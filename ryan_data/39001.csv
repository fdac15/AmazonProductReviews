"I bought these cards (along with First Animals) when my baby was about 8 months old. At that time, she liked looking at the pictures, touching the cards (some are fuzzy, soft, shiny, etc) and flipping them around. She quickly learned what each animal is. I was shocked to see that within days she pointed out each animal I said out loud when all the cards were spread out on the floor. The cards are thick and durable (but can still be EASILY chewed - she took a chunk out of some). They are colorful and engaging. These are the best ones yet! She now likes to put the cards back in the box and take them out one by one. Oh, and when the cards are all spread on the floor, she tends to use them as ""ice skates"" She finds it funny to slip on them, so just be careful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q5SDT5YA0H0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756615186#wasThisHelpful","R2Q5SDT5YA0H0I","A10STX704CY2IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10STX704CY2IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this for my one year old daughter to give to daddy for his birthday. He plays guitar, so I thought it would be cute that she bought him this ""guitar"". Of course, it turned out adorable....but on to the real reason why it's great. My daughter is such a Guppies fan and she loves to press all the buttons and ""strum"" this guitar. It plays music and some sound clips, but the best is the Bubble Guppies theme music. A few seconds of it has my daughter dancing each time. I could only see her using this toy more and more as she gets older, so I think it was a great purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30UD95X4UFI2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009T1O7VY#wasThisHelpful","R30UD95X4UFI2X","A10STX704CY2IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10STX704CY2IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is a reason why there are so many glowing reviews. This bowl set is just PERFECT!! I WISH I FOUND IT SOONER!Seriously, it's one of my best baby purchases yet. I use it twice a day to mash up fruits. It mashes/purees stuff within seconds. You cannot get the same texture when you use a spoon and try to do it yourself.

"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 11 months old. She loves the doll. It is light enough for her to carry around while walking and soft so that if she falls with it, she won't get hurt. She loves to bite the dolls face, lol, but I think she is attempting to give it a kiss because she brings me her ""baby"" to kiss and hug too. Really great purchase and it's holding up well.

"Title: Unbound Colours of LoveAuthor: Kathryn TaylorPublisher: Bastei EntertainmentSeries: Color of Love # 1Reviewed By: Arlena DeanRating: 4Review:""Unbound Colours of Love"" by Kathryn TaylorMy Thoughts....This twenty two year old naive Grace Lawson from Chicago was delighted to go her three month internship in London at the 'Huntington Technology Ventures.' However, Grace never knew she would meet up with the owner Jonathan Huntington and to become his 'sex slave.' NO! What impressed Grace so much with this guy to want to do this? I didn't understand after Grace finds out that Jonathan did not do relationships because only wanted wild sex. Why oh why would Grace want this? To me she deserved better than that. I found this story was simply off the chart crazy to me. However, I will say that Grace walked into this with her eyes wide open. Grace knew what she was getting into because she had been told by several people to be careful of Jonathan. It seems like she wasn't happy until she went to the club with Jonathan only to find out she didn't care for this...REALLY?? No, I didn't care of Jonathan at all! Oh, well I see will have to get this next series 'Uncovered....Colours of Love #2' to see what next will come next of Grace as she seem to want to hang on to this Jonathan.Even though I didn't like many things that went on in the story I did see that this author really tells a story that will keep your attention till the end and will leave you wanting to know what will come next for these two people.This book was provided as an ARC from NetGalley for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6O1JDI226WFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYER2BI#wasThisHelpful","R6O1JDI226WFG","A3K3P9U2AB4P4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K3P9U2AB4P4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The character Nicci will really be someone to not mess with especially with ""The master plan and blueprint she had for her life which didn't include fear."" Now, why was this?

Will Detrek be able to make Nicci forget ""about her blueprint on her crystal table."" Will Nicci receive the happiness she desired in her life and turn away from all of her killing ways? Will Detrek be their for her once he knows all the badand evil things that Nicci has done in her life? And Nicci's friends...how do they play in this story? My favorite part was that dream!

"Title: UnLove MeAuthor: Dawn MartensPublisher: D. M.Series: The Angels Warriors Complete TrilogyReviewed By: Arlena DeanRating: FiveReview:""UnLove Me"" by Dawn MartensMy Thoughts...What a trilogy read 'The Angels Warriors MC' series. It was such a pleasure to get three reads all in one read. This novel was wonderfully well written. I did find that to get the complete story you will have to read it in order. Book one ...'UnKiss Me' was of Eden's and Jasper's story. Book two...'UnTouch Me,' was of Lily and Vinny's and Book three 'UnBreak Me' was of Hilary and Mason's story. I loved how these the three stories intertwined with each other. Each one of these stories deals with a secrets that had been kept and handled. 'UnLove Me' is full of suspense, lies, infidelity, revenge, sexy steamy scenes along with all the drama,[dysfunctional family drama], mystery, misunderstandings, humor, and sadness that will keep you turning the pages till the end. It will not be hard to keep up with the three stories because the author will repeat some of the scenes from a previous book 1, 2, or 3. I will say I liked that for the most part of the stories being repeated as the story in that particular part of the book will flow and intertwine very well into the rest of the story.All six of these main characters were quite some individuals with some being wilder and even living some real crazy lives but considering that this is a motorcycle group story, I guess that would be expected. Along with the characters being well developed, portrayed and somewhat believable the reader will get ones one intriguing story after it all said and done. Now, I will say be ready for a read that is 'brutally violent, abusive, emotional and downright hard to read at times,' but if you can get passed all of that and continue on to the very end of this story, one will find you have one heck of a good trilogy that I would recommend to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MGIRJLPPUTPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508674728#wasThisHelpful","R2MGIRJLPPUTPD","A3K3P9U2AB4P4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K3P9U2AB4P4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Now, that the Duchess Adele husband has died will she be able to except what Valdrik had to offers her? I found the characters very well developed, colorful and oh so believable helping to make the read definitely a quick descriptive, colorful page turner.

Now what do I mean by that?...Just pick up this read ""Facing Our Future' and you will see how well this novel is laid out for our 'Black Men in the Twenty-First Century.'  The read starts with a foreword by Chance W. Lewis, A note to our Readers and Introduction. Then the reader is given a Part 1 [Man Your Facturing Men, It's Called MENtoring For A Reason & The Man Of The House]...Part II [What If I Can't Dribble, Dunk, Run Or Rap?

All I can say after all is said and done...you must read this novel for yourself to see how well these authors put it out there for the 'Black Man.' I found this read full of some good advice.Will we be able to build strong black men in our generation?  Will their be older and wiser  people out there to be able to help, mold and shape us into what is needed for the black man today?  One thing for certain...we need to push forward.  And from this read the reader will get all of that and more.I  love this quote I read from the epilogue...""...It is our aim to help them to help them to be the imitable leaders, husbands, fathers and mentors that they are designed to be....The young black males of today are our future and they are worth the effort that it will take...We must not stand back and complain about the plight of black males when we can use the same energy to create positive change.  It is only when we take personal ownership of the problems facing the black male community that we can begin to see  statistics reversed and mindsets changed.  In order for the black lives to matter to others, they must first matter to us!""There is so much more in this read that is so very good to read. Would I recommend ""Facing Our Future: Building Strong Black Men in the Twenty-First Century, by:  Jeremiah Hopes & Zack Reynolds, Jr.?""  YES,YES and YES!  This is a wonderful good novel for all 'Strong Black Men' to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15OLV0FGBNC1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0986140503#wasThisHelpful","R15OLV0FGBNC1M","A3K3P9U2AB4P4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K3P9U2AB4P4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

'Where Would I Be' entails a little bit of it all from 'love, manipulation, possessiveness, triumph, loss, drama, depression, strength, family, friends and to redemption.' This story will put one on quite a horrible emotional ride of a survivor's life of domestic abuse. Who will survive? This author really does a good job with relating this story to her readers being once herself caught up not once but twice in domestic violence where it touches parents and even children too. Many questions will be identified and answered in this read that will be a great help with anyone going through domestic abuse or one knowing someone who has been a victim .... such as 'Is there life after domestic violence?' How will this love story work its way out? Will this James Harris change for he good or what? This is where I say you will have to pick up this good read to see for yourself how well this author brings it all out to the reader. Will this heroine be able to to love again? I loved how this author brings out Lisa's strengths. This was a very touching story that as you read one can quickly be caught up in the emotions of it all where it will feel so real.

"Title: UnbalancedAuthor: Laura T.JohnsonPublisher: L.A.B. PublishingReviewed By: Arlena DeanRating: FiveReview:""Unbalanced"" by Laura T. JohnsonMy Thoughts....This was a very interesting as well as a compelling story about Catherine Palmer and Dorian Wallace.I was able to hang on every word as I read through this subplot about this story. From the read I found myself thinking this happens a lot to us...sisters...wanted love and what had already happened in Catherine's life with her parents and grandmother gone from her...she wanted someone to love her unconditionally. It looks like Catherine as it all but.... Then Catherine meets the the 'campus heartthrob, Dorian Wallace.' Will sparks fly for these two? Well, it seems so but was it really? What was up with Dorian's 'domineering behavior? Couldn't Catherine as well as others see through it all? What will happen when Catherine faces the abuse that is right in front of her as she faces this 'Unbalanced' love? This is where I say you will have to pick up this novel to see how this author presents it to the reader. This author really digs deep in telling the reader this story because she has been faced with so much of it through being abused herself.There can only be one message here and what I learned from this good read was that when one shows 'jealousy, possessiveness, controlling and a violent side' this can only lead one to a road of disaster. There are only two roads one can take ....one way in or one way out","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B1X9DW2S232R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UU2VWWS#wasThisHelpful","R1B1X9DW2S232R","A3K3P9U2AB4P4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K3P9U2AB4P4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You will get her true feeling about it all and how God was there for her through it all. Ms. Jackson's wrote this because she 'wants this story not only for her healing but for all families who have struggled through a similar experience.'What I enjoyed about this story was during the read there was a certain phrase [as well as the title] that was delivered that really opened it up for me and that was ""God's Grace Is Sufficient"" and He really is!Thank you to this author for a gift of her novel for a honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OQRVI46CBO4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IR6M98U#wasThisHelpful","R3OQRVI46CBO4X","A3K3P9U2AB4P4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K3P9U2AB4P4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I loved how this author was able to share her story with us as she starts 'using the tools that had been given to her from God.'

As the reader reads through this novel we learn about just what consecration and fasting really means. How does all of this work? Well, just sit back an read about Jackie Dotson's Journey to Praise as she explains it all as she tells her story backed up with scriptures on this beautiful road as Ms. Dotson 'lays out many of God's tools needed in order to receive the blessing He has for you'. We will continue on this 'Journey after the 21st Day Fast.' This was beautifully delivered and then it's our turn where we get 'Your Journey to Praise' where we are 'to use the tools that God has given us.' I loved how this author gives us each step...starting with 'The Fruits of the Spirit' on to the ending which was to 'Be Hold in the Lord,' At the end of the read we are presented a 21 day Journal with each step followed with the scriptures of praises to follow which were inspired by biblical numbers for each day.' And the last section we will be presented the 'Journey Continues which was a *Special Bonus.* Wow, this is a rich read that only will not be fully understood until you pick up this excellent read of ""Journey to Praise"" to see for yourself how well this message is brought out by this author.

"Title: A Cowboy Firefighter for ChristmasAuthor: Kim RedfordPublisher: Soucebooks CasablancaSeries: Smokin' Hot Cowboy # 1Reviewed By: Arlena DeanRating: FourReview:""A Cowboy Firefighter for Christmas"" by Kim Redford....What I liked about this novel..This novel was about Misty [an investigator] and Trey's[rancher and local firefighter] story of a small town romance with a 'western twist.' Both of these two people were not looking forward to the Christmas holiday that was coming upon them in the small town of Wildcat Bluff, Texas. I liked how this author brought these two together as they are drawn to each other putting out a small grass fire. I found this storyline somewhat suspenseful in that the read will hold your attention and will keep you guessing who is guilty of setting these fires until the very end. By working together will these two be able to find out just who is behind these fires? I loved how the story will all come together for Misty and Trey. Would I recommend this novel?

Now to make this story complete  I will have to add Elle's son Toby because he really makes this story so cute.

Now Elle has a opened up a business and is doing OK with he son...meets George and will a friendship will come from it?

"Title:  Secrets at Maple Syrup FarmAuthor:  Rebecca RaisinPublisher:  Carina UKReviewed By:  Arlena DeanRating: FiveReview:""Secrets at Maple Syrup Farm"" by Rebecca RaisinWhat I liked about this novel....This was another one of this author's great novels that I did enjoy reading.  It was so interesting to know that Lucy's mum who was suffering from a long term illness wanted her daughter...  something special for her daughter.  So, we find Lucy on an adventure for a year...ending up in Ashford, Connecticut where her life would be changed forever.  Why was that?  Lucky was there to live her life to the fullest for one year not  worrying of her sick mum. It was there in Ashford that she meets some wonderful people....even that moody Clay who she persuaded  to give her a job as a 'farmers assistant' on the Maple syrup farm in which he had inherited.  I loved how this author was able to bring the readers back to Ashford, Connecticut which was the home of the famous 'Gingerbread Cafe' that if you are a reader of this author novels you will know all about that cafe... meeting up with many old friends..like CeeCee, and Lil to name a few.Yes, ""Secrets at Maple Syrup Farm'  is of many secrets that will be dealt with in this read, however, .  I was happy to say I was able to guess a few of them early in this well written read.  The storyline will keep you turning the pages till the end because you will not want to miss anything. The heroine in the read really loves her mum and wanted to obey her but for me I found it so hard to do what Lucy had done...and that was obeying her mum wishes.  The hero, Clay...well I was able to catch what may have been his secret from what this author presented this story... still it was a good read in how this author presented it all to the reader.  I don't want to give too much away other than to say pick up ""Secrets of Maple Syrup Farm"" and see how well this story is brought out.  Questions will be answered...Will Lucy decide on the trip to Paris...for a career as an artist or stay in Ashford?  Will their be something for Lucky in Ashford besides wanting to be that artist?What else I liked about this novel...There was definitely a learning process of how maple syrup is made that this author covers so well in the read and I don't want to leave out all of those good baking descriptions that the ladies of the Gingerbread Cafe turned out as well in the foods you can use with maple syrup.  I will say there were a few recipes that were new to me to what you could use maple syrup in!I will say that it will be interesting to see what more may come of Lucy, Clay and her mum that only this author can do so very well especially in the small town of Ashford....what a great place to live.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39LGFJHXTJEY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQD8HNY#wasThisHelpful","R39LGFJHXTJEY4","A3K3P9U2AB4P4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K3P9U2AB4P4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Truly life for Ali had been 'turned upside down.'  Now she was in Napa looking after her father due to falling and injuring his arm who now lived in a retirement community.

It was in Napa where  Ali opens up to new friendships and trying to decide what would be best for her life now that she is alone and feeling very angry.  What will happen after Ali meets a cantankerous old women named Edie who lad lost her husband in W W II?  I liked how this author was able was able to let one see that there are some many pains and losses in our world. This history was indeed interesting!  From meeting Edie why would a journey to Berlin give Ali answers about not only Edie but herself also?  Who would have known that both of these women had endured tremendous emotional pain.  In the end  would there be a way for Ali to heal and yet not forget?  I liked how this author was able to show through another person story how Ali will be able to find the courage she needed to want to live again.  I found the characters were beautiful written being so well developed, defined, some humor and so believable giving this story such a heart wrenching detailed story that I wasn't able to put down until the end...often finding myself tearing up at parts of the read.  Be ready for a good story of personal growth and self discover....also there is a backstory from a Edie's diary...but I don't want to spoil it for you...only to say you will have to pick up the good read to see for yourself what that is about.""It's You"" was a  well written story by this author that told two stories of two women of different generations that showed raw powerful emotions.  For Ali.... love and loss, recovered from heart break and healing  to being able to  pick up the broken pieces of the heart and the strength to make some new choices and hope again. I will go farther in saying that this is one novel that will stay with you long after you have read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11EQLQNDK00NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQSF63I#wasThisHelpful","R11EQLQNDK00NC","A3K3P9U2AB4P4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K3P9U2AB4P4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Along with this there seems to be some mysteries that will come up front and center as Juliette's  mother will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and is not doing well with her treatments and then there is a long distance romance.  I felt the story started up a little slow but it does pick up and the reader will be presented a good read by this author that is told is first person narrative by Juliette. I wish I had read the first novel...'Table by the Window' first because I did have a little problem understanding some of the story and some of its characters.  However,  as I continued to read on  I did find this read somewhat captivating that did keep my attention till the end.  This was quite a interesting read where one could see this family pulling together, the inclusion of  history of written old letters between Juliette's grandmother, Mirielle and her sister that dealt with love from WWII France. Be ready because the reader will also get some surprises, happiness, sadness, drama, humanity, hope, illness, family relationship issues,long distance love,  traveling, suspense, mystery of family secrets, some new romance and even some heartbreak of a break up romance.  Then what puts the icing on the cake of this novel  .... the reader gets some very good recipes that you will be left wishing you could be there...tasting it all. I liked how this author was able to weave these unique recipes[especially those chocolate chip cookies] into the plot of this story...very well done. If you are interesting in recipes, food and cooking ... you will love this novel.  Also I enjoyed the quotes that began each chapter that dealt with food or cooking. If you are interesting in Now, in saying all of that I will say it would be best to read the first series, then this one and then the reader will be more than ready for the conclusion of the 'Two Blue Doors'series..'A Table By The Window' to get the rest of this intriguing story by this author.I received a copy through NOR  in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L3M544AYEHPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PBHBC#wasThisHelpful","R3L3M544AYEHPJ","A3K3P9U2AB4P4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K3P9U2AB4P4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title:  Sex Becomes HerAuthor:  Regina ColePublishser:  KensingtonSeries:  Sexy # 1Reviewed By:  Arlena DeanRating: FourReview:""Sex Becomes Her"" by Regina Cole....I found this novel had a very intriguing erotic story...giving the reader a little bit of it all from  Eliza finding true love, forgetting about what had happened in the past with that horrible  relationship, and in the end finding someone ...doing what she  wanted  do when it came to exploring her identity of sex.Eliza was living in a small mid western town,  a chemist when rumors are spreaded about her reputation from her ex boyfriend..Tyler[broadcasting her fantasies and secrets desires] and definitely a prick. Then Eliza meets Chandler who was a divorced ..meeting  by bumping into each other at the airport and then finding themselves at the same wedding in Hawaii.  From here this story really picks up  when these two meet and explore the fun with their chemistry being off the chart.  But why will Eliza keep feeling like she was 'damaged' when all she wants is happiness. I liked how this author tells this story from both Eliza's and Chandler's POV.  Be ready for plenty of drama as well as twist and turns, and even some other issues to be maybe  divulged that will keep you turning the pages in this read. Will these two people go their separate ways or will they get their HEA? And what was this secret Eliza was holding on to through most of the story?  I did also enjoy that Chandler was ....well I don't want to spoil it for you...so you must pick up this well written story to find out.The author really gives the reader some interesting characters, however, there were some some secondary characters that I wasn't to sure about seeming a little off a little ..like Gregory, Sabrina and Stacey but you will just have to pick up this read to see for yourself what you may think of them..  In the end this author will give you one a story that will be the an example of a women's sexual liberation in an adult relationship that will be a held up due to 'respect, understanding and open communication' giving Eliza the self confidence to believe she had value.  I did notice that this author left the reader wondering just what would 'Sex # 2 be about?

"Title:  How To Marry a Royal HighlanderAuthor:  Vanessa KellyPublisher:  ZebraSeries:  The Renegade Royals # 4Reviewed By:  Arlena DeanRating: FiveReview:""How To Marry a Royal Highlander"" by Vanessa KellyWhat I liked about this novel..I loved this historical romance story of Alec[Alasdair Gilbride] and Edie[Eden Whitney].  I will say I laughed so hard at some of the bantering that went on in this novel with Alec and Edie but also especially that of Edie's mom.  I was able to catch some of Edie's feeling for Alec quite early in the read, but was quite surprise at a lots of the twist, turns and drama in this read that was so very interestingly presented by this author. The characters were all off the chart well done...being well developed, defined, portrayed, engaging and so very believable. I also liked the way this author was able to give the reader one hot steamy highlander romance story as the heroine and hero are brought together in their lively interaction throughout the read.  Who knew that a horrible kiss and being snubbed by the ton would cause such a uproar that would force Edie to have to leave London for the Highlands. And that there would be plans by Edie's mom to start some  match making for Edie.  I found this read  not only fascinating and entertaining with a good depth, a great plot but also a well paced read that will definitely keep your attention all the way till the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B7KPGJDAIH96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTR5ZC#wasThisHelpful","R3B7KPGJDAIH96","A3K3P9U2AB4P4R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K3P9U2AB4P4R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Title:  Hot Summer NightsAuthor:  Lisa Marie PerryPublisher:  Harlequin KimaniSeries:  California Deserts DreamsReviewed By:  Arlena DeanRating:  FiveReview:""Hot Summer Nights"" by Lisa Marie PerryWhat I liked about this novel...Wow, what a well written story that this author gives the readers. I found this story was somewhat predictable however there will be some twist and turns that will really will  have the reader do on the edge of your seat wondering what is coming next.  I found ""Hot Summer Nights"" a contemporary romance about [Gabrielle]Gabby and Geoffrey.  I loved how this author brings these two people together..with Geoffrey thinking Gabby was a waitress instead of an executive chef of this resort. Now why was that?  With Gabby trying to do it all  but will she be ready for what Geoffrey wants to offer her?  What was it about Gabby that Geoffrey was so intrigued with?  Will she be able to handle these feelings that she has for Geoffrey or will she keep herself in the shell that she seems to have been in for quite a while? I found the characters in this read were for the most part well developed, defined and believable giving the reader a interesting read.  Truly friends like Gabby has with Robyn, and Kimberly really added to this wonderful story and I will not forget the some of the staff employees.  I will say I didn't care for Gabby's family at all and that is all I have to say about that!By the time I got to the ending  of this read I was however left wondering is there more to come of this story especially after the strange phone call that was received?

You talk about mean spirited classmates that seemed to have it out for on Ona.  I love how this story was presented..with a ""reunion trip turning out to be an erotic-theme cruise"" for these classmates.  Now how did this happen?  However, I loved how Ona was able to some much needed help from that 'blond-haired, silver-eyed Riker Evan.

"A man with Aspergers decides he needs a wife, and sets about securing one with scientific finesse - creating a detailed questionnaire to eliminate any unsuitable candidates.  He gets side-tracked from the Wife Project by the Father Project - a quest to discover the biological father of Rosie, a girl who had unwittingly filled out his survey.The story structure had a good rhythm and the hero is quirkily unpredictable yet with breathtaking single-minded logic.  I suspect the novel was written with a screen play in mind, as I think it could easily be transferred onto the screen with few changes to the story; plus there were a few iconic visual scenes that are ready to go.Highly recommended if you have a friend or significant other who favours logic over emotion - Big Bang Theory fans will enjoy seeing a Sheldon-like character actively seeking romance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LZKYD3R5JE57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009VIZDLI#wasThisHelpful","R1LZKYD3R5JE57","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though I knew all the tragic facts of the Father's Day murder of three small boys, I was not prepared for this heartwrenching insight into how the tragedy destroyed so many people. Before the tragedy, Cindy Gambino was a bright, energetic and bubbly woman who thrived on domestic order and motherhood; throughout her relationship with Robert Farquarson, she had been exasperated by his lack of involvement with their babies and his lack of initiative in contributing to the household in other ways.  Eventually she ended the relationship, but was careful to support his relationship with their three sons.The death of her sons completely destroyed her in a way I could not comprehend through media coverage of her facing the endless trials and anniversaries with her new partner and their two subsequent children. This book chronicles Cindy's destructive dependence on pain killers and anti-depressants simply to face the day, and how she lost her complete sense of self.  Somehow she managed to hold on to her fledgling romance with Stephen, although the book paints the painful contrast between their life as a grieving couple and what could have been if they hadn't both been shattered by this tragedy.Every time Cindy seems to find new strength and purpose, she is knocked down again by her own grief and the slow-moving legal process.  While she started out devoutly believing her husband's innocence, the truth gradually dawns upon her that he killed their children to destroy her. With every page, I just want to tell her not to let him win.  In the background, we see the peripheral victims of the tragedy - Stephen and his children who also lost three children when the boys were murdered; the heartbroken school community who create a memorial garden for Jai, Tyler and Bailey; and the friends and family who can't resist taking sides in a long-past divorce battle, making their judgement about who was to blame for the failure of Cindy and Robert's marriage.Robert himself is a shadowy figure who lurks in the background with no good answers for his actions before or after the tragedy.  His revenge is diabolical - he not only killed their three children, he destroyed Cindy so she could feel no love or joy in her new life without him. Just as he had never helped much with their home or children, Cindy was unable to contribute much to her new home - she no longer cooked or bothered with housework, and she struggled to nurture her two boys with Stephen. It seemed to me that Robert's revenge was to turn Cindy into a version of himself, and I hope she can fight back to preserve her new family and find peace with the future and her own identity as a grieving mother with two living children and stepchildren who need her.This is a heart-wrenching book that clearly outlines the physical and emotional toll of grief beyond the initial tragedy.  It also gives a good account of the court case and the evidence that convicted Robert, and kept him in jail despite various appeals. Hopefully now, his victims will find some measure of peace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IYUMN52OHK7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPDGP4C#wasThisHelpful","R3IYUMN52OHK7D","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Life on Scribbly Gum Island is a mixture of serendipity, tradition and mystery, starting with the famous and lucrative Munro Baby Mystery - what happened to Alice and Jack Munro, who disappeared from the small island leaving a newborn baby girl?  Connie and Rose, the two young girls living on the island with their father, had found the baby and alerted authorities to the mystery - now elderly women, they have made Scribbly Gum Island into a lucrative and appealing tourist attraction, with the star of the show Baby Enigma, the abandoned little girl that they raised, and who is now a grandmother herself. Every year, they celebrate the Anniversary of Alice and Jack's disappearance with an island festival.When Connie dies, she leaves her house to a relative stranger, triggering a reassessment of the Munro Baby Mystery amongst the family. What really happened to Alice and Jack Munro?  How has their disappearance - murder? abandonment of their baby? - become the catalyst for an annual celebration?Different family members have their own interpretation of the mystery. Enigma's granddaughter Grace is a unique and important character as she gives an unsettling insight into post-natal depression - she understands why Alice might have simply walked away from her baby. Enigma herself glories in the celebration being all about her.  As an elderly woman, she confides that as a child she'd been afraid her real parents would show up and she wouldn't be special any more.When the truth is finally revealed, it is both surprising and logical, and immensely satisfying. And the reader knows that while this family has focused on the mystery of Alice and Jack, they've missed a few shocking incidents in their own family history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R356GYRWKNL4S9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003R509VK#wasThisHelpful","R356GYRWKNL4S9","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this latest chapter in the Tudor saga, glorious King Henry has receded into a bloated tyrannical child-king, fretfully trying to make sense of his marital history while his latest wife acts as his nurse. The story is narrated by Kateryn Parr, who sets aside her own hopes for marriage with her lover, to become Henry's last queen.  While Gregory can only speculate about the thoughts and motives of these colourful historical characters, she does it superbly within a carefully researched historical context.Kateryn is haunted by her predecessors and tries to avoid their fatal ""mistakes"" yet she also finds that a living queen cannot compete with the dead Jane Seymour, mother to Henry's only living son. She even finds it difficult to deal with Anne of Cleves, who had graciously side-stepped marriage with the King, and was now a favoured member of court.  In a double irony that Tudor lovers will appreciate, while Henry's previous wives were obsessed with delivering a healthy male heir, Kateryn is portrayed as terrified of becoming pregnant to Henry, because another failed pregnancy would humiliate the King, endangering her life.While Kateryn navigates these challenges and becomes a loyal loving step-mother to Henry's three motherless children, she also makes her own significant contribution to the era, translating religious passages into English.  Gregory's examination of the changing church and attitudes to education, particularly for women, is extremely illuminating.  Kateryn also takes the role of Regent when Henry is away at war, competently managing the country in his absence - a formidable task for a young woman who has only previously run a small estate.  There are also interesting glimpses of the man Henry could have been if he hadn't been gluttonous for power and for food - a man who respected higher education for women as well as men; a man who was prepared to make changes to the Church.Kateryn's secret love story runs as a recurring thread throughout the book, the lost passion between the lovers creating a dramatic contrast to the sordid sickly business of intimacy with King Henry.  This is an excellent finale to the saga of Henry's wives and I'm glad to learn more about Kateryn's achievements as a writer and a Queen. Overall, the book conveys the frighteningly precarious nature of life with despotic and fickle Henry - when a dearly beloved wife or friend can be banished or destroyed at any moment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FHUVVNP52FGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDXSE5C#wasThisHelpful","R1FHUVVNP52FGX","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love any slice of Mitford, and this book is no exception.  Jessica ""Decca"" Mitford writes a commendable companion piece to her sister's fictional stories about the legendary family.  Here you learn the inside story of ""Jassy"" who saved up her running away money from the time she was a little girl and then suddenly took off one day to America, leaving her aristocratic family reeling.  The extraordinary thing about the Mitford family is how closely truth and fiction run together.  Just like Jassy in Nancy's stories, Decca did revolt against the perceived meaningless boredom of secluded privileged family life until she abruptly eloped to France with her cousin Esmond (a young cousin of Winston Churchill).  Life was certainly no longer boring - the young couple swung between poverty and parties with their well-to-do friends, coming up with many get-rich-quick schemes along the way, some clever, some downright dishonest. After a family tragedy and with war looming, they moved from London to America where they continued seeking their fortune.This is a great story in its own right, but when you balance this book against other books by the Mitfords and about them, you will pick up a few undercurrents.  Like most teenagers, Decca's view of her family was fairly jaded and distorted, but even as a mother of adult children (when she wrote this book) she did not balance her unfair appraisal of her mother or her upbringing.  Older sister Nancy pointed out that Decca seemed to have researched her childhood using Nancy's fictional novels, and in a few cases presents Nancy's ridiculous stories as fact, while failing to work with any original content of her own. While Decca presents her parents as rigidly incapable of respecting any other viewpoint, she has the same failing - she never acknowledges how hurtful or frightening her actions were, and she cannot explain the inconsistency of her hatred of her sister Diana (a Hitler supporter) with her passionate love for her sister Unity (a Hitler fanatic).  To be fair, it would be difficult for any Mitford to negotiate all the passionate political allegiances of any member of the family.  And while Decca rages against her family's impassive attitude to war (based on her observations in the mid-thirties, written decades later) she fails to acknowledge that while she skipped off to America, Nancy worked to help Spanish refugees and their mother took Jewish refugees into the family home while nursing Unity who was permanently incapacitated after a failed suicide attempt.In a family of eccentric and funny people, during a time of polarising political beliefs and social change, Decca comes across as the family member who is always pushing for an argument and always needing to be in the right.  One unintentionally funny anecdote is her unswerving admiration for her husband Esmond who wrote letters from America to cousin Winston (Churchill) advising him about war policy. Decca says she doesn't know if Winston read the letters, but it showed how intelligent and insightful Esmond was.  Yet neither of them showed much intelligence and insight when they caused an international incident by eloping to Europe during the Spanish Civil War while Decca was still a minor. Despite her criticism of her family, she did continue to live by the upper class creed that ""If I don't like something, I will insist you change it"" which served her well as the pioneer of muck-raking journalism and helped her make a difference amongst her poverty stricken neighbours who didn't have that kind of self-assurance... but wasn't so congenial on the family front.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8TOGQ71YWP4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590171101#wasThisHelpful","R8TOGQ71YWP4T","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read Anne Frank's diary as a teenager, I could relate to her as a person and I could understand the tragedy of her death, but I could not comprehend the horror and fear of the situation forced upon her family.  This book really brought home the cruel terror of forcing people into hiding simply because they were born into a certain religion.  I could also see for the first time, through Miep's eyes, how precarious the hiding place was - while the Franks and their friends hid upstairs, people worked downstairs during the day and any sudden unexpected noise would have attracted attention.Miep fills in a few blanks in the pages of Anne's diary - she tells of the day she was working at her desk and looked up to see the German officers storming upstairs, and then the hideaways being marched down again, blinking and shuffling on their way to the concentration camp.  She records how she found Anne's diary in the chaos, and hid it in her drawer, knowing she was implicating herself in the ""crime"" of hiding the Franks. Anne's father came home and resumed his place in the business, but when they finally understood that his wife and girls were not returning, Miep gave him Anne's diary.Miep describes herself as an ordinary woman living in extraordinary times, but she must have had an extraordinary level of courage, nerve and moral fibre to show such commitment and loyalty in the face of danger. Just as Anne's diary inspires us to be courageous and creative in the face of difficulties, Miep's story inspires us to have the courage of our convictions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RINO8NJ2ZNX7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADMZZ2S#wasThisHelpful","RINO8NJ2ZNX7O","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love James Herriot's writing style and also his tenacity as he looks after the creatures great and small in the little Yorkshire town of Darrowby.  His character sketches are hilarious but never cruel and within the humour, you can see how much love and caring he has for animals. While he puts a humorous gloss on life - and the breathtaking scenery and delicious food are beautifully depicted and easy to envy - it's clear that life is tough in the 1930s.  Even disregarding the war looming in the background, a simple car journey is hazardous without windscreen wipers and negotiating a rough winding road punctuated by vicious wire bound gates.  And nobody could envy the three am cow midwifery!My only criticism of the omnibus version is that some stories are missing, so the story arc of James and Helens' courtship is fairly rushed compared to the single book versions.

"In this thinly veiled autobiographical novel, Nora Ephron's counterpart Rachel Samstat has a passion for cooking, so recipes punctuate the storyline - she describes the recipes for her sadness, her joy, sharing - and as an aside, discusses the various merits of which fruit pie to make if you're only going to throw it at your husband anyway.In between cooking up a storm, Rachel's story is witty, heartbreaking and poignant.  With their marriage in ruins, she gives birth to their second child and for a little while the parents are united together... but only as parents, not as husband and wife. Her caustic one-liners are beautifully balanced and memorable - if you read carefully, you will pick up a few lines that made it into the When Harry Met Sally screenplay.The movie starring Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson does not match up to the book - from what I remember, Meryl blamed Jack for this, but I just don't think the movie script meets the bitingly witty standard of the original book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LYANMB45VB1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008VSN4HE#wasThisHelpful","R3LYANMB45VB1H","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Poor Adrian - he can't take a trick.  His skin is bad, his parents have complicated romantic lives, the family is short of money, he's bullied at school and he is in love with Pandora Braithwaite - but worst of all he is an unrecognized intellectual with craving to write poetry, and a panoramic knowledge of the Norwegian leather industry. The BBC won't publish his poems (but at least they are immortalized in the published pages of his diary) and nobody wants to hear his discourse on the Norwegian leather industry.While the books are very, very funny, I can't help feeling sad for Adrian as well - his pompous diary entries demonstrate how much he wants someone to appreciate his talents and individuality, but his parents are heartlessly pursuing their own lives and don't have time to give him the attention he needs. He is a classic teenager, indignant that nobody will appreciate him, and incapable of analysis or self-criticism - it is the type of book that reads differently at different stages of your life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WH7V0H1Q4D2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YUC1IW#wasThisHelpful","R2WH7V0H1Q4D2K","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Margaret ""Peggy"" Mitchell created the iconic Scarlett O'Hara and recreated the world of the Confederate South - but who was the woman behind the sweeping passionate saga? The Road to Tara shows how Mitchell was shaped by her childhood in Atlanta, Georgia, hearing bitter passionate stories of the Civil War (which ended in defeat decades before she was born) and also by her fiercely feminist mother, who taught Peggy that when the world falls apart all you have to rebuild is whatever is in your head, and whatever is in your hands.  While Peggy always felt she failed to live up to her mother's expectations, she certainly did shape her destiny through the stories in her head, and the ability to craft these stories into a unique and compelling novel. This book shows how Mitchell's life was the inspiration for Scarlett's fierce single minded scramble for security, despite the pull of nostalgia - certainly Mitchell's mother would have approved of how Scarlett rebuilt her world using her head and her hands.  Ironically, Edwards points out that unlike her heroine, Mitchell could not cope when her own world seemingly fell apart, when she was overwhelmed by the fame and attention triggered by the publication of Gone with the Wind.Edwards also reveals the men behind the fictional counterparts, Ashley Wilkes and Rhett Butler.  While the inspiration for Ashley remains a shadowy, brief cherished romance in Mitchell's life, the man who inspired Rhett Butler will be an unhappy shock for dedicated GWTW fans. Mitchell's first marriage was violent and unhappy, due in part to her husband's alcoholism, and there are several disturbing parallels in the romance of Scarlett and Rhett.This is a ""must read"" for any Gone with the Wind fan - you will love reading the samples from Mitchell's journalism days, and you will be fascinated by the glimpses into her childhood where she sat on the knees of elderly Confederate soldiers who were only young boys when they marched away to war.  You will see how Scarlett's fierce independence was a response to Mitchell's sense of inadequacy, and you will have a greater insight into Scarlett's attitudes to flirtation and sex.Best of all, you will ""witness"" the writing of Gone with the Wind - how it started as a hobby, then became an all-consuming obsession, only to be abandoned whenever the author had a fit of panic about her ability to write.  In today's world of laptops and digital copies, you will wonder how Mitchell ever managed to compile a highly detailed book with dozens of characters and spanning 12 years, by stuffing chapters into different manilla envelopes.  You will read of the magical moment (any author's fantasy) when a publisher came knocking on Mitchell's door looking for manuscript, and found himself with a suitcase full of manilla folders containing a future bestseller. And he was hooked by the very first page.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259YXW3NQ88KW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LXVG5KO#wasThisHelpful","R259YXW3NQ88KW","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every day, Joe's mother goes to wake him up, only to find... a lion or a pig or some other creature in Joe's bed. By Sunday, [spoiler alert!] she finds Joe himself in bed, and they have a lovely day together.This book has been a favourite with all four of my children - it is a great one to read and re-read from the age of 2 to 6, as you can see your children develop an understanding of their own imagination.  A 2 year old will wonder where Joe goes every day when the lion/ mouse/ monster/ king etc tries to fit into the daily routine, while a 6 year old will know that Joe is pretending to be these wild and independent creatures.Joe on Sunday is a simple read-aloud story, with a great rhythm and vocabulary, so you will enjoy reading it to your child, who will soon pick up on the pattern of the story and maybe even learn the days of the week.  The bright, humorous illustrations complement the story beautifully.This book is not easy to find now, so I recommend snapping it up while you can and making it a permanent fixture on your bookshelf.  After years of reading it to my own children, I love introducing other kids to Joe, so I can see whether they think Joe ""goes away"" or if he is just pretending.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CTLLBI5YOHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803704461#wasThisHelpful","R1CTLLBI5YOHP","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love reading historical fiction and biographies based on the Tudor era, and I've often been curious about the mysterious disease ""sweating sickness"" that struck such fear during this period.  Claire Ridgway explains the symptoms and treatment of sweating sickness, which is extremely interesting from a modern perspective - whatever it was, it clearly caused dangerous dehydration, and the Tudors didn't have many treatments for that. For best results, stay completely still for 24 hours, under light covering and taking sips of warm drink.  Whatever you do, don't fall asleep. There are some herbs and specific beverages recommended in the text, if you are interested in purchasing the book.Ridgway also looks at possible triggers for sweating sickness, although most of the theories can only be speculation as the disease disappeared as mysteriously as it appeared.  The book is an extremely short read, but it is crammed with well-referenced information from primary sources such as Tudor written records and modern scientists. An excellent addition to your Tudor library!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCWN527J8ZIOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4VWI70#wasThisHelpful","RCWN527J8ZIOP","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was curious to read this because I have looked at Natalie's blog intermittently, and she seemed to switch between sponsoring products to worrying that she can't write what she likes because of her sponsors - so I wanted to read what she had to say when she was free to express herself without a sponsorship deal.  Hmmm.First of all, this book is a very poor endorsement for her publisher who clearly did not bother to hire a proofreader to untangle all the convoluted passive sentences and spelling errors - even of brand names!  I'm also a little dubious about her decorating advice as demonstrated by the pictures of her home, which is overflowing with oddments and objects.  Natalie's signature style advice is: ""When in doubt hang some antlers on it"" and she is true to her word as you can see by the morose corpses in the background of each image.  ""... the kind of decorating decision that separates the men from the silk flowers. I ve brought so many dead animals into our home ... we have become a sort of halfway house for forgotten bulls eyes.""With a shudder at the poor creature hanging on the wall, I flipped over to to the next tip, which seemed more my taste: Doilies.  Natalie states that ""a paper doily is the difference between chocolate chip cookies for the neighbors on a flimsy paper plate and chocolate chip cookies for the neighbors on a pretty, flimsy paper plate.""  Isn't this a lifestyle book?!  Why is she entertaining guests with paper plates?There are other mystifying chapters, such as ""On Being the Boss of Your Own Poops"" and ""What would Meg Ryan Do?"" - Now I love Meg Ryan movies and I'm sure she is an admirable person in real life but I don't really know enough about her to answer this rhetorical question, let alone use it as a life compass.  According to Natalie, Meg Ryan would tell me to take care of myself.  Regarding the poop chapter I have nothing to say. Another chapter is entitled ""On Being French"" where Natalie reveals that she is not French but she thinks she should be.  So maybe it should be called On Not Being French.On the last pages, I discovered that Natalie Jean hadn't completely freed herself from the domination of sponsors - every object featured in the book is mentioned faithfully in the ""Resource"" section, along with retailer/ supplier information.  For your convenience she has indexed these entries according to object, such as ""For my feet"" in case you want socks just like Natalie Jean.

"Faberge's eggs - intricate, opulent mementos of domestic intimacy - epitomized the last decades of the Romanov dynasty. Nobody except the Tsar of Russia could have commissioned such magnficent jewelled works of art, yet many of them were made to commemorate private celebrations and special places. When the Romanov empire crumbled and the other treasures were dispersed, even the new Communist leaders sought to preserve Faberge's eggs. Ironically the eggs emerged to symbolize the capitalist age of the 20th century, as millionaires collected them like unique trophies of wealth.This book traces the eggs from the earliest inspirations of Carl Faberge and his first Imperial commission to create an egg for Tsarina Marie, as a memory of her childhood. It follows the royal family tradition of a new egg for Marie from her husband the Tsar every Easter for the rest of his life; and how their son Nicholas continued the tradition, commissioning one egg for his wife and one for his mother each year. Faber examines how Faberge designed the eggs to reflect significant historical events in Russia as well as special memories for the Imperial family throughout Nicholas' reign - up until the last unfinished egg of 1917, that Nicholas never saw although he did receive a bill addressed to Nicholas Romanov after his abdication.The story of the eggs did not end with the fall of the Romanovs. Faber traces the fate of each egg, including what is known of those that are missing, and we see how they captivated royalty, con artists, entrepreneurs and millionaires throughout the twentieth century. There are plenty of amusing and poignant anecdotes, such as the millionaire Malcolm Forbes who was determined to ""beat"" the Kremlin's score of ten Faberge eggs. When he finally collected his 11th egg, he told reporters that his search wasn't finished because most people do buy eggs by the dozen. And after his death, his sons respected his wishes and released the eggs onto the market, so someone else could have the fun of collecting them.The book is an excellent companion piece for anyone who has been fascinated by the Romanov dynasty and its downfall... for anyone who loves reading of intricate and costly works of art... and for anyone who wants to read a simple creative history of the twentieth century from a unique perspective.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MLEM5D611MNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S49A8M#wasThisHelpful","R3MLEM5D611MNX","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this case received a great deal of media coverage, the book brought the personalities to life with empathy and detail.  Simpson does an excellent job at presenting everyone's perspective in a polarizing case.  Most importantly of all, she presents Tina Watson as a real three-dimensional person, when all we have known of her from the media is the terrifying silhouette of a prone diver at the bottom of the ocean contrasting with the glowing bridal photo of eleven days earlier.So did Gabe Watson intentionally kill his bride for insurance money - or did his negligence and inexperience contribute to her death?  Should the dive company take any responsibility?  My opinion shifted several times while I was reading this book, which describes Tina and Gabe's romance, his attitude to her family and friends, and Tina's early health problems and her relative inexperience as a diver. Whether you decide Gabe is innocent or guilty of causing Tina's death, his behavior towards her family is inexplicably cruel and inexcusable.  When all they had left was a grave to grieve over, he repeatedly removed their flowers from Tina's grave and had her body exhumed and buried elsewhere.The other puzzling issue for armchair detectives is the 16 different versions Gabe gave about what happened during the 7 minutes he and Tina spent underwater, before he emerged alone while another diver swam desperately to retrieve her from the ocean floor.  Why couldn't he give a consistent, plausible account for his actions?  Simpson starts the book with a simple yet thorough description of diver training, so readers can see that Gabe's explanations do not make sense and he did not act appropriately under the circumstances.A compelling human tragedy, and a beautiful tribute to a woman who died too soon and is still mourned by her family and friends who have too many unanswered questions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ONNDG9137NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041KLBP8#wasThisHelpful","R34ONNDG9137NC","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dedicated Tudor fans will love this biography of three background figures in Henry VIII's England - his niece Margaret Douglas (daughter of his older sister Margaret); Mary Howard, who was Anne Boleyn's cousin and married Henry's illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy; and Mary Shelton, another relative of Anne's and briefly Henry's mistress. If you have read Phillipa Gregory or other historical fiction from the period, these names will be familiar to you as shadowy background players - Soberton gives them substance and personality, so we can see their strength of character, their talents and their achievements. We can also see the hazards of being too close to the throne of a paranoid king, who saw every marriage as a threat to his dynasty.One flaw in the book was that the three stories were intertwined in each chapter, making it difficult to follow which Mary we were talking about sometimes.

"The narrator is a single man who longs to be more sexually experienced, although he struggles to forge meaningful relationships.  The solution?  He decides to infiltrate the world of swingers.  For Daniel, to be accepted into this tribe is the sexual equivalent of a commoner being accepted into the Royal Family or Jane Goodall being accepted by the chimps. His single status is a huge obstacle in his path, as of course most swingers are happily married couples who don't trust anyone who might upset the balance of harmonious partner-swapping.After a slow and heartbreaking start, the author reveals all his secrets in a unique and comprehensive etiquette guide to sexual interaction and basic courtesy. The book is an entertaining read for anyone curious about this choice of lifestyle - the etiquette guidelines would also be useful for anyone negotiating the dating scene.

"When Alice loses the last ten years of her memory, she finds herself navigating life and divorce as a highly organized mother of three, while caught in her identity as a 29-year old pregnant woman, deeply in love with her husband.  It is so easy to identify with her dilemma and readers will unconsciously be looking back a decade to contemplate how they have changed.  Alice learns the blessing and curse of memories, as she craves the forgotten moments with her children, but enjoys a more harmonious relationship with her bewildered husband who tells her that she won't like him so much when her memory returns. Alice has the luxury of examining all her relationships as an outsider, so she was apologising a great deal for things she couldn't remember.... At one point, I wondered how the ""past"" Alice could really have transformed into the ""present"" Alice but when the puzzle pieces fell into place, her character was logical and consistent. One of the most valuable points of the book was Alice's realization that every person in a relationship contributes to its success/ failure... and sometimes you all have to make peace with that to move on.This book is a great lesson in what to remember, what to forget and what to value - while the conclusion was perhaps one chapter too long, it was bitter-sweet and satisfying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY7833JR7M8AD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003R50A5K#wasThisHelpful","RY7833JR7M8AD","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very interested in reading this book after seeing it promoted on a historian's website, as I felt this was a great historical perspective to examine.  Even in my history class at school (in the 80s!) our teacher talked about how childbirth and lack of contraception affected the role of women in society and we looked at Henry VIII's wives and daughters from that perspective. So this book seemed like an anachronism to me, and I was disappointed that the author's argument was undermined by historical inaccuracies and wildly personal opinions.  For example, she questions why we don't condemn Mary 1 of England after her treatment of the ""rightful"" Queen of England, Lady Jane Grey.  For one thing, I've heard Mary condemned on many grounds (such as her religious persecution) but I've never heard a serious historian claim that Lady Jane Grey was the rightful Queen of England.  I'm sure someone could make up a strong argument for this premise, but the author did not bother - she simply stated that Mary executed the rightful queen of England, and for some confusing reason, this was tied into the slut-shaming argument.While the author condemns historians for judging women of history for their sex lives, I was puzzled to pick up a consistent implication that sex is generally a power play.  For example, she talks about Cleopatra meeting Caesar for the first time, saying that Caesar was a ""world weary and promiscuous 52 year old Roman who had seen it all and slept with most of it. Cleopatra was a 21 year old exiled ruler who was probably still a virgin.  She wouldn't have known how to seduce a man like Caesar even if she had been willing to try.""  The phrase ""seen it all and slept with most of it' is about as sexist and demeaning as you can get, but I was also amused at the assurance that a promiscuous 52 year old and virginal 21 year old, who both happened to be strong assertive leaders wouldn't have been attracted to each other, and the young girl wouldn't have known how to act upon it even if she had found him attractive.  Did the author consider that these were two like-minded people who were actually attracted to each other and acted upon it? I also don't understand Kramer's one-sided debate about Cleopatra being promoted only as the bad girl/ good girl when she quotes enough historians to support the argument that she was a strong and effective ruler in her own right. Another bizarre claim was that before Anne Boleyn was married, she was a victim of the ""slut if she said yes, and a bitch if she said no"" attitude.  Anne's romantic affairs up to and including Henry VIII are fairly well documented, and I've seen no evidence to support Kramer's claim that she had problems negotiating sexual terms before her marriage.  When she managed to snare the king, she was certainly called a whore and accused of witchcraft and other powers to ""catch"" him, but I don't see how that fits in with Kramer's claim about her pre-marital life. Kramer claims that even ""in modern discourse, Anne Boleyn continues to be either pilloried as a whore or upheld as an angel"" and she quotes unnamed ""history buffs"" who call Anne ""a piece of work"" who ""deserved to die."" I'm not sure who these history buffs are, but I can't believe they have the authority to be quoted in a serious historical work.A few other niggling issues - she uses the word ""slut"" as if it has meant the same thing for centuries, but the meaning of the word has actually changed fairly recently.  Secondly, until the mid-20th century, ineffective contraception and the risks of childbirth had a powerful effect on attitudes to women's sexuality, and it is only now that women can take control over their biological destiny that attitudes have relaxed.  I can't see anywhere in Kramer's book that she addresses this part of the equation.I feel this could be a rewarding historical angle if it was tackled by a historian who could dispassionately chart how attitudes had changed, using valid historical references to support her claims. This book could certainly be strengthened with clear references to historians and an acknowledgement that attitudes have changed in historical texts over the centuries.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8Y5M7PR03BOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2NXG6K#wasThisHelpful","R8Y5M7PR03BOT","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a childhood favourite, and I was thrilled to find this copy on Kindle. Warm, nostalgic, funny and inspiring, Katy's story is an excellent choice for anyone who loves Anne of Green Gables, Little Women, or Laura of the Little House.In the beginning, Katy is really, really naughty, in an impulsive endearing way - clumsy, inspired and heedless of consequences.  While the first few escapades end with a few tears and bruises, she finally does some real damage - choosing to ignore her aunt's orders not to play on the new swing.  She falls, and ""bruises her spine"", so she is unable to walk.  Her father, a doctor, sees no option but to leave her in her bedroom and hope for the best.  Katy is shattered, and confines herself in the dark, crying constantly, until a wise cousin sets her on the right path.The author, Susan Coolidge drew on her own childhood when her publisher asked her to write a comparable story to the current best-seller Little Women.  Personally, I prefer Katy and her siblings, because there are no dark undertones and being good does not involve painful sacrifice or submerging your true personality. It looks like a wholesome healthy childhood with plenty of loving guidance. I can't see Katy's father telling the children to give away their Christmas breakfast! The book is humorous and light-hearted, and the moral is not too heavy handed, because Katy really doesn't have a choice about being less impulsive and more patient. The family dynamics are true to life, sensitive and funny.  Your heart will break for poor sensitive little Elsie who doesn't belong with the older or the younger group of children and always feels left out.There are also a few interesting historical insights: once Katy is injured, she is stuck in her room with no options to go outdoors, and no physiotherapy to keep her muscles from wasting.  Also, the story is set in Ohio, yet Katy's family are ""Westerners"" which puzzled me (I'm not from the US!) Later in the series, when Katy's sister goes to Colorado, they start referring to themselves as ""Easterners"", so there is some insight into the growth of America during the 19th century.In comparison to the other classics, Katy also has the most delicious food than any other 19th children's heroine.  While the other books make the food SOUND delicious, I've always privately wondered if I'd want to eat with Laura or Jo or Anne.  But Katy's meals are tempting and delectable.Some commenters have complained about the format of this Kindle version - it must have been corrected since then, as my version was well laid out, easy to navigate and with no discernible errors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YMRATKJPMWKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00847HCAC#wasThisHelpful","R2YMRATKJPMWKJ","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is closer to a novel of manners than a murder mystery, as a group of childhood friends are reunited in their 70s when a box containing two skeleton hands is found in their old play area.  An early scene in the book reminded me of The Famous Five, with the older people sitting around being interviewed by a policeman about what they had noticed while playing all those years ago.While the reader already knows the identity of the victims and the murderer, the friends have no idea... they are each more preoccupied by the impact of their reunion. Alan Norris starts daydreaming about his first love, Daphne, who is dazzling and glamorous in contrast to his dull and predictable wife Rosemary; Michael is steeling himself to meet his 99-year old father, who abandoned him as a child. The other couples are facing the inevitable health decline of old age, but one of the beautiful aspects of this book is that all the characters are still learning and growing and participating actively in life. None of them are defined by their age, even though their adult children and grandchildren are quick to dismiss any unpredictable behaviour as ""Alzheimers"".The strongest and most engaging thread in the story is the ""love triangle"" between Rosemary, Alan and Daphne.

"There's a toilet metaphor in the title, but I'll leave that for another reviewer...Once I sat down next to this woman in a pub who spent the next two hours telling me horror stories about her love life, and rationalizing about how all these horrible men treated her badly because they were secretly in love with her.  The fact that some of these men were in long-term relationships with other women didn't shake this theory.  Reading Quin Woodward Pu's book ""The Plunger Syndrome"" plunged me back into that dark drunken night, so long ago. She likes the word ""I"", doesn't she?!Well, it's reassuring to see that Quin Woodward Pu has managed to modify her sentence structure,  but the general structure is still as bewildering as her previous efforts.  In the first section she switches rapidly from an anecdote about a man who ""dumped"" her after two dates, to an anecdote about being raped.  Both these anecdotes served to show how Pu prefers creative individual ways of dealing with conflict - when she was raped, she didn't do the boring sheep thing by calling the police; instead she called the man's wife.  When she was dumped, she called her lawyer.  My admiration and respect for Ms Pu's creative individuality shot skywards, even though I struggled to figure out the connection between the two events.While these two anecdotes seem to suggest that the men in Ms Pu's life take what they want and run for their lives/ wives, the title of the book is The Plunger Syndrome. Ms Pu wants to educate the world about men who are ""plungers"" - when they meet a girl with Ms Pu's creative individuality, they plunge into a fantasy of a deep long-lasting relationship. This was certainly very educational to me - I always thought men who talked about marriage or romantic mountain-climbing trips to Nepal on the first or second date were BS artists, not plungers.  I thought they were after sex, and they were on a mission to make as many wild, romantic extravagant promises as it would take to seduce me. Maybe I don't have Ms Pu's creative individuality.Sometimes men lie to get what they want.  Sometimes they start out liking you, then decide they're not interested in seeing you again. Sometimes there is an interesting funny story in this chain of events... but not this time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HZLWJTDGFT7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NA9AQDE#wasThisHelpful","R1HZLWJTDGFT7V","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wendy Bright just wants to go to school like other kids, but her father is a warlock and thinks school is a waste of time.  When he starts casting spells on her teacher, Wendy needs to use all her magic powers, with the aid of her 14 kilobat spell cruncher to keep school going. But when her father casts one spell too many, Wendy discovers that her teacher has a few powers of her own.This is a delightful hilarious read-aloud story for pre-school and early school age children.

"This is the story of two brothers who discover a box of treasure they can't open.  They argue over the treasure until Herbert pushes Harry overboard.  Herbert spends the rest of the story stranded alone while he desperately protects the ""treasure"".  Meanwhile Harry makes it to shore and goes on to have a loving and fulfilling life.For adults and older children, the lesson is obvious.  An abstract treasure is not worth sacrificing family, companionship, warmth, security and comfort.  For children under the age of 6, the moral of the story is lost behind the dazzling word ""treasure"". They see Herbert crazy and alone, hugging the box with the treasure in it, but they will insist that he's happiest because he has the ""treasure"". I think this moral belongs in a more complex book for older children.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U1W7T48WY1P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140567836#wasThisHelpful","R2U1W7T48WY1P4","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would highly recommend this as an excellent story for any little people who have just ""welcomed"" a new baby at home, as it takes an original angle to all the ""new baby sister/ brother"" stories.This is one of those fantastic illustrated stories, where kids relate to the story immediately, while the adults can follow the plot from an adult perspective. Cuthbert is perfectly happy being an only child with parents and grandparents all to himself. But then he ends up with 4 baby sisters who snatch all the attention away from him.  Cuthbert does his best to win back some attention from parents and grandparents - my kids love the way he says ""Bumble boo bum"" while everyone croons over the babies.  When he is ignored and put off, he resorts to his imagination, and calls for a BAD boy to play with him.Well Cuthbert gets more than he bargained for when three pirates answer his call.  But when the pirates upset the babies, Cuthbert realizes where his true loyalties lie, and he comes to accept his place in the family. My children have all loved this story, and my youngest daughter even asks me to read her story in bed, like Cuthbert's mummy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R350TMH6MO1O3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143500856#wasThisHelpful","R350TMH6MO1O3K","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the keys to great writing is when the ""villains"" are also endearing and engaging.  Monstrous Lady Montdore is an incurable snob with one dream - to see her beloved only daughter Polly marry spectacularly well... maybe even to the Prince of Wales.  But when Polly finally makes her choice, Lady Montdore is horrified and vows never to see Polly again. So who does she decide to marry?This ends as a twisted kind of happy ending love story, as Lady Montdore discovers the love of her life, but remains famously blind to his true nature.This plot is set against the busy noisy hilarious chaos of the Radlett family, modelled on Mitford's own eccentric upper class family. Uncle Matthew roars and blusters but he still sets Fanny's criterion for manhood; Uncle Davy is diverted from his health to make excellent observations about various family members and dull, quiet narrator Fanny is the central point where all these colourful eccentric characters converge.I love this book and The Pursuit of Love, but all Mitford's other books are not so razor-sharp unfortunately.  However, her family is as fascinating as they seem in these semi-autobiographical novels, so I would recommend reading some of the Mitford biographies available if you want to know more about this family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IXMQSM5QDYUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FXCSGS#wasThisHelpful","R2IXMQSM5QDYUT","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story alternates between three perspectives, Cecilia, the relentlessly ""perfect"" wife, mother and Tupperware queen; Rachel, so buried in grief for the loss of her teenage daughter years earlier that she cannot bond with her still-living son; and Tess, who thought she was happily married right up until her opening statement in Chapter 2.These women only know each other superficially, and do not realize how their interlinking lives connect them to a tragedy in the past and a disaster looming in the future. One character, Connor Whitby, is linked to all of them - they all have very different views of what sort of person he is, and he proves to be the eye of the storm, a catalyst for disaster, several times over.As a veteran of school-mum politics, I recognized and related to all the female characters at some point.The plot was intricate and believable, and it had me thinking, ""What would I do in this situation?""  How do you change gears into high drama while you are focused on your children and the trivial tasks of everyday life?I recommend this book for anyone whose life is currently defined by the school run and canteen duty.  It is funny, intriguing and heartbreaking with a satisfying conclusion.

"This is the story of a high-profile Australian tragedy - a recently separated father drives off the road into a dam, and manages to escape out of the sinking car, leaving his three small sons grappling to undo their seat belts in the dark cold water. Only the father survived.  Robert Farquharson claimed he had blacked out during a coughing fit, losing control of the car.  But the physical evidence showed that the car had turned sharply and cleanly into the dam at a regular speed, without skidding or spinning out of control.Garner's opening cry, ""Let this be an accident"" is echoed throughout the book, by court watchers, family, witnesses and most heart-rending of all, Cindy Gambino, the mother of the lost boys and estranged wife of Robert.With a compassionate, non-judgemental eye, Garner looks at the evidence and wonders how we judge a person guilty - is it the evidence, or is it the character of the accused? As she watches Farquharson's strong maternal sisters support him, Garner quotes a legal friend who says ""If I was appearing for him, I'd try to make his family see that loving him doesn't mean they have to believe he's innocent.""The style of this book is melodic and mournful, yet the evidence is clearly represented and easy to follow, so readers can make their own balanced assessment. If you enjoy this book, you will also be interested to ready ""Have you seen Simone"" by Virginia Peters, as she uses a similar style to tell a true crime story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SO7JI7LQ8VOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KK3NT3C#wasThisHelpful","R1SO7JI7LQ8VOC","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking for a Kindle version of this beloved book, and was very happy with this one.  There were a few formatting issues that bothered me, but at the end of the book I found a note from the publisher asking readers to report any issues... so hopefully they have been ironed out now!The Exclusive Bonus Features at the end of the book proved to be a summary of the book's history, a list of characters with limited explanation about their role in the book (not so useful) and a list of Civil War battles with notes about their context in the book (quite interesting, but disappointing to find it after the war was over!) So if you are reading this edition and curious about the characters or the battle history, skip to the end for these notes. (I was secretly hoping for photos, but no such luck!)Before you read this book, it is a good idea to do a little Wikepedia level research on the Civil War.  This story is completely and infamously from the perspective of the Southerners who persisted in believing the slaves were happy being slaves and felt like ""family"" with their white owners.  Considering the O'Hara family had about 300 slaves, and 3 stayed loyal to the family after the Yankees won, this is probably a statistically accurate account of how many slaves saw their white owners as ""family"".  There are some ingenuously racist statements, such as the time Scarlett told a Yankee woman that she wouldn't consider white servants... to enjoy GWTW, you have to see it as a time capsule, and remember that the economy of the time was based on slave labour to keep the cotton crops flourishing. Margaret Mitchell fails to mention Lincoln's assassination, but his untimely death had something to do with the chaos of Reconstruction, when there was no good economic model to replace the slave labour one.I read and re-read Gone with the Wind throughout my teens and twenties, and I'm now coming back to it after many years.  The characters and scenes remained so clear to me, but still I came up with some new insights about this classic story.  When I first read GWTW, the term ""narcissistic personality"" wasn't so common, but now I see that Scarlett O'Hara is the most impeccably drawn narcissist in literature.  She only cares about the people she can't have, discarding them as soon as they show any interest in her (including her own son, who she only seems to notice when he's having fun with someone else); she drifts into boredom when other people talk about their problems, including the old lady who told of how she watched her mother being murdered by Indians.Yet because the book is so completely from Scarlett's perspective and she's living through such difficult times, we relate to her completely.Mitchell did an incredible job of juggling an enormous cast of characters and keeping them all memorable so the stories within stories are easy to follow.  Some characters like Tony Fontaine only appear briefly every few hundred pages, but you know exactly who he is and understand exactly why he acts as he does.Even though I'd hate to know Scarlett in real life (unless I needed financial support after a war), you have to admire the way she tackles each challenge so single mindedly, whether she has to lie, steal, cheat, kill... or even pick cotton once the slaves are gone.  I know sequels have been written but there is no decent sequel for this story.  She will always be a self-centred narcissist, craving whatever she can't have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TPXG8U2Y0VTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVIK7TO#wasThisHelpful","R2TPXG8U2Y0VTV","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What happened to Tegan Lane?  A young Australian woman, Keli Lane, showed up at a Sydney hospital 9 months pregnant. She claimed she was planning a home birth but couldn't contact her midwife.  Staff delivered her healthy baby girl and gave her the paperwork to fill in - Keli filled in some of it, naming the baby Tegan Lee Lane.  Mother and baby had no visitors, and a few days later they left the hospital quietly, without being formally discharged.  A few hours later, Keli was at a wedding with her boyfriend, as if nothing had happened.  When she attempted to adopt out another baby a year or so later, a sharp-eyed social worker picked up that Keli had had three babies, yet only two were accounted for, and Keli's double life imploded.Keli Lane is probably one of the most composed and enigmatic women to ever face a murder trial. With no body, no witnesses and no crime scene - and for years, no known victim - authorities took years to pin Keli down to a murder charge.  This book helps the reader walk alongside Keli, using her own words as well as the recollections of friends and transcripts of taped phone conversations, to give some insight into why a healthy young woman with a steady boyfriend would use adoption - and worse - as birth control. With unflinching, but non-judgemental insight, Chin gives us an opportunity to question why and how Keli Lane found herself in this situation.The most intriguing aspect of Keli Lane is that she never confided in anyone throughout three pregnancies. It's probably understandable that she didn't turn to her parents or ex-boyfriend when she decided not to keep her baby, but less comprehensible that she didn't confide in a girlfriend, or even a friend's mother.  Having set her mind on adoption or abortion, she cleanly removed several babies from her life without anyone in her circle knowing. With Tegan, however - the second of three children to be born - she was stuck.  She missed the time frame for abortion and she knew from experience that the adoption process was emotionally draining and time-consuming, especially when you are lying to social workers about the natural father's involvement.Keli wants the world to believe that the only person she ever confided in throughout three full-term pregnancies was the man who fathered Tegan during a one-night-stand, while they were both in committed relationships with other people. This man was prepared to accept custody of Tegan without any necessary paperwork or a blood test to prove paternity.  And he has the same passion for secrecy as Keli, having managed to raise Tegan under the radar of the biggest missing person search in Australian history.She spins lies that reveal a great deal about her attitudes, and that also shove the blame for her decisions onto other people.  By far the cruellest story Keli tells is that she hid her pregnancies because she feared her parents' disapproval.  Personally, I think this young woman in a rocky relationship with dreams of athletic glory, actually disposed of these babies through abortion, adoption and murder in secret, because she knew her parents would have encouraged her to keep a baby.  The simple truth is, Keli did not want to have a baby.  In one tragic note of truth, when she knew the police were after her, she realized she would be separated from the one child she did keep and raise.  She told a friend in a taped phone conversation that she had finally figured out she was meant to be a mother. But it was too late.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J4KRB5FWERCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1459631226#wasThisHelpful","R1J4KRB5FWERCN","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was an interesting story, and worthy of a true crime novel. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy a wide range of literature including true crime.  For readers who only like true crime, the style might put you off. I would recommend you read the sample first to see if you enjoy the style, before buying the book.  I enjoyed the style of this book, which was an original and unusual one for a true-crime story - I felt as if I was reading the biography of a 19th century writer, rather than the typical news reporter true-crime style.  The style, the setting and the characters all gave the story an olden-day feel, as if this was a turn of the century crime, but it actually took place in 1987.  A wealthy eccentric couple disappear abruptly and the local Jersey police are convinced they were murdered by one or both of their sons... but without the bodies, the investigation stalls.The book opens with Roderick breaking down in guilt years after the crime, and then veers neatly into the parents' past with a rather contradictory account of the boys' upbringing and characters.  One part of the book jarred with me - Roderick's brother Mark is described by his aunt as thoughtful and loving, sending flowers to his sick mother, when not all young men would have bothered... but only a few pages later, he is described as having a cold and hostile relationship with his mother.  It is natural for relatives to have a more mellow view of relationships than other observers, but I think the author should have addressed these inconsistencies directly, rather than just recording completely different perspectives without comment.While the old-fashioned biographical style engaged me during the earlier part of the book, I don't think it was a suitable style for describing the police investigation, which could have been narrated in a more direct, newspaper style. Once the crime was officially solved, I think most readers will still be asking: ""Was that really what happened?""  A few key pieces of evidence didn't seem to get a fair hearing in court.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GRIN06X3IS80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJLXTE8#wasThisHelpful","R2GRIN06X3IS80","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you get depressed at the social isolation and hopeless eccentricity of Rendell's usual heroes, you will be relieved to meet John Creevey, who starts the story as typically painfully shy and unassertive with only a handful of friends but gradually becomes a little tougher, a little more observant and a lot more assertive.  It is rare for a Rendell hero to come out of his shell and improve his life, but by the end of this book there are a few hints that John might resolve some of the tragedies of his life and find love again.John is distracted from his own heartbreak by a series of coded messages that he believes are the communiques of a criminal gang.  Once he learns how to decode the messages, he decides to send a message of his own...  He never discovers that this ""criminal gang"" are actually schoolboys playing an elaborate and sophisticated spy game; and he never finds out what happened with his message.Fourteen year old Charles Mabledene is the polar opposite of John Creevey.  Angelically beautiful with robotic efficiency and absolutely no morals, he is ambitious to move into a position of power in this schoolboy gang, and he demonstrates disconcerting talents for uncovering information. He proves to be the most chilling character in this book of ""strange men"".I found John's story more engaging than the parallel plot of the schoolboys with their secret gang.  Their schemes seemed either too meaningless or too impossible for me to engage with them properly, although I am quite convinced that highly educated school boys of that age would enjoy these kinds of spy games. The two worlds collided when Charles took up John's ""assignment"" not knowing the message was planted. Without giving away the ending, I think this could inspire an excellent sequel - I'd like to know what one particular character was up to, twenty years down the track.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VYQY001EXC7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J4VSIQ#wasThisHelpful","R3VYQY001EXC7P","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vicky Soteriou had everything she wanted - a lavish lifestyle, an adoring husband, three beautiful children and a lover she could manipulate to do anything... With a destructive taste for conflict and excitement, she gambled away her future by convincing her insecure drug-addled lover Ari to kill her husband so they could be together.  As her husband fought for his life in hospital, Vicky realized the police were closing in on Ari, so she quickly and neatly confessed to her involvement in order to minimise the damage.  Another bad gambling choice.While Vicky orchestrated the central event - her husband's attempted murder - her voice and perspective are mostly silent in this book, as she did not speak publicly in court or otherwise after her first disastrous incriminating police interview.  But the voices of those around her - Chris, her devastated husband, her lover Ari, her blindly loyal parents and her bitter in-laws - all paint a picture of a woman who sees herself as above the consequences of the actions she instigates.  Her sister could not understand why Chris's family were so vindictive when Vicky ""just made a mistake"".  She managed to convince her parents that Chris was somehow responsible for the attempt on his own life, and she was the victim of a ""conspiracy"". The police who interviewed her were astounded when she asked to go home after confessing to attempted murder.Her self-centred confidence would be comical if it wasn't for the scarred and damaged body of her ex-husband, her confused and devastated teenage daughter, who is now estranged from Chris, and the two little twins who are growing up without their mother.  It is a great consolation to me that Vicky is deprived of designer clothes, cocktail parties, nail polish and thrice-weekly hair appointments throughout her incarceration.  A fantastic quote from her parents gave an insight into her upbringing: at Vicky's murder trial, her parents noticed a strange woman sitting next to Chris and they were outraged.  At a break in the proceedings they accused him of leaving a ""rose petal"" for a ""cactus""!  Maybe they should have put some of that energy into teaching their rose petal right from wrong.Chris Soteriou has emerged courageously from the tragedy as a stronger and wiser man, with two small children to raise, a loving woman to support him along with his fiercely loyal family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1USGW63YU7QZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFTBVXY#wasThisHelpful","R1USGW63YU7QZ4","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If only they'd had some tiger food in the house...I find this book really captures childrens' imaginations as they try to work out what they would do in this situation.

Would a tiger get drunk from drinking beer?  (Some of these questions are from older kids than the intended audience...)This whimsical old-fashioned story has a European feel with the landscape and clothing - there is also something decidedly old-fashioned about the family structure with Daddy at work all day (and the ""Ta-da!"" pose when he arrives home from work), but this does not detract from the story for me.  If it bothers you, you can talk about how family dynamics are different now, although careful not to spoil the magic possibility that a tiger could possibly come to tea.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NCK7K60SNT7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XJ70QI#wasThisHelpful","R3NCK7K60SNT7H","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Elizabeth is a difficult character to pin down - unlike Anne Boleyn or even Margaret Beaufort or Elizabeth Woodville, it's not so easy to give the White Princess a modern context because what modern woman finds herself in this situation? She is the eldest daughter (and presumably eldest surviving child) of the King of England, so she should be queen.  She's seen her younger brothers disappear, spirited away by someone who wants the throne badly enough to kill innocent children... that would be enough for most people to decide they are quite happy to forget about ruling England.  Elizabeth takes the middle ground - she marries Henry Tudor, victor at Bosworth and solidifies his claim to the throne, then steps back into the shadows so he can rule England.  Did she have more influence than we know about? Was she haunted by her brothers? Why was she so flirtatious with her uncle? Was she so determined to be queen she would have married ANYONE???  We will never know and we can only wonder...I think the flaw in this story is that Phillipa Gregory really wants us to believe that Perkin Warbeck could have been the missing prince from the tower.  But this just isn't plausible to me.  Even the most stoic queen would have cracked under this pressure and embraced her brother.  For me, the only realistic reason Henry would have allowed Perkin in court was to prove he wasn't really the prince. There is also a beautifully sad historical account in Alison Weir's biography of Elizabeth going on a pilgrimage during her last pregnancy, visiting all the significant places of her life in the months between Arthur's death and her own death.  I'm sorry Philipa Gregory didn't use this as the basis of her story as it was quite powerful and speculative.Elizabeth's choice to be a background figure must have been a choice to some extent as only one generation on, her daughter in law Katherine was a strong consort, and of course in the next generation, her grand-daughter and namesake became one of England's greatest rulers...","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IPS29JDFKREG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CCX9DUG#wasThisHelpful","R1IPS29JDFKREG","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book for my daughters in 2006 when our third child was due, and now my youngest child (age 5) still loves having it as a story.  It is an easy enjoyable story to read aloud together, with engaging characters.  While Amy, the oldest is confident and excited about the new baby, Ben, the younger child, is a little unsettled with the inexplicable changes whirling around him although he enjoys helping prepare the room for the baby.  The illustrations are beautiful and the storyline sets up some realistic expectations - Mum will get tired easily and you can't go to the hospital with her!  Ben is sad and confused when she disappears and feels as if ""everything is changing"".  But the book also offers some helpful tips for how parents can guide their children gently through the experience of meeting the baby.  The baby has a present for its siblings and Ben is allowed to choose the name (from a list, read out loud by Dad).  Even now that our family has finished the ""baby phase"" my kids loving the special memories associated with this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7RLW12TMRHRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0753457385#wasThisHelpful","R7RLW12TMRHRO","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While other protagonists in the Cousins War series are obsessed with gaining or retaining the throne, the King's Curse is narrated by Margaret Pole, the daughter of George Duke of Clarence and the niece of Edward IV and Richard III.  If you have read The Kingmaker's Daughter, you know about her tragic childhood - her mother died young, her father disappeared into the tower for treason, and her maternal aunt, wife of Richard III died broken-hearted before the Battle of Bosworth.Margaret and her younger brother survived all this, and at the beginning of The King's Curse, she is married and banished to the country out of the new king's sight.  Her brother is not so lucky, banished to the tower as a punishment for being born too close to the throne.Margaret doesn't seem to have any ambitions to regain the throne for herself or her family.  She is happy with minor royal responsibilities, such as looking after the new Spanish princess Katherine who comes to England to marry Arthur Prince of Wales.  While she suffers indignities and injustices under Henry VII, she chooses to pursue a rewarding country life, looking after her lands and her people. Henry even stifles this ambition when he drives her into poverty after her husband dies.  Then Henry VIII becomes king and he does not seem to have his father's craven mistrust of Margaret's heritage.  She is welcomed back to the palace where she attends the beautiful young queen Katherine.  When Katherine gives birth to her first son, Henry asks his beloved cousin Margaret to raise this new prince.But the baby prince dies and the new king becomes obsessed with his own failure to sire an heir to his throne.  He tests his power to the limit, violently defying his subjects, his advisers, his loyal wife and even his God as if a tantrum could get him a son. Meanwhile Margaret quietly nurtures her family of four boys and a girl, so they become powerful and influential members of court without ever admitting how close they are to the succession.Over the years, during Katherine's downfall and the rise of Anne Boleyn, Margaret has to do some fast talking to protect her family and her lands, without being accused of treason.  She narrates the horror of Henry's reign, describing a brutal tyrant who would not listen to rational argument and executed good men simply for disagreeing with him.  She also describes the disastrous effect when Henry dissolves the monasteries, which worked as England's social security system, offering shelter and support to the sick and poor.Margaret is pragmatic, with a fierce desire to live.  Her death is one of the defining moments of Henry VIII's reign - he executed his cousin, the woman who had helped raise him, had raised his daughter Mary and whose sons had supported him without ever hinting that they had a comparable claim to the throne.  He executed her when she was in her 60s without a trial - her death is legendary because she fought back when the executioner swung his axe.Most books about Henry VIII focus on his personal life rather than the life of citizens during his reign - this book is the exception because even though Margaret is a peripheral member of the royal family, she describes how Henry's obsession with absolute power affected the country. This book brings home the arbitrary brutality of Henry's reign and shows the far-reaching effects of allowing certain favourites to seize land and treasures from the monasteries.  It's maddening not to be able to tell Henry to concentrate on his own beautiful daughters who were both there, and both non-threatening successors to the throne. After reading this book, I wonder if the desire for a son was more about proving his manhood than securing the throne for future generations.An enjoyable and thought-provoking read for a long time Tudor fan!  While this book might end The Cousin's War, I could see some threads towards future books - I'm guessing I'll see Reginald Pole and Princess Mary again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A8JGCAMLIH3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKKTYJM#wasThisHelpful","R2A8JGCAMLIH3G","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jemima's tale is an old-fashioned allegory, warning young women to beware of foxy gentlemen who show an unnatural interest in their eggs.  Jemima is a little gullible and trusting, restless to leave the farm, and a ""very bad sitter"" - in short, she's a girl looking for trouble. The foxy gentleman is quick to size her up and take advantage.The book is perhaps one of the few child-sized Greek tragedies, as Jemima goes to so many lengths to protect her eggs, trusts the wrong person and then just on the verge of rescue, the eggs are lost anyway.  The allegory goes perhaps one step too far when Jemima's rescuers accidentally gobble up her eggs. As the central moral of the story is recognizing ""stranger danger"", it's a little too ironic that the friends should cause the tragedy. All the characters are three-dimensional adult personalities transcribed into animal form and the story has an undercurrent of menacing violence that might bother some parents.However, small children will not see past the exquisite water colour illustrations of the farmyard animals, so you can enjoy this book together and talk about the mistakes Jemima makes and the lies the foxy gentleman tells... We can only hope Jemima doesn't make similar errors of judgement in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GT36B8FNJU8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0723247781#wasThisHelpful","R1GT36B8FNJU8E","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But then, in a twist, the little elephant friend starts missing Mum... who is not available (she's at work).The moral of the story seems to be that when kids are busy, they are free to ignore their mothers; but it is very sad and worrying when Mum is busy or unavailable.  I'm sure young children will relate to this theme beautifully.  My 5yo daughter and I had some lovely in-depth discussions about Emily Brown and her actions.Not as good as ""This Teddy Bear Belongs to Emily Brown"" but still lovely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X1HPUGF056T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1408302039#wasThisHelpful","R2X1HPUGF056T8","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was mesmerised by Levin's book and wondered hypothetically how the plot could have been transposed into a movie.  My husband said: ""I think there was a movie called ""A Kiss Before Dying"" - but I don't know why you want to watch it.""  He was right on both counts.The plot is so painfully contrived, it turns itself inside out and becomes meaningless.  Dillon's only characteristic seems to be a sycophantic fascination with his father-in-law and a hypnotic fascination with trains. But Sean Young's performance is truly spectacular in its awfulness.  Drama students should watch it as an object lesson in how NOT to deliver lines.Surely no other actress has ever managed to deliver the lines: ""He killed my sister;"" and ""Yes, I'll marry you,"" with exactly the same facial expression and emotional affect.

"This book has elements of classic mystery writing, although its various subplots don't seem to merge neatly.  The opening is intriguing - a man is truffle-hunting with his dog, when the dog produces a human hand from an old ditch.  It turns out the ditch was dug 11 years ago, and numerous witnesses display uncanny memory skills as they recall what they were doing the day the ditch was dug, the unusual t-shirt on a passer-by, and the conversations they had about the ditch being refilled again.My favourite plotline was of the devoted husband and father who left home to attend a funeral 11 years earlier and never returned...  This loving blameless man had one innocent secret, and as we can guess, it was this secret that triggered his disappearance.  Coincidentally his daughter is going public in her search for the father who never came home, just as the hand emerges from the ditch...  while this is contrived, it's a little more satisfyingly within the rules of mystery writing than all those impressive feats of memory.  This story dovetails with the story of a local author who has one outstanding success to his credit, and two (!) cackling wives pushing him to churn out more novels.The other main plotline had no connection with the rest of the story - Rendell must have it in her contract to discuss social issues, and she tells a terrifying and compelling tale about genital mutilation of young girls.  If Dora Wexford started the story not knowing what female circumcision is, she certainly knows by the end of the tale, as Rendell describes the procedure repeatedly in painful graphic detail.  If you're squeamish, skip those bits - they don't affect the outcome of the mystery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OSCO4QH157SL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003SNJPUC#wasThisHelpful","R2OSCO4QH157SL","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a brief and succinct account of the investigation into the death of Anni Dewani, a Swedish woman of Indian descent who was shot dead during her honeymoon in Capetown.  Her husband Shrien Dewani claimed their car had been hijacked, and he had been thrown out of the car.  Within 3 minutes, Anni was killed and a few valuables were stolen.As police investigated the suspects, they drew a connection between the gunman and the hired driver of the vehicle, and from there, drew a connection between the driver and Shrien Dewani himself.  Did Shrien hire his driver to arrange the murder of his wife?  Police soon discovered that the bridegroom had a bizarre motive for the crime - but meanwhile, an investigative reporter started asking himself: How easy is it for a tourist to arrange a hired killing within a few days of landing in Cape Town?  Not that easy, apparently.It is not the author's fault that this book ends with an unsatisfying lack of completion.  At the time of writing, Shrien Dewani was in an English mental health facility, fighting extradition back to Cape Town, so he had never had his account of Anni's death tested in court.  But it is still an excellent and balanced summary of the different perspectives of the case - perhaps one day, the legal system will come to an official conclusion about why Anni Dewani was killed.Most importantly, Hammer includes emotive interviews with Anni's family, giving her a personality and a ""voice"", as well as giving voice to the family's heartbreak. The evidence is set down so the reader can decide independently which is the most plausible explanation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUQT4527RRE2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2HFFC2#wasThisHelpful","RUQT4527RRE2Q","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent tale of discovery and identity for anyone who has been adopted, and even for anyone who questions the role family plays in shaping identity.  Suzanne Chick grew up believing that her mother had died in childbirth and her father was a soldier killed in the war, a story of romantic finality that wasn't actually true.  Her adoptive mother finally admitted that Suzanne's birth mother had been unmarried and was probably still alive.  Suzanne didn't start searching for her birth mother until her own daughters were grown.  She soon discovered that her birth mother was a well-known and prolific writer, Charmian Clift, but that Charmian had died many years earlier.Suzanne ""meets"" her mother through Charmian's writing, and through the work of a biographer working on a book about Charmian's life. Charmian's writing leads Suzanne to have more questions about the past, but not all can be answered.  Most harrowing of all, she learns about the tragic lives of Charmian's other children, the two sons and daughter born from her marriage to novelist George Johnston (author of My Brother Jack).I've heard this book hits on all the adoptive child's fantasies - my birth mother is famous/ I was the lucky one because I was adopted - and I think this is probably correct.  There is a fairy tale quality to this story, a sense of triumph over tragedy, as Suzanne fits the missing pieces of her identity into place. It doesn't end this way for all adopted children seeking birth parents - Suzanne's brother (also adopted) was inspired to seek his own birth mother after observing Suzanne's journey.  He received a blunt letter in the mail denying contact.  Suzanne is the lucky one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWEGGCTAEX8W0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0330356542#wasThisHelpful","RWEGGCTAEX8W0","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first reading, I felt this was a raw and very honest account from a woman who truly believed she was doing something good for someone else, and was caught up in the emotion of giving away her own child.  There is some very good thought-provoking insight from psychologists and experts about what Whitehead was going through and she had an excellent ghostwriter who helps to keep the story seeming balanced.BUT the more you read, the more you realise how manipulative and self-centred Whitehead is. My take on the story is that she was seeking out her own surrogate father because her husband wouldn't have any more kids.  Mary Beth had her children very young and she was probably ready to do it all again as an older, experienced mother (she was still only in her late 20s). So she hatched a scheme to sign up as a surrogate, get pregnant then cry for the baby.  No wonder she was angry when the Sterns expected to pick up the baby!!When the sperm donor/ surrogacy scam didn't work, she had an affair, got pregnant and left her husband to start a new family.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R820YCWG707SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312026145#wasThisHelpful","R820YCWG707SK","A28LG1X5W3HMXW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28LG1X5W3HMXW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This has great surge protection and can accommodate two of those brick type plugs.  Nice on/off switch and lights to indicate it is grounded and protection is on.However, this is a very confusing device.  There are four plugs that are so-called energy saving.  There are no instructions as to how they work from what I could see on the box or in it.  Apparently you need to have something plugged into the 'master' outlet and if THAT device is drawing power the rest of those controlled devices will get power.  Okay, sounds good.  But how is someone to know that?  And what happens if that master outlet device gets turned off or even unplugged?  The rest of the devices on that side get the power cut.  I don't know how much energy you might potentially save, but to me that is not worth the potential pitfalls of having something you need get turned off with no warning.  This to me is not a good thing.  Essentially for me those four outlets are not going to get used.

"I have used both arm and wrist blood pressure units.  This one from a great company is very, very compact.  Much more so than other wrist units I have had.  And it comes with a compact and sturdy travel case.  The case is nice but you can save even more room by wedging this between some clothes.  It folds up super small.Well, all well and good, but it has to do the job, right?  That it does and very well.  It is super, super quiet.  The quietest one I have used.  When you put in on and turn the start button on it helps guide your wrist position for the best reading.  But, be quick, because after a few seconds it will begin the reading even if not in the best position.  The display is very crisp and clear.  You easily set the date and time (follow the instructions).And the best part is that you can synch your readings to a phone app.  Once synched you can emailed them to yourself or your doctor.The accuracy is great.  This is a great product and superb for traveling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12R960YGB6Q0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010H76PTU#wasThisHelpful","R12R960YGB6Q0F","A11T807LX2EF00","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11T807LX2EF00?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderfully sounding bluetooth speaker with lots of versatility.  It is heavy, so don't think you can throw it in your luggage and take along on a trip.  Well, you could, but I wouldn't take up that much space and weight.  There are other options for that.Make sure you read the instructions.  Once you do, set up and pairing was a snap.  The battery gauge only works when it is turned on, which is not the case with other things I have owned.  It takes a while to charge up.  But then again it lasts and lasts.  And you can charge your phone or tablet which is a great feature.The sound, well, it's simply awesome.  I was holding it and felt it vibrate at the bass notes.  Quite impressive.  Very nice stereo separation.You can also answer your connected phone and use it as a speakerphone.  It sounds fine.  But like all these type products the caller can hear you are on a speaker.It is pricey.  But it is a quality product.  I have it in another room and am playing some things from my computer through it and it sounds great.  Of course, if others are around you need to move it closer to where you are.  You can use it outside on the deck.  It won't be flying around.  Did I say it was heavy.  You could use it as a paperweight.All in all this is a great product and sounds just great.  Make sure you want to spend this much money on something like this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R83CEK9M7EXB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1SBB9A#wasThisHelpful","R83CEK9M7EXB1","A11T807LX2EF00","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11T807LX2EF00?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What an excellent keyboard/case.  I have used lots to these in the past and I have to say this is the best one yet.Once you put the iPad in and line it up the keyboard comes alive.  A light flashes to tell you it's now connected.  The keys feel, well, just great.  I typed on it for a while and unlike some other keyboard/cases/folios this one felt natural, like a regular keyboard.  No guessing where the keys were either.  Everything worked just great.And the really nice thing about this one is that you can fold it over and the iPad can be used easily in one hand.  Of course it is a bit bulky but not as bad as you might think.You can also recharge an iPhone while using it.  A nice touch to top off or especially when you are run down and don't have a charger handy.All in all this is one great keyboard that is one of the lightest ones around, works well and feel natural.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AE9UK6AK34OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ODYYFO6#wasThisHelpful","R1AE9UK6AK34OO","A11T807LX2EF00","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11T807LX2EF00?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used WD-40 for ages.  So I was very intrigued at this formulation.  Will it last long-term, up to a year, who's to say at this point?  But I suspect it will.  Why do I say that?Well, the product smells like the WD-40 I know and love, so that's a start.  But I did notice when I applied it it had a bubbly effect when it hit the bolt, etc.  Interesting.  Like it was digging into the little unseen crevices.Also, it seems to have a bit more consistency, adhering and not as drippy.I do believe it will have staying power.  But since I just used it on spreader bolts, fence gate locks, outside bolts, I can't attest to how long it will hold up at this point.  But for now it seems to a different variation of the formula which makes me hopeful.  So far so good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31UL85JUDDVU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00631GWS4#wasThisHelpful","R31UL85JUDDVU8","A11T807LX2EF00","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11T807LX2EF00?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, Turbo Tax and Intuit have been in the news quite a bit of late.  And now they are giving people money back.Well, I used the Deluxe version last year and had to pay to upgrade along the way because of some features it did not have.  Now they have cut even more from the Deluxe so I bought the Premier.  Amazon has great prices on this (though I got a free copy to review).The Premier edition works well for my particular needs and as usual walks you through the process.  It can get a bit confusing and difficult to go back to a particular spot, but that would be true with any software tax program.  The ability to e-file is nice for Federal and state and this version includes one state download.  But you have to pay to file your state electronically.One issue that I have encountered over the years is that when you file a second state return, which I need to do for income in a different state, I needed to include a copy of my other state tax return.  That did not get included in my e-file.  If I am paying extra (a lot extra) to e-file another state, why would they not include ALL the forms that are required?  I have pointed that out to Intuit.  I don't plan to do that again.The program imports a lot of info which saves time.All in all I am pleased.  I haven't finalized things yet, just did what I could, but so far it is pretty typical.  I knocked off stars because of the up-selling.  I was all set to buy the Deluxe and discovered that it no longer did what it did last year.  And then I recalled how I had during the course of using it last year had to upgrade anyway for some financial importing features that actually saved me time to do and ended up being worth the extra money.Don't expect a lot of customer support from them and don't pay attention to their guarantees.  Had an issue one year when they miscalculated and I had to pay interest.  To get the guarantee refund, etc., they wanted me to go through so many hoops that would have taken so much time it wasn't worth it.  I essentially had to recreate the file.  They would not accept their own electronic file I had on my computer.  Go figure.  Made no sense.But, overall I have been pleased with them.  Like I said, I knocked off stars for their come from behind change in product and up-selling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGJ1XKB4OS7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYXTCNC#wasThisHelpful","R2GGJ1XKB4OS7S","A11T807LX2EF00","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11T807LX2EF00?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a nice, compact and efficient stapler.  It sits very nicely on my desk top either horizontally or vertically.  Takes up a lot less space than my other stapler did.It works as advertised.  Staples up to 40 sheets without a problem.  I used regular staples at first, then switched to Optima staples and noticed a difference.  So, if you get this, get the right staples.  By the way, it does NOT come with any staples.  Big mistake, in my view.  They should have included some staples to get started with a blurb about using the right ones.The staple backs lie flat which helps when you have stacks of stapled items.  It avoids that bulge at the stapled corner.  Also, this uses about half a strip of staples.  Being so compact there is no way to have had it use a full strip.  The only disadvantage is that you will refill it more often.  Very little effort is needed to do the job.All in all a great little handy stapler.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZQ1YTTKAVGFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OILMEI8#wasThisHelpful","R1ZQ1YTTKAVGFS","A11T807LX2EF00","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11T807LX2EF00?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a bit different that the ear plugs you might buy  They are rigid and come in a small little case.  They essentially just block your ears from outside sound... more muffle the sound.

That being said, it was better than nothing and did help muffle the engine noise.These are not easy to get in and out of the case.  I spent more time than I would think I should have getting them in and out.  There must be a better way to do that.Once out of the case they are easy to hold and maneuver.  And it takes a bit of turning to get the right fit to block the sound around you.  Well, as much as it can.Again, don't set your expectations too high.

"This is a very nice stroller.  Easy to fold up and open.  Works well and has a nice screened area at the top which when uncovered (easy to do) let's you peak in and see what is going on with your little one.  Easy to maneuver and lots of onboard storage.Some issues I had were the instructions (as with a lot of so-called instructions) were not clear.  At one point it referred to a picture that was so small and unclear you couldn't figure anything out.  Why is it so difficult for people to write instructions in a clear, concise and simple manner.  They should actually give the instructions to someone and see if they can figure things out.Another issue was the horrid smell from the folding top.  It went away after quite some time.  But it left me wondering about any potential effects that could have long term.  In this day and age the use of this plastic/whatever material that produced such a horrible smell should be rethought.The instructions say you don't need tools.  Well, I needed a hammer like item to get those little cotter pins inside the wheel hub to attach the rear wheels.  My finger did not have the force needed to get it through the axle hole.The stroller works easily and the braking system is simple and quite effective.I knocked off a star for all of ""my issues.""

I didn't find any instructions in my package and it took a while to figure out how to turn it on.  You push the button, the lights show your charge level, you push the button twice to get the light to go on.

"I havent bought a scanner in a long time.Technology has changed a bunch since the early days.Normally, i have one or two radios in the truck with scan capability, and that met my needs.I'm on a temporary assignment in the mountains of colorado, and wanted a base station scanner to use in my hotel room to hear both work frequencies an surrounding areas.This one met my needs, since i didnt really need any digital scanning for now.Holy moly! I like this thing.So far, i've programmed in 10 county fire dispatch channels, and its searching for their tone-out information by itself.Waiting on a USB to Serial adapter to arrive to be able to program the rest of my channels.its a pretty hefty unit, well built, nice screen, easy to manipulate the controls.Pros i've found so far:1. Comes with 3 types of power cords. Home/Cig plug/hard install car wiring.2. BNC vs older ""rca type"" plug3. GPS capable4. Preprogrammed per state5. Software programmable6. 10 channel fire tone out scanOther people have reviewed the 15x pretty well, so i'll leave this review by saying:-You're going to want to computer program it.-You need to find a better instruction manual online.-You will probably like this scanner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28YZ8XXCBYCV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002IT1C8U#wasThisHelpful","R28YZ8XXCBYCV7","AAOLNBV6A9094","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAOLNBV6A9094?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We recently received our grey headboard for our guest bedroom, and like the other reviewers were pleasantly surprised at how nice it looks. We paid under $100 and definitely got our money's worth, it's exactly as a headboard should be, and takes all of 1 minute to assemble since you just attach the legs to the board. I had a slight issue with attaching the legs to the frane, the included bolts were like a mm too big for the slots, but using a drill I was able to push it through anyways. It's a little wobbly attached to the frame, but I dont see how it'd be different than most any other headboard attached to the metal frame. I would actually recommend if possible just bypassing the frame and attaching it to the wall, just need to get the screws to do as such, I will be doing that at a later date but for now, it works fine.It is cushioned, but could stand to be slightly more cushioned but is still more comfortable than having your head hit the drywall. The grey is more of a true light  grey, the pics they posted have a greenish tint but the piece itself does not have a blue or green tint.Overall, this piece was about the same price as doing it DIY, but saved the hassle, and looks professionally made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AD6BVL0TOC1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O1DGDIA#wasThisHelpful","R3AD6BVL0TOC1S","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't know why that one review is so anti-flavored protein, but yes, this has other ingredients in it, as many protein drinks do. It doesn't hide the ingredient list, its right in the product description, and the list is pretty short (and some of them can be very, very long). Also, the ""serving size' is suggestion only, and you can get far more than 28 servings out of this. I usually use a single scoop (24g protein), so that's 72 servings for around $50 (I got it on sale, so the price varies).It mixes well, the strawberry is alright, artificial tasting, but not too bad if you pair it with milk. Since I don't use a fridge at work, I put about 4oz milk in my blender bottle along with several ice cubes, they melt and bump up the liquid to around 8oz for a serving by the time I have it after my afternoon workout.Overall, its protein, if it fits your budget and/or is a good price, there's no reason to not consider this brand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AD9S9HD8A4I8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011AF5OG8#wasThisHelpful","R2AD9S9HD8A4I8","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its expensive, even overpriced for the amount, but its a good mix of natural oils, so I can't fault the product in the least. You could of course just use Olive Oil and have similar effects for a cheaper price, but you'd have to do a bit of legwork or have a rich stock of oils to duplicate this formula.You can use this anywhere, doesn't have to be for a beard since again, its just a bunch of vegetable oils. If you suffer from dry skin or hair, you can use this after taking a shower since your natural oils will have been stripped by soaps and warm water. Or you can use lotion, which is likely even cheaper but not as ""natural"". Keep in mind even as a ""natural"" product, people can still have reactions to it, but its a good option to try since natural sources of oil tend to be less problematic than certain chemicals used in lotions and creams (also note that oils can clog pores if you're already naturally oily, I wouldn't use oils, but this is for dry-skin sufferers to try).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XVVJT97QBV60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UEN9ECI#wasThisHelpful","R2XVVJT97QBV60","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, this light has great spectrum, it absolutely works for plant growth, but this is a VERY focused beam. Light intensity decreases exponentially the further away it gets, so you really don't want this more than 3 inches from your plant, which leaves around a 3 inch spread. For many plants, this means it basically will get at most two leaves in a canopy, and you'll get very upright growth with no spread depending upon the plant.This bulb is ideal for a sprouting, cutting, or very small and/or immature plant, but if you're looking to grow or over-winter most plants, you'll need something with far more power and spread.The light is still working great almost a year later, however, when you unscrew it from the light fixture, the top of the bulb comes unscrewed on mine at least. So, rather cheap materials, but hey, it's still functional and works great for bringing a cutting to a teenager when used alongside foil. I do DWC, and also take my own cuttings, so I use this as an intermediate when my adult plants are still flowering, and my cuttings are getting a little antsy to get out of their dome, I pop them in a bucket with basket lid, have a clamp light with this LED ove the plant and surround the plant with that reflective bubble wrap insulation, works very nicely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HLV0W67EEWQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEC4U0E#wasThisHelpful","R2HLV0W67EEWQB","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works as advertised, feels of pretty good quality overall. The wire gauge and jacket could stand to be a little thicker, but I have it crossing power cables (perpendicular, of course) with no noticeable interference over a 20' run so that's a fairly good sign of proper shielding. I'm using this cable for a LFE subwoofer but the fidelity seems fine even with bass-heavy music. I'm also used to heavy-duty A/V cables since I work with A/V equipment, but this is an good consumer product at a good price. Unless you're looking for a mobile cord (as in, heavy duty jacket for A/V equipment that will get knocked around a lot), there's really no reason to spend more than this, you're getting OFC wire with seemingly good shielding (important if running near power cords), gold-plated connectors (doesn't matter much to connectivity but prevents oxidation), and seemingly well connected connectors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UB9GFTVZ9SIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RXNUW28#wasThisHelpful","R2UB9GFTVZ9SIR","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far so good, I haven't had it installed for too long, but I'm the type who will come back and alter a review if it ever leaves me less than satisfactory down the line, but I can't speak for longevity yet.However, the Joy Bidet was very easy to install, just turn off the water to the toilet, connect the T to the toilet tank, connect the hose from the wall (water source for the toilet), and connect the hose to the bidet, reinstall the seat, turn back on the water, and you're done. No plumbing experience required, these bidets are very simple to install, although I would recommend a crescent wrench for installation of the pipes (don't over-tighten and crack the plastic parts though) and a screwdriver for the toilet seat. The only somewhat difficult part was putting the toilet seat back on while getting it aligned properly, but that could very well have just been how our toilet was designed.The bidet itself works very well, the pressure is perfect for our house; in comparison, we also have a Luxe Neo 180 bidet, and the pressure on that thing is crazy, you have to be very careful not to hurt your button back there. The advantages the Neo 180 has are that it looks a little nicer, and has a ""woman"" nozzle as well which is directed slightly more forward (as a side note, this is also advantageous for guys who get sweaty down there, a little awkward to use but it works). The Joy Bidet's really only flaw is that it looks rather clinical. Not really a deal breaker, just would look nicer with some nicer printed text and maybe a chrome knob or something like the Luxe, but we'll make do where we're making doodoo.This was a steal for the price, and for those who haven't used one before, this is not only more sanitary, it also lessens the amount of paper waste. You still use TP to pat dry afterwards, but trust me guests are often intrigued and enthused by it, not at all weirded out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BBCZKH8DA8RR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043D3ANE#wasThisHelpful","R3BBCZKH8DA8RR","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved everything about these bulbs, but they are apparently very cheaply made. One is still going strong, but the other has developed a very rapid and annoying flicker while on (meaning it lights up and shuts off very rapidly when it should just be on). Have tried in another fixture that works fine with the other bulb, so I know its the bulb itself. There's not much else to be said about these; they work, they had a fair and even amount of light, it just looks like there's a 50/50 chance of them working properly, hence the 50/50 on my rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3661NTB8RISSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GYP8LQ0#wasThisHelpful","R3661NTB8RISSX","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've purchased and installed two of these wall mounts, they work fantastic and are worth every penny. The primary reason for installing the mounts was to free up shelf space for center channel speakers, but an added benefit is this also secures them to the wall for earthquake-safety reasons (living in California, everything should be earthquake prepped).Installation is a breeze for those with handy-man/DIY experience. For those without said experience, this is still a rather easy project to tackle, but I'd say two people should be utilized if you are inexperience (so someone can hold the mount while being fastened, and so you can have a helper to load up the TV on the bracket). Both mounts were installed by myself, since I've done this a few times, the last one I purchased took approximately 5 minutes to put up. The only real difficulty comes from making sure the TV/mount are in the spots you want them to be. I'd rather make sure to just hit the studs and adjust furniture accordingly, but if you need to install between studs, the standard procedure is to install a sheet of plywood to the wall that is fastened to the studs, then install the mount on the plywood.The hardware included might not be the greatest, but I've had zero issues with it so far. These mounts are pretty darn secure, I'd feel safe with pretty much any TV being mounted with these. I have a 42"" plasma and a 55"" LCD mounted with these ones (I also have other mounts, usually its either Cheetah or VideoSecu, both are solid brands of comparable quality, get whatever is cheapest with the desired features). The dual-arm or articulating mounts are much better for actually swiveling a monitor or TV around, its a nice smooth motion (the one-arm mounts usually need to be 'locked' for them to not be wobbly, which means they don't swivel easily).I'm sure the more expensive mounts have cool features and all, but ultimately, this does everything I need in a mount: its solid, swivels nice and smooth, and was fairly easy to install, not much more I can ask for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W0X5OTVYV7OQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MYQTEI#wasThisHelpful","R1W0X5OTVYV7OQ","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is the flavor good? Yes. Is it worth even remotely close to the cost they are charging? I'm afraid not. I suppose if you're a complete jerky snob then maybe the extra cost is worth it, but since I wasn't paying attention when I ordered (my fault, just ordered it when it was on sale), I didn't see this is only a 2oz bag. The entire package is 200 calories, that's how small amount you are getting. If you can find Alien Fresh Jerky local, then I'd recommend that over this, as the cost/flavor ratio is far more reasonable (and it is pretty good jerky as well).

"Excellent product, as others have said, nice metal build, very high quality. The bracket gives this the option to either be hung, or attached to wood via screws (not included). I currently have the Back to Roots AquaFarm to grow herbs in it, and sunlight through the window just wasn't cutting it. So I got this light which I have screwed into the wall, approx 6 or 7 inches above the aquafarm. I have plenty of plants thriving, although this light could stand to be brighter (its plenty bright for its rated capacity, but keep in mind if growing multiple plants they will want even more light). This LED flood light is also nice because it disperses the light better than most LED grow bulbs.For those new to using LEDs for growing, this light should be plenty for starting sprouts or growing herbs, and it should be adequate for a lone larger plant, but don't think you can get one 20W LED grow lamp and suddenly stick 3-4 tomato plants under it and expect them to thrive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UAI17VPPVMUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KL8OW0U#wasThisHelpful","R2UAI17VPPVMUI","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I never got a chance to use the California Blade or whatever it is others are talking about, so I can only compare my experience with this blade to my previous methods of drying the car. I've gotta say, it's not perfect, but I fully endorse every person who washes their car to keep this in their 'toolbox'. In fact, it's worked so well, I have two, one to keep in both my cars!So let me explain about the product first: it's merely a 1/4"" silicone 'blade' on a plastic handle, and works similar to any other squeegee like you've used at any gas station. But, this one is designed for the entire vehicle, hence the thicker and longer blade. And it works really well for the most part; its only flaw comes with curves and uneven surfaces, which most cars are bound to have. But think about it, on those large flat surfaces, do you not get a lot of water buildup? Does this not require an annoying amount of towels or chamois to dry? Well, one method for those who wash their cars at home is to use the squeegee as much as they can, then go back over with a microfiber towel (recommended Meguiars microfiber towel)Now, for how I use it is slightly different than most, but I think it's a good method and others might appreciate. Here in CA, water is somewhat of a big deal, so I don't really wash my car at home as much as I used to. But, I commute a lot, so my car looks like garbage within a few days (I also live near fields, so my car is constantly caked with dust and bugs). So, I use a DIY car-wash place that recycles the water, and I do this every week on both vehicles. Paying for car-washes would be quite expensive, but I only pay $2.50 each time, doing soap, clear-coat protectant, rinse, and spot-free rinse. It's super helpful to find a spot-free rinse. But 'spot-free' is only mostly-spot free (it still makes a huge difference though, we have such hard water in our area). I then use this wiper-blade to remove the excess water, and then touch up slightly with the microfiber towel on certain spots. Because the towel only gets slightly damp and not soaked, I don't have to worry about washing/drying it all the time. The Wiper Blade is silicone/plastic, so there is no cleaning or drying! Just use your finger to remove excess water, and its dry! Then I keep both in the back of the trunk, ready to use for next week. Our cars look great and clean (most) all the time, our cars are protected (wipers also are less prone to scratch your coat on your vehicle), and we're helping to conserve water at the same time. Obviously you'll still need to apply wax/detailers/etc at some point, but most quick-detailers should give good results with a quick spray through after each wash, and then waxing only needs to be done on a semi-annual basis, and this regimen works well for those who aren't super into detailing their vehicles, but still want it to look nice and clean on a regular basis, on the cheap I might add.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VT3IRT9HN7DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00439QDZK#wasThisHelpful","R2VT3IRT9HN7DN","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me say the pros about these bulbs:+Affordable+Look goodThe cons:-Takes 1 second to turn on after flipping switch-Bad CRI, definite green hueOK, so basically, the bulbs look excellent in our fixture; I had recently installed a face-down fixture in our bathroom to replace the ugly track-of-bulbs builder grade garbage. Since I put in a nice new fixture, the curly-q CFLs looked noticeably more ugly sticking out of the half-globes. So I decided to look into a bulb that looked better, and these absolutely hit the spot, they look great in the fixture. They were also an excellent price for LEDs (although energy-wise, about on par with the CFLs they replaced).On the negatives, they aren't 'instant-on', and this is in two different fixtures on different parts of the house that worked fine with CFLs and incadescents, but they take about a second after flicking the switch to turn on. Figured I'd mention it since that was a huge gripe about CFLs originally (which have come a long way). The other major negative is the CRI isn't listed that I can see anywhere on the packaging, but it's gotta be very poor. They put out a noticeable green hue, I think it looks gross. I can deal with excess blue, and excess yellow is common in CFLs, but the two combined to make the excess green hue just looks gross to me. I've asked others and they don't seem to mind it, so I know its just me being a picky-pants, but still, I couldn't stand to light up something important like a living space with this color.So for a guest bathroom and a rarely-used office hanging lamp, they will do, but I'm unsure if I will order more or not when I replace our master-bath fixture. The bulb shape is excellent, obviously its very lare so you must have an accomodating fixture, but for the fixture it went in they look great. Just wish the color output and turn-on speeds were a little better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P5CIHZN33W82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EK6L446#wasThisHelpful","R2P5CIHZN33W82","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't my first USB stick drive, but I've gotta say I'm pretty impressed with the case design on this guy. Most of the USB sticks I've had tend to have either rubber or plastic casing, making them prone to damage if you're like me who uses them very frequently and also uses them with their daily key set.I've found no flaws with this case design, fits beautifully on a keyring, is quite small (without being 'tiny' to easily lose), and seems very durable.The only 'issue' is the write speed is quite low; I saw one review state they were getting 15mb/s transfer speeds, but in my real-world usage, it seems to average just above 7mb/s transfer speeds. Still acceptable, especially for my usage of this particular device, but it quite a step back when I go from my speedy USB 3.0 sticks with their 70+ transfer speeds to go to something with a tenth of the speed. I use this particular device in my cars to store music on (wanted something with a durable keyring so I could hookup a 'quick connect' to it, as I alternate between vehicles throughout the week to spread the wear and tear on vehicles). So, it sucks when I need to load it up completely with the full 30GB of music, as that is a little slow (approx 20 min or so), but otherwise it's worked fantastic. For this one, durability was far more important then speed, and it's been excellent in that regard.If you want speeds, look into the USB 3.0 sticks, they put 2.0 to shame. Also, it seems other brands have copied this design, so I guess just look for the one that's cheapest, but you won't go wrong with this one, and it's at a pretty affordable price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN0LVX1HPHB1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A35WYBA#wasThisHelpful","RN0LVX1HPHB1D","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got these at a great price, currently just have a 40 and 25-pounder, will likely order lower weights for my wife (will be price-comparing to local stores for the smaller ones though).They are solidly made, good size, not really any negatives that I can list. I had no chipping on mine, nor stickers or anything that won't come off, mine just had a tag with the little zip-tie type things on them, so I think many of the complaints others had are probably being rectified.Mine was also shipped in a box within a box, the outer box was ripped to shreds but the inside box containing the actual product was great.These are solid cast-iron, the only thing that can really happen to them is the paint can chip off (they can also break your stuff, but that's user error). Thus, the only improvement I would say would have been nice to have seen is to have moreso a vinyl/rubber coating on them, as the paint is just a high-gloss enamel that does nothing other than appearance. Its slightly slippery, but being that I do intentionally rotate them in my hands I think it's a good amount of slickness to them. I think these are great and love the price that I paid for 'em, just kinda keep your eye out for when they go on sale and you should get a great deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16IT9MHKPVBQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003J9HKYI#wasThisHelpful","R16IT9MHKPVBQB","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't going to be a popular stance here as this set for some reason has a solid 5 stars, but man this is the biggest joke in the Naruto series. Now, if you're like me you'll still watch them, but first off what is with this Scooby-Doo nonsense going on? Seriously, the plot of the first storyline is straight out of an episode of Scooby-Doo, complete with masked mystery men and hologram projectors to scare off those ""meddling kids"". I mean this is just insulting, as the rest of the Naruto series definitely tip-toed that line between being an adult anime, but this is a straight saturday-morning kids show. Seriously, Kakashi friggin stands there and has some weak ninja throw stars at his back, doesn't even attempt to evade them, and then Naruto just runs past enemies and they somehow all fall down defeated? Just...wow, what a joke. Sloppy animation, poor storylines, zero character development, and Naruto's voice-actor (English) got very sloppy here as well. The other voice actors were still spot-on, just no real amazing dialogue scripted for them.And the case is still in the cruddy box set that is very easy to have damaged in shipping with no extras. So yeah, even if its not popular I'm going to rate this as I really feel, which is that it is merely OK.

"Having purchased this on a lightning deal, I can say that this product's strongest assest is its cheapness. Unfortunately, that's really its only strength.This product does not mix well at-all; I have to use a blender bottle just to mix the stuff, attempting to mix it with a spoon leaves half of it sitting on top of the water or in clumps.The flavor is overly fake-sweet. The fruit punch even smells somewhat like licorace, but then tastes like cotton candy gone bad.I don't really ""feel"" much after taking this product. Well, my stomach makes some grumbles (no cramping or anything really negative though) but thats about it.All of this is in contrast to C4, which I do now strongly recommend after seeing what its competitors are like. I hated the cost of C4, so figured I'd look at an alternative; don't get me wrong, its better than nothing if you really really don't want to spring for something better, but I can only give this an unenthusiastic recommendation. I personally can't wait until its gone, I will be sticking with C4 unless I find a better alternative.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRSWNDS8B8MPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DGM42O#wasThisHelpful","RRSWNDS8B8MPE","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, for those who don't know much about the show, Naruto obviously follows the story of a young ninja-in-traning named Naruto. But, the show is much more than that and follows closely the lives around him as well, all fellow ninja and ninja in training, in a time/world where ninja are the primary military power for the neighboring villages.The show starts off a little quirky, and of course has its usual anime quirks, but has some of the greatest character and plot development I've ever seen. The tip-toe the line as the themes and issues dealt with are often very adult, but also encapsulates it and presents it in a manner that makes it ok for most ages. At times the show can be filled too heavily with filler, simliar to Dragonball Z, but I would also say most of the time keeps a pretty decent pace aside from a few tangent storylines. Overall though, I'm friggin addicted to this show, and once you get halfway through the first season it really begins to build up immensely. Vol 2 is amazing, but still Vol 1 I think is necessary to build up to it and begin the journey.The price is pretty excellent; I'd love for there to be a better 'normal' way to watch these dubbed, but hulu only has subbed, so the DVDs are the best method (there are of course websites, but many have bad quality). You get a heck of a lot of episodes for the price, although you'll find you end up addicted so when all is said and done be prepaired to dish out some dough!The biggest letdown is the packaging. Its nothing special, and that I'm A-OK with. However, two of the boxsets were in bad shape, one of which I had to return. And yes some of that is shipping, but it's also just really really really cheap boxes. The discs even seem more like a cheap DVD printer than a high-quality production. I mean the content's perfect quality so no worries there, but Viz obviously got a super-cheap company to produce these DVDs. But Amazon's great with returns so if you do get a busted one like I did, just make sure to exchange it. They work perfectly fine for normal usage, they just aren't super quality for shipping or constant usage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KUFCJ30J63Q1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HW5G2Q#wasThisHelpful","R1KUFCJ30J63Q1","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember when I got this years back from my parents; I'm always into the latest gizmos and whatnot, so I thought this was more or less a joke. I was appreciative of the gift of course, but never thought I'd seriously use it. However, after several frustrating moments with several electronic studfinders, I finally pulled this little guy out of my bag. Within seconds I had what I needed; the magnet's so powerful it stuck to the wall hands-free so I could very easily mark the location. This is now my go-to studfinder.And the built-in level is far more handy than you'd think.Normally I'd give far lengthier reviews, but there's really nothing else that can be said about this. It works with very strong magnets. There's no batteries or electronic components to go bad. It's insanely durable. And it just works.

"***Update 12-15-2013***I try to keep up with my reviews, and I'm not above correcting any previous remarks should my opinion change. I've added a star, as the pump seems to have gotten quieter and is now quieter than the Keurig we also still have. We are thinking that we will keep the Tassimo and return the Keurig, as the Tassimo does make good specialty drinks, almost coffee-house grade, so it's nice for a weekend treat as they are still quite expensive. I still recommend and will continue to use our Senseo machine, not only is it smaller/quicker/quieter, the cost per cup is by far the cheapest of the bunch, and if you only want coffee it's a great way to go. The big hangup for us is the senseo doesn't create a bunch of trash where both the Keurig and Tassimo do. If you want cappuccinos and other espresso drinks, the Tassimo's the way to go. And just a hint, this is a great item to use coupons that a certain BB&B store gives out regularly...****This isn't going to be a popular review, but I'm not sure why on earth the other reviews are so generous to this machine. This is a real review, and no this isn't complaining about it breaking down, this machine is just really not that great for the reasons I will go over within.So to start off, we purchased the Tassimo T20 on sale for black friday, and we got a great deal on it, much lower than the current asking price. We purchased some Gevalia Carmel Macchiatto coffee from the same store (BB&B) and took it home to try it out. We currently have a cheapie $15 Hamilton Beach Senseo machine and figured this would be a significant upgrade since I had always liked Keurig since trying them out years ago.So first impressions, the machine feels fairly solid, the snap lid feels sturdy, all good there. However, some immediate issues I didn't care for: bad instruction manual on super cheap/raggedy paper that was hard to read (you're going to burn through massive plastic containers, don't try to act like you care about the environment using cruddy paper), and within it says DO NOT use vinegar to descale the machine and you must buy a special cleaner from Bosch. The Keurig we eventually also purchased to compare said specifically to use vinegar, guess which method is cheaper? We've used vinegar in our Senseo, not that it even has a scaling issue like these other machines do (I'll go more into this as well later).OK, so those are minor/petty issues admittedly, so long as the machine works great we're all good, right? OK, first, the Tassimo is the LOUDEST machine we have in our house short of our washing machine when it gets off-balance. It literally shakes the entire counter and causes our dogs to bark with how loud the pump is (and concerns me if they're using such a poor quality pump how long it will last). The Keurig is also loud, but still quieter than the Tassimo T20 by far (the senseo being a drip machine is completely silent...).Next up was loading the machine: it's not rocket science, pretty straight forward, but has way too many steps surrounding the machine beyond simply loading the machine. See, you can only load a disc when the light is on orange, again straight-forward. However, it has a mind of its own on when it wants to go back into standby mode. It regularly sits on the green-coffee symbol, and after brewing it has some ridiculous ""manual"" mode where you like hold the button or press it repeatedly for extra water I guess (I really just wanted a normal cup of coffee at this point...). The symbols also don't make sense in my opinion, green tends to mean ""ready to go"" as in the time you mess with the machine, not ""don't touch, but we're green lighted"". They really need to reverse the symbols, have a ""red"" for when it's brewing and green when it's ready to be handled.OK, absurd little light symbols aside, at least loading the machine isn't difficult. Oh, but the pack you bought is mostly little milk containers for some reason? Yeah, so you put those in first (or whatever the specific ""recipe"" calls for), and then you get to wait like 30+ seconds after its down doing a glorified frothing of milk to finally have the machine go back into the orange so you can open the top to finally put in the coffee disc. Finally, you have your coffee.Admittedly, it does a decent job of brewing. But you know what else does a decent job of brewing with less confusion and takes about the same amount of time? A friggin espresso machine (which we also have). And the espresso machine isn't going to cost you $1.50/cup either.Look, the machine brews a decent cup of coffee or espresso, that much I can admit to. However, I just think the darn thing is radically impractical, obnoxiously loud, and ridiculously expensive on a per-cup basis. If you want normal good coffee, the Senseo still wins our heart which is surprising as it's a cheap piece of junk, but it also takes up no counter space, is so easy to use a child could do it, and takes less than 30 seconds to brew a cup with no wacky prep or maintenance. If you want variety, the Keurig wins although it's pricey, but the k-cups are significantly cheaper (although not quite as good as the Tassimo, admittedly). If you want espresso and good coffee, save your money for a real espresso machine. With the amount of learning it takes to utilize the Tassimo you can learn a basic espresso recipe such as a carmel machiatto, and you won't be paying a heavy premium for frothed milk either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CDS7GW22VAHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OQF5YE#wasThisHelpful","R1CDS7GW22VAHO","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first Brother printer; I've been wanting to try out the Brother brand for a while, as they've made decent and reliable small business printers for years (at least as far as I know of them). It seems they're really pushing into the consumer territory, and with the major manufacturers (HP, Canon, etc) all having their various failings, now might be the best time to switch to a different brand.Overall, let me just summarize at the top that this printer is functional, does everything it should quite well, except the print quality is pretty mediocre and the plastic paneling is very very cheap.Now, that may sound like I'm unimpressed with the printer, but that would be wrong. I think the cheap paneling isn't that big a deal so long as you treat it with care, just don't go and plop something heavy on top or else you'll probably obliterate the thing. My previous printer was a Canon MX700, and the plastic was very thick on it and the printer lasted for years (but scanned pretty poor quality). I don't have kids or anything that might break the printer so I'm not too worried, and for a personal printer it should be fine, I just wouldn't have it necessarily as a printer for a whole small office due to its brittleness.The print quality gets the job done, but I wouldn't expect even high quality prints of documents (that are meant to show to prospective clients for example) and certainly wouldn't even attempt photo printing. But, if you need high quality color documents, FedEx Office/Kinkos/etc are always there, and WalMart/Costco will print photos that will blow away all but the highest end printers (which would cost thousands, I know I used to work for Costco's photolab and now work in digital media). In fact, the printing of this machine reminds me of the old color dot-matrix printers (even makes that irritating ""rrreerrr"" noise as the print head moves back and forth). Speaking of noise, its pretty quite, but does make that high-pitch noise as the print head moves around, but its pretty muffled and certainly acceptable.Other pros of the machine include its rich feature set (duplexing, ADF, wireless, etc). The wireless worked easy for me; I did have to install software from the CD and it installed some irritating taskbar software with popups for updating (didn't remember seeing that listed through the install prompts). I like the paper tray being within the machine in the front instead of paper sticking out the back like many consumer machines, and the print cartridges are really easy to replace as the door is located in the front of the machine (no having to prop up the lid to change cartridges).Like I said, the cons aren't really a big deal nor a deal breaker, just don't expect this to be a shared frequent-use high-quality printer. It fits its niche quite well, and for all of its cheapness it seems intelligently designed (like my Civic, cheap parts but also designed to run forever). I'm satisfied with it for the price, and have no problems recommending it to people needing a cheap all-in-one printer for their personal use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JBUM57EISARK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EANURCE#wasThisHelpful","R1JBUM57EISARK","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's only one flaw with this case, and that is the primary case doesn't cover the top or the bottom of the phone. If you primarily use the holster this may not be a problem, and even if you don't use the holster it may still not be a problem, but figured I'd point out it's one flaw. I know it's a flaw because that's how I've broken my phone previously; while gorilla glass is very strong and scratch resistant, it is still glass and is prone to shattering if dropped in the right way. The rubber cases actually provide better protection in my opinion than the hard shells because of this: they absorb more of the impact.So, that's the one major flaw, but I don't think it needs to be a deal breaker, and I still love the case overall.The kickstand can be a little tough to pull out, particularly if you have weak fingernails, but if you work it one side at a time it pops out without too much difficulty. The kickstand itself has been great, and the primary reason I purchased this case (I actually didn't care about the holster). The kickstand works well in either portrait or landscape mode.The holster is a lot better than I thought, and is actually one of the best holster-designs I've ever used! it slides in and out smooth as butter, yet isn't so loose that it will fly out on it's own. The clip mechanism is easy to operate and has a spring; I've used holsters without a spring mechanism and they can be tough to actually clip onto a belt or pocket. The holster also protects the front of the phone completely, and is inlaid with a felt material.The case fits everything well, has holes in all the necessary locations, is a snap to install or remove, and (since I jog with my phone in my hand) reduces the likelihood of hitting the volume buttons accidentally without impeding your ability to push them when you want to.Overall, a great bargain for the $6 or so price most sellers are asking for! Certainly feels like a case you'd pay $30 at Verizon for!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DPTHNJTR279D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ASGPTQ6#wasThisHelpful","R1DPTHNJTR279D","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Butter Chicken Curry by Kitchens of India is one of their best tasting products (many are really good however) in my opinion. The paste is easy to work with, but there in lies what I think is the best opportunity: because this is just a paste, you are also free to modify and create your own recipes as well! If you want to add coconut milk, go for it!The way I personally cook is to first marinade the chicken in oil and lime (so it gets broken down), then cut and flash grill it on a cast-iron grill pan while sprinkling curry powder on top, then toss it into a pot to simmer with this spice packet, and while that's simmering I also grill onions, garlic, bell peppers, and some either jalapeno and/or red pepper which I also dust with curry powder, and then I add them to the pot. Finally I let everything simmer for a few minutes, then serve and it is spicy and delicious (if you want it slightly less spicy forget the hot peppers). This not only stretches the dish, it also stretches the amount of sodium (it is rather high in sodium) across bigger portions, and also adds tons of vegetables.I love this paste though, I can make dishes that taste better than many of the local Indian restaurants (too many just toss in the chicken and cook quickly, it gets rubbery cooked that way).So overall the spice packet is great for making various kinds of curries (including the traditional butter chicken curry), it does have some heat on it's own, but do watch out for the sodium in these packets. Also, enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16VZLN38RDIFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V17MLS#wasThisHelpful","R16VZLN38RDIFY","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So first, I'm not really a tea fan, but the Yogi Green Tea Rejuvenation has a pretty decent flavor in my opinion, and my wife who actually likes tea really liked this flavor. In comparison, we had originally ordered Lipton Green Tea Bags, Superfruit Purple Acai with Blueberry, 20-Count,  Boxes (Pack of 6) since it had a 20% coupon, and even at the reduced price there's no way I would recommend it. I was shocked at how little tea was actually in each packet for starters, two bags couldn't even flavor an 8ounce cup!So, I looked around, and liked Yogi's response to a critic's claims, they have organic tea leaves and that's a big deal to me; I like to purchse organic produce when possible, but didn't even make the connection that they might be spraying down their originating plants (Camellia sinensis). After receiving my order, I really think we made the right choice.The tea bags where stuffed pretty full, having almost 3x as many tea leaves in each bag as the Lipton bags, so that alone makes the slightly higher price justified. Each bag is plenty for a small cup. The flavor is pretty good, like I said I'm not a tea person, it's almost like it needs a squirt of orange or something, but still a little dab of honey I'm certainly OK with it. The tea is fairly mild and smooth, but not in a watery/unflavored sort of way like the Lipton tea.So, I strongly recommend this brand, I look forward to trying out other flavors but as for now this will certainly be my mid-afternoon tea; the caffeine amount is perfect so I can go work out, but not so much that it keeps me up at night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N8ZKJDO3PG1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CMD64S#wasThisHelpful","R3N8ZKJDO3PG1K","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So to give up a soda addiction, I've recently switched to teas. I'm not really a big tea fan, but having tried a few Tazo teas with just a bit of honey or sugar added I was growing to somewhat like it. When I saw this Lipton tea had a coupon, I decided to go for it, since I like Green Tea anyways.Well, this is just disappointing. First, the packets contain a very very small amount of leaves, as in around 1/8 of the bag was filled with leaves. Second, they don't really have any smell, and even just making a small (around 7oz) cup with two bags still barely had any flavor. And worse, the flavor that was there was kinda disgusting. I tasted like a hint of minty-like flavor with some bitter...I don't know, trash-water flavor? I mean seriously, it was just gross. I've tried it on multiple occassions, and my wife who likes tea a lot more than me commented on how flavorless it was.Will not be buying Lipton again if this is what they've become; Tazo may be overpriced but I've never had an experience with them like I have with this tea.This is one of the very few one-stars I've ever given, but I really feel this deserves it. It's cheap, but even for cheap it's still not worth it.***Update 8/27/13***So we decided to try Yogi Green Tea Rejuvenation, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6), and while it is a little more expensive, each individual bag had more than double the filling of tea leaves, in fact closer to triple the amount, meaning only one bag is actually needed for a normal sized cup. Plus, it tastes much much better. We contacted Lipton about this flavor, and never received a response, I guess they're OK with trash-flavored tea with their name on it. We won't be trying Lipton products after this fiasco, this stuff just gives me nightmares thinking about, it really was that bad.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23Q52JA8W4SK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YJCAKI#wasThisHelpful","R23Q52JA8W4SK7","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure why Consumer Reports is getting so much flak in the reviews, because they still are a great starting point for many larger (and occasionally smaller) purchases. Of course you shouldn't ONLY trust Consumer Reports, but for things such as cars and appliances they are usually really good and thorough in their reviews and somewhere in their top selections lies a winner. Even when I bought my Civic previously, they ranked it high but for some reason stated the Ford Focus was the ""car to buy"" at that price point; still, if you actually read the reviews you can come to your own conclusions. They try to be objective, but choosing a ""best of"" tends to come down to subjective points and its up to you, as the consumer, to decide which factors are most important.Since my car purchase, I had unsubscribed from them for a few years (just didn't have any major purchases in the pipeline, so I didn't need it), but since re-subscribing I actually find their articles to be better written then previously. Like I said, you still need to make your own decisions, but if you follow most of their reviews and guidelines you'll at least land in the general vacinity of what you need and avoid some major catastrophes as well. And yes, I'm quite technically savvy, and use this as a starting point, but if you aren't savvy you'll be far better off going with a CR recommendation then you will over just believing what advertisers promote.And yes a PC magazine might be better at reviewing PCs, but again, as somewhat who works as a computer tech for major organization, they're pretty darn biased as well (my personal recommendation is that the brands don't mean anything unless you're a major organization with a service plan, they're all made with the same parts produced in the same factories; best to look up specific models and read reviews on Newegg or Amazon instead and take those with a grain of salt).Anyways, I recommend Consumer Reports, but I do wish they were slightly cheaper to subscribe to. I also will state that, as someone who watches a lot of TV, I appreciate many of their articles on ""As Seen on TV"" products, since I'm often curious (most are garbage, but every once in a while something decent comes along).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZRO9AUN37603/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005N7PH#wasThisHelpful","R2ZRO9AUN37603","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On my android phone, I use Hide It Pro, and it works beautifully; the application name is ""hidden"" by calling itself ""audio manager"", and hiding files is quick and easy. The same application is available for Kindle Fire, but it doesn't work quite the same way as it does on my phone. If you only have a very small amount of files (like 2 or 3) you wish to hide, it may be better, but each file needs to be ""sent"" so it takes like 7 button presses and a little bit of wait for every single file. I also tried another file hiding application (File Hide Expert), and that also didn't work as I wanted.This application, Smart Gallery, isn't perfect by any means, but you can tell its got a good foundation and does what it should for the most part. Hiding an entire folder is easy to do, there are options for changing the password type (swype or pass code) and it is quick and doesn't seem to be glitchy like the other apps on Kindle Fire were. The developer has also added some ""how to"" notes for each page, and it's not terribly complicated to use either. There is some clunkiness however; the password doesn't prompt you to set it up/change it, you have to go to settings yourself (top right corner), and the GUI isn't the best around either. That being said, I'd take a little bit of clunkiness for an app that doesn't seem to be as glitchy and actually functions as it should unlike the others I've tried. The only other thing I'd like is if it were to do like the ""Hide It Pro"" app and change its name/icon after installation and have a ""secret"" way to access it.I wouldn't hide like sensitive info with this obviously, just trying to make it so if I pass around my K Fire people don't see EVERYTHING I have; kinda lame the K Fire doesn't allow a little more customization, but at least I found an app that works good enough in the meantime!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJV5WT7SV0XMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BA82FB8#wasThisHelpful","RJV5WT7SV0XMC","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally I had a little Fender amp, I believe it's the Fender Frontman 15g, for my practice amp. And it's not a bad amp or anything I suppose, but the sound was somewhat inconsistent, it had a lot of hum, and I just wasn't a fan of the sound. I've been out of practicing guitar, and while waiting around I stopped into a guitar center and passed by these amps with one of their salesmen playing it. On a whim, I listened and loved it, purchased it, brought it home, plugged it in, and am really liking it!This amp is larger than the Fender, but it's still a great practice-size amp unless you're in very cramped quarters. Its not super light where I'd lug it with me everywhere (unless that were my job of course), but that's to be expected for an amp like this. I've heard tons of smaller amps, but I really think this size is ideal for practicing on (just the dispersion alone seems better than a smaller amp, even though I play with the amp pretty low on the volume scale). This can also go fairly loud if needed.I do notice I have a little more hum than when I listened in-store, but that could easily be my guitar (Epiphone Les Paul '56 Gold Top), but it's certainly manageable on this amp (unlike the Fender, which I brought back out to compare). I've gotta say I also think this amp is pretty freaking cool to have the effects built-in! I'm not really an effects guy, despite having about 7 pedals; I think they're awesome, I just don't like having to bring them out and hook them up to just diddle for a few minutes on the guitar, so it's great to have them built-in! Huge time/hassle saver. And they sound pretty darn good too! Obviously not as versatile as a true pedal effect, but great for practicing.The only odd thing is the ""clean"" setting had effects enabled; even after doing a factory reset, they were enabled again, but I like that you can easily store your own settings. Just change to the settings you like, then hold down the button, and like setting a radio station in your car its stored instantly! I think that's pretty awesome, but I'm used to old-school amps I suppose. But anyways, it's nice to instantly switch between clean settings, crunchy settings, to heavy distortion settings just by pushing a button. Playing clean on this amp (which is what I do most often) sound amazing, it has great clarity; just plucking a few strings sounds like music coming from this little box, it's pretty cool. It does take a little getting used to with the effects and the knobs, but once you spend a few minutes, look a few things up in the manual or online, it's actually rather straight-forward.I don't regret the purchase in the least, this little amp is impressive and well-worth the asking price IMO. It's actually made pulling out my guitar and practicing a fun experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30H7JLC7Z7R7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GYWBIM#wasThisHelpful","R30H7JLC7Z7R7R","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't order these online, as the Meeks near me had this for $6 and couldn't pass them up since I lose almost as many pruners as I break. They looked solid in the packaging, and after testing them out, I've gotta say that out of the package they're one of the best pruners I've ever owned. Everything is solid/heavy-duty, short of the brands that cost 3-5x as much. The pruners are sharp, and have a lot of metal in the head. That also makes them slightly heavier then say Fiskars. I'd recommend a Fiskars product if you suffer from something like arthritis, but the nice thing about these Bond pruners is they cut through thick woody specimens with ease. Those who deal with Wisteria in a sunny climate know it can be rather invasive, but I can easily cut through multiple shoots at a time to keep it in check. The blade is sharp, and the spring is nice and strong. I also like the pouch and haven't had an issue with them tearing, although I mostly just use my pant pocket anyways.Compared to the Corona, Fiskars, and various other cheapies I've purchased lately, these Bond pruners are far superior. The comparable Coronas look like they'd be as good, but I bought their 5/8"" pruners which were garbage (broke right out of the package, company never replied either).The only potential downside I see is that they are made in China, which likely means Chinese steel, which also means it may be more prone to rust (tends to have higher impurities). Basically that just means wipe 'em down after use and don't leave sitting outside for them to get wet; who knows, they could be fairly rust-resistant, but that seems to be a common problem with Chinese imported hand tools. I have no problem with them and bring them inside anyways (otherwise I'll misplace them and lose them).  The other minor issue is occasionally the locking mechanism seems to get in the way if you go snipping away blindly (probably because I use them more like hedge trimmers than delicate pruners). They have a noticeable amount of grease on them (good thing), so I'd say you should probably grease them yearly to keep them nice and springy. I have noticed they don't hold an edge all that great either; still good for cutting thick stiff branches, but takes some work on other items (or just needs to be sharpened).These are just plain clippers that work very well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7POU3CV18E2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I1PJD4#wasThisHelpful","R7POU3CV18E2W","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I just received my pair today hoping this would be better quality than my other tools. My other pruners include Fiskars, Avon, and various other cheapies. I figured this time I'd buy something a little bit higher in quality, but still didn't want to break the bank. Can't say I'm impressed however.I opened up the box, and yeah, nothing special, which is exactly what I was wanting. Just a standard workhorse set of pruners. I take them outside, and with the first few snips the spring mechanism was already not working properly (I had to ""assist"" it to get it to spring back). So I snip a few more branches, all around 1/4"" or so in diameter. Now the spring mechanism is busted completely, and the locking mechanism is no longer working properly either.So, I guess I just got a bad pair, but for it to break that quickly doesn't exactly send loads of confidence on the brand. I sent a message to Corona to see how they respond, and that'll be the deciding factor on whether I'll give them another chance or not.And yes, bought through Amazon directly, and they have the Corona engraving on the tool so unlikely it's a Chinese knock-off.***Update 4/19***So I haven't heard a response back from the company, so I've just decided to return it. I bought some cheap/small Fiskars instead, which the lock mechanism already detached for a minute, but was an easy fix and otherwise functions perfectly. So I guess I'll stick with them instead; I'm sure I just receieved a bad product, but I also never got a response from the company so I'd rather not deal with it. If you are going to buy the Corona Pruner, I'd recommend trying the 3/4"" instead of the 5/8"", the way the 5/8"" is designed seems to be more prone to errors.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y4ON2NYCMVR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BRBQJG#wasThisHelpful","R2Y4ON2NYCMVR4","A1FVN80HHHR3RA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FVN80HHHR3RA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't say how it happened, but within the past year and half these pantry moths had become one of the largest pests in our area. For anyone that has dealt with pantry moths, you know how annoying they can be when their population begins to explode.

"I have not even played the game yet, but feel compelled to write a review solely based on the delivery method of this game for PC users.  Although I understand that most applications are shifting to download method versus CD/DVD/BluRay, the fact is that it should be discounted when compared to the console versions that do come with a disc.

"I am actually surprised there are no other reviews for this product, because it's quite excellent.  Personally, I needed a pouch type case like this because I use a mount/holder in my car that's custom made for the Nexus 6 so it cannot have even a thin case on it or it will not fit.  What's nice about this case is that the screen is protected.  Most cases do not offer any protection for the screen at all.  The pull tab to get the phone out of the case is a nice system/feature.  The quality of the leather/stitching seems excellent -- I hope it lasts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J4KUPVZTF2NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HD74YO#wasThisHelpful","R2J4KUPVZTF2NM","AWHL379EE14K7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWHL379EE14K7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was pleasantly surprised about the differences in the item pictured and what was sent.The center glass piece is not connected with rubber tubing -- it's a solid piece of glass.  The only caveat to that change is that they didn't include a center pipe clamp.  I'm not terribly confident that the center pipe won't break because of that lack of support from a clamp, but it seems to be pretty sturdy.The base is also not a triangle -- it's a rectangle, which I feel will be a lot more sturdy.We are using this for my son's 8th grade science fair experiment.  We were just going to go with something homemade, but this will look sooooo much more ""professional"", and also put the focus more on the experiment rather than the apparatus used in the experiment.  I feel it will result in a better grade/score.  At first it seemed a little on the price side (even those others here on Amazon were significantly higher priced), but when you add up all the supplies, time spent finding, buying, and assembling it, it's actually probably the better deal.

"Original 2-star Review:The costume is actually pretty good, but unfortunately it arrived missing one of the two plastic hoops that make up the mouth and the one that was there was split/broken.  Of course, now it's too late to return this one and get a replacement that isn't broken, so I'm stuck paying full price and still having to rig something to make the costume usable for my child for Halloween.Incidentally, I'd recommend getting one of those green one-piece suits to wear underneath this as it doesn't come with a real shirt, gloves, pants, etc.  Basically it's just the pot and the mask, but it's still a great costume.So, costume is actually recommended, but the vendor, Blockbuster Costumes, I would steer clear from them.Edit:  So now that Halloween is over, I had to come back and report that this costume was a huge hit -- everyone loved it.  However, I have to take credit for a lot of that because I modified it rather significantly.  Like I stated above, mine did not come with a hoop in the lower jaw, so I added some plumbing tube from the hardware store and it worked great.  I also stitched the two jaws more together in the corner of the mouth which looked a lot better.  I also added a hoop of plumbing tube around the ""rim"" of the pot so it kept its shape a lot better and actually looked like a pot instead of skirt.  A green one-piece leotard was worn under it.  My son said it was a little difficult to see out of it, but I showed him how the face covering just velcro'ed in place, so he could uncover and recover his face as he wanted.Overall, great costume, but I'm still steamed that I had to pay full price for one that was broken and missing parts.  But the costume was such a success, that I decided not to have the costume take a hit because the seller has lousy quality control, so I changed the review to 5-stars, purely for the costume.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38EBN1OKZ2MIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QQ35L0#wasThisHelpful","R38EBN1OKZ2MIW","AWHL379EE14K7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWHL379EE14K7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent flood light for decorating during the holidays.  I'm currently using it for Halloween, uplighting a 15' tall ghoul, and setting it on dark purple or blue or even using the strobe function makes the Halloween decor look awesome.  I'm probably going to buy a second one for use at Christmas, so that the entire front of my house will be well lit. If you have a smaller house (or smaller front face to your house), you could easily get by with just one because it's very bright with a rather wide angle beam.It's probably bigger than you might be thinking it is.  In fact, it's huge.  I have laptop computers that are smaller.  I guess that can be good or bad depending on how you're using it.  I don't actually mind the size, but was surprised about how big it actually is.The remote works fairly well, but it has very limited range as others have said.I know this has been asked/answered several times, but there seems to still be conflicting answers -- it definitely retains the last settings in memory, even when powered off with a timer or just unplugging it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1604XQO5YJU58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHLIJP8#wasThisHelpful","R1604XQO5YJU58","AWHL379EE14K7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWHL379EE14K7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My family really likes this type of case for their iPads and Android tablets.  I usually buy the Poetic brand version of this style of case, but they haven't been holding up too well, ending up with the plastic corner pieces cracking/breaking, etc.  This Fintie version seems much more durable, as well as more form-fitting, completely covering and therefore protecting the edges.  The material it is made out of also cleans up better than the ""leather"" versions.  The autowake feature works very well, too.Just a word of warning -- this case is NOT going to really protect any tablet from accidental drops, even from a short height. After replacing the screen on my son's iPad 3x, I attempted to move him to a nerf style case to better protect the device from accidents, but those cases render the iPad almost unusable.  In the end, he went back to the case and he just needs to be more careful.

"First of all, I have to commend Bissell for even attempting a product like this.  Why?  Because of SUS (Stupid User Syndrome) that is typically rampant in both floor steamers and vacuum cleaners by themselves.  SUS is amplified x2 when combining these two products.  I don't understand why quite a few people here find direct manufacturer replies to these reviews as suspect.  I find it to be excellent customer service!If you read through the 1-star reviews, the majority of them say the Bissell Symphony worked perfectly the first few times/months they used it, but then it stopped performing well.  Guess what, people?  You have to maintain your housecleaning tools!  I own three different vacuum cleaners, two different steamers, one hard floor scrubber, and one carpet cleaner.  After every time that I use any of these, I thoroughly clean them.With my vacuums after each time that I use them I remove hair and debris from the power brushes, I wipe out the inside of the dirt cup with a wet paper towel, and generally clean the entire outside casing.  Every two or three times that I use the vacuums I clean the filters as directed in the operator's manual.  About every six months or so, I actually remove the hoses and run water through them to remove any built-up dust, and then allow to drip dry.  These are all things you must do or every vacuum is going to fail over time.  If you don't want to do this, then I suggest you revert back to a broom and dustpan, as they don't require any maintenance.  Have fun with that!With my steamers I only use distilled water.  The reason why stares at me every few months when I get a shower -- all of my shower heads in my house are crusty with mineral build-up because most city water is ridiculously hard.  You should be doing the same thing in all devices in your house that produce steam -- steam cleaners, steam mops, clothing steamers, irons, etc.  There's no place for those minerals to go when tap water is converted to steam, so it stays in the product and affects performance. Usually you can resolve this by running a cycle or two of diluted vinegar/water through it, but it's just better, easier, and usually cheaper or about the same price to simply use distilled water.  You should especially use distilled water when the manufacturer specifically recommends it.  Not doing that is, frankly, SUS (Stupid User Syndrome) and definitely not the fault of the product or manufacturer.Also, a lot of the complaints seem to be centered around cleaning up heavy messes.  This isn't a shop-vac or an industrial steam cleaner -- it's more of a regular, routine cleaning device.  If your home is really so filthy that this device cannot clean it, then you probably need to either clean more often or switch all you devices over to industrial/commercial models that are made for cleaning the apparent restaurant/hotel level of filth that you seem to be encountering.  I have pets, I have children, I have women in the house with long hair, and I've never encountered messes that my consumer home appliances couldn't clean or maintain.Now, all that being said, the Bissell Symphony works just fine for me, even after months of owning/using it.  Does it vacuum as well as my dedicated vacuum (Shark Rotator Liftaway Professional)?  No.  But even a Dyson vacuum doesn't clean as well as my Shark does, so I really didn't expect this product to either.  I expected it to clean as well or better than my Hoover Lynx cordless vacuum (which is an excellent cordless vacuum by the way), and it does do this.The Bissell Symphony does steam just as well as both of my other steam mops (if not actually better because the steam starts faster), and it is nice to not have to vacuum the whole floor first.  Admittedly, if I want my home to be as thoroughly clean as I can possibly get it (like I do once or twice per month), I vacuum the whole house with my dedicated vacuum and then steam mop all the hard floors with a dedicated steam mop.  However, between these ultra-thorough cleanings, the Bissell Symphony does an excellent job of maintenance cleaning, and because it's combo device, I can get it done in roughly half the time.  My time is valuable -- so it's nice for housecleaning to not take as long every time.  There are several problem areas in my home -- by the guinea pig cage, under the bar stools, and under the dining room table.  I usually hit those areas (and only those areas) with my Hoover Lynx cordless, and then just use the Bissell Symphony on the entire floor.I originally rated the Bissell Symphony 4/5 stars because I feel there is room for improvement on both the vacuum and steam mop sides.  I do feel that if this item was improved it would most likely cost a lot more than it does, so given the price/performance ratio, I feel this is overall a very good product to excellent product as-is, which would probably get it more like 4.5 stars, so I rounded up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VXPCDF3KZXH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KR5UJN6#wasThisHelpful","R3VXPCDF3KZXH0","AWHL379EE14K7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWHL379EE14K7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's also very capable of playing the latest Call of Duty titles at rather high settings with great performance.  Just make sure you pair it with a nice, fast monitor, because I tried to skimp a little on the monitor and ended up having to switch it out for a better performing one.

"Wouldn't you know it, as soon as I bought this the wife ended up with a nail in the tire of her vehicle, so I was able to test this out when I had to top off some air in the spare tire.

I was initially annoyed that a compressor with these specs didn't allow for using a cigarette lighter plug to power it,, but it's honestly not bad to hook it up directly to the battery, and it easily reaches all the way back to the rear wheels on my Toyota Sequoia SUV.

"I'm currently on a quest for a stakeout pole (SOP) for my kayak.  I have several homemade ones (using a garden stake as well as PVC).  The fiberglass on this SOP is a little more ""chaulky"".  It's also a non-standard size pole (diameter) so it's difficult to add a stainless steel point to it.  At 6' it's also a little on the short side.  The water I typically fish is very shallow, but there are frequently times where 6' just isn't enough. The rubber handle is very easily marked/marred.  Also the anchor shackle is not very useful since it's so high up.  Unless you're in 5-6' of water, attaching a lead to the shackle is going to pull the anchor to the side and out of the ground.  It's better to attach the lead so it slides up and down the pole depending on the depth of the water (you want the lead to be at water depth).I'm probably going to end up with an 8' Wang Anchor, which is a lot more expensive but includes a stainless steel tip and a better handle.  There's also a DIY one available (Google catfish stakeout pole), but to be economical you really need to organize a group buy, which makes the initial front money somewhere around $350.Overall, this is pretty good SOP, but I think there are better ones out there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R138F4XNEUCRLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PJMQLY#wasThisHelpful","R138F4XNEUCRLN","AWHL379EE14K7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWHL379EE14K7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've only been using it for about 5 days now, but I'm very impressed with this dashcam, especially for the price.  Everything has been working perfectly with no problems at all.I chose the capacitor rather than battery model because I reside in Florida where electronics are typically baked quite nicely through the windshield in the Florida sunshine.  The black bezel was nice, too, so it's not so ""advertised"" that you have a camera on your windshield -- it definitely blends in a lot more.Apparently this camera now comes with a different mount than that what the online reviews typically show.  This new mount swivels nicely for almost infinite adjustment, and it seems to lock down pretty securely.  .Another thing that most reviews I've read claim is that you cannot use a Class 10/UHS microSD card in this camera, but that's the only card I had available and it's been working flawlessly.  My firmware in the camera is dated September 2014, so perhaps that's something the manufacturer fixed with a firmware update.As the photo shows, I mounted mine behind the rearview mirror next to my radar detector (which is actually mounted to the mirror stem).  I then ran the included power cord around the windshield and installed a 12v receptical under my dash using a fuse tap/""add-a-circuit"".  Everything looks really clean and uncluttered, with no cords showing or hanging down in front of the windshield.

"I used this processor along with a new motherboard to upgrade a previous Pentium Duo system I built a while ago (that's now being used by my kids), and I'm actually very impressed with the performance.  I have a custom i7 system for myself (I do a lot of gaming and video editing), and was going to go with the i5 processor for upgrading the kids' PC, but the high price of the i5 put a stop to that.  For the high price of the i5, I might as well go with an i7, but the i3 is ridiculously cheap and for the medium level gaming that they do on the PC, it does a great job.  They mostly use consoles for gaming, so it really wasn't necessary for them to have an i7 processor.  I have this i3 processor on an Asus  B85M-G R2.0 motherboard with an older Asus Radeon 7850 graphics card and 8GB of RAM with Windows 7 64-bit, and it's now a very nice, extremely capable system.I have no regrets at all going with the cheaper i3 versus i5/i7 processors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ADRKGGBCF7H5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2LIF2S#wasThisHelpful","R1ADRKGGBCF7H5","AWHL379EE14K7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWHL379EE14K7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Working fantastic so far.  I used this motherboard to upgrade an old Pentium Duo system where the onboard network card failed.  It was time to upgrade to a more modern processor anyway (i3).  The upgrade went very smooth -- I basically replaced all the major internal components of the system and the whole process (including new OS install) was literally done in just a couple of hours.  I am a 20+ year career network engineer, but hardware upgrades don't usually go this smoothly.Minor caveats would be that the motherboard doesn't seem to be entirely micro ATX formfactor, because I replace another micro ATX board with this one in the same case, and the screw holes for the case aren't all in the correct area for this new motherboard, even though they were for the old one.  The case is just a generic mini tower, so it's not like I'm trying to re-use a proprietary Dell or HP case or something.  It works, but there's just not as much support as I would like, and it was a minor issue when pressing on the motherboard to install the CPU, heatsink/fan, and RAM.When i first turned on the system, it wouldn't boot.  I immediately thought I had a DOA motherboard, but then I remembered to go back to the basics and make sure everything is seated properly and check all the wire connections.  Turned out that I didn't have either RAM DIMMs pushed all the way in (probably because I was worried about the motherboard flex from the lack of screws).  I felt like a noob, but was glad something so simple solved the problem.  After that, everything booted up perfectly.This is my second Asus motherboard, and so far i would highly recommend them.  I have this micro ATX one now for my kids' computer, and for my full-height tower computer, I have a full ATX motherboard by Asus, which has been working perfectly for a year now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16J2AF2BLIC50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KO6F8YI#wasThisHelpful","R16J2AF2BLIC50","AWHL379EE14K7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWHL379EE14K7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love it so far.  It replaced an Lexmark X8350 All-in-one printer that just croaked on me out of the blue (it was rather old).  I love that ALL of the functions of this printer -- printing, scanning, faxing, etc. -- are all available wirelessly to every PC that's connected to it.  There's also some limited functionality with Android/iOS devices.  It prints fast, relatively quiet (a bit of ""clunking""), ink colors are really, including in printed photos.  Anything that I initially felt to be a caveat has all turned out to be learning curve differences between this Epson printer and my Lexmark (which again, I had for a very long time and was very used to it).  Some things that didn't seem to work right (perfect example is the rear paperfeed) worked fine after I read the instructions and figured out how it was supposed to work.  About the only lingering caveat is the XL (high capacity) ink cartridges are not readily available in my local stores, but even that isn't a really big deal because with a little planning ahead, I can order directly from Epson (with free shipping) for the same price that they're listed at in the local stores (when they're in stock).  It's just a really nice, modern printer that is a nice upgrade to my old Lexmark.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BH3UI5D2O9JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGF06#wasThisHelpful","R2BH3UI5D2O9JP","AWHL379EE14K7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWHL379EE14K7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm actually pleasantly surprised by these.  They stay in place well for exercising/activity, but definitely try the different size earbuds and clips until you figure out whatever fits your ears the best.  I do wish the neck cord was a little bit longer so it draped around the neck more, because if you turn your head too far to the left or right, it tends to pull. The controls aren't very easy to use, especially the single button for power, play, pause, etc.  You can't really operate that button with the headphone in your ear because you have to press it so hard that it feels like you're going to bust an eardrum.  The sound on these is pretty good, better than what you would typically expect for such inexpensive headphones.  No, they're not Bose, so you have to manage your own expectations.  Like others have mentioned, it doesn't come with any sort of charger -- just a USB charging cable.  You can use your phone charger, PC USB port, etc.  The charge quickly and seem to hold the charge for a quite a while.  One of the other things that surprised me in a positive way about these is there is no delay when using them to watch movies on my tablet.  Usually with wireless headphones there's a delay.  Overall, especially for the price, I would highly recommend these if you're looking for inexpensive, good, wireless headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H4EGDL5D7USQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP6CF92#wasThisHelpful","R1H4EGDL5D7USQ","AWHL379EE14K7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWHL379EE14K7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent mouthpiece, so I felt the need to give it five stars, but I hope that others will read this review above and beyond the star rating, because my son has had a lot of difficulty playing with this mouthpiece versus the one that came with his clarinet.  First of all, the cork on this one made for a very tight fit on my son's clarinet.  I actually expected this, as all of the corks on his clarinet were VERY tight when first purchased, and this was easily remedied with some sanding and cork grease.  However, for some reason he just has a lot of difficulty getting a good sound with this mouthpiece compared to the one that came with his clarinet.  Even using the same reed and ligature.  I also played the clarinet since 6th grade, and I don't have a problem with this mouthpiece at all, but I'm sure my son won't be the only one.  I purchased this mouthpiece because his original one has a tiny chip on one corner of the mouthpiece, so I thought it would be a good idea to replace it before it became a problem.  He's back to using his old mouthpiece, but I decided to keep this one in case the old one eventually gives up the ghost completely.  Hopefully he can learn how to play on it should he ever need to.My other son plays sax and I bought him a Yamaha 4C mouthpiece for it and he loves it and plays it much better than the mouthpiece that came with his sax.Overall, I highly recommend this mouthpiece, but don't be surprised if your young band member doesn't like it so much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXL9TUXZD8LQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002F5562#wasThisHelpful","RXL9TUXZD8LQC","AWHL379EE14K7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWHL379EE14K7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the second one of these I've purchased -- and not because something happened to the first one.  It actually works so well that I wanted two.  I'm using one on my Panasonic Lumix FZ200 camera and the second one is for my newly purchased Samsung Galaxy Camera 2.  For the Camera 2 I purchased a flash bracket that I mount the mic to, and then I had to purchase an adapter to plug the mic into the combo headphone/mic jack.  Basically, any adapter that works for the iPad will also work for the Camera 2.  I also had to buy an adapter for the Panasonic FZ200 as it uses the smaller size jack.  This mic works great on both cameras, and both cameras shoot excellent 1080p video.  With this mic the dual footage from both of these cameras results in a really nice verging on pro level production.If whatever device you're using for video offers a mic jack, I'd highly recommend buying this mic and using it.

"I have very mixed feelings about this repair kit, but I hate it when buyers review things based on principle rather than reviewing the actual product itself, so that's why I gave it 4/5 stars because OVERALL the product worked and was relatively easy to install.Okay, first of all, Kohler...sheesh...really?  Can Kohler make a valve any more different/proprietary than every other company?  Because I seriously doubt it.  Plus, i really don't think this is the best valve design and definitely more prone to leaks.  All that being said, kudos to Amazon for having it for a fraction of the price of the local hardware stores, and it was great that it was a combo instead of having to buy the items separately (yes, they're both needed to repair a leaking shower).I purchased this to repair the six-year-old shower in our six-year-old home, and I'm rather surprised to find it so different from the original part.  Basically, it's rather similar, but there are some significant differences, too.  First of all, I had to install it a complete 180-degrees from the original.  Not sure why they felt the need to do that, but I (of course) didn't notice it until I installed it and tried to test the hot water.  It wasn't that big of a deal, but it was annoying to have to turn off the city water valve AGAIN, and drain all the water our of the system AGAIN, and then reinstall it ""upside down"".  There is also no way to install the fixture handle perfectly straight, and it has to be a few degrees from vertical when in the off position.  Again, not a huge deal, but I definitely think that was a botched assembly on the valve stem by Kohler.In the end, I'm not watching expensive Florida water steadily drip down the drain anymore, so I'm happy.  Definitely not the worst plumbing repair/install job I've done.  I still think it's an overall bad design, and I find myself wishing that when the house was under construction that we had gone with a different brand to get something with valves and a valve pot that are more standard.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QYWC5EKVAXQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GZU9FY#wasThisHelpful","R2QYWC5EKVAXQM","AWHL379EE14K7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWHL379EE14K7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had no Roku related problems with this device.  I really like HuluPlus and UFC.TV Fight Pass channels, which pretty much covers everything on TV that I typically watch. Yes, you have to pay around $18 for those two channels combined, but it's a lot cheaper than the $200 I'm currently paying DirecTV.  Plus, despite the negative reviews, there are quite a few truly free channels out there that are real TV channels from cable and satellite TV.I would advise considering the negative reviews that actually had problems with broken or malfunctioning Roku devices, but the hundreds of negative reviews from people in bought the Roku 3 and then tried to use it in a foreign country where it does not work should just be disregarded.  That doesn't work with DVD players, satellite TV services, satellite radio, etc.  I don't know why they would think it would work for internet streaming.The things I like best about the device:1.  It's tiny2.  The headphones port on the remote is incredibly handy3.  Setup was simple, practically instantaneous4.  Good assortment of channels5.  Navigation is very fastNegatives:1  It's a little pricey all things considering, but you can always get a Roku 1 or 2 instead of the 3.2.  It's only as good as your internet connection.  If your internet provider is having trouble, so is your Roku.3.  The remote is a shiny fingerprint/grease magnet.  A glossy remote control is a bad idea.4.  Why does everything Roku have to be purple?5.  Fingerpointing can be a problem when it comes to support.  Roku support will blame the channel/provider, the channel/provider blames Roku, they both blame everything on your internet connection, etc.In summary, I'm very happy with the device, but I'm admittedly a rather techie type of guy who doesn't consider things like this to be even a challenge.  I can see by the reviews that there are some people who are confused by just the HDMI connection.  Is it the device for you?

"I really didn't expect anything stellar (no pun intended), but this is a rather inferior telescope.  I think it is a decent terrestrial spotting scope.  However, honestly, if you already have a superzoom camera you probably already have the range of this scope and pretty much can guarantee you'll have better quality with the camera.  I also purchased an accessory kit that included a barlow lens, a couple more eyepieces, and filters.  These accessories were for the most part unusable on this scope because in the end all you're doing is increasing the magnification of an already poor image so you're just getting a larger bad image.  I also got a T-adapter for my Pentax DSLR, but the pics were horrible, and I can get vastly better shots with my longest Pentax lens.Specifically with regard to any astronomy use, if you're planning on looking at the moon, you'll do okay.  If you're wanting to do anything else with this don't waste your time.  The description talks about seeing Saturn's rings and Jupiter's moons -- there's simply no way.

"Excellent case solution for the Galaxy Camera 2.  I found the fit to be perfect for the Camera 2 and definitely not too tight.  There's only one real design problem and that's with the hole position for the wrist strap -- it's right in the middle of the top flap, when it's attached off-center on the camera.  I could see it eventually stretching or ripping the hole if you use the strap to carry the camera while in its case.  Other than that, it's perfect.

Was rather interesting to find out that the home laser printer I have installed in the same room (but not plugged into the UPS) reduces the voltage on this circuit in my home so much that it trips this UPS into thinking there's been a power loss.

"First off, I have to say that I'm very impressed with the case.  I think that it's the best thing going in affordable underwater housings for camera -- definitely wins the ""best bang for the buck"" category.  Unfortunately, that's where the positive part of this review begins and ends.The negatives include me first purchasing the wrong case per the recommendation from the Dicapac website.  They recommended the WP-S3  case for my Panasonic FZ200, and there is no way that the FZ200 can fit in there.  Ironically, they made that recommendation because the WP-S3 is also recommended for the Panasonic FZ70, which is the same superzoom formfactor of the FZ200, but the FZ70 is actually slightly larger all over.  So, don't rely on the Dicapac.com ""Fitment Guide"", as it could steer you very wrong.So after seeing how tiny the WP-S3 was, I decided to jump two size up (skipping the WP-S5) and got the WP-S10.  It was a little big for the relatively compact FZ200 ""body"", but the lens extension was a nice fit.  Again, not sure why they would ever recommend the comparatively tiny WP-S3 for this camera.  The bulkiness of the case is significantly reduced by just squeezing most of the air out of it before closing.There is, of course, vignetting (black circle around the image) when shooting at full wideangle, but that's to be expected with this type of case, and most people are going to be shooting at full zoom anyway.  The lens extension on the case is somewhat collapsible, so if you really wanted a wideangle shot, you could get it without vignetting by simply pulling the lens extension in toward the body of the case.  It's a clumsy solution, but it would work.  My smaller diameter lens on the FZ200 is somewhat ""lost"" in the rather wide lens extension of the WP-S10, but this is the only case that will work because of the length of the FZ200's lens when zoomed.Another caveat of this case is if your camera has one or more roller style controls.  You will not be able to adjust these at all.  On my cameras the aperture is controlled by a roller, so if you're shooting in shallow water where the light is brighter, you're going to have trouble controlling highlights, and then again have trouble in deeper, darker water when you can't open up the aperture.  Limited access to controls with this case definitely dictates that you put your typically high end camera in a very automatic point-n-shoot mode, which somewhat defeats the purpose of the whole endeavor of getting an underwater housing for your high end camera instead of just using a $150 waterproof point-n-shoot.The deal ender for me was that in testing the camera/casing combo, all of my pictures were turning out very soft if not actually blurry/out of focus.  My camera has one of the best, fastest, reliable auto focus features available, but I kept getting very soft pics, even in bright light, even on land (as in not underwater).  So I theorized that it might be the autofocus system of my camera not liking being behind a the lens cover of the case.  My camera does fine with filters on the lens, but the lens cover on this case is about 1"" from the end of the camera so I thought that could be the problem.  So, I got out my Pentax K-X DSLR, tried several different lenses on it, and same softness/slight blur.  So I removed the lens cover from the case (it screws on/off), focused a shot with my FZ200 completely out of the case, and then put the removed lens cover from the case in front of the FZ200 lens -- instant blurring visible from the viewfinder and LCD.  The lens cover on this case is not optically correct!  With that issue, it would be better to simply use my Pentax WG-2 waterproof camera or even my GoPro, because although those pics are not as nice quality as pics from the FZ200 or my Pentax K-X, you can easily tweak quality in post-processing, but you can't fix such significant blur.Coming to this conclusion was very disappointing, as I was really looking forward to better waterproof photography.  I frequently fish from a kayak, and participate in Heroes on the Water events (where we take war veterans kayak fishing), and I was going to use this to get better photos of the veterans out on the water, especially from a distance (I can't be up close for everyone all the time).  It's bummer that it's no longer an option.  I'm not sure why Dicapac wouldn't use an optical quality lens cover.  No, it's not because it's supposed to counter any distortion from shooting under water because that's not needed for underwater shooting and even that would just be a magnification adjustment not focus.Unless you like soft, unsharp photos from your high end camera, I just cannot recommend this product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W1DZ78F30L9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00169HXW2#wasThisHelpful","R1W1DZ78F30L9I","AWHL379EE14K7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWHL379EE14K7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The head is acceptable quality and the particular shape and style of this Frontier Hawk is my favorite of all the various types.  I favor this shape because it has a nice wedge from the blade to the eye, and does not have any excess weight for a hammer, pipe bowl, or spike.  The Norse Hawk looks good in side profile, but instead of a wedge to the eye, it has a sharper curve.The handles on these Tomahawks are made both incorrectly and carelessly.  The taper on the handles is not gradual, but instead there is a sharp knob on the last inch of the handle, and a set screw the compensate for the incorrect handle shape.  Historical examples of tomahawk certainly did not use set screws, not only because the machine work would have been inaccessible, but the screw itself would easily be lost and irreplaceable in the field.  A proper friction fit is better than a set screw that only damages the handle.  But to achieve a good friction fit, the contour of the handle must match the taper of the head.  Cold Steel's handle has parallel sides and then a rapid taper in the last inch.  This results in only the top sixteenth of an inch of the head bearing on the handle.  Although the handle can be re-profiled, there is barely enough material left create the correct thickness at the base of the head's taper.The grain orientation of the handle is often wrong, which is simply carelessness that results in an inferior product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38MSQ5BMZHSWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030DDG9Q#wasThisHelpful","R38MSQ5BMZHSWW","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a carbon steel chain that is nickel and chrome-plated.  It is not stainless steel.  H-S makes stainless steel collars, but they are about twice the price and have a small tag on one of the round end links identifying that their stainless even from a distance.  You will not find a stainless H-S chain like this for less than twenty dollars new.  They're typically about twenty-eight dollars lately.Here's the advantage of chrome-plated steel: it is much glossier and shinier than stainless steel.  H-S highly polishes the nickle plating before they chrome-plate the chains.  They have a mirror-like finish.  Stainless steel, on the other hand, is a bit duller even after polishing, and then when it wears it turns a duller grey. As already mentioned, the chrome-plated steel can be had for less than half the cost of the stainless.The stainless steel HS uses has a higher tensile strength than their chrome plated collars, and it is lighter weight for the same thickness.  If you want a stronger, lighter chain that won't ever rust, but will stay a sort of bright-grey, dull mirror finish, then get the stainless.The chrome-plated steel chains are not weak by any means.  They will not wear from abrasion the way the brass ones will, and they are more than strong enough to hold any dog.  The strength is slightly less than the stainless chains, but mostly insignificant since both are far stronger than needed for the purpose.  The difference in weight is more significant.  The chrome-plated steel chains do weigh significantly more than the stainless ones, and this could matter depending on the size of chain and dog.  The other disadvantage of the chrome-plated steel is they could rust if the chrome plating is worn off and if the chain is neglected such as being left in the yard, or stored outdoors or in a wet location.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LZJ8HFGQJD7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002DI9WQ#wasThisHelpful","R2LZJ8HFGQJD7V","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The narration is entertaining if not overly simplified, and it too frequently is dubbed over scenes of the rich men sipping whiskey in their office.  While the narration is slightly deeper, the pictures suggest these guys built empires by brooding greedily over glasses of liquor instead of actually doing any work.  While they may not have literally broken their backs the way some of their workers did, I'm pretty sure they were busy, stressed, and totally consumed by running their empires and not just engaged in the kind of solitary brooding the episodes depict.  Admittedly it would take a great deal more effort to re-enact the hectic daily life of these men, but the images often serve merely as a back drop to the narration.  It would have been better had photographs or paintings of the actual men and sites been used instead, but understandably, this was from an era before photography was especially extensive.  By way of comparison, Ken Burns documentary on Prohibition has a lot of original photographs, but is admittedly from an era slightly later.The reason I still appreciate this pseudo documentary is because it was able to hold the attention of my kids (7 and 8) who probably would not have been able to follow one more concerned with accuracy, detail, and authenticity.  I believe they learned something about this significant era in American history that they'll be able to build on later as they get older.

"Awesome.These are nicely molded polyetheylene kayaks.  They're light (because they're small), durable, and super easy to paddle.These are easy even for kids to paddle.  Although they're best for just having fun, we've gone distances with them too.  My 8 year old can keep up with my canoe paddling a mile.  I tow my 7 year old some of the time.  After the first mile, I've towed both (as a train).Flotation is good, especially since they have foam in both ends.  They're not easy to swamp, but they certainly won't sink.  They are not easy to re-enter, but this is something that takes skill with any boat.  My boys have been successful re-entering several times, but it can be difficult and there has been times they failed without help.  Always wear a life jacket, and never go alone.It comes with a styrofoam billet in the front which adds extra flotation.  It's a good idea, but not durable as kids will kick it with their feet down there and it will come apart (it's just white styrofoam).  I removed the billets (from two kayaks) and replaced them with Polyform A-0 buoys secured to an eyebolt.  I replaced the lag screw that holds the billets in with an eyebolt.  The foam in the stern is unreachable and unlikely to be damaged.  I wonder if it could hold muck in there, but haven't had an issue so far.My wife at 5'1"" and 100 pounds fits these nicely but a boat with slightly more leg room would be a little better.  They easily hold her weight though.  Even I fit them at 5'8"" and 140 pounds, but I am really too big to fit the short length.  I can fully straighten my legs, but my feet are all the way to narrow part of the bow.  My weight causes the bow to ride too low in the water.  Old Towne limits them to 100 to 115 pounds, which is about right.  I would also put the height limit at 5 feet, but a heavier and taller person can fit in a pinch.Because I have paddled these myself, I can say they are a delight to paddle.  They're very fast and efficient, and they turn well.  Of course they're very short and narrow for my size, so that is not surprising.  However, I would not want a wider, longer boat for my boys as it would be harder to paddle and harder to turn.They're expensive compared to cheaper two-piece or sit-on-top kayaks carried by stores that sell lots of cheap imports.  I think they're worth it, especially if you have the opportunity to do a significant amount of paddling with your kids.  They're probably too expensive for a beach toy that you use for a once a year trip.  We've been paddling with them at least 7 times in the last two months since we got them, and will probably go another 7 times in the next two months before winter.I paddle a canoe myself so I can fit my wife and I and our dog, plus any cargo we want.  The canoe is a lot of fun too but has tradeoffs.  It is harder to paddle. It is much more affected by wind.  It is a beast to carry (it's an Old Towne and polyethylene also, about 80 pounds).  Even though it is a smaller canoe (14'7"") I could fit my family of four, our big dog, and some cargo in it.  Even so, I think it was well worth it to get the kids their own boats.  They have far more fun and its more motivating for them to go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVQNB2MXZ5085/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QIKL546#wasThisHelpful","RVQNB2MXZ5085","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I replaced a Schlage keyed deadbolt with this combination item.  It works very well.A combination lock allows my kids to open the door without having to keep a key.  While I used to be ""latch key kid"" myself, my own kids are never home alone.  Nevertheless, I might send them to the door with bags/groceries etc. while I'm still at the car.  When we come back from walking the dog, they can open the door for me.  I have confidence knowing they'll never be locked out.A combination lock means my wife and I don't have to carry keys.  My wife has an electronic fob for her car, and my car uses a switch and starter button (old school).  Eliminating the house key means no more keys at all.Brass metal keys, including Schlage and Kwikset have too much toxic lead in them.  So much that they've been sued by State's governments but they are unlikely to change.  Not having to handle a key reduces exposure to lead.The lock functions well.  It was easy to install (to replace existing deadbolt) and the result was the cylinder turns easily, it fits properly, and works smoothly.  Locking and unlocking from inside is just a turn of the large lever.  Locking from outside involves pushing the top ""Schlage"" button and turning the knob to lock the deadbolt.  Unlocking from outside, you can either enter the 4 digit combo into the keypad and turn the knob, or you can press the Schlage button to illuminate the keypad and then enter the combo and turn the knob.A 4 digit combo is quick and secure enough for the level of security this whole product is intended for.  It provides for more than 3000 possible combinations, so a brute force attack on the combination is not as likely as a brute force attack on the door jamb or window.  This is not a high security product, as it is intended for doors that can be kicked in, breached with a ram, or bypassed.  The buttons appear to be durable and not likely to soon reveal discrepancies in use, but the combination can be changed easily to level the use of different buttons.  The lock also supports multiple combinations, and therefore temporary combinations.I looked at alternatives, but determined this simple option is best.  I imagine future cars (and houses) will have two-factor authentication to use -- you'll need to have something (probably a digital certificate with private key on your smartphone device) and to know something (a PIN), but you'll probably have an (slightly less secure) option to pre-enter or save the PIN so that you'll be able to open the door or use the car just by being near it.  This combination lock won't unlock just because you're nearby, but it is a pretty easy PIN to enter.  I looked at alternatives that include Bluetooth or Wifi connectivity, but they all involved a proprietary service with subscription or a device that was too expensive and unproven.I don't have long term results for this product yet, but expect it will fair well for several years to come.  The brushed nickel finish on my Schlage door set failed with peeling varnish after about 5 years.  I would have thought it would be nickel plated, but apparently they coat it in some kind of plastic varnish and it comes off.  Because of that, I also doubt this combo deadbolt product is really brushed nickel, but instead it is probably the same fake painted-on finish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QRI4SLLTR148/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NJJ1MQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QRI4SLLTR148","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Perfect for whip cream or to foam egg whites.  I bought this to replace a Cuisinart immersion blender that I only ever used with the poorly-made whisk attachment.

"My previous toaster lasted over 40 years, and still works.  This one lasted 2 years before one of the internal slice lifting arms dropped and an internal fuse or circuit breaker blew resulting in no power.  Because the unit is sealed with security screws and plastic seals over the housing screws, it is impractical to repair it other than to send it back to Breville for out-of-warranty repair at eighty dollars.While this toaster worked well while it worked, I feel the electronic gadgetry has been mis-applied to make something that should be simple, very complex, expensive, and prone to failure, whereas the same result can be achieved with a much simpler appliance.  You cannot taste the difference.I can think of a more innovative design for a toaster, that instead of using complex lifting motors and electronics just for show.  It would come apart into two modules so that one could be put in the dishwasher and the separate electrical module and heating elements would include a self-clean feature like ovens.  For the price, this Breville unit adds nothing of value compared to a plain electric toaster with a mechanical spring lift.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N329S9K5EK3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001415B12#wasThisHelpful","R1N329S9K5EK3N","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the best portable target I have found for youth and traditional archery without heavy draw bows.  I bought this to put in the 4x4 so my sons and I could should a target in the bush without breaking or losing a lot of arrows.  The target face is much nicer than a bag target (a coffee sack stuffed with blankets and wrapping materials).  It stops arrows from my adult draw-length long bow which is about 35#.  I love shooting a bow with a low draw weight and learning instinctive archery.  I used to hunt and draw a 60# bow with a peep sight and pin, and was plenty accurate enough with it, but the lightweight bow is much more fun.  This is the right portable target for it and my kid's bows (ages 7 and 8) which must be about 10#.  At home we use straw bales which give a bigger target area for a lot less money.  We just spray paint a target on three or more bales. But that is too hard to take into the field.

"This is a helpful introduction, but focuses on the basics of one fairly unpopular method.  The bulk of the book is dedicated to teaching the hand stitch or saddle stitch.  Stohlman teaches what could be described as Western stitching, with straight stitches, marked with an overstitch wheel in a groove.  European-style saddle stitching using a pricking iron, diamond awl and laying the stitches at an oblique angle seems to be far more popular with leather craftspeople and consumers of high-end leather goods.

"While it may make more sense to just have the pulse oximeter as a micro-USB probe and all the software on a phone/tablet, this device does it all with a nice display and flash memory for a fraction of what probe-only devices cost.  I installed the software on a PC and uploaded the data to view a graph without any problems.  The software isn't beautiful, but it is functional.  I also understand that the data can be manipulated into 3rd party software (a previous version was integrated with Sleepy Head).The clip with display is a bit bulky for long-term recording.  I secured it with vet-wrap, careful not to make it too tight, but it was still uncomfortable after several hours.  I got good data though.This device is really most amazing for its price.  Because it is so inexpensive, I could purchase it when I was only slightly curious to record SpO2 levels over several hours.  Had I a more pressing need, I would want something more robust in features and software integration, but would have to expect to pay five times as much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PE1BCI9K5HRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B8L8ZXE#wasThisHelpful","R2PE1BCI9K5HRG","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are cheaper than a happy meal toy and probably almost as toxic as the meal.  I bought one set as giveaways for 6 to 9 year olds.  I would not give these to smaller kids as I don't trust the PVC or the paint/dye safety.  I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the items when I received them and was going to return them, but considering the price, I decided to just give them away as planned.  They are definitely not anything like Schleich, and not even the kind of quality I would expect to find at Wlmrt or Trgt stores.  I've got to commend their maker for finding a cheaper, lower quality way of making something I thought was already really cheap (plastic animals).The most disappointing thing about them from a play perspective is they are hollow and have a huge seam where they split apart.

The one shortcoming is the steel cover that fits over the studs on the wall mount plate and to which the arm is attached is made of stamped sheet metal rather than a sturdy casting.

"I love the idea, but it's nowhere near deep and loud enough.  I bought the ED-55 which is the same as this ED-50 but also features three-dog sounds, a chime, and alarm sound.  I was sorely disappointed when I plugged it in, and cranked the volume up to max.  It was distorted and I could tell it was not loud enough.  I tested it at my home's entry which has a double-pane glass window, masonite on stud wall, and a masonite/foam-core door.  The motion sensor activated just fine, but from outside the dog sounds seemed like they were very far away, like the dogs were on the other side of the house.For the sake of this review I decided to use an SPL meter to measure sound pressure levels and compare the fake dog to my real dog.  My SPL meter's microphone is not calibrated so the measurements may not be perfectly accurate, but I think they are a fair comparison since I used the same meter for both sounds.  At 1 meter, the fake dog was as much as 100 to 104 decibels (A-weighted or dBA).  At the same distance, my real dog was also about 100 to 104 dBA.  The A-weighting on the sound meter favors the high-pitched sounds the ED-55 can reproduce.  Without any obstacles in the way, the piercing sound of the ED-55 is fairly loud, but only at the higher frequencies.I also tried stepping outside my home's entry to see how well the different sounds penetrated.  The real dog is able to produce much more sound pressure at low frequencies (bass) compared to the mini-amplifier and very small driver in the ED-55 which struggles with bass.  At the highest volume level, the distortion on the ED-55 is bad.  Just like a small radio on an alarm clock, there is much less distortion if you don't crank the volume all the way up, but I still used maximum volume for all the tests.  Outside, the ED-55 produces barking sounds that only registered as high as 68 dBA, but no higher.  My dog was consistently around 85 dBA when measured through the door and wall.  Decibels are on a logarithmic scale, so that is more than four times louder than the fake dog.  For the test, I had my dog bark on command.  I think he could get even louder if he sensed a real intruder or was actually mad.When my dog is home, I don't need Rex.  But I often take my dog with me when I leave.  I was hoping to leave Rex home, but if I did, people who approach my home would probably think I've acquired a little chihuahua or that the dog is locked in a crate in the bedroom closet with the door shut.The ED-50 and ED-55 are priced well beyond simpler gadgets like the Fake-TV or a fake camera, but an ineffective product is worthless.  I would be willing to pay twice as much for a product that was twice as loud and did not have excessive distortion in the low frequencies.  But as it is, the ED-50/55 is useless.  I think it could be modified with a more powerful amplifier and a larger, perhaps six to eight inch woofer.  I may do that myself, but for most customers, I cannot recommend the fake dog.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OFLRVUPPXPIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BHV6FY6#wasThisHelpful","R1OFLRVUPPXPIV","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A century of dog training has been built primarily on what is explained in this book.  While more recent training theory and methods may build on Most's methods with some improvements, little, if anything has refuted their validity or made them obsolete.Some critics may be suspicious that his methods were harsh, but they have obviously not read the book.  In his own words, his theory and practice is congruent with any modern method that conscientiously acknowledges the use of aversives like a harsh word (""Bah!"") or the use of leash and collar which Most explains as contrasting ""agreeable"" and ""disagreeable"" experiences for the dog.  For example, walking in the heel position, the dog sustains an agreeable experience, whereas if it forges, lags or walks away out of the heel position, the leash results in a disagreeable experience.  Ironically, Most himself laments the ""old days"" when less sensitive methods were harsh.  As far as I know, we simply do not have a written record of those methods.  Besides this 1910 book from Most that primarily advocates inducing the dog's instincts and using positive reinforcement, earlier records include Stephen Hammond's 1882 book Practical Training that advocated positive reinforcement through praise and meat, and W. N. Hutchinson's 1848 book ""Dog Breaking"" which also promotes reward-based training and criticizes lack of kindness, patience, and hard punishments.My conclusion is that sum total of historical literature we have on dog training theory and practice advocates reward-based training, instinctive-inducement and positive reinforcement, and that if harsh, insensitive methods and brute force are used now or in the past*, it was due to ignorance.  Reading this book will not somehow contribute further to that ignorance, but rather serve to dispel it.One might consider Koehler's books from the 1950's as opposed to positive/reward-based training, but if that is so, then they were a contemporary departure from the 100+ years of training literature that preceded them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33WD9JTWMDT1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=192924200X#wasThisHelpful","R33WD9JTWMDT1U","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review after 9 months:- Constant print alignment problems- Smearing- Skipped lines- Heavy color ink usage even though I almost never print color or pictures- Black ink runs out fast even though I use the faded-grey draft mode for more than half my printsThe quality problems are so persistent and grievous that I can't imagine using this for business.  I use it primarily to print worksheets for my two kids, and UPS return labels.  Every time I try to use it for something where quality matters, it disappoints.If this was truly low-initial-cost printer (40 dollar job), then I would accept getting what I paid for.  While this is still an inexpensive printer, the ink costs add up quickly and I will have to consider dumping this since it cannot print anything decently and is too costly to print casually.Note: The printer will not print black if I select black-only if even one color cartridge is reported empty.  I'm disappointed that the Epson is deliberately set up to stop printing black just because a color cartridge is out and did not allow a workaround to print black only. Shame.I've found the scanner produces poor image quality.  I would like to scan my children's artwork on paper, but I get better results taking a picture of it with a camera.  I suppose the scanner function works adequately if you're just using it to replace fax.Printing can be good quality if the right ""inkjet"" paper is used so it doesn't bleed too much.  I think this is the first inkjet I've had where I won't regret having it instead of a laser printer, but I also wouldn't replace the lasers at the office with anything like this.  It's definitely a home, personal or small office, low-productivity printer, and it has limited page sizes.  Personally, the thing I miss the most is double-sided 11x17, but admittedly that is another category/price-range.I have done some photo prints on this, which I would not plan to do regularly.  This is not a photo printer.  I used photo paper to print some proof-of-concepts for an offset print project.  The print quality was quite good, but the printer left roller marks with many tiny pin prick dents on the paper.  There may be an adjustment for this, but it's not worth it to me to figure out.  It was awkward enough just changing paper sizes and orientation with the poor user interface.  For photo printing, I still prefer a laser-exposure mini-lab type system (Fuji Frontier etc.) - In other words, I send it out to a service.I frequently have alignment problems with the printer.  I get places on the page where the image is shifted left or right.  I've run the print head alignment utility several times but it still has alignment problems on occasion.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JTDCHVE0LB9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGF06#wasThisHelpful","R1JTDCHVE0LB9M","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It was a bit difficult to fit two very small/short, kids bikes with 16 inch wheels, but it could be done.  My wife's hybrid with the fat aluminum mixte-style frame also fit poorly since it had a very wide top tube and widely-spaced seat stays.  It still works.  My 80's Schwinn 10 speed with thin, chromo, horizontal top-tube fit perfectly.  If you had 4 bikes like that with plain diamond frames and skinny, level top tubes, this rack would be a breeze to load.  As it is, I do not think you could expect to load 4 bikes of various shapes and sizes and not expect some scuffs and minor damage from the bikes rubbing against each other.  I suppose if you have very valuable bicycles, you probably transport them on a rack in a van or truck, well-spaced apart.Threading the bolt to lock the swing-away carrier is a bit tedious.

I previously ordered the PG-4Y cable that comes with a Proficy USB serial adapter and could not make that work on XP, Win7, or Win8.1 with several different versions of the driver.  I could get the driver to be correct in device manager, but MCP-5 would never read or write to the radio.

"This is a 100% wool sweater, which will perform far better than cotton or acrylic (like the Alpha version) neither of which I would ever even bother with.  The wool is not lambswool or Merino or like any of the delicate gift sweaters you'd find at Macy's.  This is fairly tough wool from around the sheep's bottom somewhere in India.  It's made in India on a machine.It fits tight, but I am content with my regular size and would only consider one size up - my size is on the small end and I'm thin.  The sleeves are extra long because they're designed to be rolled back at the cuff.  The sweater has good elasticity so it has stayed tight and not stretched out after several years of occasional use.The sweater is fairly thick and bulky which keeps it warm even in a little breeze.  The wind blows right through my Pendleton Shetland sweater, but this Rothco is quite a bit more substantial.  I can imagine a Lanolin-rich hand-knit Aran jumper being a little tougher and warmer, but not much in this price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24NC6XO72NES5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IQXJEU#wasThisHelpful","R24NC6XO72NES5","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Been using Dromedary and Dromedary Lite's for 20 years - totally came to trust them on many expeditions (PCT, JMT, 14er's, and winter alpine treks) - bought 2 of these and they both leak.  MSR changed the caps or cap supplier and the new caps are defective.  I screwed on one of the caps from a Dromedary Lite I purchased 15 years ago, and it would not leak.  The old caps, which have been supplied as recently as a year ago, have ""wash and dry after each use"" molded on them.  The new caps do not and are thicker on the edges and have sharper grip teeth.  Fix the caps and I will change the rating.  In the mean time, I will probably have to buy Nalgene caps or something to replace the junk MSR is selling.The design is top-notch.  The fact that the caps are interchangeable with Nalgene, fit water filters, and the nylon bags are tougher than plastic are all a testament to the fact these bags can be the best.  They're the only bag I trust to fill with hot water and slip in my sleeping bag in the winter.  They're awesome, 5-star products if they're made correctly.I have a hydromedary kit I used on the bigger bags (6L) for at least 15 years.  I replaced the hose before with regular vinyl tubing from the hardware store.  The tubing on this hydromedary is smaller in diameter but still looks like standard vinyl tubing and could easily be replaced.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R372ZQFSR7KWSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000G7WJJ2#wasThisHelpful","R372ZQFSR7KWSX","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice pressure gage.  I bought it specifically for the fill port it has on the side although I would have to modify it for my use.  The only let-down on this EZ Air is the clip on the end of the hose.  It slips off too easily.  I replaced it with a ""CTA Tools 1930 Straight Lock-On Air Chuck.""  The two chucks look nearly identical, but the Accu-Gage one works poorly and the CTA one works perfectly.My 4x4's onboard air compressor is tankless so the Schrader valve fill port isn't ideal because an air chuck on the end of my fill hose would cause pressure to build in the hose -- pressure that would normally be stored in a tank with a pressure regulator.  I don't have space for that, and don't desire the cost and complexity of tanks, regulators and cutoff switches.  Therefore I pulled the valve core, installed an adapter to 1/4"" NPT and then a quick-disconnect.  The open port is on the fill hose-end and the brass disconnect is on the gage-side where it hold pressure when disconnected so I can get an accurate pressure reading.  While it's connected, I can monitor pressure in the line, but I have to estimate the corresponding pressure in the tire.  It's usually 20 to 30 psi less than the line pressure, and that's enough for me to see when the tire has aired up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ESFYV3J13U2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Z33Y1E#wasThisHelpful","R3ESFYV3J13U2X","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I suspect something failed in the dimming circuit.

"This is an outstanding snow melter and water boiler.  It is very fast and very efficient and it is also reasonably lightweight and compact for the capacity.  The tradeoff's are it does not scale down well for solo use, it does not work well for cooking or simmering, and the pot/cookware is specific.  It may be possible but not practical to use with a regular pot.I use mine to boil water to reconstitute dehydrated food for a family of four people.  I typically only boil 1 liter of water, but the extra capacity is useful and will be used more as my children grow to eat more in a meal.

"It worked pretty good as a portable for a couple of years of regular use for airing up after offroading.  I could fill my 33"" radials from 12 to 35 psi in about 18 minutes.  I would have liked a faster fill, but even the larger compressors like the 400 are only a little bit faster.  After mounting it under my hood, it overheats and barely fills the tires.  It really only worked well as a portable.This compressor fills tires up, but it takes a while.  For a really fast fill, the best option is a CO2 or nitrogen tank but they're pricey, bulky and they cost to fill up.  The next best option is to have two compressors.  Even having an air tank doesn't speed fill ups unless it's a very large tank.  Once you empty the relatively low pressure (120 psi) air tank, your compressor now has to fill the tires and the tank.  I just don't have room for a tank large enough to fill my tires.  I don't even have room for two compressors.  So I decided to be content with the 300P.Then I decided I could save some time by mounting it onboard without a tank.  I mounted it under the hood with a hose to an open port at the front grill and wired it with a fuse, relay and switch.  I would save time by not having to un-bag it, pop the hood, connect the leads, or put it all away.  Now I just need to plug the hose, hit the switch, and air up.The problem is the compressor gets preheated to about 140 F under the hood.  I have it mounted above the fender well and tire on the passenger side.  I can fill my 33's from 14 psi to 35 psi and then the compressor shuts off because it gets too hot.  If I make a mistake or want more pressure, I could be waiting a long time for it to cool off.The 400C is a little faster and might fill up my tires before it overheats, but it's also a 33% duty cycle compressor and I don't expect it to run much longer than the 300.  Viair offers the 450C, for continuous duty.  I expect it would continue to run even when it gets hot, but it's even slower than the 300 -- and since it's about three inches longer, it doesn't fit my spot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DOO60WSZYHLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000X90YUO#wasThisHelpful","R3DOO60WSZYHLM","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this as an art table for two kids, 6 and 7.  Because it tilts down from the center, with the legs in the lowest position, the height at a fairly steep incline is quite low -- about 20 inches from the floor to the front-bottom edge of the table surface.  I use it with their 12 inch seat-height chairs.  The stool is high and mostly useless for my purposes.The table and chair appear to be made out of rubberwood.  I would have preferred maple but rubberwood is slightly better than particleboard or MDF.The screws split the stretchers on the stool in three places.  The table went together without mishap, but one of the holes for the pencil tray appears to have bulged the desk surface.  There's a strange lump there like it may have been repaired at the factory with putty before being finished.The defects are altogether unsatisfactory, but nothing that a second order can't rectify.

"These are fine in mud, but the soles are very hard plastic and they have no traction at all on ice or on the rocks in the river or creek bottom -- I mean they are really slick.  I had Bogs before or cheap PVC boots from the hardware store.  Either of those were far better.  While I don't mind the Wetland boots in light snow, soft dirt, and moderate mud, I primarily wear a tall boot like this to cross the river when its low or creeks, and in snow that's no more than knee-deep, which is usually what it is around the streets and sidewalks -- but these are dangerous to wear in those situations.

"There's been many good things written about this pen, and I found most to be true.  Ultimately I was disappointed with the Fine nib.  I found what I wanted with the 1.1mm Italic nib.  Even though changing the nib is as easy and flicking off with a fingernail and sliding another on, I could not find the nibs for sale from Amazon -- only from 3rd parties that charge a lot for shipping.  I ended up buying a Joy pen because I could get the whole pen with a usable section, feed, and cartridge as well as the nib for only a few dollars more than a nib and shipping.  I would appreciate it more if I were able to buy nibs for a reasonable price.The nibs are a bit scratchy and slow.  Maybe a gold nib would be a bit smoother.  I imagine finding a fast italic nib would be a bit tricky, but the Fine that comes with this Safari isn't much faster and doesn't look anywhere near as good.I've used the cartridge and the converter with Noodler's Black and found both to be satisfactory.The only other suggestion I have to make this pen better would be to provide a tactical barrel and cap.  The Al Star might work better than this plastic Safari, but neither is really designed with tactical needs in mind.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XVR0V5WHRDKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002T401Y#wasThisHelpful","R2XVR0V5WHRDKT","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this just for the nib.  I wish Lamy and Amazon made the nibs available for a better price, but as it was I could get the whole pen for just a little more than the nib and shipping.  Amazon was not and still is not today selling the nibs, so Prime or Super Saver shipping isn't available.Rather than changing the nib on my Safari, which I could just push off with my fingernail, I just swapped the barrel and cap.  The long barrel on the Joy is impractical, but I do prefer the smooth black section and feed to the Safari's coarse textured grey one.  I don't care for the red clip on the Joy's cap, but again, I bought it for the nib.The nib is decent, I suppose for the price.  The 1.1 italic nib gives me exactly what I was looking for whereas the fine nib on the Safari was a big disappointment.  The 1.1 nib is a bit scratchy, but it writes beautifully.  I think the tines may be a bit too tight as no light passes between them, and I can barely force a piece of fine paper between them.Together, the Joy and Safari are decent pens and they've helped me figure out what I care for in a pen without costing me a fortune.  I continue to use the Safari barrel and cap with the Joy's section, feed, and nib, along with a converter and Noodler's black ink for every day carry.  I don't think I'll ever become a collector or desire to own luxury pens.  I'll admire them, but I only want a pen for EDC that's like the one I have.  It could be better if the nibs were smoother, and the different nibs had better availability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCO4MDBAJ9RB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002T3ZKG#wasThisHelpful","RCO4MDBAJ9RB8","A24PNVLQKEOZ2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PNVLQKEOZ2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read the label, and decided to try them based on the big claims.  Immediately I was overwhelmed with disappointment.  Their label claims had really raised my expectations.  I took out a BIC Cristal and compared how each writes.  I was impressed that the InkJoys actually faired well compared to ""the"" ball point pen.  I was hoping for so much more, but considering that the overwhelming portion of the pen population can't even function half as well as a Cristal, I decided not the throw them away.

I use them for the daily math worksheets I write for my students.  They could be used to write a note, but some of the colors are a bit effeminate for a man.

"I've been reading this to my boys.  I started it when we visited Canada and rode the train.  We're not finished yet, that is with the book, but honestly I'm not sure we ever will be.  It's a slow starter, difficult to understand, even a little difficult to read with fluency because the language is poor.  The story may end up being a reasonably good one after we get past the first third, but already the author's skill is quite apparently lacking.  It may very well be a bestseller in the here-today, gone-tomorrow market, but it hardly compares to great children's literature.Update:It took us a while, but we did finish it.  The story picked up a bit about half-way through, but it also continued to demand further stretches of the reader's credulity.  While I didn't find anything offensive, the story just alternated between boring and uninspiring.  It wasn't the worst thing I've read at all.  I'd liken it to a popular action movie -- shallow and unbelievable, but entertaining enough to sell widely.I'd just switched to Boundless after reading a string of Newberry honor books and the original, uncensored Hardy Boys.

"This is the second Mystery of History book I've taught from.  I also use the _Story_of_the_World_ series to which I can compare this.  Mystery of History includes a great deal of biblical history, and it is evident the author has tried to make it Christ-centered.  In many places it is written by the author in first-person, which is a little unorthodox for a history text book.  Nevertheless, I think the subject demands a good teacher to keep the subject lively, fun, and engaging for many students.  Story of the World, by comparison contains slightly more brief accounts of many of the same subjects, but doesn't include as much bible history (in volume I), or as much in the way of teaching aides, lesson plans, advice etc.  I still use both and will continue to do so.  I've also been using video from New Dimension Media (available on Amazon Prime Instant Video), Schlessinger Media (old VHS and some DVD from the library), and occasionally some Youtube content.

Internally, this Hito is all electronic -- a quartz movement and electronically controlled alarm, but the alarm sounds electro-mechanically, so you get the sound of the hammer striking the bells instead of some beeping sound from a vibrating diaphragm (speaker).  The style and finish are very clean.  It keeps time quite accurately.  It was just a few seconds fast over several weeks time compared to another clock I have that is corrected by an atomic clock.  It's not silent, but it is much quieter than most quartz clocks in this price range.  I can only hear it if it's within a few inches of my ear.  The noise is a ticking sound of a higher frequency than is typical of many quartz movements.  It may still be quieter than a lot of AC-powered electronic clocks that have cheap transformers.

"These are very stiff and the sole does not flex.  I have worn through quite a few pairs of the original desert boots and appreciate them for what they are.  I thought I would try these with the alternative sole material.  Presumably they will last longer, although I have not found that to be a serious concern about the Desert boots.  Unfortunately, I found the soles on the Bushacre do not flex at all.  This lack of flex introduces a problem while not solving a significant one in the tradeoff.The original desert boot has a flexible upper, the suede ones are breathable, and the soles flex well, and there's not too much toe-spring, but the crepe rubber soles are somewhat heavy and the heel pad results in significant drop.  I recommend trying the Vivobarefoot Gobi II alongside the desert or bushacre boots.  For me, the difference in comfort is stark.  I thought the desert boots were comfortable, having come from highly-structured boots, but the Vivo's are even better, especially with the insole removed.

With both slots populated (in my PC, with my SSD primary and the lower slot for a backup HDD), the HDD not only gets unacceptably hot, but it directly transfers heat to the SSD and absolutely cooks it, too.The ejection mechanism on the upper 2.5 slot is goofy, and this is a little difficult to describe: On other backplane products I've used or evaluated (including another Startech double 2.5 unit), you must first insert the 2.5 drive into the slot, then the door must be closed to complete the insertion and marry the drive to the internal connectors.  In other words, you HAVE to use the door, you cannot complete the insertion without, because the door will try to close on your finger if you keep pushing the drive in.On this unit, however, you can slide the drive all the way in and connect it without the use of the door.  BUT, if you do that, the ejection lever doesn't engage, and the drive is now stuck in the slot.  You have to remove anything you have installed in the lower tray, slide your hand inside the unit, and pull the 2.5 drive out, which also puts unwanted force on the 2.5 connector.  Really uncool.As others have noted here, the doors and handles are very flimsy.  You have to be REALLY careful or they indeed are going to break.I bought this so I could change out a series of backup HDD's directly to the mobo and get superior transfer speeds.  However, I guess I'm going back to doing those backups over my external Startech dock at the nearly twice as slow USB3.0.  That much larger fan keeps an HDD COMPLETELY cool to the touch, even under the largest of data transfers.Also, when I compare the design and build quality of this unit against other excellent Startech products I've owned, I can't believe it came  from the same company.  Really disappointed with this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLEH5N9X1VHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXYKFVG#wasThisHelpful","R3LLEH5N9X1VHM","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After sitting on the fence for several months with this item in my Amazon Wishlist, an Amazon Seller called River Oak Group listed this cabinet for the lowest price I had seen, $199 shipped.  With some trepidation over the transit of a 115lb. package consisting primarily of glass from Florida to Los Angeles, I pulled the trigger.  There was also a post-sale issue which ROG responded to quickly and professionally, so kudos to them.The cabinet arrived via UPS glass-intact, which is a minor miracle, considering UPS is a BRUTAL environment for any package.  Ironically, by a label on the bottom of this unit, the U.S. distributor for this Taiwanese-built cabinet is only 40 miles away from us, but ROG is in Florida, so the cabinet went all the way from California to Florida to ROG, then all the way BACK again to us.  The ""global economy"", sigh.The following is our experience in unpacking and assembling this cabinet.  We offer it as some do's, definitely some don't's, and some off-the-cuff ideas for getting this thing assembled and installed in your home.First of all, you ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, do not want to open this package inside your house.  There was a mountain of of styro-detritus inside this package which came flying out once it was opened.  We unpacked ours on our front porch (see photo), and had to use a Shop-Vac after we were done to get all the tiny bits and pieces of styrofoam cleaned up.  If you have animals, you definitely want to make sure none of these bits ends up where they could consume them, as the ingested styro could block their intestines and potentially harm or kill the animal.As to the design and construction of the cabinet itself, surprisingly, the exterior rigidity of the cabinet comes primarily from the glass sides and rear.  Those four black wooden struts you see in the stock photo are primarily there to hold the shelf clips, and provide only minor structural support.About those struts: There is a recessed metal insert in each end which is threaded for included allen-headed screws.  These became a major problem: As the screws were tightened, several of the inserts began to back themselves out of the strut end.  We had to carefully thread the inserts back into the strut after coating the exterior of each with Gorilla Glue to anchor them (WARNING: you DO NOT want to get any glue inside the insert itself).  Also, on two ends, the wood had not been drilled deep enough for the screw length, so we had to drill those out AFTER the insert was reinserted and the glue had dried, carefully making sure the drill bit did not ruin the inner threads of the insert.  This was NOT fun.The struts themselves want to turn off-center as the screws on both the top and bottom plate are tightened.  We had to use a paper notepad, inserted between the glass and the strut, to keep the strut in the correct orientation during this part of the assembly.Once we got past those obstacles, it was time to insert the glass.  The instructions sequence is the rear panel first, which is inserted in a groove in the base, then the installation of two plastic pieces (that run hte entire length of the glass) that have channels for both the rear glass panels and the sides.  This was pretty nerve wracking, as the glass is not only difficult to get into the groove in the plastic, it made a continual snapping noise that sounded like the glass was cracking.  Getting the plastic channel to seat on the glass edge was NOT easy.After this comes the installation of the shelf clips.  The clips themselves are made of a soft rubbery plastic material that are a molded single unit combination of a barrel and suction cup, and a 2"" screw which inserts in the barrel and then is screwed into metal threaded inserts in the struts.  Caution needs to be observed when tightening each shelf clip, because the soft plastic will compress and possibly crack/break if over-tightened.  It is also not exactly easy to operate a screwdriver on each of these, as they are nearly up against the glass.  You want to put a towel in the bottom of the case while you're doing this, because if you slip and drop the screwdriver, you're going to most likely going visibly gouge/damage the finish. Again, surprisingly, the shelves themselves float independently inside the cabinet entirely on the suction cups, and provide no additional structural support to the cabinet itself.The door installation was pretty straghtforward.  Start (from unpacking) to finish (doors on and glass wiped down from installation fingerprints), it took us around 3 hours, due to all the above-described custom fixes we had to engineer.  We've given this unit a four-star rating, but if half stars were possible, we'd give it 3-1/2: It was definitely a more difficult and trying assembly than we would have liked.A final word: This unit sat in my Amazon Wishlist for several months while I monitored the price.  It ranged from low 300's to $245, then suddenly, for just a few days in July '15, ROG listed it for the $199 price.  As of this writing, ROG doesn't have any listed, and the price has risen back to $245.  So, you may want to be patient, drop this into your Wishlist and monitor it.  After everything we went thru to assemble this thing, if we had overpaid $50 -$100 for it, we'd REALLY be unhappy.  As is, we're semi-OK with the entire transaction and the finished product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39KPT0MHM82JX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPGP4KA#wasThisHelpful","R39KPT0MHM82JX","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pleasantly surprised to get excellent soundboard quality and, as always for this period, a great performance.  I docked only one star because at 50 minutes, this wasn't obviously the entire show (it was a King Biscuit Flower Hour broadcast), and there may also have been some futzing with artifical crowd applause in between songs.

"The Space Oddity ""rare version"" discussed in another review here is most likely a demo or rehearsal take; it does not have multi-track production, and sounds like a rough mix done in single take.  Wakeman's Mellotron is certainly not present, although someone is playing an organ.

"I'm not here to review Dylan (does anybody REALLY need to?).  The audio is fabulous, as the box supplies the '03, '05 & '09 remasters, along with 14 additional newly re-vamped titles, so from an audiophile standpoint, it's the ***t.  However, I'd still give this set a 4-3/4 star rating, the missing 1/4-star due to a couple of weird decisions regarding content and construction.When I was reviewing the tracklist for the ""Side Tracks"" set, something was tugging at my memory, until finally it dawned on me: On ""Biograph"", there were 18 unreleased tracks: 17 of them are on the ST set, which you would think would more or less obsolete Biograph in our collections.  However, the '97 remastered Biograph was processed with Sony's Super Bit Mapping, and some of the same tracks on ST don't sound quite as good.  So, don't part with your Biograph set just yet (and Dylan's per-song recollections in the Biograph booklet are pretty kewl).The other CACV1 decision that threw me for a loop was the inclusion of the original mix of Street Legal.  That mix sounded terrible on its original vinyl and CD.  However, when Sony unexpectedly popped up with a fabulous new Street Legal remix/remaster in the 2003 SACD hybrid Dylan releases, it was truly a revelation.  I was never sure what Dylan was trying to accomplish on that album, but I always liked it.  Not including that version in this set is really an injustice, because once you have compared the two, the original becomes unlistenable.The last thing: Sony has been parading out these great catalog box sets for the last few years.  The one negative constant that runs thru them all, however, are the cheap album sleeve cover replicas.  What makes this especially annoying for long time Japan mini-sleeve collectors, like myself, is that mini-sleeves are 135MM-square, where the sleeves for Sony's domestic box sets are 125MM.  The difference? A mini-sleeve CD slides easily out of it's cardboard album jacket, but getting the discs out of these smaller sleeves without getting your fingerprints on the data side is a challenge... with practice, you can do it, but it ain't easy, these smaller sleeves are just too tight around the disc.What's frustrating is: ALL of the 135MM mini-sleeve-sized print-ready artwork masters for ALL of these titles already exist at Sony Japan, because almost all of these box set titles have previously been released as mini-sleeves over the past 20 years... Why not just get that art and print properly-sized sleeves where you don't have to fight to remove a disc?  I've never understood that.  Even more maddeningly: Sony DID use 135MM sleeves in the U.S. Mono Box!All in all, these are minor nits, and this is truly an awesome set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO1V7EGW7JZ2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F6Y3FKW#wasThisHelpful","RO1V7EGW7JZ2P","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Much of this material had been previously available on two single disc releases, 1998's ""Tramcar To Tomorrow"" and 2002's ""Tremulous Antenna"", both now OOP.The three CD's on this set contain eleven additional previously-unreleased tracks from the same shows, and now also in-between-songs BN stage chatter that wouldn't fit on the two single-disc releases.  Both the previous CD's were mastered with loudness compression, while this new set is not, so there is a marked difference in overall volume when comparing this new set to the older titles.This new set also includes a Region-0 DVD with great footage of the band performing 13 songs live in various years (it's fun to watch the keyboard stacks grow as time progresses), in excellent video & sound quality.  Many of the segments have appeared on YouTube, but they all look far better on this DVD.One caveat: This set is inexplicably missing two Tramcar tracks, ""Crying To The Sky"" and ""Peace Of Mind"".  According to the liner notes, both were recorded the same day as the Hammersmith Odeon show which comprises the entirety of disc #2 in this new set.  The production credits are different however, so it's not clear if these two missing tracks were also from that show, or recorded earlier (a soundcheck, perhaps?).  Disc #2 is only 57 minutes in length, and the two missing tracks are nine minutes combined, so why were they left off?It's always great to get ANY additional vintage BBD live material, and with all the recent afore-mentioned releases, plus the incredible Live at Metropolis Studios London and Practice Of Everyday Life sets, this has been a heady and dizzingly wonderful last couple of years for die-hard BBD fans.

For content reviews, please see the other posts, and also those on the individual album titles.This CD compiles the two albums JJC recorded for the Silvertone label, 1990's Travel Log and 1992's #10.  All tracks from both albums are present, except for ""Digital Blues"".I purchased this CD in hopes of getting updated mastering.  In actuality, I found that even though no remastering had been performed, the overall volume level of this disc is actually lower then the two original CD's!  In these days of louded-up ""remasters"", that's a first in my experience.Both albums are great, and this seems to be a less expensive method for obtaining them... albeit missing the one track.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8MIUOKCS12XB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046BU01I#wasThisHelpful","R8MIUOKCS12XB","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From Wiki:""According to the liner notes, Frank's son Dweezil talked with his father shortly before Frank's death about the songs Frank had written that he would consider to be his ""signature"" tunes. These were ""Zoot Allures"", ""Black Napkins"" and ""Watermelon in Easter Hay"". The album compiles the original album versions of these three pieces, along with an alternate, live take of each, and the track ""Merely a Blues in A"", a blues improvisation recorded in Paris in 1974. It was released by The Zappa Family Trust.""From All Music Guide:""This 1996 CD compilation was the first one put out privately by the Zappa family following Frank Zappa's death in 1993 from prostate cancer. The music includes three new versions of familiar Zappa works, followed bytheir better-known counterparts that have previously appeared on both LPs and CDs. As Dweezil Zappa explains in his liner notes, this previously unreleased excerpt from ""Black Napkins"" is not yet fully formed; oddly enough, like the version that follows from Zoot Allures, the Napoleon Murphy Brock sax solo has been edited out. The new version of the next instrumental, ""Zoot Allures,"" fares better in comparison to the well-known take from the Zoot Allures CD, in spite of some distortion inadvertently added by the Tokyo PA system during its recording. ""Merely a Blues in A"" marks the initial release of a gritty blues likely improvised during a 1974 Paris concert. Finally, two versions of Zappa's sensational blues ""Watermelon in Easter Hay"" close the CD. The early 1978 concert version features a slightly faster tempo with minimal accompaniment by his band, although Zappa's solo ideas are already well conceived. Zappa's solo on the studio version, originally heard on the release Joe's Garage Acts 2 & 3, was taken from a concert recording and mixed with a sparse yet effective studio backing; it remains one of Zappa's most fascinating guitar solos. Unlike the posthumous new Zappa CDs that have appeared on Rykodisc after 1993, this one carries a rather high price tag, although it consists of only four new recordings among its seven tracks. The fancy package includes a removable stick-on moustache and goatee like the late composer's own facial hair. Zappa fans will likely enjoy this limited-edition CD.""Recorded 1974 - 1979Track listing:""Black Napkins"" LIVE 11/22/75 - 7:10""Black Napkins"" ZOOT ALLURES VERSION 2/76 - 4:15""Zoot Allures"" LIVE 2/5/76 - 15:45""Merely a Blues in A"" LIVE 9/27/74 - 7:27""Zoot Allures"" ZOOT ALLURES VERSION 10/76 - 4:05""Watermelon in Easter Hay"" LIVE 1/76 OR 2/76 - 6:42""Watermelon in Easter Hay"" JOE'S GARAGE VERSION 1979 - 8:42Personnel:Frank Zappa - lead guitar, vocalsTerry Bozzio - drumsNapoleon Murphy Brock - tenor saxophone, vocalsNorma Bell - vocalsAndr Lewis - keyboards, vocalsRoy Estrada - bass guitar, vocalsChester Thompson - drumsTom Fowler - bass guitarGeorge Duke - keyboards, vocalsDave Parlato - bass guitarRuth Underwood - marimbaLou Anne Neill - harpPatrick O'Hearn - bass guitarTommy Mars - keyboardsEd Mann - percussionAdrian Belew - rhythm guitarVinnie Colaiuta - drums-optometric abandonArthur Barrow - bassPeter Wolf - keyboardsWarren Cuccurullo - rhythm guitar","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R200CZZUZD7AWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KYLA1E#wasThisHelpful","R200CZZUZD7AWE","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently accidentally (which is actually French for ""moronically"") wrecked a +10-year-old pair of Sony -V900's.  I always liked the -V900's sound, but I was never happy with their external sound isolation, and was annoyed by the constant replacing of the ever-deteriorating ear pieces.  So, since I was faced with replacing them, after some research, I went with the DT770M's.The isolation is indeed fabulous.  I can hear virtually nothing of the external world.  Audio-wise, however, I don't like these as much as the Sony's.  The -V900's just had a more rich tone, where the -770's just sound flat to me.The Sony's were also more comfortable, but that is probably a compromise for the -770's superior isolation.I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD590's, but those can only be used in an environment where there is absolutely no external sound.  They are great-sounding, though, as good or better than the Sony's.There are times when I need the absolute isolation, so the -770's are perfect for that.  But, I would never recommend them for critical listening enjoyment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YUI7VMP3HQLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F4KWQI#wasThisHelpful","R2YUI7VMP3HQLQ","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some 30 years ago, a favorite author of mine, Harlan Ellison, published a set of stories, and in the foward, quoted the Irish poet Brendan Beehan, and that missive has stuck with me since: ""Critics are like eunuchs in a harem; they know how it's done, they've seen it done every day, but they're unable to do it themselves.""  And, as Ellison succinctly observed in the same essay, Roger Ebert, albeit one of the pre-eminent film historian/critics of our time, will also, unfortunately, always be the guy who penned the original screenplay to ""Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls"".I've always respected that wisdom, so even though I've posted hundreds of CD reviews here in this Forum, I've rarely opined to content, preferring to stay in the realm of audio quality and remastering, a region I feel comfortable to roam in.  I've always held most music criticism in contempt: I'm old enough to have read the original reviews of many albums Rolling Stone magazine panned back in the 70's that they now hail as ""classic"" and ""must-own"" recordings.  And quite honestly, a lot of what I read in this Forum just reinforces my reticence.But, I'm throwing my hat in the ring on this album and artist; I gotta, I gotta, I just gotta.Probably like many of you, I first heard Eytan Mirsky when I first saw that great indie movie, The Tao Of Steve.  The two tracks he recorded for the film really stuck in my head, and I remembered staying through the credits so I could write down the name of the artist.I'm a sucker for a power pop tune with a great hook, but it's like well-scripted comedy; it's REALLY hard to write, even harder to write well, and virtually impossible to do it consistently.Eytan Mirsky is that rare exception.  This guy just cranks out one great song after another, and in five albums, plus a bunch of rarities I've had the pleasure to acquire, I've never heard a song yet I would refer to as ""filler"".  The highest accolade I could think to afford this guy is this: On all of his albums, comprising nearly a hundred tracks, I've never used a fast-forward or track-skip key.  How many albums released in this day and age can you make that statement about?While I'm not comparing them to each other, I get the same feeling hearing a new Eytan album that I did the when I heard Elvis Costello's first or second album back in the 70's: You just can't stop listening to the songs, they just stick in your head all day, and you find yourself repeatedly listening to them all week.  I've had this album for 2 days, and while I can't give you an exact count of how many times I've played it, it's A LOT.It's been a long time since Eytan released his last album in 2004, but this one is worth the wait.  Same deal, each of the 13 tracks a perfect gem, and again, just ain't no filler to be had.  I buy 500-1000 CD's a year, and I can state with perfect certainty this will be in my Top 10 of 2012.It's also great to see him here on Amazon selling the album direct himself.  So, do yourself a favor: Support a great artist, buy his new album, and by all means, check out his previous work.  You can even send him an e-mail thru the Amazon system and he'll answer you (click on his Seller ID); in addition to being a great singer-songwriter, he's also just a helluva nice guy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RKNAX1MDN4LA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008GUKK4M#wasThisHelpful","R3RKNAX1MDN4LA","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is only for those interested in sound quality and/or collecting Japan mini-sleeves. For reviews regarding content, please see other posts in this forum, or go to All Music Guide (dot com). Also, due to Amazon's persistant and unfortunate programming policy of cross-pollinating reviews across different versions of the same CD title, this review may appear elsewhere: It was posted only on the July 2012 Japan mini-sleeve edition of this album.Prior to this, you had to go all the way back to the 1991 Mobile Fidelity edition, if you wanted to hear the best audio of the original LP mix.  All of the other Quadrophenia releases, and there have been a ton of them, were either remixed and/or were remastered with unacceptable levels of loudness compression (see the 2011 ""Deluxe Edition"").But, no more. Now, the Japanese have released a Japan-only 2012 remaster that HAS the original mix (yes, Jeff L, your ""seal sounds"" are back in ""The Dirty Jobs"" after the ""you men should remember how you used to fight"" lyric) and HASN""T been louded-up: The overall sound level of this new Japan version is approximately the same as the MFSL, so you won't get the speaker-blasting result like when you cue up the ""Deluxe Edition"".So, for Who purists who have been unhappy for over twenty years, the glorious day of finally getting the ultimate edition, of what many (including Townshend) consider to be the best Who album of all time, is finally here.  There is improved clarity in this edition, so there is no longer any need to go big-bucks out-of-pocket for the long-defunct MFSL set.In addition to the original LP booklet replication and the standard Japan lyric sheet, there are also two plates with the original Track vinyl LP Side A/B labels, a nice touch in many SHM releases.Although Japan has repeatedly reissued both SHM and Who mini-sleeve titles, there are no guarantees that this will be re-issued in the future.  Being that there are only 5000 copies of this release for world-wide distribution, if you really want the best-sounding original mix, I wouldn't delay in buying this.If you go to the Comments section below this review, I've included a link to a Tokyo-direct mini-sleeve retailer where you can get it at the lowest price.  A last note: Yes, there may be a few U.S. Sellers here on Amazon who will be close to the Tokyo price, but be aware that ""ImportCD's"" (who in actuality is Super D Distribution in Irvine CA, the U.S.'s largest CD wholesale distributor) and ""blowitoutofhere"", utilize flimsy adhesive-corrugated packaging that offers ABSOLUTELY no protection to a fragile mini-sleeve during transit; it's hard to just get the packaging open without bending the mini-sleeve jacket, as the adhesive interior sticks to the outer re-sealable plastic sleeve, and can actually bend/crease the mini-sleeve jacket! I've received bent and damaged mini-sleeves from both, but ImportCD's/Super D is the WORST company to try to get a postage-paid return from (they claim to reimburse the return postage after they've received the return, but then they bone you on the postage refund and don't respond to e-mails), so I would definitely advise against buying this title, or any mini-sleeve, from either.  I've been dealing with the Tokyo retailer for over a decade now; they know how to pack 'sleeves correctly, and you can pre-order months in advance of release at the lowest prices.  So, be forewarned: As stocks dwindle for this title, if you choose to buy from either of those U.S. retailers, if you get a bent or damaged 'sleeve, you may not be able to get a replacement for it.WHAT IS A JAPAN ""MINI-LP-SLEEVE"" CD?Have you ever lamented the loss of one of the 20th Century's great art forms, the 12"" vinyl LP jacket? Then ""mini-LP-sleeve"" CD's may be for you.Mini-sleeve CDs are manufactured in Japan under license. The disc is packaged inside a 135MM X 135MM cardboard precision-miniature replica of the original classic vinyl-LP album. Also, anything contained in the original LP, such as gatefolds, booklets, lyric sheets, posters, printed LP sleeves, stickers, embosses, special LP cover paper/inks/textures and/or die cuts, are precisely replicated and included. An English-language lyric sheet is always included, even if the original LP did not have printed lyrics.Then, there's the sonic quality: Often (but not always), mini-sleeves have dedicated remastering (20-Bit, 24-Bit, DSD, K2/K2HD, and/or HDCD), and can often (but not always) be superior to the audio on the same title anywhere else in the world. There also may be bonus tracks unavailable elsewhere.Each Japan mini-sleeve has an ""obi"" (""oh-bee""), a removable Japan-language promotional strip. The obi lists the Japan street date of that particular release, the catalog number, the mastering info, and often the original album's release date. Bonus tracks are only listed on the obi, maintaining the integrity of the original LP artwork. The obi's are collectable, and should not be discarded.All mini-sleeve releases are limited edition, but re-pressings/re-issues are becoming more common (again, not always). The enthusiasm of mini-sleeve collecting must be tempered, however, with avoiding fake mini-sleeves manufactured in Russia and distributed throughout the world, primarily on eBay. They are inferior in quality, worthless in collectable value, a total waste of money, and should be avoided at all costs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZG3NQR3G5275/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QWFBC2#wasThisHelpful","R2ZG3NQR3G5275","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On one hand, it's great to finally have this release, which is more or less the actual first Brand X album, available again.On the other hand, it's not-so-great to once again hear painfully-obvious loudness compression applied to a fabulous recording, especially since you have to spend a lot of money to get it.If you have the original CD, I would advise hanging on to it.  It's just a big chunk of dough to obtain the same result you can achieve by just turning up the volume on the older disc: I didn't hear any additional clarity or revelations in the Japan disc to justify its price tag, and I'm well-established in this Forum for my disdain of the SHM ""improved audio"" smoke-and-mirrors BS claims.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UKA0JMEVCWA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082DTF0I#wasThisHelpful","R3UKA0JMEVCWA0","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I installed this card on an HP DC7900 PC that has only SATA on the MB.  I had purchased a 3TB 6Gbps SATA III HDD that I wanted to run JBOD inside the case for storage.  However, when the PC attempted to boot with the card installed and the 3TB HDD attached, I got a BIOS error message: ""110-Out of memory space for option ROMs"", which is defined by HP as ""Recently-added PCI expansion card contains an option ROM too large to download during POST.""  I removed the data cable and the PC booted normally.  Re-attached the cable after W7 booted and the drive appeared.  I just couldn't boot with the drive attached to the card.  E-mailed Syba tech support and got a response ""Please go into your BIOS Utility Manager and disable ""Boot from add on card"" or something similar to that. It sounds like your system is attempting to boot from the Seagate HD.""  I checked the BIOS; the boot procedure from my 180GB Intel SSD primary was in the correct order.  Tried a few other things, including HP's direction of disabling NIC PXE option ROM, but nothing worked.  Wrote Syba back, sent them a screen capture of the HP error message page, asked them if they had a similar product with a smaller ROM-footprint.  I got no response; thanks a bunch, Syba.  Returned the Syba to Amazon, posted this negative review, and bought a StarTech 4-port card to see how that works.  Stay tuned:).5/30 UPDATE: The StarTech card arrived. Plugged it in, didn't even have to load the driver, BING, it works, and the machine boots normally.

"I purchased this CD, as I do the majority of my CD's, with the intention of ripping it into MP3 format.  I use Exact Audio Copy/LAME, the best ripping and encoding engines available, and several Plextor drives (708, 716 & 760), the industry-superior units Plex produced before throwing in the towel on consumer products.  I also ran the disc in a Sony XA7ES, the best CD-only transport Sony ever produced.When I received this CD, the last track ""Heaven"" would not finish ripping, stalling at 95% complete.  It also froze and skipped in the XA7.  I contacted Nonesuch Records, sent the CD back, and they sent a replacement.  However, the new disc not only stalled on the same track, it did so at around 20% complete, so it was actually worse than the first CD.

"I purchased this stand, based on the reviews posted here previously to this date.  However, after working with it for a very short period of time, I returned it as actually defective.  There are multiple reasons why I was not happy with it, and I would NEVER recommend using this stand for anything other than maybe as a portable table to lay tools on, where you could cut a piece of wood and screw it to the quick-disconnect mounting arms.  Here are my ""FLIMSY"" issues with this product:1.) The legs have slight play after they have been supposedly locked into their down position, and accordingly, the stand wiggles.  After setting it up, I had to push each leg outward slightly to plant it more solidly.2.) The extending arms are too loose in their tracks, so when the material supports are attached, they never achieve 100% support for any stock placed on them.  I test-mounted a miter saw, but I could never get a 2X4 or 2X6 to lay flat on the saw's main plate.3.) The chintzy design of the material supports can never be adjusted to compensate for the play in the extender arms. I played with all three adjustment knobs for half-an-hour, but could never get either roller properly leveled.  As far as I was concerned, #'s 2 & 3 qualified as defective, and became the basis for the return.  One other reviewer noted this and stated he shimmed the supports... Really?  I'm a break-it-down-at-the-end-of-the-day guy, so I've got a lot better use for my time than pissing around shimming these supports every time I set it up again (like whatever project I was going to work on using this stand?).4.) The channels on each mounting arm end directly over the lock-down handles (see photo #2 above).  There's no way to get a socket wrench in that small gap to tighten the mounting screws (and good luck getting your fingers in there with a washer & nut); the only thing that fits is a 13mm crescent wrench (the size of the supplied mounting nuts/screws), and you only get maybe a 30-degree turn.  Apparently, it was more important to save the 1"" additional metal in manufacturing cost that would have been necessary to extend the end of each arm properly to make them socket-wrench accessible.  Yes, you could mount the screws upside down, but for myself, I'd rather not have the end of the screws exposed to catch on clothing, etc., and also, installing  them that way wouldn't work with the mounting plates on many miter saws, etc.5.) After mounting my miter saw to the arms while attached to the stand, I removed the saw.  The next day, when I went to re-install it, I struggled to get the arms to settle properly on the frame, and I damn near dropped the saw twice in the attempt.  My back was not a happy camper after that episode.However, here's THE SHOWSTOPPER:6.) NEVER, EVER pick this stand up on one end so that only two legs are on the ground: The locking push tabs are too weak and loose in their mating holes.  I discovered that, even with nothing mounted to it, if you just lift up one end, one or both of the opposite legs will collapse from just the stand's own inherent weight!  If you have a heavy piece of equipment mounted, and you're stupid enough to pick up one end (or if you accidentally bang into one end of the stand), well, that's my definition of ""POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS"".  This problem is noted in many of the reviews here.So, if you're absolutely determined to buy this stand because of its low price, after you initially set it up, you want to make DAMN SURE you:1.) Adjust (push outward) each leg tight against the end frame to eliminate the stand's inherent wobble as much as possible,2.) have it on completely level ground,3.) never pick up the entire stand and try to move it after you set anything of weight on top of it (read the other reviews and see what happened to one guy who tried exactly that),4.) never set this up in a high-traffic worksite area, especially where heavy materials are being moved around and the stand could be inadvertently run-into, and5.) always turn the stand completely upside-down to collapse the legs; if you're futz'ing with the locking tabs on one end, and the stand collapses on the other, there's a good chance you're going to pinch your fingertips.What did I end up with? A DeWalt (and no, I don't work for DeWalt, and as you can see by the ""Amazon Verified Purchase"" logo above this review, I actually bought the Denali and tested it).  The DeWalt is twice as much money, but it has none of the problems listed above: The legs are tight when locked and the stand is completely stable, the extender arms don't wobble, the material supports are level, you can get a socket wrench under all 4 corners of the mounting arms, the mounting arms have a like-butter-smooth on/off action, the leg locking tabs don't slip and have clever release handles, so you'll never get pinched... Now, THIS is a safe and properly-designed work-stand worth my hard-earned bucks.DeWalt also has all kinds of useful accessories available for its stand (I've already purchased an extra set of arms and the wide roller supports), but there's nothing on Amazon for the Denali, not even spare mounting arms, in case you wanted to pre-mount several pieces of equipment for quick change-outs... and, unlike the Denali's, the DeWalt mounting arms have convenient rubber feet which aren't going to grind into/scratch whatever surface you place them on.  And, as many other reviewers have noted, if you need replacement parts for the Denali, as they would say in China where it's built, ""rotsa ruck""; DeWalt has an 800- number right in the manual.To me, all that is worth the extra money, if not for only for just sheer peace of mind.  I can see there are plenty of positive reviews here about the Denali, so I sorta feel like the funny-colored ""pickle"" in the punchbowl, but I'm calling it like I saw it (yep, pun intended!).","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ3F476TQE8OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MS7B2K#wasThisHelpful","RJ3F476TQE8OP","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I disagree with ""Jason"" completely.  I already own the Retrospective disc and purchased this disc based on his recommendation to compare.The mastering on this disc is exactly the same as released on the out-of-print 1996 Retrospective disc, which has now been re-released.  Used copies of  Retrospective are even available here on Amazon for less than the price of this newer compilation.Why buy the older release?  It has sixteen tracks compared to only ten on this disc.  Retrospective also has a real booklet, where this disc has only a front sheet.  Sony's ""Super Hit"" series are produced for the cheapy rackjobs, like Wal-mart.The only real reason to buy this disc, if you ABSOLUTELY have to have it, are the three remastered tracks that don't appear on Retrospective, ""Looking Over My Shoulder"", ""Crash And Burn"" and ""Rip In Heaven"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R382AL0PN43FG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QCKJ8Y#wasThisHelpful","R382AL0PN43FG7","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a long-time fan of this quirky recording, I previously purchased the ""Millennium"" version 10 years ago, where it has resided in my collection since.  However, I noticed in the Marketplace section an Amazon Seller ""fazonrecords-sopwithcamel"" had a ""2006 remastered"" edition, denoted with the text ""Some say this is more faithful to the original vinyl recording of 1973 than the out of print 2001 version.""Well, I bought it and compared it: I am definitely not one of the ""sayers"" on that claim.  I find it sorely lacking in the clarity and detail of the earlier release.  The bass is also annoyingly pumped up on the 2006 edition.The Seller is really doing a disservice to consumers, as they have used the same catalog number and UPC for this release.  Since this was a completely different mastered version, the releasing company should have issued the newer disc under at least a different UPC so the two can be discerned.  The only difference between the two is cosmetic: Both have a clear disc tray, and the front spine reads ""MILLENNIUM EDITION"" on the former, and ""REMASTERED 2006"" on the latter.If you're looking for this album, and you want the best-sounding version, I would definitely pay the extra money and get the Millennium disc.  Be sure to e-mail any potential Seller and confirm which edition you're buying.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V5LW8GW5CRFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005B2V7#wasThisHelpful","R1V5LW8GW5CRFT","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Inevitably, when obtaining a compilation package, the reviews tend to focus on favorite songs left off the set.  Here, quite the opposite, I'm taking mild issue with what was included.The first 7 tracks are Split Enz recordings.  Now, no doubt that TF played an integral part in that fabulous band, but do we really need all those tracks once again?  They're all on numerous SE ""best of's"", and most real SE fans will have also purchased the excellent remasters released a few years ago.  So, why waste precious space?  There's plenty of other fantastic TF material, both from his own albums, and others where he guested, that coulda-shoulda been included here.Also, even though the ad text above trumpets ""Crowded House"" material, there are no CH-recorded tracks, just remakes of 3 CH songs.  So, again, if they included the Split Enz material, why no Crowded House?  This was released on Capitol, where CH resides, so there should have been no licensing issues.  Sorta strange.On the technical side, however, all the material has been excellently remastered, so I do highly recommend adding this set to your TF collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ISU5KEP4JP9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PHVGYK#wasThisHelpful","R2ISU5KEP4JP9C","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So, let's start with a little background for the uninitiated: The 1972 LP release.The LSO ""Tommy"" was the original ""album box set"": No record company had ever attempted such an elaborate and ornate release in the rock genre.  The box came with a beautiful 12X12 lavish ""coffee table"" book and a fold-out card of a pinball machine.  The Tommy box truly set the bar for all such sets to come.In 1989 and 1996, Tommy was released by different catalogue houses on CD (Rhino & Castle, respectively).  However, both came in standard jewel cases and no attempt was made to replicate the original box or book.  Both of these releases subsequently went OOP and fetch high prices to this day in the used after-market.In 2009, U.K. Repertoire Records took a crack at finally reproducing the entire original set, and did the graphics part exceptionally well.  However, the mastering was TERRIBLE (see my review on that page), so it was a real heartbreaker.Now, in 2011, the Japanese have swung for the fences with a ""Blu-Spec"" remastered release in a mini-sleeve replication of the original set.So, in comparing these four editions, you have to consider the mastering, Blu-Spec, the graphics and the closeness of the replication to the original release.Let's start with the audio.First, the 1989, 1996 and 2009 editions are single disc sets.  The 2011 is a 2-disc affair.  There's no reason for this as the 71-minute recording would have fit on one disc, and has the downsides of increasing the cost of the set, and making you change discs to hear the entire performance.The new mastering from the 2011 is slightly better than the Rhino releases: Obviously, from the original engineering/miking/recording of the performances, there is not much real improvement to be had.""Blu-Spec"" joins a list of Japan-only implementations of substrate material derived from LCD manufacturing (the others being ""SHM"" and ""HQCD""); all these schemes are fronted by different Japanese companies, and each was delivered with identical promises that the LCD material would deliver better optical read performance, and subsequently, supposedly better sound.Unfortunately, there is no discernable audible benefit from the implementation of each LCD scheme, and even more unfortunately, prices for these releases are much higher than regular CD editions.  As I have written about extensively in reviews concerning these releases, I have never been able to hear a wit of difference between an LCD-implemented CD, and a regular-substrate CD, of the same master (please note those last four words).  As far as I am concerned, ""Blu-Spec"" is fittingly denoted by its initials, and I am consistently annoyed by the hiked prices for these LCD-material titles.So, that leaves the graphics of the 2009 and 2011 releases.I give a VERY slight edge in my preference to the Repertoire.  Their rendering of the book is not-as-accurate, as the original had the lyrics printed on the same page as the wonderful illustrations.  Repertoire cleverly chose to print the lyrics separately in the rear of the book, and in doing so, isolated the  artwork, which makes them even more appreciable.Repertoire also included a separate booklet with detailed info of the original 2 performances, and the challenges presented in bringing the concerts to a live audience (now, if only they had done a better job on the audio!).  The Japanese have also apparently provided some text along the same lines, but unless you can read Kanji, you're SOL.Where Repertoire provided a fold-out photo copy of the pinball machine graphic, the Japanese have turned that into a 2CD digipak with the design front and back in raised graphics, just totally super-kewl.  Both sets come in slipcovers, but as the Repertoire disc resides in a plastic tray inside a digipak sleeve, it is thicker than the Japan edition.So, there you have it for this 2011 release vs. the previous three editions: The best remastering, fagetaboudit on Blue-Spec, and take your pick on the graphics, where the Japanese, as they do in virtually all mini-sleeve releases, strove for accuracy to the original LP set, but where Repertoire imaginatively produced the slightly-better booklet of the two.  There's no longer any reason to pay big bucks for a used copy of the original two LSO Tommy releases, just buy the Japan set.A final note: I'm not sure why the Amazon info above reads ""Indie Europe/Zoom"" for the releasing label, and the number of discs is wrong.  The Japan releasing company for this set is Archive, and I double-checked the UPC on the obi on the Amazon Seller system, and it links to this page.  I have submitted corrections, and hopefully, Amazon will correct them.Whew.  I now retire to recover from elephantitis of the keyboard.  Whichever version you choose, happy listening!  It's a fabulous, landmark performance, and your Who collection is not complete without it.WHAT IS A JAPAN ""MINI-LP-SLEEVE"" CD?Have you ever lamented the loss of one of the 20th Century's great art forms, the 12"" vinyl LP jacket?  Then ""mini-LP-sleeve"" CD's may be for you.Mini-sleeve CDs are manufactured in Japan under license.  The disc is packaged inside a 135MM X 135MM cardboard precision-miniature replica of the original classic vinyl-LP album. Also, anything contained in the original LP, such as gatefolds, booklets, lyric sheets, posters, printed LP sleeves, stickers, embosses, special LP cover paper/inks/textures and/or die cuts, are precisely replicated and included.  An English-language lyric sheet is always included, even if the original LP did not have printed lyrics.Then, there's the sonic quality: Often (but not always), mini-sleeves have dedicated remastering (20-Bit, 24-Bit, DSD, K2/K2HD, and/or HDCD), and can often (but not always) be superior to the audio on the same title anywhere else in the world.  There also may be bonus tracks unavailable elsewhere.Each Japan mini-sleeve has an ""obi"" (""oh-bee""), a removable Japan-language promotional strip.  The obi lists the Japan street date of that particular release, the catalog number, the mastering info, and often the original album's release date.  Bonus tracks are only listed on the obi, maintaining the integrity of the original LP artwork.  The obi's are collectable, and should not be discarded.All mini-sleeve releases are limited edition, but re-pressings/re-issues are becoming more common (again, not always).  The enthusiasm of mini-sleeve collecting must be tempered, however, with avoiding fake mini-sleeves manufactured in Russia and distributed throughout the world, primarily on eBay.  They are inferior in quality, worthless in collectable value, a total waste of money, and should be avoided at all costs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33IQ8TDLLTOSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SATLUI#wasThisHelpful","R33IQ8TDLLTOSZ","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being the 2nd reviewer for this set, and having read T. Fleming's enthusiastic post, I will now ministrate to my respective side of the hydrant.Ten years ago, I opted for the Queen catalog in Japan mini-sleeves, which I believe had Japan-dedicated remasters.  I never heard any of the artifacting in the Toshiba discs that Mr. Fleming speaks of in the European releases.  So, please remember as you are reading this, I do not have the domestic Hollywood or European releases, only the Japan discs: If you do not own those, you will probably not reach the same conclusions as I did.On the heels of those recent, terrible Rolling Stones ""remasters"", Universal has applied the same odious loudness compression method to another high profile catalog: Queen.  If you're not familiar with term, the technical explanation is the application of an increasingly high ratio of compression to the dynamic range of a particular recording, and then increasing the gain of the recording, until the peaks have reached maximum.In layman's terms: There are no longer any quiet or loud passages in the recording, EVERYTHING is at the same volume.  Go to Wikipedia and search ""loudness wars"". In that article, there is also a link to an excellent You Tube audio/video demonstration.Basically, the ubiquity of the iPod is the culprit in this plague: When music is played back thru earbuds in any environment with ambient noise present, by having the volume artificially jacked across the entire music spectrum, you can hear the content more clearly.When you listen to these new Queen editions in a home system, however, it's just a sheer wall of high volume sound; there is no dynamic range remaining.  The vocals, instrumentation and orchestrations are all now in competition, rather than being in harmony, with each other, and the overall volume of each album is much louder than the previous versions.  There is also a noticeable loss of clarity in the cymbals on the 2011 releases; they sound much sharper on the Japan discs.All of this adds up to a real heartbreaker, because a lot of the bonus material is excellent, and Queen fans have been waiting for a long time for this kind of look under the hood.There was also no reason to split the bonus material to a 2nd disc on any of these releases, other than to charge a higher price for each title.  None of these albums with their respective bonus material approach the full capacity of a CD.  There was even room on each album disc to include not only the new bonus material, but also the bonus tracks from the earlier editions.  So, especially with the addition of a 2nd CD in each set, making each title more expensive, Universal's choice not to do so borders on the egregious.NOVEMBER 2011 UPDATE: Amazon has lowered the price on this set by nearly half.  I was already regretting buying this set; now I'm just downright pissed, since it's ""an Amazon Exclusive"".  As for the next three boxes (#2 is already out as of this writing), you might not want to buy them until they've also been discounted!","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ORWNJJA30YSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SBB0LU#wasThisHelpful","R2ORWNJJA30YSM","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you like your Sade vocals buried by the instumentation, then this set is for you.  The loudness compression that has been applied to this set has completely obliterated the dynamic range of the original recordings.To set your expectations of what you will hear: If you've been listening to Sade past three decades on any previous CD release, your ear has been trained to expect Sade's voice to be in the front of the soundstage, just like if she were singing on stage in front of a band in a small club.  When you play any of the tracks from this bastardized set, you will immediately notice that her vocals are buried and competing with the instruments, like she had been physically moved from the front of the stage to behind the drum kit.  The volume of every track is REALLY loud, much louder than the older CD's, and quickly tiring to listen to.If you're not familiar with the term ""loudness compression"": Go to Wikipedia and search ""loudness wars"". In that article, there is also a link to an excellent You Tube audio/video demonstration of this reprehensible practice, which is being propagated by bean-counter record company executives.The technical explanation of loudness compression is the application of an increasingly high ratio of compression to the dynamic range of a particular recording, and then increasing the gain of the recording, until the peaks have reached maximum. In layman's terms, what this means is there are no longer any quiet or loud passages in the recording, EVERYTHING is at the same volume.Basically, the iPod is responsible for the proliferation of this practice: When music is played back thru iPod earbuds in any environment where there is ambient noise present, by having the volume artificially jacked across the entire music spectrum, you can hear the content more clearly. However, when you listen to the same recording thru a home audio system, it literally  sounds like the music is emanating from a megaphone.  The ""remastering"" on this set is a classic example of this insidious process.If you own any of the 2000 remasters, hang on to them, AND DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SET!","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OLXESBBBJU64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TB8GS4#wasThisHelpful","R3OLXESBBBJU64","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is only for those interested in sound quality and/or collecting Japan mini-sleeves. For reviews regarding content, please see other posts in this forum, or go to All Music Guide (dot com). Also, due to Amazon's unfortunate programming policy of cross-pollinating reviews across different versions of the same CD title, this review may appear elsewhere: It was posted only on the 2011 Japan mini-sleeve version of this album.This 2011 release of the first 10 Joni Mitchell studio albums (the live ""Miles Of Aisles"" is not included) in mini-sleeve SHM-CD format all contain the same HDCD-encoded masters that were released in 1990. Anyone hoping for updated audio may be somewhat disappointed, although the 1990 CD's are just fine, from a faithful remastering/dynamic range standpoint.As I've stated previously, I've never been able to discern any audible difference in the application of the SHM LCD substrate material on an SHM-disc and non-SHM-disc of the same master, and that holds true here.So, for an investment of +$300 (and that's only if you know how to pre-order them directly in Japan; here on Amazon, a full set would be much higher), all you're really getting is the mini-sleeve replicas. Granted, they're wonderful, exact replications, even matching the heavy cardboard of original LP's, but thasa lotta moolah for just the 'sleeves.For 'sleeve collector's, this leaves only ""Aisles"" and ""Shadows And Light"" that have not been released in mini-sleeve versions (all the Geffen titles were released several years ago).  Hopefully, that is an oversight that will be corrected in the near future.WHAT IS A JAPAN ""MINI-LP-SLEEVE"" CD?Have you ever lamented the loss of one of the 20th Century's great art forms, the 12"" vinyl LP jacket? Then ""mini-LP-sleeve"" CD's may be for you.Mini-sleeve CDs are manufactured in Japan under license. The disc is packaged inside a 135MM X 135MM cardboard precision-miniature replica of the original classic vinyl-LP album. Also, everything included in the original LP, such as gatefolds, booklets, lyric sheets, posters, printed LP sleeves, stickers, embosses, special LP cover paper/inks/textures and die cuts, are is precisely replicated and included, An English-language lyric sheet is always included, even if the original LP did not have printed lyrics.Then, there's the sonic quality: Often (but not always), mini-sleeves have dedicated remastering (20-Bit, 24-Bit, DSD, K2/K2HD, and/or HDCD), and can often (but not always) be superior to the audio on the same title anywhere else in the world. There also may be bonus tracks unavailable elsewhere.Each Japan mini-sleeve has an ""obi"" (""oh-bee""), a removable Japan-language promotional strip. The obi lists the Japan street date of that particular release, the catalog number, the mastering info, and often the original album's release date. Bonus tracks are only listed on the obi, maintaining the integrity of the original LP artwork. The obi's are collectable, and should not be discarded.All mini-sleeve releases are limited edition, but re-pressings/re-issues are becoming more common (again, not always). The enthusiasm of mini-sleeve collecting must be tempered, however, with avoiding fake mini-sleeves manufactured in Russia and distributed throughout the world, primarily on eBay. They are inferior in quality, worthless in collectable value, a total waste of money, and should be avoided at all costs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R205T1Z8ZW9ZEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004L296DA#wasThisHelpful","R205T1Z8ZW9ZEH","AGEJE3WH26UBR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGEJE3WH26UBR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The theme of this event was the 12th anniversary celebration of the company.P.W.G. Tag Team Champions Young Bucks vs. Anglico & Jack Evans started out as a riot but evolved into a tag team match with both teams relying on double team & high flying maneuvers with Anglico & Evans working a hyper speed pace causing the Bucks of all people to slow it down but still working at a fast pace. Akira Tozawa returned after over a 3 year period to face off against Ricochet in a match that got more competitive & physical over time as they both were having fun with the other's offense including Tozawa trying to do moonsault but resulted in him german suplexing himself. Other matches include Mike Bailey vs. Chris Hero in a ""size vs. speed"" match with both men attacking with strikes, Tomasso Ciampa vs. Trevor Lee in a slow methodical match with some impact, Brian Cage vs. Johnny Gargano in a ""power vs. technical"" match, World's Cutest Tag Team vs. Team Tremendous in what became an impromptu Texas Tornado Match that saw the biggest Canadian Destroyer ever, and Andrew Everett vs. Rich Swann in such an evenly matched contest that the commentators stated that it was like Everett was ""looking in dirty mirror.""Normally P.W.G. always delivers but this was a show was at a disadvantage with a lot of the regulars (including P.W.G. Champion Roderick Strong) working other taped shows that night (TNA, Ring Of Honor, Global Force, ect.) resulting in this show not really leaving ""first gear"" until the final two matches so this was a solid show but definitely a step down from the quality normally expected.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R215RZBK8SLI12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013XMZZHE#wasThisHelpful","R215RZBK8SLI12","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The theme of this event was that it was the third time in history that the card or talents were never advertised leading up to the event so all the matches would be a complete mystery to the crowd throughout the night.P.W.G. Tag Team Champions Andrew Everett & Trevor Lee made their debuts against each other at the previous Mystery Vortex event & they tried to rekindle the magic here before being interrupted by the Young Bucks, who were in Japan the previous day, leading to a tag title match that saw both teams executing some double team offense & aerial moves while one team singled out an injured body part with the bigger story here being whom decided to get physically involved in the match including a long awaited return.  P.W.G. Champion Roderick Strong faced off against ""Speedball"" Mike Bailey with Bailey using his fast educated feet throughout the match while Strong used continuous impactful offense both in & outside of the ring.  Other matches include Tamasso Ciampa vs. Johnny Gargano that saw both men fighting in the crowd taking out the first few rows along with executing impactful moves using all areas of the ring, World's Cutiest Tag Team vs. Monster Mafia in one of Josh Alexander's final matches that saw both teams take as much as they gave, Chris Hero vs. Zack Zaber Jr. in a submission based bout that saw both men trying to hurt each other & one man focusing on a specific injured body part, Biff Busick vs. the debuting Timothy Thatcher with both men using a heavily based submission style focusing specifically on the joints of the body to the point where the winner won by a chokeout, and the debuting John Silver vs. Brian Cage.You can't go wrong with P.W.G. & this was a standout event that definitely left a lasting impression at the end of the night that's worth checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCTOIAS5EWZYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HAK784#wasThisHelpful","RCTOIAS5EWZYM","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It should be noted that this was WWE's first Network exclusive PPV event to their network (excluding previous NXT specials).Elimination Chamber Match: WWE Tag Team Champions New Day vs. Prime Time Players vs. Lucha Dragons vs. Cesaro & Tyson Kidd vs. Los Matadores vs. The Ascension - While the rules & structure for this Elimination Chamber match was the same, this was the first time since the creation of the match that tag teams were participants. Various highlights include various high flying maneuvers executed from various spots of the chamber from the top of the pods to off the top of the roof, one man climbing around the chamber like he was Spiderman, one team trying to get involved in the action before they were legal in the match making them the odd team out, and how more than one team had a ""numbers advantage"" over the others. This was a really good Chamber match with lots of crazy spots & some teams looking better than they had been in a very long time.Divas Champion Nikki Bella vs. Paige vs. Naomi - This was one of those triple threat matches that was non-stop action with some divas using different strategies such as trying to isolate one while focusing on the other & trying to take advantage of of a situation stealing pins along with other moments like one being thrown hard against the announce table, a facebuster across the knee, a tower of doom powerbomb, and one of the scariest looking reverse frankensteiners I've seen in a good match with all the divas working hard here.John Cena vs. Kevin Owens - A rare ""champion vs. champion"" match as Owens was in control early staying one step ahead of Cena having counters to his offense & delivering some impactful moves of his own while continuing to taunt him whenever possible before Cena was able to take advantage of an opening as they traded momentum with Owens attempting Cena's own offense against him while Cena hit some impactful offense from different areas such as the top rope to a springboard position`with a finish that definitely shocked the world as this was the type of performance that makes a superstar & impact which it did for Kevin Owens in his WWE PPV debut as he was able to pull out the performance from Cena that pushed him to the limit.Neville vs. Bo Dallas - It should be noted as the announcers pointed out that both men were former NXT Champions as it was Neville who defeated Dallas for the championship as Neville took the advantage with a series of kicks & even going aerial to the outside while Dallas attempted to ground him while taking some short cuts in an average match but the best Dallas has looked in a significant amount of time.Intercontinental Championship/Elimination Chamber Match: Ryback vs. R-Truth vs. Mark Henry vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. King Barrett vs. Sheamus - Just like the tag team championship match earlier in the night, this was the first time that the Intercontinental Championship was on the line in this match after Daniel Bryan forfeited the championship earlier in the week while Mark Henry was a last minute participant due to the injury to Rusev earlier in the week. Various highlights include one man bringing the fight to one of the participants before he could exit the pod, how one of the participants ""escaped"" out his pod into the match while later another was trapped inside, unlikely alliances made to eliminate members, one man who was used to destroy the pods...twice, and when it got down to the final two as this was a solid chamber match.WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - The former Shield members reignite their feud that started a year earlier with members of the Authority in J&J Security & Kane coming out with Rollins while Roman Reigns was banned from ringside. Ambrose was in control early before distractions allowed Seth to take advantage as they were evenly matched with both men having the same offensive maneuvers in mind along with sacrificing themselves such as a suicide dive that landed both men over the announce table & a clothesline out of Cactus Jack's old playbook that took both men over the top along with aerial offense from top rope elbows & knees to their standing opponents along with impactful offense such as a release powerbomb into the barricade & lariats turning their opponents inside out. These two always had natural chemistry & never had a bad match (just bad endings) against each other & this was no different as it was very physical from start to finish.On the pre-show match was Stardust vs. Zack Ryder along with MizTV featuring Daniel Bryan. This was another solid show from start to finish with both chambers delivering some good action & other standout matches on the card so in the end, this is worth checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1190N2LHXR9RC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YUN2VIW#wasThisHelpful","R1190N2LHXR9RC","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back by popular demand is another volume of ""Best Of WCW Monday Nitro"" with Diamond Dallas Page once again returning (looking like he wore the exact same outfit) as the host of this series.  A couple of notes here in that some of the theme music has been changed again (Sting's ""Metallica"" theme changed to his ""crow"" theme, Chris Jericho uses his WWE theme, Hollywood Hogan's ""Voodoo Child"" into a generic version of that) while Michael Buffer's ring announcing & image hasn't been removed unlike the previous sets.Normally I give my review at the end but I'll leave it here as the usual criticism I have for these sets is that they caught some memorable moments here while still leaving out some important ones but this volume does that more than the previous two as I see no justification in not having Arn Anderson's emotional retirement speech while moments like Hall & Nash diving in a swimming pool & the first verbal confrontation between Savage & DDP when they had better & more memorable confrontations on the show plus I wasn't a big fan of the whole nWo Monday Nitro segment where they took close to 20 minutes to tear down the set only to have another long promo segment dedicating the night to Hogan.  Same goes for the matches as well as some of these were picked for name value only but were nothing more than clusters & easily forgettable while others made question ""what was the point of that?"" when again quality matches are still left on the cutting room floor (I remember one lucha libre crusierweight match where Juvi was sent into the crowd landing on a fan in the front row, another Juvi/Kidman match from that same era that was probably their most physical encounter, the forgotten Hogan/Giant match before Souled Out '98 where Giant got a clean pinfall win, one of the Sting/Flair matches from 1999, we got Sting's title win from DDP on a previous set but still missing the four way where he lost it later in the night, Flair's last World Championship victory, and after the influx of the Network & Mysterio no longer under contract that I think we can finally start showing the matches without his mask).  The positives I can say is that with this being the third volume is that we got some performances from some of the high to mid-card talent that constantly gets overshadowed & forgotten about (Johnny B. Badd, Kidman, Booker T, DDP himself, and tons of Bret Hart matches that he was almost the featured star of the set) while I do admit they got some of the important & favorite moments that was forgotten about in the past (like kicking Giant out of the nWo).  In the end, this would definitely be a set I highly recommend to pick up for fans of WCW, the Monday Night War era, or specifically Bret Hart since this is the most that his WCW career has ever been showcased.Matches include:Randy Savage vs. Lex Luger - Luger put his WCW career on the line here as both men started the match off so intense that they locked up & went from the ring to the outside without breaking as Luger used his power along with taking advantage of his surroundings while Savage went aerial in the ring & to the outside while also fighting fire with fire with the ringside environment in a intense physical match that ended with more questions about Luger than there was before the match.Oct. '95WCW Television Champion Johnny B. Badd vs. Eddie Guerrero - Both men were trading momentum early exchanging the same holds along with different offense from a springboard position along with a series of counters & reversals as they got equally more competitive as the time went on delivering such impactful holds from a DDT to tombstone piledriver along with having the same offense in mind at the same time as this was a highly competitive encounter between two evenly matched opponents.Nov. '95Sting vs. Diamond Dallas Page - DDP got an unfair early advantage as he resorted to various brawling & illegal tactics to keep the advantage while Sting relied on his trademark offense in the ring & even going out over the top to the floor at one point in what was a solid match but good showcasing for DDP at this stage in his career against a top talent.Jan. '96WCW Champion Ric Flair vs. Randy Savage - Randy Savage played his own set of mind games against Flair coming into the match as he was lead to the ring by an entourage of women (featuring an unnamed Linda Hogan & Debra McMichael) lead by former Horsemen manager Woman who had a strong response to when Flair attempted to relive old times as this match started off mostly on the floor before eventually making it back & staying in the ring with both men exchanging momentum in what was a short & average but entertaining match here memorable for end result.Jan. '96[Macho Madness: The Randy Savage Collection]Sister Sherri vs. Madusa - This started out as an interview with Sherri over what happened a week earlier at her wedding only for Madusa to attack her taking this fight to the floor whipping Sherri into the steps & suplexling her out of her shoes only for Sherri to take back the advantage in the ring as this was a very short match but aggressive for what it was as this was definitely about who would be the last woman standing.Jan. '96Lex Luger vs. Kevin Nash - Luger recently became the #1 contender for the WCW Championship but Nash made it clear Luger would would have to go through him to get his shot at Hollywood Hogan as Nash had fellow nWo members at ringside who kept causing a distraction whenever Luger started to get the advantage as the match was just a backdrop to the bigger story of who & what came to Luger's aid against the nWo.Apr. '97Giant & Diamond Dallas Page vs. Harlem Heat - This was a segment more than anything else as the nWo attacked & completely dominated not just all the participants in the match but anyone else who tried to get involved along with other areas of the show as well.May '97WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs. Juventud Guerrera - Jericho's first title defense since winning the championship only 2 days earlier as he attempted to keep Juvi grounded with submissions & stretches along with other offense such as a backbreaker while Juvi relied on his lucha libre offense of different head scissors & ranas including a counter from a powerbomb into a frankensteiner while also attempting high risk maneuvers that didn't pay off on more than one occasion while Jericho got more aggressive including variations of the powerbomb & a frankensteiner that was heavily impactful in a high impact match that also saw a post match interview that not only saw an interruption but possibly one of the funniest one-liners said in the history of the program.June '97Scott Steiner vs. Randy Savage - Savage had Elizabeth in his corner while Scott had his brother Rick in his as Scott was in control with his fast paced offense causing the ""Madness"" to come out of Savage taking a shot at Rick on the outside & using the ringside environment only for Scott to match the intensity with both men fighting in the crowd more than once & executing his trademark suplexes along with a super frankensteiner in what was an intense match that saw Savage bring out a side of Scott that foreshadowed the future ""Big Poppa Pump.""July '97WCW Tag Team Champions Outsiders vs. Diamond Dallas Page & Lex Luger - Both teams were going back & forth with each team playing to their strengths hitting one big move only for the other to come back & hit one of their own while the Outsiders continued to use whatever tactics possible from singling out one opposing member & bending the rules to their advantage in a good tag team encounter.Aug. '97Diamond Dallas Page vs. Stevie Richards - This was just a quick average match that was only noteworthy of the post match staredown DDP had with someone from his past.Sept. '97Eddie Guerrero & Chris Jericho vs. Chavo Guerrero & Dean Malenko - This took place in El Paso, TX which is the the hometown of the Guerreros as Eddie started out very intense only for Chavo to match it countering Eddie's offense into his own along with hitting his own impactful moves on Jericho while Malenko himself picked up his intensity with a shot on one opponent on the apron that knocked him into the outside guardrail head first only to later get a receipt with a missile dropkick directly to the back of his head while he had a submission applied while Jericho kept being his usual ""role model"" self to the point where he still didn't take his crusierweight championship off throughout this highly physical & intense match.Feb. '98Juventud Guerrera vs. Kidman - Both men attempted to use high risk maneuvers that didn't pay off well with one man over shooting his target while the other would get caught in mid-air in this very short match that was more about Juvi's issues with another member of the Flock during this time.May '98WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Randy Savage - It was during this time that Savage was a member of the newly formed nWo ""red & black"" Wolfpack faction & still wearing a knee brace from his injury while Hogan had his Disciple in his corner as Savage was completely dominate causing Hogan to resort to various dirty tactics & pushing the limits of a disqualification in order to gain the edge in what was an average match between the two but more about who else decided to make an appearance with the issues he had with everyone involved.May '98Billy Kidman vs. Scott Hall - It was during this time that Hall was having a drinking problem to the point where Vincent had his cup of booze but refused to give it to him until he won the following match as Hall kept easily toying with Kidman but kept getting distracted asking Vincent for a drink allowing Kidman to keep taking advantage with his speed advantage & aerial assault including a counter to the Outsiders Edge in what was a solid encounter.Sept. '98Diamond Dallas Page vs. Kanyon - Raven was in Kaynon's corner as DDP was able to take advantage of mistakes & accidental distractions only for another distraction to finally work in Kaynon's favor as they traded momentum throughout the contest with the bigger story being the face to face that happened after the match.Oct. '98Goldberg vs. Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Kevin Nash - Bigelow arrived on the scene targeting Goldberg weeks earlier only for Nash to win his title shot going into Starrcade making this match here with one man showcasing his brains over brawl on multiple occasions by just sitting back & letting the other two fight or forming an alliance to double team one of the other competitors as all three men had moments of interaction with each other such as one big move being executed only for the third man to attack right after as this was a non-stop action brawl between all three men along with one more who had an interest in what was happening.Dec. '98Bret Hart vs. Booker T - This was a #1 contenders match for Scott Hall's United States Championship as Booker started out very fast paced causing Bret to keep resorting to tactics trying to break his momentum & slow the pace down such as grounding him & pushing the limits of a disqualification as they continued to trade momentum with Bret targeting an area of the body with submissions & strikes along with other dirty tactics while Booker continued to use his athleticism with various styles of kicks in a very hard fought contest with the only negatives being the distractions during the match from a backstage segment & commentary on other storylines instead of the match itself.Feb. '99Goldberg vs. Ric Flair - Hollywood Hogan & Kevin Nash was on commentary for this match as Flair kept trying to get some offense in against Goldberg to no avail as he was literally ""running into a brick wall"" & constantly being overpowered resulting in Flair resorting to using dirty tactics often from going to the eyes to going low & using the ring environment around him to his advantage. This was a different type of match for Goldberg as he faced Flair who resorted to his ways of being ""dirtiest player in the game"" that he never encountered before.Mar. '99[Golberg: The Ultimate Collection]Hollywood Hogan vs. Diamond Dallas Page - It should be noted that this was DDP's first match back from his injury by Scott Steiner, WCW President Ric Flair was in DDP's corner without DDP's approval, and despite being a member of the heelish ""nWo Wolfpack/Elite"" faction that the crowd supported Hogan over DDP.  This started out as a brawl as the match went from the ring to fighting on the announce table to destroying the Nitro set before heading back into the ring using different objects to beat on each other with Flair attempting to get involved in more ways than one only to not keeping getting the reaction he was expecting from both Hogan & DDP as they traded momentum with Hogan using offensive moves such as submissions that we haven't seen from him before in a match that Tony Schavonie said ""will leave you breathless"" to the point where DDP after the match talked about a phone call he received the next day from the WWE Champion asking how he dragged that type of performance out of Hogan.Mar. '99Sting vs. Randy Savage - This match started out of control from the very start with an unusual distraction allowing Savage to dominate right from the start working over Sting in the ring & around ringside with brawling & illegal tactics while his valets in Team Madness having no issues getting physical themselves multiple times as this match only got more out of control with anyone getting in the way ending up getting taken out themselves as Bobby Heenan defined this encounter perfectly on commentary, ""Savage is exactly that...A SAVAGE!""June '99[Best Of Sting]Hardcore Match: Hak vs. Rick Steiner - Rick Steiner came out in street clothes as this fight didn't stay in the ring long making it's way backstage quickly with anyone who was in their way getting nailed as both men used whatever they had around them while dismantling cars in the process in what was an out of control brawl with quite the visual of who decided to thrown whom into a camper trailer & what happened.June '99Sting & Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash & Sid Vicious - Nash had a mystery partner in Sid while there was some clear tension between Hogan & Sting just based off their past but worked well together staying one step ahead of their opponents while Nash & Sid singled out one individual using whatever tactics they could to keep the advantage in their favor in a solid tag match that was more about who else decided to get involved in the fight & which team was left standing.July '99New York Evening Gown Match: Madusa vs. Mona - As a side note for those who don't know or remember, Mona is better known as ex-WWE Womens Champion Molly Holly as Madusa was forced into this match she didn't want any part of by the new ""Powers That Be"" to the point where she didn't even wear an evening gown as Mona tried to wrestle only for Madusa to take her aggression out on her along with getting in the face of anyone who was going along with the match in any capacity as this was more of a segment than an actual match.Oct. '99WCW Champion Sting vs. Bret Hart - This was Bret Hart's first WCW Championship match (to my knowledge) despite being in the company for close to 2 years as Bret took the offense to Sting right away with punches & bouncing his head off various items on the floor only for Sting to resort to desperate tactics & giving a receipt using the ringside environment to his advantage as they went back & forth using their trademark offense against each other resulting in a match that got more aggressive over time.Oct. '99[Sting: Into The Light]Ladder Match w/special referee - Kevin Nash: WCW United States Champion Goldberg vs. Bret Hart vs. Scott Hall vs. Sid Vicious - You knew the direction this match was going when two of the participants started brawling before the other two made their entrances before the mystery referee in Kevin Nash came down to ringside with the ladder as this was nothing more than a quick four way brawl that saw more than one person get involved in the action as this was more of a segment than a ""match"" as this all about screwing over more than one person in favor of another.Nov. '99WCW Champion Bret Hart vs. Jeff Jarrett - Jarrett walked out wearing Bret's championship belt with Creative Control at ringside as we saw Bret be more aggressive than usual from the start as he resorted to brawling tactics from fighting on the floor to low blow & raking eyes across the ropes while Jarrett gave it all right back to him as they went back & forth in what was a physical brawl.Nov. '99Texas Tornado Match: Sting & Vampiro vs. Lex Luger & Ric Flair - Sting & Vampiro started this match off with a bang as one set of opponents stayed fighting in the ring while the other set fought from the stage area to the swimming pool area to the beach into the actual Gulf Of Mexico using whatever they could get their hands on such as ranch dip & salsa to surfboards (I can't make this up) in a match that I can only describe in one word: FUN!Mar. '00WCW Champion Booker T vs. Mike Awesome - This was Booker's first title defense as Awesome dominated with his power along & crusierweight ability while also taking shortcuts using weapons on the outside only for Booker T to match him with his aerial ability & even taking advantage of his surroundings setup by Awesome at one point with the bigger story behind not only who decided to attack afterwords but who saved whom from the attack but be sure to watch this match on mute as the commentators were too busy doing a subliminal burial of a specific person on commentary that it heavily distracted from the match.July '00WCW Tag Team Champions Mark Jindrak & Sean OHaire vs. Jung Dragons vs. 3 Count - One team was very dominate in the beginning causing them to become the odd team out with the two opponents working together to take them out of the match using double teaming & high flying offense before focusing on each other as this match in what was a non-stop fast paced tag match with a new alliance formed in the aftermath.Nov. '00Booker T & Diamond Dallas Page vs. Steiner Brothers - It should be noted that both Steiners held the top two singles championships (Scott as World & Rick as U.S.) with both men set to meet their opponents in title matches at the upcoming Greed PPV as this started out as a brawl with the Steiners constantly resorting to illegal tactics such as blind tags & double teaming along with taking advantage of the environment not just outside but backstage while DDP & Booker put up a strong fight themselves with not just their wrestling but throwing fist & getting aggressive themselves in a solid tag team encounter.Mar. '01(Blu-Ray) WCW Tag Team Champions Scott Hall & Syxx vs. Steiner Brothers - Kevin Nash was out with knee surgery causing Syxx to defend his half of the championship as the Steiners used their power advantage to while Hall & Syxx relied on quick tags & double teaming along with taking some shortcuts that caused more than one person to have a response to in what was a nice back & forth tag team encounter.Oct. '97(Blu-Ray) WCW United States Champion Bret Hart vs. Lex Luger - Luger showcased his superior power early causing Bret to keep using the same tactic to break the momentum only for Luger to adapt & used a different strategy to avoid that happening before Bret was able to heavily target an area of the body to neutralize Luger's power using his wrestling ability & dirty tactics which didn't always work in his favor in a solid encounter.Aug. '98(Blu-Ray) Bret Hart vs. Hollywood Hogan - Don't judge a book by it's cover here because this match is advertised as the first (and to my knowledge, ONLY) ""Hogan vs. Hart"" match but was nothing more than a segment as Hart heavily hurt his knee causing nWo Wolfpack to help him get medical help while Sting (who Bret had formed an alliance with weeks earlier) took his place in the match only for Hogan's nWo stable to attack the Wolfpack in the back leading to Hart turning on Sting & beating him down in the ring with the assistance of Hogan.Sept. '98[Hulk Hogan's Unreleased Collection](Blu-Ray) WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Sting - Sting came out very intense from the start taking the fight to Jarrett from the outside all the way to the stage area with Jarrett gaining control due to a mistiming heavily focusing on a part of the body using whatever he could in a quick but intense match that came down to someone having unfinished business.May '00(Blu-Ray) WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Kevin Nash vs. Scott Steiner vs. Goldberg - One of the participants was attacked backstage making this a glorified handicap with two of the participants singling out the other using double teaming & just beating on him one at a time with another person getting involved in the action as well as this was pretty much a huge cluster that was about ""strength in numbers"" that's really only remember for one of the rare matches Goldberg had being a heel at that time.June '00Other moments include Sting confronting Rick Steiner, The Giant getting kicked out of the nWo, a verbal confrontation between DDP & Randy Savage, highlights of nWo Monday Nitro, nWo attempts to recruit Rick Steiner, Giant tossing Scott Hall into a pool, Lex Luger joined the Wolfpack, Hollywood Hogan calls out DDP & Karl Malone, Giant chokeslamming DDP through the Nitro stage while Kanyon vs. Raven (July '98), Ric Flair confronting Bret Hart & nWo Wolfpack flipping nWo Hollywood's limo is on the Blu-Ray.I already gave my summary at the beginning but again, it's a set I would pick up but not before the previous two volumes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RULS12FCBPE5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5JQ3FU#wasThisHelpful","RULS12FCBPE5P","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back by popular demand is another volume of ""Best Of WCW Monday Nitro"" with Diamond Dallas Page once again returning (looking like he wore the exact same outfit) as the host of this series.  A couple of notes here in that some of the theme music has been changed again (Sting's ""Metallica"" theme changed to his ""crow"" theme, Chris Jericho uses his WWE theme, Hollywood Hogan's ""Voodoo Child"" into a generic version of that) while Michael Buffer's ring announcing & image hasn't been removed unlike the previous sets.Normally I give my review at the end but I'll leave it here as the usual criticism I have for these sets is that they caught some memorable moments here while still leaving out some important ones but this volume does that more than the previous two as I see no justification in not having Arn Anderson's emotional retirement speech while moments like Hall & Nash diving in a swimming pool & the first verbal confrontation between Savage & DDP when they had better & more memorable confrontations on the show plus I wasn't a big fan of the whole nWo Monday Nitro segment where they took close to 20 minutes to tear down the set only to have another long promo segment dedicating the night to Hogan.  Same goes for the matches as well as some of these were picked for name value only but were nothing more than clusters & easily forgettable while others made question ""what was the point of that?"" when again quality matches are still left on the cutting room floor (I remember one lucha libre crusierweight match where Juvi was sent into the crowd landing on a fan in the front row, another Juvi/Kidman match from that same era that was probably their most physical encounter, the forgotten Hogan/Giant match before Souled Out '98 where Giant got a clean pinfall win, one of the Sting/Flair matches from 1999, we got Sting's title win from DDP on a previous set but still missing the four way where he lost it later in the night, Flair's last World Championship victory, and after the influx of the Network & Mysterio no longer under contract that I think we can finally start showing the matches without his mask).  The positives I can say is that with this being the third volume is that we got some performances from some of the high to mid-card talent that constantly gets overshadowed & forgotten about (Johnny B. Badd, Kidman, Booker T, DDP himself, and tons of Bret Hart matches that he was almost the featured star of the set) while I do admit they got some of the important & favorite moments that was forgotten about in the past (like kicking Giant out of the nWo).  In the end, this would definitely be a set I highly recommend to pick up for fans of WCW, the Monday Night War era, or specifically Bret Hart since this is the most that his WCW career has ever been showcased.Matches include:Randy Savage vs. Lex Luger - Luger put his WCW career on the line here as both men started the match off so intense that they locked up & went from the ring to the outside without breaking as Luger used his power along with taking advantage of his surroundings while Savage went aerial in the ring & to the outside while also fighting fire with fire with the ringside environment in a intense physical match that ended with more questions about Luger than there was before the match.Oct. '95WCW Television Champion Johnny B. Badd vs. Eddie Guerrero - Both men were trading momentum early exchanging the same holds along with different offense from a springboard position along with a series of counters & reversals as they got equally more competitive as the time went on delivering such impactful holds from a DDT to tombstone piledriver along with having the same offense in mind at the same time as this was a highly competitive encounter between two evenly matched opponents.Nov. '95Sting vs. Diamond Dallas Page - DDP got an unfair early advantage as he resorted to various brawling & illegal tactics to keep the advantage while Sting relied on his trademark offense in the ring & even going out over the top to the floor at one point in what was a solid match but good showcasing for DDP at this stage in his career against a top talent.Jan. '96WCW Champion Ric Flair vs. Randy Savage - Randy Savage played his own set of mind games against Flair coming into the match as he was lead to the ring by an entourage of women (featuring an unnamed Linda Hogan & Debra McMichael) lead by former Horsemen manager Woman who had a strong response to when Flair attempted to relive old times as this match started off mostly on the floor before eventually making it back & staying in the ring with both men exchanging momentum in what was a short & average but entertaining match here memorable for end result.Jan. '96[Macho Madness: The Randy Savage Collection]Sister Sherri vs. Madusa - This started out as an interview with Sherri over what happened a week earlier at her wedding only for Madusa to attack her taking this fight to the floor whipping Sherri into the steps & suplexling her out of her shoes only for Sherri to take back the advantage in the ring as this was a very short match but aggressive for what it was as this was definitely about who would be the last woman standing.Jan. '96Lex Luger vs. Kevin Nash - Luger recently became the #1 contender for the WCW Championship but Nash made it clear Luger would would have to go through him to get his shot at Hollywood Hogan as Nash had fellow nWo members at ringside who kept causing a distraction whenever Luger started to get the advantage as the match was just a backdrop to the bigger story of who & what came to Luger's aid against the nWo.Apr. '97Giant & Diamond Dallas Page vs. Harlem Heat - This was a segment more than anything else as the nWo attacked & completely dominated not just all the participants in the match but anyone else who tried to get involved along with other areas of the show as well.May '97WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs. Juventud Guerrera - Jericho's first title defense since winning the championship only 2 days earlier as he attempted to keep Juvi grounded with submissions & stretches along with other offense such as a backbreaker while Juvi relied on his lucha libre offense of different head scissors & ranas including a counter from a powerbomb into a frankensteiner while also attempting high risk maneuvers that didn't pay off on more than one occasion while Jericho got more aggressive including variations of the powerbomb & a frankensteiner that was heavily impactful in a high impact match that also saw a post match interview that not only saw an interruption but possibly one of the funniest one-liners said in the history of the program.June '97Scott Steiner vs. Randy Savage - Savage had Elizabeth in his corner while Scott had his brother Rick in his as Scott was in control with his fast paced offense causing the ""Madness"" to come out of Savage taking a shot at Rick on the outside & using the ringside environment only for Scott to match the intensity with both men fighting in the crowd more than once & executing his trademark suplexes along with a super frankensteiner in what was an intense match that saw Savage bring out a side of Scott that foreshadowed the future ""Big Poppa Pump.""July '97WCW Tag Team Champions Outsiders vs. Diamond Dallas Page & Lex Luger - Both teams were going back & forth with each team playing to their strengths hitting one big move only for the other to come back & hit one of their own while the Outsiders continued to use whatever tactics possible from singling out one opposing member & bending the rules to their advantage in a good tag team encounter.Aug. '97Diamond Dallas Page vs. Stevie Richards - This was just a quick average match that was only noteworthy of the post match staredown DDP had with someone from his past.Sept. '97Eddie Guerrero & Chris Jericho vs. Chavo Guerrero & Dean Malenko - This took place in El Paso, TX which is the the hometown of the Guerreros as Eddie started out very intense only for Chavo to match it countering Eddie's offense into his own along with hitting his own impactful moves on Jericho while Malenko himself picked up his intensity with a shot on one opponent on the apron that knocked him into the outside guardrail head first only to later get a receipt with a missile dropkick directly to the back of his head while he had a submission applied while Jericho kept being his usual ""role model"" self to the point where he still didn't take his crusierweight championship off throughout this highly physical & intense match.Feb. '98Juventud Guerrera vs. Kidman - Both men attempted to use high risk maneuvers that didn't pay off well with one man over shooting his target while the other would get caught in mid-air in this very short match that was more about Juvi's issues with another member of the Flock during this time.May '98WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Randy Savage - It was during this time that Savage was a member of the newly formed nWo ""red & black"" Wolfpack faction & still wearing a knee brace from his injury while Hogan had his Disciple in his corner as Savage was completely dominate causing Hogan to resort to various dirty tactics & pushing the limits of a disqualification in order to gain the edge in what was an average match between the two but more about who else decided to make an appearance with the issues he had with everyone involved.May '98Billy Kidman vs. Scott Hall - It was during this time that Hall was having a drinking problem to the point where Vincent had his cup of booze but refused to give it to him until he won the following match as Hall kept easily toying with Kidman but kept getting distracted asking Vincent for a drink allowing Kidman to keep taking advantage with his speed advantage & aerial assault including a counter to the Outsiders Edge in what was a solid encounter.Sept. '98Diamond Dallas Page vs. Kanyon - Raven was in Kaynon's corner as DDP was able to take advantage of mistakes & accidental distractions only for another distraction to finally work in Kaynon's favor as they traded momentum throughout the contest with the bigger story being the face to face that happened after the match.Oct. '98Goldberg vs. Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Kevin Nash - Bigelow arrived on the scene targeting Goldberg weeks earlier only for Nash to win his title shot going into Starrcade making this match here with one man showcasing his brains over brawl on multiple occasions by just sitting back & letting the other two fight or forming an alliance to double team one of the other competitors as all three men had moments of interaction with each other such as one big move being executed only for the third man to attack right after as this was a non-stop action brawl between all three men along with one more who had an interest in what was happening.Dec. '98Bret Hart vs. Booker T - This was a #1 contenders match for Scott Hall's United States Championship as Booker started out very fast paced causing Bret to keep resorting to tactics trying to break his momentum & slow the pace down such as grounding him & pushing the limits of a disqualification as they continued to trade momentum with Bret targeting an area of the body with submissions & strikes along with other dirty tactics while Booker continued to use his athleticism with various styles of kicks in a very hard fought contest with the only negatives being the distractions during the match from a backstage segment & commentary on other storylines instead of the match itself.Feb. '99Goldberg vs. Ric Flair - Hollywood Hogan & Kevin Nash was on commentary for this match as Flair kept trying to get some offense in against Goldberg to no avail as he was literally ""running into a brick wall"" & constantly being overpowered resulting in Flair resorting to using dirty tactics often from going to the eyes to going low & using the ring environment around him to his advantage. This was a different type of match for Goldberg as he faced Flair who resorted to his ways of being ""dirtiest player in the game"" that he never encountered before.Mar. '99[Golberg: The Ultimate Collection]Hollywood Hogan vs. Diamond Dallas Page - It should be noted that this was DDP's first match back from his injury by Scott Steiner, WCW President Ric Flair was in DDP's corner without DDP's approval, and despite being a member of the heelish ""nWo Wolfpack/Elite"" faction that the crowd supported Hogan over DDP.  This started out as a brawl as the match went from the ring to fighting on the announce table to destroying the Nitro set before heading back into the ring using different objects to beat on each other with Flair attempting to get involved in more ways than one only to not keeping getting the reaction he was expecting from both Hogan & DDP as they traded momentum with Hogan using offensive moves such as submissions that we haven't seen from him before in a match that Tony Schavonie said ""will leave you breathless"" to the point where DDP after the match talked about a phone call he received the next day from the WWE Champion asking how he dragged that type of performance out of Hogan.Mar. '99Sting vs. Randy Savage - This match started out of control from the very start with an unusual distraction allowing Savage to dominate right from the start working over Sting in the ring & around ringside with brawling & illegal tactics while his valets in Team Madness having no issues getting physical themselves multiple times as this match only got more out of control with anyone getting in the way ending up getting taken out themselves as Bobby Heenan defined this encounter perfectly on commentary, ""Savage is exactly that...A SAVAGE!""June '99[Best Of Sting]Hardcore Match: Hak vs. Rick Steiner - Rick Steiner came out in street clothes as this fight didn't stay in the ring long making it's way backstage quickly with anyone who was in their way getting nailed as both men used whatever they had around them while dismantling cars in the process in what was an out of control brawl with quite the visual of who decided to thrown whom into a camper trailer & what happened.June '99Sting & Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash & Sid Vicious - Nash had a mystery partner in Sid while there was some clear tension between Hogan & Sting just based off their past but worked well together staying one step ahead of their opponents while Nash & Sid singled out one individual using whatever tactics they could to keep the advantage in their favor in a solid tag match that was more about who else decided to get involved in the fight & which team was left standing.July '99New York Evening Gown Match: Madusa vs. Mona - As a side note for those who don't know or remember, Mona is better known as ex-WWE Womens Champion Molly Holly as Madusa was forced into this match she didn't want any part of by the new ""Powers That Be"" to the point where she didn't even wear an evening gown as Mona tried to wrestle only for Madusa to take her aggression out on her along with getting in the face of anyone who was going along with the match in any capacity as this was more of a segment than an actual match.Oct. '99WCW Champion Sting vs. Bret Hart - This was Bret Hart's first WCW Championship match (to my knowledge) despite being in the company for close to 2 years as Bret took the offense to Sting right away with punches & bouncing his head off various items on the floor only for Sting to resort to desperate tactics & giving a receipt using the ringside environment to his advantage as they went back & forth using their trademark offense against each other resulting in a match that got more aggressive over time.Oct. '99[Sting: Into The Light]Ladder Match w/special referee - Kevin Nash: WCW United States Champion Goldberg vs. Bret Hart vs. Scott Hall vs. Sid Vicious - You knew the direction this match was going when two of the participants started brawling before the other two made their entrances before the mystery referee in Kevin Nash came down to ringside with the ladder as this was nothing more than a quick four way brawl that saw more than one person get involved in the action as this was more of a segment than a ""match"" as this all about screwing over more than one person in favor of another.Nov. '99WCW Champion Bret Hart vs. Jeff Jarrett - Jarrett walked out wearing Bret's championship belt with Creative Control at ringside as we saw Bret be more aggressive than usual from the start as he resorted to brawling tactics from fighting on the floor to low blow & raking eyes across the ropes while Jarrett gave it all right back to him as they went back & forth in what was a physical brawl.Nov. '99Texas Tornado Match: Sting & Vampiro vs. Lex Luger & Ric Flair - Sting & Vampiro started this match off with a bang as one set of opponents stayed fighting in the ring while the other set fought from the stage area to the swimming pool area to the beach into the actual Gulf Of Mexico using whatever they could get their hands on such as ranch dip & salsa to surfboards (I can't make this up) in a match that I can only describe in one word: FUN!Mar. '00WCW Champion Booker T vs. Mike Awesome - This was Booker's first title defense as Awesome dominated with his power along & crusierweight ability while also taking shortcuts using weapons on the outside only for Booker T to match him with his aerial ability & even taking advantage of his surroundings setup by Awesome at one point with the bigger story behind not only who decided to attack afterwords but who saved whom from the attack but be sure to watch this match on mute as the commentators were too busy doing a subliminal burial of a specific person on commentary that it heavily distracted from the match.July '00WCW Tag Team Champions Mark Jindrak & Sean OHaire vs. Jung Dragons vs. 3 Count - One team was very dominate in the beginning causing them to become the odd team out with the two opponents working together to take them out of the match using double teaming & high flying offense before focusing on each other as this match in what was a non-stop fast paced tag match with a new alliance formed in the aftermath.Nov. '00Booker T & Diamond Dallas Page vs. Steiner Brothers - It should be noted that both Steiners held the top two singles championships (Scott as World & Rick as U.S.) with both men set to meet their opponents in title matches at the upcoming Greed PPV as this started out as a brawl with the Steiners constantly resorting to illegal tactics such as blind tags & double teaming along with taking advantage of the environment not just outside but backstage while DDP & Booker put up a strong fight themselves with not just their wrestling but throwing fist & getting aggressive themselves in a solid tag team encounter.Mar. '01(Blu-Ray) WCW Tag Team Champions Scott Hall & Syxx vs. Steiner Brothers - Kevin Nash was out with knee surgery causing Syxx to defend his half of the championship as the Steiners used their power advantage to while Hall & Syxx relied on quick tags & double teaming along with taking some shortcuts that caused more than one person to have a response to in what was a nice back & forth tag team encounter.Oct. '97(Blu-Ray) WCW United States Champion Bret Hart vs. Lex Luger - Luger showcased his superior power early causing Bret to keep using the same tactic to break the momentum only for Luger to adapt & used a different strategy to avoid that happening before Bret was able to heavily target an area of the body to neutralize Luger's power using his wrestling ability & dirty tactics which didn't always work in his favor in a solid encounter.Aug. '98(Blu-Ray) Bret Hart vs. Hollywood Hogan - Don't judge a book by it's cover here because this match is advertised as the first (and to my knowledge, ONLY) ""Hogan vs. Hart"" match but was nothing more than a segment as Hart heavily hurt his knee causing nWo Wolfpack to help him get medical help while Sting (who Bret had formed an alliance with weeks earlier) took his place in the match only for Hogan's nWo stable to attack the Wolfpack in the back leading to Hart turning on Sting & beating him down in the ring with the assistance of Hogan.Sept. '98[Hulk Hogan's Unreleased Collection](Blu-Ray) WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Sting - Sting came out very intense from the start taking the fight to Jarrett from the outside all the way to the stage area with Jarrett gaining control due to a mistiming heavily focusing on a part of the body using whatever he could in a quick but intense match that came down to someone having unfinished business.May '00(Blu-Ray) WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Kevin Nash vs. Scott Steiner vs. Goldberg - One of the participants was attacked backstage making this a glorified handicap with two of the participants singling out the other using double teaming & just beating on him one at a time with another person getting involved in the action as well as this was pretty much a huge cluster that was about ""strength in numbers"" that's really only remember for one of the rare matches Goldberg had being a heel at that time.June '00Other moments include Sting confronting Rick Steiner, The Giant getting kicked out of the nWo, a verbal confrontation between DDP & Randy Savage, highlights of nWo Monday Nitro, nWo attempts to recruit Rick Steiner, Giant tossing Scott Hall into a pool, Lex Luger joined the Wolfpack, Hollywood Hogan calls out DDP & Karl Malone, Giant chokeslamming DDP through the Nitro stage while Kanyon vs. Raven (July '98), Ric Flair confronting Bret Hart & nWo Wolfpack flipping nWo Hollywood's limo is on the Blu-Ray.I already gave my summary at the beginning but again, it's a set I would pick up but not before the previous two volumes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OA637X14WV51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5JQ3BY#wasThisHelpful","R3OA637X14WV51","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those cases where I can try to describe the Undertaker but words wouldn't do the character for over the last two decades justice but one of the most important factors in his legacy is his undefeated streak at WrestleMania. That has become so important in WWE that it's just as important (& in some cases, more important) than any other factor going into the show weather it's the celebrities or the championship matches leading to WWE releasing an anthology of his first 20 wins back in 2012...however all of that all came to an end at the hands of Brock Lensar at WrestleMania XXX in one of the most shocking moments in not just WWE but sports & entertainment history itself to the point where it was covered on various media outside of wrestling & now you can relive not just the birth & growth but also the phenomenal growth & eventual end here on ""The Streak: R.I.P. Edition.""  Now for those who haven't seen any of WWE's previous ""Collector's Edition"" sets (Mick Foley's ""Greatest Hits & Misses"", The Rock's ""Just Bring It"", Brock Lesnar's ""Here Comes The Pain""), they are just the original material released once again with the additional bonus of not only the original match 20 match presentation but also his 21th match against C.M. Punk & the eventual ""21-1"" loss against Brock Lesnar while the documentary on the original presentation has been removed making this a match only anthology that's a limited edition set coming inside of it's own coffin case while it should also be noted that all of the matches here have the attitude era logos & references to ""WWF"" unedited unlike the previous presentation.Matches Include:1-0: vs. Jimmy Snuka - This match was pretty short with Taker showcasing his dominance with his trademark moves like the flying clothesline & tombstone. Outside of the fact that this was Taker's Mania debut & the beginning of the streak, nothing special past his dominate victory over a legend.WrestleMania VII[Undertaker 15-0]2-0: vs. Jake Roberts - The former allies & now enemies met here with a different twist for Undertaker as he was now a fan favorite during going into this match. Taker was his usual dominate self here as he completely no sold Robert's offense & took the fight to the floor throwing Jake into the ringpost before going back into the ring throwing him into the turnbuckles. Roberts was able to somehow hit Taker with his DDT twice but make the mistake of turning his focus to Paul Bearer which not only ended up cost Roberts the match but his WWE career at that point.WrestleMania VIII[Undertaker 15-0]3-0: vs. Giant Gonzales - This was one of the rare times that Taker had to look up to someone & Gonzales used that to his advantage to dish out punishment in the ring & out on the floor using the steel steps only for Taker only for him to keep getting back up. Taker was eventually able to get some momentum & take Gonzales down to one knee before he resorted to some desperate tactics to make sure in his mind Taker wouldn't get back up...only for Taker to not only return but also knock Gonzales off his feet. This match took place during the period where WWE saw Taker as more of an attraction & kept having him feud against other ""monster"" characters who just weren't good in the ring causing Taker to have to carry the match on his own as was the case with Gonzales here.WrestleMania IX[Undertaker 15-0]4-0: vs. King Kong Bundy - After Taker was absent for WMX, he returned here feuding with a member of Ted Dibiase's Million $ Corporation in a mission (that would pretty much describe his entire year of 1995) to retrieve back his urn that was stolen from him while it should be noted that American League Baseball umpire Larry Young was the special referee for some unknown reason. In a nutshell, this match was once again another match where Taker pretty much had to carry the weight here as Bundy was very limited in what he could do past certain moves like his Avalanche splash in the corner however this match was the definition of the phrase ""winning the battle but not the war.""WrestleMania XI[Undertaker 15-0]5-0: vs. Diesel - Thought Undertaker's career (specifically during the mid 90's), he had the reputation for being able to bring out the best performance out of bigger men who were very limited in what they could do in the ring & Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash was one of those men here. This was a match that can be described by Vince McMahon as ""these two monsters are clobbering each other."" They used heavy impact power moves while Taker resorted some some moves we hadn't seen from him at that time like a crossbody block. This was a real hard fought victory for the winner.WrestleMania XII[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]6-0: No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Champion Sid - A couple of notes here but an injured Shawn Michaels was on commentary, Undertaker wore his original black & gray ""western"" outfit for the first time in years, and Bret Hart (who had lost a WWE Championship cage match against Sid on RAW earlier in the week thanks to Undertaker) came out with comments for everyone before being taken out. Taker dominated early & even executed his top rope walk we now know as ""old school"" before Sid was able to catch Taker & take the match to the outside using the guardrail & announce table then focused on Taker's back with various moves like the bearhug, camel clutch, and powerslam. Both men continued to have the same strategy by either grounding each other with chinlocks & nerve holds or executing the big boot or both going outside of the usual gameplan by coming off the top rope. This wasn't your typical ""big man"" match as both men here told a story while giving it everything they had possible to give at this time resulting in a competitive match.WrestleMania 137-0: vs. Kane - The first match between these two & honestly, I feel this has been the best match between these two as it lived up to the hype & at times, seemed like Taker was fighting himself as they matched each other move for move. Definitely a ""Oh My God!"" moment was where Undertaker flew over the top rope into the announce table. After many matches against each other for years afterwards, this still goes down as my favorite one & a match that lived up to the months of hype building up to it.WrestleMania XIV[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker; Twisted, Disturbed Life Of Kane; Kane: Journey To Hell]8-0: Hell In A Cell vs. Big Boss Man - This was the first time that a Hell In A Cell match took place at Mania as it was during this time period that Taker had his own stable called The Ministry & declared war against Mr. McMahon & his corporation causing McMahon to send his enforcer into action. Overall this was a slow paced brawl that saw Boss Man use his signature handcuffs & nightstick to work over Taker causing him to bleed before Taker recovered using a chair & the cell against Boss Man on his way to victory but it should be noted that the aftermath where Boss Man was hung from the top of the cell thanks to the Brood wasn't shown. This match was very disappointing quality for this type of match to the point where they never show highlights of this match when showing the history of the match & this match was excluded from the DVD anthology of Hell In A Cell.WrestleMania XV[Undertaker 15-0]9-0: vs. Triple H - This was the first major meeting between these two superstars & it got real personal with Triple H busting Taker open requiring a high amount of stitches in his forehead (which you can see up close in the DVD extra interview). This started off wild with the spanish table being broken early before it settled in the ring & Taker got so focused on revenge that he attacked & knocked out the referee in the ring. They took the fight through the crowd into one of the camera towers. Both men did whatever they could to inflict punishment such as Triple H beating the hell out of Taker with a chair & Taker responding with chokeslamming Triple H off the tower & delivering an elbow drop himself. They settled back into the ring where the sledgehammer came into play before Taker extended ""the streak.""WrestleMania X-7[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]10-0: No Disqualification Match vs. Ric Flair - This match was very personal to Flair after all the attacks that Undertaker made towards his friends & family to the point where Flair didn't do his usual ""stylin' & profilin'"" as he made his way to the ring but instead disrobed early & ran straight to the ring leading to both men fighting in the announce area within the first minute. They were trading fist before Taker threw Flair into the turnbuckle with Flair looking to do his classic spot only for Taker to caught him with the boot on the apron. Taker was dominate to the point where he busted Flair open just from his punches alone only for Flair to return to his ways of being ""the dirtiest player in the game"" to regain control & have Taker bleed but just continued to keep coming to the point where help came for Flair along with using a chair. At this stage in Flair's career, this was definitely the best performance he had dating back to years before WCW closed while Taker was at the top of his game.WrestleMania X811-0: vs. Big Show & A-Train - This happened during the era of Taker going under the biker gimmick as the ""American Bad Ass"" & with his original tag partner Nathan Jones being attacked earlier in the night, Taker had a handicap match here. Taker tried to get a quick win early here causing Show & Train to use the numbers advantage with double team power moves before Taker was able to use the strategy of divide & conquer and receive some help in order to keep the streak alive. This was pretty much what you would expect from a handicap match here but Taker had a better performance here against these two big than than he's had in the past at Mania at times against one.WrestleMania XIX[Undertaker 15-0]12-0: vs. Kane - Kane attacked & helped bury his brother alive at Survivor Series months earlier only for Taker to keep sending various messages to Kane for months teasing the return of Undertaker under his original persona of ""The Deadman"" but we ended up getting more than that as we also saw the return of Paul Bearer. This match was pretty short & sweet with Kane not believing that Taker was really there before Taker not only showed him that he was back & dominated his way to victory over his brother in a way that showed that the ""Deadman"" is back.WrestleMania XX[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker; Undertaker 15-0]13-0: vs. Randy Orton - ""The Legend Killer"" was out to end the legend of Undertaker's streak as Orton kept trying to go for quick covers early to no avail. Both men would go on to exchange punches with Taker attempting his Dragon Sleeper submission that was countered into a DDT & later countering the chokeslam into an RKO as both men traded momentum causing Randy to resort to desperate tactics including an appearance from his father using his trademark cast on his arm before Orton's overconfidence at one point came back to haunt him & cost him the match. Orton came into this match with an injury that would eventually have him out of action throughout the spring & summer so this was as good as it could be taking that into consideration as they would go on to have better matches throughout the rest of the year.WrestleMania 2114-0: Casket Match vs. Mark Henry - Another Mania first in that this was the first casket match at the event. In a nutshell, Mark Henry was another limited big man so the match was a slow paced brawl as this was one of those cases where the stipulation definitely helped more than it would have been if they had a regular match. Nothing special here past the fact that this was the first casket match at Mania.WrestleMania 22[Undertaker 15-0]15-0: vs. World Champion Batista - Taker's Undefeated Streak vs. Batista's Title and I'll be point blank honest, this was the match that should have ended the show. This was Batista's best showing since his series against Triple H around a year earlier as he stepped up his game & didn't show any lack of effort like most of his previous performances. This was a classic ""big money"" WrestleMania match & the match of the night for me as you saw the crowd off the chain throughout the bout & even moments where it looked like Batista was going to end the streak & with various moments to look out for like Undertaker's big dive onto Batista, Batista's running powerslam through the announce table, and Batista taking it to the air with a flying shoulderblock off the top. It's ironic that this was the 20 year anniversary of WrestleMania 3 but Undertaker walks out of his WM the same way he did 10 years earlier...as a champion.[Greatest Stars Of The 21st Century; Undertaker 15-0]16-0: vs. World Champion Edge - Edge finally made it into the WrestleMania main event that various people (myself included) felt should have been his years ago & I guess WWE learned their lesson from last year in putting the Undertaker title match on last since he usually delivers...and this was no exception. Edge worked on Taker's back throughout various parts of the match with the match getting better & better as time went on with a couple of near falls that would have had you convinced that he was actually going to lose. Justice was served after what happened close to a year earlier as Taker regained his championship from Edge thanks to ""that choke hold"" (Devil's Gate).WrestleMania XXIV[Top 50 Superstars Of All Time; You Think You Know Me: The Story Of Edge]17-0: vs. Shawn Michaels - This is one of those matches that I can try to describe & review but the words wouldn't do it justice. This match had everything (including the unique ""Heaven & Hell"" entrances) on a physical & emotional level of both men refusing to lose to the point where this was the closest anyone had ever come to breaking the streak to the point where you saw the most emotion from Undertaker since his ""Deadman"" character returned 5 years ago & Shawn was even so desperate at one point, he was hoping for a win via countout. Instant classic here & quite frankly, this was the match that saved this show & should have ended it since nobody was going to be able to top it.25th Anniversary Of WrestleMania[Shawn Michaels: My Journey]18-0: No Disqualification/No Count Out Match vs. Shawn Michaels - Seeing how this is only the fourth time in WrestleMania history & the first time in 15 years that a non-title match is the final match at WrestleMania, you could tell that the quality they delivered last year was enough to warrant the closing position. Although these two put on such a memorable classic last year, they were able to put on another classic but different match this year as the stipulations of only winning by pinfall/submission along with the story of Shawn being so obsessed with ending the streak that he risked his own career...this match was more intense than the last one right from the opening moment when Shawn did Taker's trademark signature ""throat slash"" at the start. Taker hurt his leg early in the match giving Shawn the advantage by heavily working over that leg with various moves like the figure four & even the anklelock. Things really picked up from here with such moments as Shawn getting the tombstone on the floor, HBK executing a moonsault that you have to see to believe, and being able to counter moves from Undertaker that nobody else was able to counter before him while Taker himself was able to keep getting up from everything Shawn delivered. I don't want to reveal the ending but the match had such an effect on Taker to the point where he showed more emotion towards Shawn that we've seen from ""The Dead Man"" before Shawn refused to go out without a fight. As what has been the case with most of the matches here, keep watching after the match as you got got a very emotional WrestleMania moment.WrestleMania XXVI[Best PPV Matches Of 2009-2010; Superstar Collection: Shawn Michaels]19-0: No Holds Barred Match vs. Triple H - Both men started out trading punches with Taker getting aggressive first by tossing Triple H over the top, ramming him into the steps, and taking apart the spanish announce table. Triple H returned the aggression with tackling Taker through the ""Colemine"" & taking apart the english announce table...only to be slammed off it to the floor. A few scary moments happened such as when Taker did his famous dive over the top ropes to the floor & he wasn't caught by Triple H coming close to landing right on his neck while later Taker took a chairshot right to the head (just knowing about concussions now makes me cringe when I see that). Both men turned up the punishment various times such as a spinebuster through the spanish table, trading chairshots, a DDT on the chair, and both kicking out of finishers including 3 separate pedigrees to the point where Triple H was just screaming ""STAY DOWN...JUST DIE...WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU!?!"" Triple H said before this match that he was going to finish the streak or die trying...well those words rang true but after the match, he wasn't the only person who died trying to accomplish their goal. It was different than their match a decade ago at WrestleMania but this was one that could stand out on it's own.WrestleMania XXVII[Best PPV Matches Of 2011]20-0: Hell In A Cell Match w/Special Referee Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H - Couple of notes here as Jim Ross returned to join commentary for this match, Michael Cole pointed out the interesting facts that not only has Triple H has won more HIAC matches than Undertaker but also never lost a match where Shawn was the referee, and Undertaker finally revealed his new haircut. Taker was dominate at the start as he targeted Triple H's head using anything he could get his hands on from the steps to the cell, and his own head to deliver headbutts causing HHH to have a bad bruise on his face. The steps were put into the ring where Triple H was able to deliver a spinebuster only for Taker to apply the Hell's Gate right after before Triple H showcased his strength & dead-lifted Taker to get out of the hold. Shawn played an important role as the referee as both guys got physical with him at times while also trying to be the voice of reason such as when Triple H continued to deliver non-stop chairshots to Taker's back to the point where Shawn tried to step in telling him, ""just pin him because you know he won't give up!"" only for Triple H to respond ""You end it or I will!"" This was physically brutal as both men didn't hold back with the chairshots & other weapons while just beating each other into exhaustion & Shawn definitely played an important role here. This lived up to the hype, no questions asked.WrestleMania XXVIII21-0: vs. C.M. Punk - Punk made his entrance with the group Living Colour performing ""Cult Of Personality"" while Paul Heyman had the urn symbolizing the late-Paul Bearer with Punk continuing to disrespect Undertaker tossing the urn around & even slapping Taker in the face causing Taker to respond in a dominate fashion with his strikes & big boot while driving Punk back first into the ring post & ""vintage"" apron legdrop before Punk was able to catch Taker off guard during Old School only for Punk to continue to show disrespect for Taker & taking it to the air with top rope moves like his Savage Elbow including one to the outside that ended up hurting himself just as much or even more than it did Taker. Both men continued to trade momentum by trading blows or using their various trademark moves such as the Anaconda Vice, G.T.S., Tombstone, and Last Ride with the other men somehow continuing to find a way to counter or escape the hold which resulted in the best match these two have had against each other & heavily surpassing their feud back in 2009.WrestleMania XXIX21-1: vs. Brock Lesnar - ""The Streak vs. The Beast"" was the subtitle here as Taker went against the one man he's never beaten dating back to over a decade earlier as Taker came out with strikes while Brock deliver more physical offense such as a belly to belly suplex & over the top clothesline resulting in Taker getting more physical using the ringside environment to weaken Brock's arm as both men were able to counter each other attempt at a big move before Brock focused in keeping Taker grounded with various strikes while Taker went for more impactful moves such as a legdrop or chokeslam as they went back & forth countering & reversing each other's attempts at submissions & trademark finishers. This match definitely let to what has to be the most shocking moment in WrestleMania history which has definitely had mixed reactions all over social media amongst others public forums (another subject for another time) but as for the match itself regardless if you agree with what happened, it was very similar to the Brock/HHH match at SummerSlam where it didn't live up to the standards that both men have been known to deliver on a big stage or even match quality of matches they had a decade earlier but what has been revealed now days after this match is that Undertaker suffered a severe concussion at the beginning of the match but kept going to the point where he did collapse shortly after he got backstage & went to the hospital with Vince McMahon himself, who didn't stay to watch the main event of his biggest show of the year for the first time ever, showing how serious the injury was. So knowing now what I didn't know when watching the match, I would have to compare this match to Cena/Rock from last year & grade this match on a curve due to the injury suffered & give Taker credit for putting on a physical performance knowing how serious the injury was.WrestleMania XXXSome of the matches themselves weren't much early on past either quick dominate squashes or just the gimmick of him fighting other limited big men (Snuka, Roberts, Gonzales, Bundy, Boss Man, Henry) but a majority of them were quality in their own right so unless you already have every single WrestleMania already in your collection (or easily access them through the network), this is a set I would recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ZWX328IZOBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HF7RM8#wasThisHelpful","R20ZWX328IZOBZ","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No different than the previous collections, WWE wants to put this collection out before the end of the year so matches from the Survivor Series & T.L.C. events are not included.  As a side note, there isn't a Blu-Ray version due to the low sales of the previous editions & this is only available internationally due to all of the PPV's throughout the year being available on the WWE Network.Matches Include:Daniel Bryan vs. Bray Wyatt - The Wyatt Family was kicked out of ringside during the early moments which Bryan took full advantage of hurting Bray's knee & coming after him with an aerial assault both in & outside of the ring along with just a ruthless assault on that bad leg with strikes & stomps & twist including using the ring ropes before Bray fought back using his own body as a weapon with his weight advantage & focusing on the head & neck area keeping Bryan grounded as both men traded momentum catching each other & countering their signature moves & submissions. This was built as a fight & definitely came off as one to the point where I had to agree with J.B.L. later in the show, ""Someone call the sheriff, they just stole the show.""Royal RumbleThe Shield vs. The Wyatt Family - Both teams had the same strategy in the beginning in that they isolated one member of the group working him over in their corner with their teammates making quick tags & having no problem taking their shots in on the apron with members of each team delivering offense that we haven't seen from them previously such as Luke Harper's dropkick & suicide dive along with Seth Rollings series of aerial offense that made the commentators compare him to Spiderman before things eventually did break down in the all out brawl between all six men that went not just in & outside of the ring but throughout the crowd as well that resulted in participants in the match being taken out one by one allowing the numbers game to take effect. This turned out to be the intense fight you was expecting with Jerry Lawler describing it best saying ""what a battle"" with the crowd being hot for this with duel chants for both teams & ""This Is Awesome!"" before they touched along with this match causing one of the funniest Twitter trends in WWE history.Elimination Chamber[The Destruction Of The Shield]Elimination Chamber Match: WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. John Cena vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus vs. Christian vs. Cesaro - While the rules & structure for this Elimination Chamber match was the same, this was the first time since the creation of the match that there was only one World Championship in the WWE meaning that this was set to be the final chance for these men to get into a World Title match at WrestleMania. Various highlights include who started out the match & their very physical interaction, Daniel Bryan being a one armed man throughout the contest, bodies being tossed into various parts of the chamber from the chain wall to grate floor including going through the pod on more than once occasion, one man using another as a weapon against another superstar, one period where everyone hitting anything that moved, Cesaro's showcase of power, the reaction from himself & the crowd when Randy Orton discovered he was a marked man by everyone in the chamber, and more than one non-participant making their presence known. This was a fun match from start to finish.Daniel Bryan vs. Triple H - The winner of this match would advance to the triple threat main event for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship while it should be noted that Stephanie McMahon not only introduced Triple H but also was in his corner for the match. Bryan came into this match with his shoulder heavily taped from the attack weeks earlier which Triple H targeted right away while Bryan was able to repeatably ground Triple H with takedowns along with offense such as the running DDT off the apron & top rope somersault that not only hurt Triple H but himself as well allowing Triple H to continue to work over the arm using the environment on the outside along with various strikes & submissions as both men continued to trade momentum either using the same strategy such as suplexes or finding counters & reversals to other signature trademark offense. While it's unusual to see Triple H in an opening match position, it lead to one of the best opening matches in WrestleMania history as both men played off each other very well.WrestleMania XXXWWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Batista vs. Daniel Bryan - Rev Theory performed ""Voices"" as Orton came to the ring as both Batista & Orton took advantage of the ""No Disqualification"" stipulation on the outside using the barriers & ringside steps as weapons while Bryan was able to work over both men in the ring with each man as the interaction between all three lead to such moments as the third man breaking up pins between the other two or stealing a attempt pin off the other man, one man hitting a big move only for the third man to come with another big move right after, and an unlikely alliance (or reunion) formed when two men decided together to take out the biggest threat in the match including one double team move that ended up hitting the receiver as much as the executor, and more than just other two competitors not wanting to see Daniel Bryan as WWE Champion. This was a great triple threat match that played to everyone's strengths while also giving one hell of a WrestleMania moment to end the show.WrestleMania XXX[Daniel Bryan: Just Say YES!]WeeLC Match: El Torito vs. Hornswoggle - I'll try to avoid all of the usual puns & jokes about the obvious during this review as this match just had so many highlights such as 3MB & Los Matadores getting involved & taking their own share of hard hits & bad landings due to their opposition & even at one point their own partner, both men using their own special tables & ladders & chairs, someone at one point having a fear a heights, and the most hysterical commentary I've heard in a long time thanks to J.B.Elf & Micro Cole & Jerry Smaller. This was exactly what it was designed to be...entertaining.Extreme Rules Pre-ShowIntercontinental Champion Big E vs. Bad News Barrett - Big E started out showcasing his power with moves like the shoulderblock takedown before Barrett was able to use Big E's momentum against him more than once to get an advantage while keeping him grounded on the mat to take away his power advantage as both men traded momentum delivering some physical offense such as a big overhead release suplex, a Cactus Jack elbow off the apron to the floor, and a spear through the ropes. A really good match here with the interesting twist of who the crowd decided to support throughout the match.Extreme RulesThe Shield vs. Evolution - This started out as a brawl between all six men before things settled down with Evolution dominated grounding one man with their power offense & illegal double & triple teaming in their corner while The Shield took back control with each member using their strengths such as Ambrose's brawling & Rollings aerial assault & Reigns power along with double & triple team tactics of own including using a specific submission maneuver just to play mind games before things really got out of control with the action spilling onto the outside with men fighting on & running across announce tables into the crowd with one man taking one hell of a ""leap of faith."" You can tell going into this match that it was going to be a war & it didn't disappoint one bit.Extreme RulesUnited States Champion Sheamus vs. Cesaro - J.B.L. predicted on commentary that this match was going to get physical right from the start & it did as soon as the bell rang with both men giving & receiving strong strikes such as Cesaro's various european uppercuts while Sheamus beat on his chest more times in the ropes than he usually does as both men traded momentum showing their strengths such as a superplex from the top rope after dead lifting his opponent off the apron or catching their opponent in mid-air or countering their signature moves with one of their own. This was a really good opening match that was exactly what Michael Cole said in the beginning, ""this is going to be a physical match.""PaybackLast Man Standing: John Cena vs. Bray Wyatt - Bray had his followers Luke Harper & Erick Rowan at ringside with him as usual only for Cena to counter that with Jimmy & Jey Uso in his corner as well as Cena was able to get a shot in himself only for Bray to either counter or shrug it off & stay in control in the opening moments hitting big moves of his own such as the big splash in corner or one arm chokeslam before both men were able to execute big vintage moves with each man delievering as much as they were receiving such as chairshots & using the steel steps including one shot to the face to Wyatt that you had to see to believe as both men continued to fight both in & around the ringside area hitting their signature moves on the floor with the brawl continuing all the way to the production area with more than just the two ""legal"" participants having their bodies thrown through objects all around the arena. This is one of those matches where if you can get past the end result then this was a really big back & forth brawl with great spots between all six men involved.PaybackMoney In The Bank Ladder Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Jack Swagger vs. Seth Rollins - It should be noted that Bad News Barrett was injured earlier in the week eliminating him from this match as this match was full of various highlights including Ambrose staying true to his word targeting Rollins right away fighting into the timekeepers area, the unique way Kofi caught himself falling off the ladder, ladder used as a weapon, superstars sacrificing themselves to hurt the other, one man getting taken out due to injury only to return later, one man backdropped onto a scaffold ladder, a chair coming into play, signature moves executed using the ladder, and ""there's always a Plan B."" This was one of those ladder matches that had tons of hard work & crazy spots where everyone has having their moment to shine with my opinion being Jack Swagger being the M.V.P. of the match getting without a doubt his strongest singles performance in almost a year.Money In The Bank[The Destruction Of The Shield]2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Tag Team Champions Usos vs. Wyatt Family - The Wyatts were able to get the first string of momentum when they were able to knock one of the Usos off balance & keep him grounded heavily working over the head before the Usos were able to start to using their momentum against them & going ""Uso Crazy"" with their aerial assault onto both members in & outside of the ring along with the Wyatt's showing some aerial ability of their own as both men traded momentum with both teams either countering each other's or delivering the same offense against each other with each time coming closer to winning the match after each pin attempt to the point where you saw the disbelief on their faces after the near fall and sequences of hitting hitting one big move after another. J.B.L. said it best, ""Someone call the sheriff, they just stole the show"" as this was an unbelievable high quality tag team encounter between both teams.BattlegroundIntercontinental Championship Battle Royal - Bad News Barrett made it clear that he had some ""bad news"" to give to the winner before the match as the various highlights include everyone targeting who they felt was the biggest threat, Dolph Ziggler's heavy amount of close calls, Kofi Kingston continuing his highlight reel of avoiding elimination, the strength of Cesaro, an ""Undertaker/Maven"" moment in regards to the most surprising elimination of the match, Sheamus hard fight to unify his U.S. Title, and when it got down to the ""final"" two.BattlegroundDivas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Paige - Paige came into this match celebrating her 22nd birthday as you knew where this was going in the opening seconds where an attempted handshake resulted in the hand being bitten & hair (or weave) pulled out by the roots as the women took the fight to the outside bouncing heads off announce tables & bodies thrown into the barricade & more hair pulled out as the girls picked up the intensity with various kicks & knees to their faces, one girl being shoved off the top rope, and one impactful counter to a move that had put other divas down. Both divas put a lot into his match action & storywise with the short time they had.SummerSlamFlag Match: Jack Swagger vs. Rusev - The winner of this match would have their flag raised & national anthem played after the match as Jack Swagger came out with the color guard from the Ft. Irwin military base with one man deciding to attack before the bell only for it to backfire with him heavily showing the effects of his injury throughout the contest to the point where he was having a hard time standing up only to even the odds attacking a previous injury on his opponent working over the ribs but kept hurting himself with the kicks & stomps to his opponent & even having to modify his signature move while his opponent unleashed a series of impactful moves including various suplexes. Both men really took it to each other here & told a great story here in regards to working over a body part.SummerSlamLumberjack Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins - Dean dominated early punishing & torturing Rollins while taking advantage of the lumberjacks on the outside tossing Seth to them more than once before Seth attempted to use the lumberjacks the same way only for Dean to react differently having no issues fighting back with the lumberjacks as both men traded momentum in the ring before the action went to the outside with both men fighting the lumberjacks to either get to or away from their opponent with the action spilling out throughout the crowd with the lumberjacks eventually having to physically carry to men back to the ring with the action just being unable to be contained between the two legal men in the match. J.B.L. pretty much said it best, ""this was the wildest most chaotic lumberjack match in history.""SummerSlam[The Destruction Of The Shield]Tag Team Champions The Usos vs. Goldust & Stardust - Jey came into this match with a bad leg that had been injured & attacked by the Rhodes for weeks leading into the match as the Usos took control early with some double teaming to the point where it took a distraction from the referee for the Rhodes to regain the advantage making frequent tags & focusing on one member of the opposition to the point where when he was able to start getting some offense on one man that his partner was able to cut him off right away while continuing to take advantage of distractions by the referee as both teams traded momentum with high impact offense & both teams flying onto each other while The Usos attempted to the Rhodes a taste of their own medicine from previous weeks. A very good athletic back & forth tag team match.Night Of ChampionsChris Jericho vs. Randy Orton - Jericho started out in control with a fast pace & taking the action to the outside early on using the ringside environment to his advantage before Orton was able to gain the advantage & keep it slowing down the pace & taking advantage of any openings such as coming into the ring or when he was on the top rope or coming into the corner along with also giving a receipt for Jericho's actions on the outside earlier as both men continued to trade momentum delivering sequences of counters & reversals to each others offense followed by delivering a signature move of their own including each man playing mind games suckering the their opponent in resulting in a competitive match that saw Orton show more personality than usual as far as interaction with not only the crowd but a moment with an announcer at ringside.Night Of Champions[The Road is Jericho: Epic Stories & Rare Matches from Y2J]WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena - WWE did another good video package that caught my attention before this match but in this case was a bell to bell breakdown of the numbers involved in their previous SummerSlam match. Cena attempted to give Brock a taste of his own medicine from SummerSlam in the opening minute while Brock heavily focused on the midsection using the same strategy from SummerSlam with various suplexes along with using his trademark kimura armlock submission stopping Cena dead in his tracks whenever he started to gain momentum only for Cena to ""never give up"" to the point where he was able to get some hard blows in to the point where Brock was bleeding from the nose as both men did go back & forth hitting their impactful moves along with sequences of countering or powering out their opponents. This was definitely a more competitive match than SummerSlam with the only downfall being the finish...depending on how you want to look at it.Night Of Champions2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Cesaro - Both men started out with some grounded grappling early with Cesaro getting the early advantage including delivering a big move we haven't seen from him recently as he continued to attack with more aggression as time went on with strikes & submissions to the point where he hurt his own arm executing a power move which Dolph capitalized on himself using a series of submission moves himself with both men trading momentum using one big signature move after another resulting in a fun athletic opening match with the only downfall being that the match stipulation don't being necessary for how the match actually played out.Hell In A CellHell In A Cell Match: John Cena vs. Randy Orton - The winner would get a future title shot against WWE Champion Brock Lesnar while it should be noted that technically this is the first ever rematch in the history of Hell In A Cell, Lesnar's advocate Paul Heyman was on the PPV panel, and there was a funny sign that WWE camera caught & stayed on a sign for a few seconds saying ""Enjoy Cena vs. Orton #121."" Both men began trading fist right away taking the fight to the outside before one man was able to gain the advantage using the ringside environment to his advantage such as the cell & steps along with using a chair to various parts of the body remaining dominate stopping his opponent dead in his tracks whenever he attempted to gain momentum including one move that ended one person's career in a previous Cell match along with continuing to use weapons to his advantage & having unique counters from his opponents offense before his opponent was able to fight back using the weapons himself along with using counters & delivering his signature moves on more than one occasion. This was the best Cena/Orton match in close to a year since their T.L.C. match as the Cell & weapons definitely added to the match but Cena was heavily on defense for a majority of the match instead of it being more competitive.Hell In A CellNow I know that there isn't enough room to get every single quality match from the year but some of the choices were very questionable for this being a ""Best Of"" as certain matches were picked in favor of some that were better quality or more significant (21-1...enough said) but we still got some of the best encounters from the year so overall this is no different than the previous years in that this is a collection for those who those who have enjoyed WWE this year but obviously are unable to watch/collect most of the PPV's.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWFGJF2756DEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PZX2CZS#wasThisHelpful","RWFGJF2756DEN","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It should be noted that this was the final live monthly PPV for TNA as they would scale back their live PPV schedule to only 3 (Lockdown, Slammiversary, Bound For Glory) while doing the rest of the events as special editions of Impact & monthly pre-taped themed PPV's under the ""One Night Only"" series.  Also on this show was a segment between Brooke Hogan & Bully Ray to put over their upcoming wedding on Impact as well.Tag Team Champions Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez vs. Joey Ryan & Matt Morgan - A rematch from the previous Final Resolution PPV that started off that saw Joey Ryan constantly showing off & not taking matters as seriously as his partner that kept allowing Chavo & Hernandez to get the advantage to the point where Morgan had to keep tagging himself in to get the advantage back for his team only for Ryan to keep tagging himself back in & losing the advantage.  This was one of those matches that was more about pushing a storyline than anything else which was the issues between Morgan & Ryan.Samoa Joe vs. Mr. Anderson - Samoa Joe wanted an answer to weather Anderson was aligned with Aces & Eights while Anderson refused to give an answer leading to this match here with Joe starting out very aggressive just beating on Anderson non-stop in & out of the ring while yelling ""ANSWER ME!"" until Anderson was able to take advantage of his surroundings to get some momentum working over a part of Joe's body that was clearly hurt to the point where he showed signs of it while executing his own offense.  This was an average match that only served the purpose of continuing the mystery of if Anderson was a member of Aces & Eights.Christian York vs. Kenny King - This was the finals of an X Division contenders tournament with the winner facing the champion right after the match as the action starting off with both men trading slaps before York was able to gain the advantage with various chops & dropkicks along with a head scissors takedown off the apron before King was able to come back showcasing various offense in either strength such as muscling up York for a rock bottom or aerial with a reverse top rope crossbody.  This was a good match between both men but had an aftermath with the loser taking his aggression out on the winner setting up...X Division Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Christian York - ...this match right after with York in even worse condition from the post-match attack to the point where RVD attempted to reason with York that he didn't have to compete only for York to slap him as the match had RVD in control with his trademark offense of using his educated feet along with some impactful moves & stretches only for York to not only keep kicking out despite RVD yelling for him to stay down but also keep hanging with RVD & even got some close pin attempts on him as well.  This match told a real good story of York being an underdog & not 100% yet still took everything the champion threw at him & even gave RVD a run for his money as the two matches here really put over York as a strong babyface for the division.Television Champion Devon vs. Joseph Park - This was Park's first match since he was officially ""trained"" with Devon constantly taunting him & showing that he wasn't taking Park seriously until Park was able to get some quick moves in on him & keep catching Devon off guard causing Devon to get more serious in his attack on Park including taking a shortcut that caused Park not to bleed but showcase a reaction that we've seen from his brother in the past.  This was one of those matches where you'll enjoy it if you understand the story they were telling about Park still being inexperienced to the point where you saw he was clearly nervous & having second thoughts on some of the offense he performed.Knockouts Gauntlet Match: Gail Kim vs. Brooke Tessmacher vs. O.D.B. vs. Mickie James vs. Velvet Sky - This was to determine the #1 contender for Tara's Knockout Championship that saw various highlights such as Gail & Tessmacher renewing their old rivalry with hard they were going at it against each other, where the match with O.D.B. started, the hardest we've seen Mickie James work in a while, and when it got down to the final two including the issues one participant kept having with the referee Taryn Terrell.  This was one of the best knockouts matches in a while due to how hard some of the knockouts (including one who was the M.V.P. of the match) worked while Taz did have some funny lines on commentary that I couldn't help but laugh at from time to time.James Storm vs. Christopher Daniels - This match had a special stipulation with the winner getting a TNA Championship match on a future episode of Impact while Kazarian was Daniels' manager for the match complete with a ""manager's license.""  Storm started out in control taking the match both in & outside the ring before Kaz had to cause a distraction allowing Daniels to take back the advantage in the ring working over Storm's arm while Kaz would then get physically involved on the outside.  Very good match with both men trading momentum & Kaz adding to the match playing the ""old school"" heel manager role as well.Sting vs. D.O.C. - Sting came out brawling on the outside before the match even started all the way to the Aces & Eights entrance to the point where D.O.C. had to use help to regain control for a moment while also avoiding whenever Sting attempted to use the Scorpion Deathdrop.  This match served the purpose of Sting returning against the man who put him out for weeks but was pretty short & sweet past that & the aftermath where he had help when the rest of Aces & Eights appeared.Elimination Match: TNA Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Austin Aries vs. Bobby Roode - Jeff Hardy came into this match as the odd man out as Aries & Roode already revealed that they made a deal to work together as a team to take out Hardy which was showcased throughout the match with both men working him over together & take away his daredevil offense by keeping him grounded causing Hardy to use different strategies such as hit & run on both men or single out one man at a time which was able to keep Hardy one step ahead of both men at times including using one to execute offense on the other while capitalizing on moments of miscommunication between Roode & Aries as well.  This was a very good main event with the story of the match playing out perfectly.In the end, this was one of those events that didn't have a bad unwatchable match on it as there was some average & solid to really good wrestling but didn't have a match that was very memorable or worth going out of your way to watch as this was more about continuing storylines more than anything else so it's a solid event that I would recommend to steam or rent.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJ40CCGYHXRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWU1EOS#wasThisHelpful","R3PJ40CCGYHXRJ","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can be said about Jeff Hardy that pretty much hasn't been said...he's one of the most charismatic superstars of this generation, a true to life enigma, daredevil in life and one of the most popular wrestlers in history to the point where TNA has released another DVD set (only one to get this many sets from TNA) decided to him here in ""Humanomoly.""  It should be noted that despite TNA advertising this as a ""Volume 3"", this more of an essential greatest matches set that used matches from his previous sets along with new material as well.TNA Debut vs. x Division Champion A.J. Styles - This was at the second anniversary show & suppose to be Kid Kash's title shot against A.J. but due to Kash being injured, Styles had to face a mystery man which turned out to be the TNA debut of Jeff Hardy making this an X division dream match. Both men challenged each other to take their best shot against each other with Styles chopping Hardy so hard that he knocked off his neck collar. Both men were able to match each other move for move throughout the match until it was ruined by Kid Kash & Dallas but it was Hardy & Styles who were left standing in the end.June '04[Enigma: The Best Of Jeff Hardy Vol. 1; Best Of The Asylum Years]Falls Count Anywhere Match vs. Abyss - Both men started brawling in the ring before taking the fight to the outside & backstage area within minutes with both men taking advantage of the environment before they came back to the ring using weapons such as a chair & ladder in different ways to punch their opponents even at the expense of themselves from unprotected chairshots to a powerbomb through a table in what was a physical contest with one man getting the final word in after the match.Destination X '05[Enigma: The Best Of Jeff Hardy Vol. 1; Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls Vol. 1]Steel Cage/Tables Match vs. Raven - Tables were already setup in the cage only for Hardy to bring chairs inside as well as both men used the cage to their advantage sending each other into it head first & grinding it against the steel until they were bleeding as each man attempted on high impact offense that ultimately sent themselves through a table instead of their opponent while also using the broken pieces of the table & chairs as a weapon as well in match that was physical with quite a visual for how the match ended.Lockdown '05[Enigma: The Best Of Jeff Hardy]Monster's Ball Match vs. Sabu vs. Abyss vs. Rhino - The ""gimmick"" for this match was that all four men were locked away in a dark room for hours with no food or water right before they came into the match competed under hardcore rules with started out right away in a four way brawl in & outside of the ring that went through the crowd with multiple men bleeding in the opening moments with various weapons coming into play from kendo sticks shots to chokeslams on chairs to bodies flying through tables including Jeff Hardy's swanton that you had to see to believe in what was definitely an extreme war to say the least.Bound For Glory '05[Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls Vol. 1]vs. A.J. Styles w/Abyss as the special enforcer - Talk about deja vu as Hardy's first match in TNA was against the same man here in his return to TNA with the difference being that this happened during the period where A.J. was the TNA Champion but also aligned with Ric Flair leading to Hulk Hogan making Abyss (Styles opponent at the upcoming PPV) the special enforcer to ensure Flair doesn't get involved. Both men traded off chops in the corner before Styles focused on Hardy's leg & worked over it using the tactics done by Flair himself in the past. Hardy did his usual unique offense during the match which A.J. was able to adapt to over time like his counter to the Twist Of Fate with the pele kick. Nice match between the two.""Impact"" Mar. '10[Enigma: The Best Of Jeff Hardy Vol. 2]TNA Championship Match vs. Kurt Angle vs. Mr. Anderson - This was one of those triple threat matches that was non-stop action with each men having their moments to look strong with such moments like both Angle & Hardy going after Anderson early, Kurt Angle german suplexing both men at the same time while later applying an single anklelock to both men, Angle injuring his ribs via a samoan roll from Anderson off the top rope followed by a Hardy swanton bomb on both men, and Angle delivering a top rope Angle Slam. The big story here was the appearance of Eric Bischoff with a chair looking to hit someone with it before Hulk Hogan made his first appearance in weeks coming down the ramp & getting in the ring on crutches looking ready to fight Bischoff who took one of the crutches before Hardy intervened & took the crutch from Hogan...to nail Kurt Angle with it & hit Anderson with the other one causing Hardy to pin Anderson. From there, Jeff Jarrett & Abyss came down to the ring to celebrate with Hogan & Bischoff & Hardy when RVD made his way down only for Hardy to nail him with the championship. Abyss' words rang true as ""THEY"" arrived on 10-10-10.Bound For Glory '10[Enigma: The Best Of Jeff Hardy Vol. 2; Immortal Forever]Ladder Match vs. TNA Champion Mr. Anderson - Despite various ladders setup around ringside, Hardy came out with his own custom painted ladder before the match. As expected in a ladder match involving Jeff Hardy, there were various bumps & spots involved here such as Hardy's flip powerbomb off the ladder, Anderson back dropped on the ladder while later hurting his wrist on the steel steps, Hardy doing a springboard legdrop off the steps on the outside, and Anderson delivering his rolling samoan drop on the ladder before hitting his own swanton bomb with his head hitting the ladder. The only thing I can really say bad here was that they had an ending planned that would have looked great if they pulled it off but because of an issue with the belt, both guys landed very hard & they had to just do an audible with the finish. For Anderson not having much experience in ladder matches, he looked strong here & held his own while we know Hardy is ""at home"" in these type of matches so while he wasn't a ""car crash spotfest"" ladder match, this was really good.Against All Odds '11[Enigma: The Best Of Jeff Hardy Vol. 2]vs. Jeff Jarrett - All I can say for the first moment of the match is ""Don't Blink"" as Hardy pulled a fast one on Jarrett which he couldn't handle & had the match restarted. Jarrett got in control & tried to keep Hardy down limiting his daredevil offense throughout the match but he was able to catch Jarrett again in the blink of an eye which drove Jarrett crazy causing him to use a chair & force the referee back in the ring to restart the match again only for Hardy to once again catch Jarrett for the third time in a row. This entire scenario was pretty entertaining & did it's job in putting Hardy over big time in his first major comeback match.Turning Point '11Steel Cage Match vs. Jeff Jarrett - This match had various stipulations attached to it such as Karen Jarrett would be handcuffed to Sting at ringside while Hardy would be fired if he lost but would get a World Title match if he won along with one of the Jarrett's being fired as well. Both men attempted to climb out the cage various times early on in the match with Jarrett countering one attempt by shoving Hardy down on his head while Hardy used his unique daredevil offense here such as a body splash & attempted Swanton Bomb off the top of the cage. At one point both men were fighting for the door to be opened with Sting getting the effects of it resulting in Karen also attempting to help Jeff with a weapon we haven't seen in a very long time. This isn't a classic cage match but was entertaining.Final Resolution '11Steel Cage Match vs. Kurt Angle - Angle came into this match with his knee heavily taped but dominated right from the start & resorted to dirty tactics the minute Hardy started to mount some momentum but Hardy still brought the fight only for it to keep backfiring like his springboard kick in the corner had him hurt himself by landing on his own head & later his own momentum being used by Kurt to launch himself into the cage as Kurt continued to bring the pain as Hardy head was busted open from it being grinded into the cage & throwing it into the cage over & over again. Hardy finally got some offense in including a Twist Of Fate/Stunner combination before Angle bounced back catching Hardy on the top rope for an Angle Slam as they really picked up the pace & hit move after move from Hardy countering Kurt's anklelock into one of his own followed by two Swanton Bombs that had Hardy's entire weight crash on top of Kurt's chest before Hardy counter the Angle Slam with one of his own followed by his own Swanton Bomb off the top of the cage. This match told the story well of Hardy trying to beat Angle at his own game & definitely was the match of the night.Lockdown '12vs. TNA Champion Austin Aries - Hardy (complete with a new entrance theme) & Aries tried to show up each other early on with shoves & slaps before Aries was able to take control & really throw it in Hardy's face causing Jeff to lose his cool & make Aries pay for it before giving a ""receipt"" for the showing off. They took the match to the outside where Hardy used to guardrail & turning Aries upside down into the steps before returning to the ring where Aries was able to take advantage of a mistiming by Hardy working over the back with various holds like an under grip backbreaker, grounded abdominal stretch, and top rope dropkick o the back. The action continued to pick up with Hardy countering Aries brainbuster & Aries delivering two back to back suicide dives squishing Hardy on the outside between himself & the guardrail with such impact that Aries cut himself above the eye before the match got taken to the ramp with Hardy's head taking a nasty bump. This was a really good main event here as they told a good story with the crowd also being split adding to the match.Bound For Glory '12TNA Championship/Ladder Match vs. Austin Aries - This started off normal between both men but didn't stay that way for long as the ladder came into play very quick starting with a tug of war on the outside followed by various high impact moves like a russian leg sweep off the ladder, a dive into an upside down open ladder followed by a roll on the ladder with the other sandwiched inside, and trapped on the outside with the steps on top of the ladder. The ladder continued to be used as a weapon such as when it was shoved from underneath causing a crash & burn onto the mat, one man the ladder being rode down onto the other, Aries doing a missile dropkick knocking one off the ladder, both men falling off one ladder landing on another, and more than one Twist Of Fate using the ladder. This was a very good ladder match that saw not only some impactful spots but also told the good story of Aries constantly trying to out think Hardy.Turning Point '12TNA Championship/Elimination Match vs. Austin Aries vs. Bobby Roode - Jeff Hardy came into this match as the odd man out as Aries & Roode already revealed that they made a deal to work together as a team to take out Hardy which was showcased throughout the match with both men working him over together & take away his daredevil offense by keeping him grounded causing Hardy to use different strategies such as hit & run on both men or single out one man at a time which was able to keep Hardy one step ahead of both men at times including using one to execute offense on the other while capitalizing on moments of miscommunication between Roode & Aries as well.  This was a very good main event with the story of the match playing out perfectly.Genesis '13Tables Match: The Hardys vs. TNA Tag Team Champions The Wolves vs. Team 3D - This was the second match in their series for the TNA Tag Team Titles as this started out as a six way brawl with tables being used in unique ways as weapons such as to counter & execute offense with more effect along with different areas of the table not normally used against their opponents & different types of strategies used use as using a teams own momentum against them to break tables or moving it out the way so another team wouldn't win the match in a good encounter that had quite the visual for the win.""Impact"" Sept. '14The Hardys vs. The Wolves - This was a #1 contenders match with The Revolution watching from the balcony. Both teams were evenly matched trading momentum using double team offense with the Wolves using fast tags & a physical style singling out one opponent while the Hardys worked over both Wolves individually using some of their aerial daredevil offense in & outside of the ring executing one signature impactful move after another in a competitive match.""Impact"" Jan. '15Lethal Lockdown Match vs. James Storm - This was subtitled ""Hardy's Revenge"" due to Jeff looking to get his hands on Storm after injuring him weeks earlier as both men used the weapons such as a trash can & chair against each other along with the cage structure itself in unique ways along with Hardy looking for receipts for what he did earlier in what was this match designed to be, a hardcore brawl.""Impact"" Mar. '15TNA Tag Team Championship/Ultimate X Match: The Hardys vs. Austin Aries & Bobby Roode vs. Kenny King & Low-Ki vs. Ethan Carter III & Bram - This was the finals of the tournament for the vacant Tag Team Championships that featured such highlights as a one man being thrown so hard that he took out the camera man, a third party getting involved in the action including being so strong that he shook the structure knocking everyone off, another object coming into play, and unique ways of assisting their partners in climbing the ropes in what was a fun match.""Impact"" Apr. '15Other matches include tag matches with Matt Hardy from Impact against The BroMans (Oct. '14), Ethan Carter III & Tyrus (Oct. '14), Samoa Joe & Low-Ki (Nov. '14), and James Storm & Khoya (Apr. '15) along with his 2010 TNA return.  Bonus material include an interview with Jeff, a music video, acoustic performances & a tour of his art collection.The only real negatives I have is that some of the matches on here could have been replaced with better quality encounters as such the recent cage match against The Revolution or the entire series between Team 3D & The Wolves or their first singles encounter against Team 3D or his 2009 classics against Kurt Angle.  You can't win them all but this is definitely a collection that would satisfy any Hardy fan so it's something I would recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O3I66K5FXOLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0124FH628#wasThisHelpful","R1O3I66K5FXOLP","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's so much to be said about the name Hulk Hogan & professional wrestling/sports entertainment but when it comes to his time in TNA, that is definitely a controversial subject for various reasons (another subject for another time) but TNA put together a set featuring various highlights from his time in the company.Matches Include:No Disqualification Match w/Abyss vs. A.J. Styles & Ric Flair - This was originally planned to be the first match of the night but after a few minutes, Sting appeared only to attack Hogan & Abyss with Flair & Styles joining in leaving Hogan a bloody mess causing Hogan to have the match rescheduled for later in the night under ""no disqualification"" rules. Hogan's head is bandaged from the assault by Sting earlier & starts out with Flair brawling on the floor leading to Flair being opened up. Flair tried chopping & punching Hogan to no avail with Hogan returning everything Flair gave him & went as far as to whip Flair with his weight belt in the ring. Flair had to resort to dirty tactics to gain some offense tagging in A.J. Styles who reopened the cut from earlier & beat on Hogan in front of his daughter Brooke building up to the hot tag to Abyss. This was a fun back & forth match that was entertaining with the aftermath being full of complete chaos with appearances from Desmond Wolfe, D'Angelo Dinero, and the return of Jeff Hardy.""Impact"" Mar. '10[Immortal Forever; TNA's Greatest Moments]Lethal Lockdown - Team Hogan vs. Team Flair: Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Jeff Hardy, Rob Van Dam vs. Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Beer Money - For those who haven't seen a Lethal Lockdown match, it's held under the same rules which the old WCW/NWA match of War Games where under. One man from each team starts the match and after a period of time, another member from one team (which in this case was Team Hogan due to RVD winning the match earlier) enters and after each time period, the teams alternate sending members in. Once all team members enter the cage, the roof containing all the weapons is lowered onto the cage and the only way to win is by pinfall or submission.Unfortunately, this turned out to be my least favorite Lethal Lockdown match since the very first one back in 2005 was as there wasn't much that stood out during the match past Abyss starting the match with an injured hip from being hit by a car on Impact (you read that right) against Robert Roode, Desmond Wolfe going after Abyss' Hall Of Fame ring, Jeff Hardy going completely crazy with a kendo stick, and someone going through a table on the roof of the cage before the action in the ring completely stopped (as if time stood still) as Flair entered the match to take Abyss' ring followed by Hogan & Bischoff getting in the ring and had their own little brawl. This match was a normal Lethal Lockdown match before everyone in the ring (including Sting of all people) was forgotten about as the focus got put completely on Jeff Hardy's daredevil stunt at the top of the cage followed by it becoming the Hogan/Flair/Bischoff show resulting in this Lethal Lockdown match definitely being my least favorite since the first one 5 years earlier.LockDown '10[Immortal Forever]vs. Sting - This match was for control of TNA as Hogan came out in his street clothes as he made it clear that he wasn't going to wrestle but instead fight Sting while Sting came out in his gear wearing a red & yellow ""Hulkamania"" shirt. Dixie Carter was sitting in the front row while Hogan revealed that Ric Flair was going to be in his corner with the special twist being that the referee was ""Jackson James"" who was revealed earlier in the night to be Eric Bischoff's son Garrett. Hogan kept overpowering Sting early while Flair got his shots in the floor whenever possible including both men hitting low blows on Sting. Hogan used a weapon given to him by Flair to bust Sting open before Sting was able to fight off both men & use the weapon to make Hogan bleed before delivering Stinger Splashes to Hogan's bad back followed by the Scorpion Deathlock. The aftermath here was the real story as we saw Immortal come out, the battle of the Bischoff's, and the REAL Hulk Hogan return. The match was what you would expect knowing Hogan's condition but what happened with Hogan afterwords was suppose to come off as ""he saw the light"" (think Darth Vader saving Luke Skywalker in Return Of The Jedi) but just the way it happened came off very flat.Bound For Glory '11[Best Of Sting]w/Sting & James Storm vs. Kurt Angle, Bobby Roode, Bully Ray - This was a ""never before seen"" match from the ""Maximum Impact"" tour of Europe as Hogan was in his street clothes for this match in what was a pretty basic tag match with Angle & Roode & Bully using their numbers to single out one opponent at a time with double & triple teaming while constantly causing distractions for the referee to turn his back to the action allowing them to take advantage both on the floor & on the outside building to the hot tag to Hogan in the final minute of the match.Maximum Impact Tour '12Other material include his press conference from Madison Square Garden, debut on Impact, appearance at Wembley Arena in London, the formation of ""Immortal"", a brawl with Bully Ray along with Aces & Eights, an interview of Hogan, and the Before The Bell special on his Bound For Glory match with Sting.As I said earlier, a lot can be said about Hogan's time in TNA but lets be honest here in that he was mostly used to talk more than anything else as his physical ability was extremely limited & with TNA is mostly ignoring their previous DVD collections with these new sets as most of these highlights were seen on the previous ""Immortal"" DVD set while everything else here isn't worth going out of your way to see. Backstage politics & internet ""dirt sheet"" news aside only to strictly looking at the product produced here that it's obvious to me that TNA decided to put this set out trying to capitalize on the recent fame Hogan has gained for himself recently in WWE (similar to their Sting set a few months ago) but with no matches & segments here that have stood the test of time or worth going out of your way to get, this is a set that I can only recommend for die hard Hulk Hogan fans but not recommend to anyone else.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJWGCF1ZY7COW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0124F2J5W#wasThisHelpful","RJWGCF1ZY7COW","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Sean Waltman, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall were at one time a very controversial group behind the scenes who were all about one things which was dominating the wrestling business like never before to the point where they didn't just dominate WWE but also WCW at the same time as they weren't just a faction created on television but a group of friends known as ""The Kliq."" You hear the story of their positive & negative influence in the wrestling business throughout the presentation hearing from the members themselves along with other personalities such as Lex Luger, Vince McMahon, Sunny, Vince Russo, Billy Gunn, Bret Hart, Sgt. Slaughter, Shane Douglas, Justin Credible, Godfather, Jim Ross, J.B.L., Rikishi, Undertaker, Eric Bischoff, Ted Dibiase, Diamond Dallas Page, Hulk Hogan, Dean Malenko, Sting, Chris Jericho, Rick Steiner, and Jason Comidies & Mani Mohtrio who taped the infamous ""Curtain Call"" while also looking at the entire group's reunion in WWE after almost 20 years backstage at the Hall Of Fame ceremonies & WrestleMania weekends.Normally I save my summary towards the end but I'll give it now in that this was a different type of presentation than we usually get from WWE in that this wasn't a ""career retrospective"" more than a detailed look at the group itself with the fact that you didn't see a heavily amount of bias towards the group as they kept it honest with members openly admitting they did things on purpose to stur up trouble along & had attitude problems amongst other issues making them difficult to work with while others were brutally honest with their negative opinions towards them. The match selection is a mixed bag as we got rarer matches from television such as RAW during the ""New Generation"" era (which we don't get a lot of) involving the group instead of the usual PPV matches that was been more available on other DVD sets over the years & currently on their network but the negative is that some of those matches are easily forgettable or been reused on DVD sets so many times instead of giving a better alternative that still got the point across (the WrestleMania X ladder match on another DVD set when the SummerSlam rematch is still unused for almost a decade). In the end, the positives outweigh the negatives so this is a set I would recommend for anyone who's a fan of any of these superstars or this era of wrestling.The documentary begins with the story of how the group came together throughout the years along with explanations of where elements such as their name & infamous hand symbol came from before going into how they were behind the scenes as far as the antics they did that rubbed the talent the wrong way along with talk about another backstage clique that was around at the time followed by discussion of their relationship with Vince McMahon & if that was truly ""best for business"" for the company or themselves. One of the biggest discussions took place next in the infamous ""Curtain Call"" at Madison Square Garden as far as how it all came together but didn't go originally as planned along with how it was a huge issue with the ""traditionalist"" in the company before going into members of the Kliq heading to WCW as far as how that effected both products on screen & behind the scenes with such phrases around the WCW talent as ""Well in New York..."" and how they still showcased their friendship to each other across television along with going into the personal issues members of the Kliq were going through at that time causing one member to comment on how he thought at times someone was going to die. The return to WWE of Hall & Nash and eventually Shawn Michaels was discussed next as far as why these reunions didn't last long and how each member evolved over the years to where they became members of the Hall Of Fame & finally had a reunion together after all these years.Matches Include:The Kid vs. Razor Ramon - All I can say is don't take a bathroom break here as you'll miss what is still considered to be one of the biggest upsets in not just RAW but probably WRESTLING history here.""RAW"" May '93[Best Of RAW: 15th Anniversary; RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]1-2-3 Kid vs. Razor Ramon - Razor had a sack of $10,000 he put up in order to get this rematch as the Kid used his superior speed to his advantage with various kids while Razor used his power & size tossing Kid around along with trying to embarrass him when possible while Kid continued to take high risk that didn't always pay off as this ultimately came down to not who was the better wrestler but who was able to outsmart his opponent.""RAW"" June '93Razor Ramon vs. Diesel - Diesel was easily overpowering Razor shoving him around & down to the mat while heavily focusing on a specific part of his body causing Razor to resort to taking Diesel off his feet including coming off the ropes to knock him down in what was a short but solid encounter.""RAW"" Nov. '93[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]1-2-3 Kid vs. Shawn Michaels - 1-2-3 Kid vs. Shawn Michaels - As a result of the interference the previous week, these two faced off against each the week after. The Kid showed superior quickness against Shawn early before Shawn finally caught the Kid with a back suplex from an attempted headlock & even took a page out of Kid's playbook with a flying head scissors on Kid to the outside & later catching the Kid in mid-air with a dropkick. Shawn slowed the pace down & worked over Kid's back with various backbreakers & hard irish whips in the turnbuckles. Both men were so evenly matched that both men were exhausted after a while. Shawn was able to gain the advantage & delivered a Razor's Edge to Kid before making it clear he wanted to punish Kid instead of beating him by doing another Razor's Edge causing Razor Ramon to come out & save the Kid from it being done a third time. This caused the brawl to the back between Shawn & Razor that saw Diesel get involved leading to Shawn giving Razor his own Razor's Edge two times on the floor.""RAW"" Dec. '93[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]Razor Ramon & 1-2-3 Kid vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Quebecers - Kid walked into this match with a previously hurt leg that the Quebecers tried to go for early to no avail before Johnny Polo got involved & took a Razor's Edge on the outside for his troubles. Razor & Kid were in control for most of this match before Diesel made an appearance that had the advantage switch back to the Quebecers who were able to focus on Kid's leg building to the hot tag to Razor before Shawn Michaels once again let his presence felt.""RAW"" Feb. '94[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]Ladder Match: Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Shawn Michaels - This was the first ladder match to be seen on WWE television. Both men started off wrestling early before Diesel got involved & ended up paying for it before Razor removed the outside mat & exposed the concrete that didn't end up working in his favor. The ladder came into play from here as Shawn started to use it as a weapon to attack Razor's ribs starting with a baseball slide into the ladder right into Razor's ribs & later doing a big splash off the top of it while later Razor used it to his advantage by whipping Shawn into it & using it squish Shawn into the ring post. There were times when both men launched an attack while one was on the ladder much as Razor slamming Shawn off of it & him ""making an ass"" of Shawn to prevent him from winning the match. This ladder match was the one that set the standard for what WWE would do this match for years to come as it was definitely a match where both men came out stronger than they went in with Jerry Lawler to the point said about one competitor, ""He Is Superman!""WrestleMania X[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; History Of Intercontinental Championship; Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn; Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden; True Story Of WrestleMania]Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Diesel - This match happened a little while after the classic ladder match between Shawn Michaels & Razor Ramon at WrestleMania as it was time for Shawn's bodyguard, Diesel, to attempt to gain the Intercontinental Championship. Razor came out very aggressive while Diesel used his power & size to his advantage. There were times where Razor was able to counteract Diesel's size like a top rope bulldog but in the end, numbers amongst other things caught up to Razor as Diesel would go on to win his first championship. This was more of a teaser for their upcoming SummerSlam match than anything else but a very good match for the ""Superstars"" show at that time.""Superstars"" Apr. '94[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's; True Giants]WWE Tag Team Champions Shawn Michaels & Diesel vs. Razor Ramon & 1-2-3 Kid - Diesel & Shawn attacked from behind only for Razor & Kid to use their momentum against them to get the advantage including a Razor's Edge in the opening minute before Shawn & Diesel recovered utilizing the strategy of singling out one opponent for an extended period grounding him & using illegal tactics such as double teaming only for it to heavily backfire causing their opponents to use their same strategy against them in what was a highly competitive match.""Action Zone"" Oct. '94Elimination Match - The Bad Guys vs. The Teamsters: Razor Ramon, 1-2-3 Kid, British Bulldog, Headshrinkers vs. Diesel, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart - This was a good opener as it was well paced with various storylines being put over such as Headshrinker Fatu having trouble adjusting to being ""americanized"" by wearing wrestling boots. The major storyline here was Diesel dominating & eliminating every member until Shawn Michaels (who was never tagged in the match) accidentally kicked him in the face (for the third time since SummerSlam) and Diesel going after Shawn with his whole team being counted out in the process. The ending was weak with Razor Ramon winning his match the same way Flair won his 3 years earlier but the bigger story was this was the HBK/Diesel story that would lead to the WM11 main event.Survivor Series '94Razor Ramon vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - Razor was able to get the early advantage only for Hunter to get the advantage using Razor's momentum against him followed by heavily focusing on a specific part of the body with Razor not only having to deal with Hunter staying a step ahead but also another distraction in a solid but short encounter.""RAW"" Jan. '96Cry Baby Match: Razor Ramon vs. 1-2-3 Kid - This was a first (and only) in WWE history where the loser of the match would actually be forced to be put in a diaper with both men trying to intimidate each other only for Razor to take the fight right to Kid using his size advantage to toss him around & knock him down only for Kid to retaliate using some aerial offense & various kicks along with resorting to dirty tactics that didn't always work in his favor.""In Your House"" Feb. '96No Holds Barred Match: WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel - The buildup to this match was very unusual & different than what we've seen in WWE pre-Attitude Era as far as Diesel having a ""shoot"" persona where he openly acknowledged Vince McMahon as the owner instead of just the color commentator while threatening to come for him after the match based off his frustration of changing him into a ""corporate puppet"" while champion while Shawn was out for revenge for Diesel turning his back on him & attacking him with a chair. HBK took the fight to Diesel right away showing his athleticism with a top rope moonsault to the outside while also showing he can get dirty too using a boot from the spanish announcer before Diesel took advantage of the match stipulation taking out anyone he felt got in his way & using weapons like a belt & chair while delivering to low blow before sending Shawn through the announce table that even Vince at ringside felt was going too far but both men continued to just use whatever they could get their hands on from a fire extinguisher, a chair, and something from wrestling legend Mad Dog Vachon at ringside that you have to see to believe. I said this earlier in that this match was pre-Attitude Era & ECW was still not known to a national audience so it was rare to see this type of match using the weapons & punishment they gave each other during this time so this match was definitely a classic for it's time & still stands the test of time to this day.""In Your House: Good Friends, Better Enemies"" Apr. '96[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; OMG: Top 50 Incidents In WWE History]Shawn Michaels vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - This was a non-title match as Hunter was able to keep staying one step ahead early taking Shawn down to the mat repeatedly only for Shawn to gain some offense along showing off & having fun at Hunter's expense as they traded momentum with both men having counters & reversal to each other's offense along with Hunter using Shawn's momentum against him & keeping him grounded constantly cutting off any attempt at momentum in what was their first televised encounter.""RAW"" May '96Outsiders vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers - It should be noted that Hall & Nash came to ringside with not only their own set of tag team titles but Hollywood Hogan in their corner as both teams were evenly matched trading momentum throughout the match relying double team offense & showcasing power with Outsiders resorting to taking shortcuts while the Steiners took advantage of Hall & Nash showcasing not always being on the same only for issues between other members of the nWo effecting the match but in a way that left more questions than answers as this was a solid encounter but more about the issues going on in the nWo around this time.""WCW Nitro"" Jan. '98Kevin Nash vs. Scott Hall - This was nicknamed ""The Battle Of The Outsiders"" as at this time, the nWo was split into two different factions with Kevin Nash being the leader of the red & black ""Wolfpac"" while Scott Hall was a member of the black & white ""Hollywood"" version after turning on Nash back in May. Also during this time, WCW decided to make a storyline out of Hall's personal demons by having him come to the ring highly drunk & being in no condition to wrestle. This wasn't close to their memorable wrestling match back at SummerSlam '94 as this was more of a personal fight with Hall cheating early by blinding Nash & even having him bleed from his lip before Nash recovered and just tried to ""beat some sense into Hall"" until he had nothing else left to prove.WCW Halloween Havoc '98[Legends Of Wrestling: Heatseekers]X-Pac vs. Triple H - X-Pac was looking for revenge for Triple H & Chyna turning on him at WrestleMania as both men came out fighting trading fist & bouncing each other's heads off objects on the outside of the ring as X-Pac used his speed & various kicks to his advantage while Triple H attempted to ground X-Pac heavily working over the neck using not just wrestling but whatever shortcuts he could as this was an aggressive match that couldn't be contained between just the two participants.Backlash '99Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, X-Pac vs. Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Kane - This was the final attempt by Hogan & Rock to get revenge on the nWo before the brand extension would place them on different shows as Hogan & Rock & Kane were dominating each individual causing the nWo to resort to a numbers games & other tactics to move the momentum in their favor in what was a fun back & forth match.""SmackDown"" Mar. '02World Champion Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Shawn Michaels & Ric Flair were the managers for each individual only for a four way brawl to start in the isleway before the match got started causing them to be sent to the back as Nash was dominate causing Triple H to resort to desperate tactics to just get away from Nash as both men weren't focused on just winning the match causing the referee to be physically involved on more than one occasion until one man just went too far causing his opponent to retaliate with anyone getting in his way, including his own manager, paying the price.Judgment Day '03T.L.C. Match: D-Generation X vs. Unified Tag Team Champions JeriShow - DX was out to gain their first set of tag team championship (although technically the New Age Outlaws were tag team champions as members of DX a decade ago). This started out as you would expect with an all-out brawl on the from the ring to the floor all the way to the arm with dueling chair being used. This match had it's various moments with Big Show actually being the M.V.P. of the match like how Triple H was sprawled across a ladder in the corner only for HBK to the thrown against him & be squished by Show, Big Show punched through a chair into Triple H's face, the power of Show destroying more than one ladder with his bare hands, and the comedic ending with Jericho & Show working together to grab the belts only for that to backfire in a nasty way for Jericho as he took the worst fall than anyone else the entire night. If your expecting the heavy ""spotfest"" that you've gotten from TLC/Ladder matches in the past that you won't get it here but this was still a good contest with plenty of moments to not leave you disappointed.T.L.C.: Tables.

Back in the ring, Triple H worked over Nash's knees by using the ladder on his knees constantly including applying a figure four with Nash's knees trapped in a ladder. Nash was able to come back & use the ladder as a weapon including irish whipping Triple H hard into the ladder in the corner & also executing his ""vintage"" sideslam into the ladder before the fight went to the floor with Nash attempting to powerbomb Triple H through the announce table only for Triple H to counter with a backdrop onto the table. With additional weapons being brought into the match such as the sledgehammer & a table, this wasn't your typical ladder match as it was more like a ""No Disqualification"" fight with them using ladders instead of chairs & other weapons but this was the best route to go since we know both Triple H & Kevin Nash can't give us the type of match that measures up to the standards set for a ladder match at this point in their careers.T.L.C.: Tables, Ladders & Chairs '11(Blu-Ray) Triple H vs. Sting - Both men had unique entrances (which I marked out for being a huge fan of the ""Terminator"" series) while it should be noted that this match could only be won by pinfall or submission. Both men started out having the same idea as far as attempts to take down their opponent before one man was able to get the advantage constantly stopping opponent dead from getting offense before finally being able to take advantage of a mistiming working him over in & outside of the ring before the match evolved into what Michael Cole described as ""The 'Monday Night Wars' have come to WrestleMania"" as you saw guest appearances from the two biggest factions in wrestling during that era along with a battle of ""sledgehammer vs. baseball bat"" in what told a good story as far as being the final battle of WWE vs. WCW and was entertaining for what it was.WrestleMania XXXIOther extras include the amateur video footage of the ""curtain call"" in May of 1996 shown unedited for the first time ever. In the end, I already gave my summary in the beginning but as I said, I recommend this for fans of any individual member of ""The Kliq"" or those of the ""New Generation"" era of WWE which was the most influential period they had in WWE.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HJ1METTNSTRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5IYR86#wasThisHelpful","R1HJ1METTNSTRQ","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Sean Waltman, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall were at one time a very controversial group behind the scenes who were all about one things which was dominating the wrestling business like never before to the point where they didn't just dominate WWE but also WCW at the same time as they weren't just a faction created on television but a group of friends known as ""The Kliq."" You hear the story of their positive & negative influence in the wrestling business throughout the presentation hearing from the members themselves along with other personalities such as Lex Luger, Vince McMahon, Sunny, Vince Russo, Billy Gunn, Bret Hart, Sgt. Slaughter, Shane Douglas, Justin Credible, Godfather, Jim Ross, J.B.L., Rikishi, Undertaker, Eric Bischoff, Ted Dibiase, Diamond Dallas Page, Hulk Hogan, Dean Malenko, Sting, Chris Jericho, Rick Steiner, and Jason Comidies & Mani Mohtrio who taped the infamous ""Curtain Call"" while also looking at the entire group's reunion in WWE after almost 20 years backstage at the Hall Of Fame ceremonies & WrestleMania weekends.Normally I save my summary towards the end but I'll give it now in that this was a different type of presentation than we usually get from WWE in that this wasn't a ""career retrospective"" more than a detailed look at the group itself with the fact that you didn't see a heavily amount of bias towards the group as they kept it honest with members openly admitting they did things on purpose to stur up trouble along & had attitude problems amongst other issues making them difficult to work with while others were brutally honest with their negative opinions towards them. The match selection is a mixed bag as we got rarer matches from television such as RAW during the ""New Generation"" era (which we don't get a lot of) involving the group instead of the usual PPV matches that was been more available on other DVD sets over the years & currently on their network but the negative is that some of those matches are easily forgettable or been reused on DVD sets so many times instead of giving a better alternative that still got the point across (the WrestleMania X ladder match on another DVD set when the SummerSlam rematch is still unused for almost a decade). In the end, the positives outweigh the negatives so this is a set I would recommend for anyone who's a fan of any of these superstars or this era of wrestling.The documentary begins with the story of how the group came together throughout the years along with explanations of where elements such as their name & infamous hand symbol came from before going into how they were behind the scenes as far as the antics they did that rubbed the talent the wrong way along with talk about another backstage clique that was around at the time followed by discussion of their relationship with Vince McMahon & if that was truly ""best for business"" for the company or themselves. One of the biggest discussions took place next in the infamous ""Curtain Call"" at Madison Square Garden as far as how it all came together but didn't go originally as planned along with how it was a huge issue with the ""traditionalist"" in the company before going into members of the Kliq heading to WCW as far as how that effected both products on screen & behind the scenes with such phrases around the WCW talent as ""Well in New York..."" and how they still showcased their friendship to each other across television along with going into the personal issues members of the Kliq were going through at that time causing one member to comment on how he thought at times someone was going to die. The return to WWE of Hall & Nash and eventually Shawn Michaels was discussed next as far as why these reunions didn't last long and how each member evolved over the years to where they became members of the Hall Of Fame & finally had a reunion together after all these years.Matches Include:The Kid vs. Razor Ramon - All I can say is don't take a bathroom break here as you'll miss what is still considered to be one of the biggest upsets in not just RAW but probably WRESTLING history here.""RAW"" May '93[Best Of RAW: 15th Anniversary; RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]1-2-3 Kid vs. Razor Ramon - Razor had a sack of $10,000 he put up in order to get this rematch as the Kid used his superior speed to his advantage with various kids while Razor used his power & size tossing Kid around along with trying to embarrass him when possible while Kid continued to take high risk that didn't always pay off as this ultimately came down to not who was the better wrestler but who was able to outsmart his opponent.""RAW"" June '93Razor Ramon vs. Diesel - Diesel was easily overpowering Razor shoving him around & down to the mat while heavily focusing on a specific part of his body causing Razor to resort to taking Diesel off his feet including coming off the ropes to knock him down in what was a short but solid encounter.""RAW"" Nov. '93[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]1-2-3 Kid vs. Shawn Michaels - 1-2-3 Kid vs. Shawn Michaels - As a result of the interference the previous week, these two faced off against each the week after. The Kid showed superior quickness against Shawn early before Shawn finally caught the Kid with a back suplex from an attempted headlock & even took a page out of Kid's playbook with a flying head scissors on Kid to the outside & later catching the Kid in mid-air with a dropkick. Shawn slowed the pace down & worked over Kid's back with various backbreakers & hard irish whips in the turnbuckles. Both men were so evenly matched that both men were exhausted after a while. Shawn was able to gain the advantage & delivered a Razor's Edge to Kid before making it clear he wanted to punish Kid instead of beating him by doing another Razor's Edge causing Razor Ramon to come out & save the Kid from it being done a third time. This caused the brawl to the back between Shawn & Razor that saw Diesel get involved leading to Shawn giving Razor his own Razor's Edge two times on the floor.""RAW"" Dec. '93[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]Razor Ramon & 1-2-3 Kid vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Quebecers - Kid walked into this match with a previously hurt leg that the Quebecers tried to go for early to no avail before Johnny Polo got involved & took a Razor's Edge on the outside for his troubles. Razor & Kid were in control for most of this match before Diesel made an appearance that had the advantage switch back to the Quebecers who were able to focus on Kid's leg building to the hot tag to Razor before Shawn Michaels once again let his presence felt.""RAW"" Feb. '94[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]Ladder Match: Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Shawn Michaels - This was the first ladder match to be seen on WWE television. Both men started off wrestling early before Diesel got involved & ended up paying for it before Razor removed the outside mat & exposed the concrete that didn't end up working in his favor. The ladder came into play from here as Shawn started to use it as a weapon to attack Razor's ribs starting with a baseball slide into the ladder right into Razor's ribs & later doing a big splash off the top of it while later Razor used it to his advantage by whipping Shawn into it & using it squish Shawn into the ring post. There were times when both men launched an attack while one was on the ladder much as Razor slamming Shawn off of it & him ""making an ass"" of Shawn to prevent him from winning the match. This ladder match was the one that set the standard for what WWE would do this match for years to come as it was definitely a match where both men came out stronger than they went in with Jerry Lawler to the point said about one competitor, ""He Is Superman!""WrestleMania X[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; History Of Intercontinental Championship; Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn; Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden; True Story Of WrestleMania]Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Diesel - This match happened a little while after the classic ladder match between Shawn Michaels & Razor Ramon at WrestleMania as it was time for Shawn's bodyguard, Diesel, to attempt to gain the Intercontinental Championship. Razor came out very aggressive while Diesel used his power & size to his advantage. There were times where Razor was able to counteract Diesel's size like a top rope bulldog but in the end, numbers amongst other things caught up to Razor as Diesel would go on to win his first championship. This was more of a teaser for their upcoming SummerSlam match than anything else but a very good match for the ""Superstars"" show at that time.""Superstars"" Apr. '94[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's; True Giants]WWE Tag Team Champions Shawn Michaels & Diesel vs. Razor Ramon & 1-2-3 Kid - Diesel & Shawn attacked from behind only for Razor & Kid to use their momentum against them to get the advantage including a Razor's Edge in the opening minute before Shawn & Diesel recovered utilizing the strategy of singling out one opponent for an extended period grounding him & using illegal tactics such as double teaming only for it to heavily backfire causing their opponents to use their same strategy against them in what was a highly competitive match.""Action Zone"" Oct. '94Elimination Match - The Bad Guys vs. The Teamsters: Razor Ramon, 1-2-3 Kid, British Bulldog, Headshrinkers vs. Diesel, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart - This was a good opener as it was well paced with various storylines being put over such as Headshrinker Fatu having trouble adjusting to being ""americanized"" by wearing wrestling boots. The major storyline here was Diesel dominating & eliminating every member until Shawn Michaels (who was never tagged in the match) accidentally kicked him in the face (for the third time since SummerSlam) and Diesel going after Shawn with his whole team being counted out in the process. The ending was weak with Razor Ramon winning his match the same way Flair won his 3 years earlier but the bigger story was this was the HBK/Diesel story that would lead to the WM11 main event.Survivor Series '94Razor Ramon vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - Razor was able to get the early advantage only for Hunter to get the advantage using Razor's momentum against him followed by heavily focusing on a specific part of the body with Razor not only having to deal with Hunter staying a step ahead but also another distraction in a solid but short encounter.""RAW"" Jan. '96Cry Baby Match: Razor Ramon vs. 1-2-3 Kid - This was a first (and only) in WWE history where the loser of the match would actually be forced to be put in a diaper with both men trying to intimidate each other only for Razor to take the fight right to Kid using his size advantage to toss him around & knock him down only for Kid to retaliate using some aerial offense & various kicks along with resorting to dirty tactics that didn't always work in his favor.""In Your House"" Feb. '96No Holds Barred Match: WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel - The buildup to this match was very unusual & different than what we've seen in WWE pre-Attitude Era as far as Diesel having a ""shoot"" persona where he openly acknowledged Vince McMahon as the owner instead of just the color commentator while threatening to come for him after the match based off his frustration of changing him into a ""corporate puppet"" while champion while Shawn was out for revenge for Diesel turning his back on him & attacking him with a chair. HBK took the fight to Diesel right away showing his athleticism with a top rope moonsault to the outside while also showing he can get dirty too using a boot from the spanish announcer before Diesel took advantage of the match stipulation taking out anyone he felt got in his way & using weapons like a belt & chair while delivering to low blow before sending Shawn through the announce table that even Vince at ringside felt was going too far but both men continued to just use whatever they could get their hands on from a fire extinguisher, a chair, and something from wrestling legend Mad Dog Vachon at ringside that you have to see to believe.

"Randy Orton vs. Sheamus - Orton returns to his hometown of St. Louis as Sheamus focused on the midsection while Orton worked over the back area with both men using grounded offense along with coming off the ropes & taking the match to the outside using the ringside environment more than once along with trading fist & forearms along with having counters & blocks to each other's signature moves in what Michael Cole called perfectly on commentary, ""a physical match.""Tag Team Champions Prime Time Players vs. New Day - Kofi & Big E. represented New Day as this was pretty much your ""tag team wrestling 101"" encounter with New Day singling out one opponent & using their numbers advantage when possible keeping him in their half of the ring in the corner while Woods on the outside made his presence felt either verbally or physically when possible while the PTP played to their strengths while taking advantage of the mistiming of their opponents in a solid encounter but nothing different than we haven't seen before from these teams.Roman Reigns vs. Bray Wyatt - Reigns started out very strong going right after him including sending him to the barricade on the outside while Wyatt was able to use Reigns momentum against him sending him into the steel steps to get the advantage in his favor while continuing to stay one step ahead of Reigns by using his offense against him along with using his body & weight as a weapon itself only for Roman to come back countering Wyatt with some impactful offense himself in what was a solid encounter.Charlotte vs. Sasha Banks vs. Brie Bella - The ""divas revolution"" that started a week earlier resulted in this match with a candidate from each team meeting here in this match that definitely had some highlights such as a ""like father, like daughter"" moment with Charlotte only to be topped later with a ""like husband, like wife"" series of offense from Brie and the double stomp in the corner by Sasha that had a domino effect on her opponents as the main strategy here was that one diva was the odd woman out attempting to take her out of the contest so the other two can concentrate on each other along with the other divas at ringside getting caught up in the action as well in a good match between all three with the NXT girls only scratching the surface of what they're capable of doing causing Brie to step up her game in her best performance in recent memory.United States Champion John Cena vs. Kevin Owens - This was the rubber match with the difference being that Owens is no longer the NXT Champion while Cena was defending his title with Owens coming out strong with a knockout punch & torture rack neckbreaker while Cena had a unique faceplant slam & top rope legdrop as both men traded momentum countering & blocking the other's offense with one man stealing the other's moveset at one point as they continued to have innovative combinations or counters rarely seen from each other before such as a superplex countered into a mid-air side suplex or powerbomb into a rana in such a hard fought match that you saw both men show signs of frustration thinking ""what else can I do?"" in what was another show stealing performance from both men in these series of match.WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Brock Lesnar - Brock came right after Seth who was doing whatever he could to avoid ""Suplex City"" from going to the outside to grabbing onto whatever he could before he was eventually caught with a series of suplexes while Brock also showcased his athleticism by hurdling over one of the barricades just to get him before Seth was able to break Brock down focusing on a specific part of his body with various strikes while also repeatedly going to the same offense just to keep Lesnar off his game in what was a short match but good for what it was but ultimately was just the background to the faceoff that's been 17 months in the making.The preshow match featured R-Truth vs. King Barrett (again).

Tag Team Champions World's Cutest Tag Team vs. Monster Mafia in a back & forth match that saw everything from the ""Kiss My Ass Club"" to ""LaRae 3:16"" along with an unexpected surprise.  The rest of the tournament saw Monster Mafia against Beaver Boys in a competitive match while Andrew Everett & Trevor Lee fought the Inner City Machine Guns with many references to other P.W.G. alumni along with other ""electrifying"" superstars and with the finals being Beaver Boys vs. Andrew Everett & Trevor Lee that saw one team take extreme shortcuts to get an advantage with the match getting more intense as time went on.  Non-tournament matches include Johnny Gargano vs. T.J. Perkins in a heavily submission based match & P.W.G. Champion Roderick Strong vs. Brian Cage vs. Chris Hero where clearly there was an odd man out who kept trying to be very sneaky but kept getting caught with each man interacting with each other leading to some moves having a domino effect onto two or all three competitors.Usually you can never go wrong with a P.W.G. show but I would say that the quality here was a step down from their previous DDT4 events but it's still an event to check out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQEHBIBWGZRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVIXFTY#wasThisHelpful","R3IQEHBIBWGZRT","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Monday Night War"" was one of the most anticipated shows by audiences for the WWE Network chronicling the competition between World Wrestling Entertainment & World Championship Wrestling during that period of time over a series of 20 episodes with each one focusing on a specific subject or superstar involved throughout that time period.  This volume is the second half of the series (10 episodes) that features various interviews from talent & management who were involved or fans of that period of time time including C.M. Punk, John Cena, Jerry Lawler, The McMahons (Vince, Linda, Stephanie, Shane), Michael Hayes, Hulk Hogan, Michael Cole, Ric Flair, Bret Hart, Lex Luger, Kevin Nash, Daniel Bryan, Booker T, Gene Okerland, Tony Schiavone, ex-Turner Sports President Dr. Harvey Schiller, Dusty Rhodes, Arn Anderson, Diamond Dallas Page, Shawn Michaels, Mick Foley, Sean Waltman, Jim Ross, Roddy Piper, Vince Russo, Triple H, Scott Hall, The Rock, Paul Heyman, Undertaker, Chris Jericho, Steve Austin & others along with archival interview clips from Eric Bischoff & and a 1998 interview with Ted Turner himself that I've never seen before.  While you can get these episodes on the WWE Network, the DVD bonus is that each episode contains a new interview with former WCW President Eric Bischoff after each episode discussing the subject at hand.Episode Eleven: Monday Night Jericho - Chris Jericho is the subject of this episode starting out talking about his early career working all over the world from Mexico to Japan into ECW before coming in WCW as part of the crusierweight division & the issues he had there as a babyface before going into how his heel turn turned his career around but still ran into issues causing him to leave such as what happened when he attempted to work with Goldberg followed by discussing his debut in WWE from how he got the concept of the countdown clock to what issues he had in his first few months causing him to not ""live up to the hype"" only for it to turn around with him opening the doors for others from WCW to jump & be elevated to the main event including him becoming the first Undisputed World Champion in WWE history.Episode Seven: The War Goes Extreme - The subject that has been downplayed & ignored in previous discussions about the Monday Night War (just look at the previous DVD in 2004) is finally discussed here with the influence that Extreme Championship Wrestling had on the war from how it was an alternative to the other companies by not living in the past & various elements they did to make themselves different which got them noticed by both companies to the point where one man made the statement, ""the nWo was ECW in WCW"" while WWE began a relationship with ECW that caused a change in the WWE product as well followed by the discussion of both companies signing away the talent & how they were used/misused including another talent saying he wanted to go through stacked tables just because he saw it done in ECW before talking about how Mike Awesome caused the only time all three promotions directly interacted with each other, what eventually caused the company to go out of business & the aftermath years later.It should be noted that this was originally the seventh episode in the series but was moved over to this set replacing the ""Foundations Of War"" episode which is on the previous volume of this set.Episode Twelve: The War Gets Electrified - ""If you smell..."" what this episode is cooking then you know it's about Dwayne Johnson starting off with how we came at a time where WWE was trying to create their own superstars with details of how WWE heavily hyped the ""Rocky Maivia"" character only for it to fail leading to the steps taken allowing him to show his personality to become The Rock through the Nation Of Domination & The Corporation before going into the significant of his feuds with Mankind & Steve Austin over the WWE Championship followed by talking about his appeal to the audience through his promos & catchphrases such as ""Smack Down"" to his tag team with Mankind & their highest rated segment of ""This Is Your Life"" along with his mainstream crossover ability with movies & television then concluding on his return to WWE after a seven year absence.Episode Thirteen: Divas Gone Wild - One of the most underrated elements of the war is covered here in the evolution of female talents starting from how female wrestlers were just a special attraction novelty act to them eventually being replaced by valets before going into what Alundra Blayze brought to RAW & the impact she had when she jumped to WCW followed by other female talents before going into the elements of how WWE expanded the role of women from Sunny becoming ""the original diva"" & Chyna being the modern day amazon & Sable's vixen personality to WCW's response of the Nitro Girls & how their women were underutilized followed by discussing more of the females from that era who were made stars with one man saying ""you don't remember Ms. Hancock but you remember Stacy Keibler"" along with Trish & Lita main eventing RAW in a Womens Championship match.Episode Fourteen: The War Goes Mainstream - Wrestling was never as big during this era as it was before due to the heavy crossover appeal into mainstream media which is covered here from how both companies used celebrities in their product while also used on other television media in their early days but started having more ""closet fans"" than casual due to the directions of the product before discussing the influx of celebrity athletes becoming wrestlers from olympians Kurt Angle & Mark Henry along with UFC fighter Ken Shamrock to Mike Tyson & NBA superstars Dennis Rodman & Karl Malone getting physically involved along with other celebrities to mixed reactions such as Jay Leno before going into how the pop culture appeal expanded to superstars appearing across different types of different types media including The Rock hosting Saturday Night Live while celebrities themselves started appearing at the shows leading to both companies expansions such as book deals & movies leading to the positive & negative effects of David Arquette's infamous WCW Championship reign concluding on how this effected WWE to this day to the point where RAW has gone over 1,000 episodes.Episode Sixteen: Building An Army - This episode focuses on the rosters & breakout stars from each company starting off with the steps taken to improve the WCW roster in preparation for Nitro while WWE focused on their ""New Generation"" before going into each promotions focusing on creating stars through various groups with the different factions in WWE along with the nWo becoming it's own brand followed by focusing the different cause & effects of decisions made by both companies with WCW creating Thunder & the infamous Halloween Havoc '98 PPV while WWE was creating it's ""Attitude Era"" including launching SmackDown & refocus on their tag team division concluding on the issues in WCW regarding their talent that caused long term effects with how the audience viewed their roster.Episode Seventeen: The Kliq - The most controversial group of friends possibly in the history of the business is profiled here in this episode focuses on Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Sean Waltman as this episode begins talking about how the group came together & the effect they had both in front of the camera & behind the scenes going into the details & aftermath of the infamous ""curtain call"" leading to The Outsiders coming into WCW & the issues caused there as part of the nWo while Shawn & Hunter formed D-Generation X out of frustration crossing various boundaries with discussion about the similarities & differences between both groups & the mentality had by the Kliq as a group being in different promotions followed by discussion of the events leading to the formation of the new DX & evolution of Triple H along with Nash becoming the booker for WCW before concluding on the aftermath of the Kliq after WCW.Episode Eighteen: Mistakes On The Battlefield - Eric Bischoff is the subject of this episode starting off as him coming into WCW as an interviewer including never before seen footage of his WWE tryout interviewing a broom while also discussing the issues Ric Flair was having his issues with WCW causing him to leave & the circumstances causing him to return while Bischoff was taking steps to change the image of WCW setting up including signing Hulk Hogan plus other big names leading to Nitro & the tactics used to gain momentum for the show with mistakes being made in regards to not utilizing the talent including Flair who was constantly sacrificed in favor of the nWo along with where the company's focus was & launch of Thunder only caused more problems leading to the lawsuit with Flair & the unprofessional actions by Bischoff before going into the infamous night of ""The Fingerpoke Of Doom"" & Mick Foley's title win that one person perfectly described being the greatest draw for WWE at that time was angry WCW fans who were driven away concluding on how the tactics used to build WCW kept coming back to haunt him along with other issues that eventually led him to be sent home.Episode Nineteen: The Fall Of WCW - The title itself is self-explanatory about this episode as we start with the introduction of Vince Russo & how we came into the creative side of WWE before going into the circumstances within WCW that led to him coming into the company only to face issues from day one eventually leading to another change in the booking that caused the biggest individual group of talent to jump from one company to the competition eventually leading to the Russo/Bischoff ""reboot"" of WCW but the issues of why it didn't work with not just the audience in front camera but the talent & the individuals themselves behind the scenes such as the infamous Bash At The Beach incident with Hulk Hogan & Vince Russo followed by why Russo's creative ideas just weren't working to the point where they lost $65 million & people to this day think Vince McMahon sent him over to kill off the company with the episode concluding on how the corporate changes within WCW's parent company eventually lead to the end of the company.Episode Twenty: Life After Wartime - This is the final episode in the series beginning with the discussion of how it went from Eric Bischoff attempting to buy WCW to Vince McMahon doing a simulcast the final edition of WCW Monday Nitro including a funny story of one recently fired WWE talent was attempting to get a job with WCW on that same night not knowing WWE had purchased the company & the irony behind the final match on the show before going into how the infamous ""Invasion"" storyline played out both in front of the camera & behind the scenes within WWE & why it just didn't work followed by looking at the arrival of several key talents from the company coming into the company afterwords including Eric Bischoff himself & how he earned respect from the locker room for his role in the company with the episode concluding on the effect the war had on sports entertainment.(Blu-Ray) ECW Champion Mike Awesome vs. Tazz - This is a match that more known for the circumstances surrounding than the actual bell to bell action as this was the only time in history that all three major companies (WWE, WCW, ECW) were involved in the same match as Mike Awesome was the ECW Champion but had signed a contract with WCW but had to lose the championship only for ECW to made a deal to have former ECW Champion & current WWE talent Tazz come in.  The match itself was only around 3 minutes but to see a WCW contracted wrestler face a WWE contracted wrestler for the ECW Championship was history in the making.""ECW On TNN"" Apr. '00Other Blu-Ray extras include Hulk Hogan's WCW contract signing parade, Paul Heyman calling into WWE LiveWire, the post WrestleMania XIV press conference with Steve Austin & Mike Tyson, the Bash At The Beach press conference for Hollywood Hogan & Dennis Rodman vs. Diamond Dallas Page & Karl Malone, and Scott Steiner's infamous ""WCW sucks"" promo on WCW that caused him to get suspended from television.I had this before with the first volume of this set in that it's no secret that WWE has had poor revisionist history when it comes to WCW in the past but WWE did a good job in this series spending time on subjects that haven't been talked in as much depth before & were very fair in their discussion on each subject including criticism of their own product & acknowledging their own mistakes with there being better selections for Blu-Ray extras that didn't come off as nothing special & haven't been released in it's entirety before. I have the some of the same criticisms as the first volume in regards to the presentation (once again ignoring the fact that this is another set in regards to WCW that has no representation of the company on the DVD cover) that WWE attempted to stretch this series out so they included episodes on certain people that came off as a reduced one hour version of previous documentaries.  In the end though, I enjoyed the series on the network & the bonus of Eric Bischoff actually contributing to this set with his views & opinions afterwords is a great bonus so this would be a good one to add to the collection right next to volume one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GBIAQQDYTD0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLB81KG#wasThisHelpful","R2GBIAQQDYTD0F","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

""Break it down"" as this episode discussed WWE's biggest faction during that time in DX starting off with the origins of both Shawn Michaels & Triple H eventually bringing their ""Kliq"" on screen together with Chyna & what their through processes were & what the difference was between their group & the nWo before going into the details of what happened when one member of the group made history on both shows followed by the discussion of things they did that raised the question of it they went too far with their antics & the interaction with Mike Tyson that eventually led to the relaunch of the group with the first high profile jump from WCW to their infamous invasion of Nitro & parody of The Nation to a reflection of the importance of the group.Episode Five; Have A Nice Day -

This was a unique episode as it didn't just focus on one person but two people who have the same thing in common of being two long term stars who remained loyal & stayed with their companies during a period where so many talents were switching promotions for various reasons in WCW's Sting & WWE's Undertaker with elements of both men's characters being discussed from Undertaker being an untraditional character & Sting being a new age superhero to similar career acheivements such as their first World Championships before going into how both men remained ""company men"" with Sting constantly dealing with politics involving the bigger names coming into WCW while Undertaker was heavily depended on working through so many injuries followed by discussing the evolution of both mens characters with Sting becoming ""The Crow"" while Undertaker started showing more human qualities and how each man's continued evolution effected their careers including one that did more harm than good for one of them concluding on how both men remained loyal until the very end to the point where Sting was in the final match on the final WCW Nitro.It should be noted that this was originally the fifteenth episode in the series but was moved over to this set replacing the ""War Goes Extreme"" episode which is on the next volume of this set.Episode Eight: The Austin Era Has Begun -

The story of WCW's biggest breakout star during this period of time was discussed next here in Bill Goldberg from his NFL career to how he got connected to WCW from training at the gym while discussing the various elements that were developed over time to build his character while hiding the negatives that came with his lack of his in-ring experience including what went wrong with a specific match he had against William Regal & the legitimacy of ""the streak"" to the point where WWE had a comedic response to it before going into details behind his World Championship victory from who's idea it was to the reasons behind why it was done the way it was followed by going into details of the decisions made in regards to Goldberg that caused him to lose his value to the company from how the streak ended & the aftermath that eventually drove fans away from WCW to what caused the fans to turn on him & how his own ego got in the way of business.(Blu-Ray) WCW Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Big Bubba Rogers -

Both men made their way to the commentary table with both giving their ""play by play"" before Rock took advantage with the Rock Bottom through a table & using the ringbell as well. Rock continued to use whatever he could get his hands on such as the WWE Title only for Foley to counter & have it come back to bite The Rock as The Corporation would finally get involved resulting in the big brawl with DX with one more observer making his presence felt leading to a moment that was not only big in the career of Mick Foley but also WWE as Monday Night RAW would never get lower ratings than WCW Monday Nitro after this night.""RAW"" Jan.

The only criticism I have is to the presentation itself (ignoring the fact that this is another set in regards to WCW that has no representation of the company on the DVD cover) that WWE attempted to stretch this series out so they included episodes on certain people that came off as a reduced one hour version of previous documentaries & most of the Blu-Ray extras being easy throw away matches that have been released numerous times before or nothing special.  In the end though, I enjoyed the series on the network & the bonus of the face to face conversation on each subject by Sting & Triple H is a welcomed bonus so this would be a good one to add to the collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VNRWE4AYP9GL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7S7ATI#wasThisHelpful","R2VNRWE4AYP9GL","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While you can get these episodes on the WWE Network, the DVD bonus is that each episode contains a face to face interview by Rene Young with Triple H & Sting after each episode discussing the subject at hand.Episode One: The War Begins - This episode gives an introduction to how both companies began their rise to a national expansion throughout the 80's & had a downturn in the early 90's before going into the changes made by WWE due the birth of ""Monday Night RAW"" & in WCW with Eric Bischoff becoming the new head of the company eventually leading to the debut of ""WCW Monday Nitro"" with Lex Luger himself speaking for the first time on a WWE program about the details of how his surprise debut on that episode was arranged followed by the discussion of different strategies taken by WCW to steal the audience away from RAW & how WWE's response to that backfired.Episode Two: Rise Of The nWo -

""Break it down"" as this episode discussed WWE's biggest faction during that time in DX starting off with the origins of both Shawn Michaels & Triple H eventually bringing their ""Kliq"" on screen together with Chyna & what their through processes were & what the difference was between their group & the nWo before going into the details of what happened when one member of the group made history on both shows followed by the discussion of things they did that raised the question of it they went too far with their antics & the interaction with Mike Tyson that eventually led to the relaunch of the group with the first high profile jump from WCW to their infamous invasion of Nitro & parody of The Nation to a reflection of the importance of the group.Episode Five; Have A Nice Day - ""Ms. Foley's baby boy"" is discussed here starting with his early days in WCW & what set him apart from others to what he had to do to reinvent himself in ECW before going into the details of his character Mankind in WWE & how one interview completely changed the direction of his career followed by the discussion of his infamous Hell In A Cell & how the long term effects of that match changed his career leading into a discussion of the infamous night he won the WWE Championship with Tony Schavonie finally giving his side of the story & the famous ""This Is Your Life!"" segment with The Rock to a reflection on his career.Episode Six: Hart Of War -

This was a unique episode as it didn't just focus on one person but two people who have the same thing in common of being two long term stars who remained loyal & stayed with their companies during a period where so many talents were switching promotions for various reasons in WCW's Sting & WWE's Undertaker with elements of both men's characters being discussed from Undertaker being an untraditional character & Sting being a new age superhero to similar career acheivements such as their first World Championships before going into how both men remained ""company men"" with Sting constantly dealing with politics involving the bigger names coming into WCW while Undertaker was heavily depended on working through so many injuries followed by discussing the evolution of both mens characters with Sting becoming ""The Crow"" while Undertaker started showing more human qualities and how each man's continued evolution effected their careers including one that did more harm than good for one of them concluding on how both men remained loyal until the very end to the point where Sting was in the final match on the final WCW Nitro.It should be noted that this was originally the fifteenth episode in the series but was moved over to this set replacing the ""War Goes Extreme"" episode which is on the next volume of this set.Episode Eight: The Austin Era Has Begun -

"It should be noted that Dusty Rhodes passed away earlier in the week so they started out the show with a 10 bell salute along with a highlight video along with references to him from the talent & commentators & the fans throughout the night.Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Dolph Ziggler vs. Neville vs. Roman Reigns vs. Randy Orton vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Sheamus vs. Kane - You knew the direction this was going when everyone went for the ladders early as there were plenty of highlights including one man constantly trying to find a way to sneak past the other participants up the ladder, a powerbomb onto a ladder only for another man to be powerbombed onto that same person on top of the ladder, RKO's ""outta nowhere"" onto anyone in sight, the ""altitude era"" coming into effect, one man doing a ""crash & burn"" more than once, bodies flying over the top rope onto a pile of others, and others who got involved in the match as well in a match that you got what's expected from it in terms of spots involving individuals & groups of competitors.Divas Champion Nikki Bella vs. Paige - Both girls started off evenly matched with each girl coming off very aggressive with their offense on the outside such as a cannonball off the apron to driving their opponent into the barricade & apron while getting real physical in the ring from running knees to the face to a spinebuster while each girl grounded the other using submission holds as they traded momentum throughout the contest with each other with both hitting & kicking out of big moves along with each crashing & burning off the top rope at one point resulting in one of the best matches I've seen from Nikki while this was the best Paige has looked since her feud with A.J. Lee with the only downfall being that you understood the direction they were going with finish but it still came off as was overbooked.Intercontinental Champion Ryback vs. Big Show - The Miz was on commentary for this match as he had issues with both men for weeks as Ryback took the fight right to Big Show taking him off his feet & to the outside in the opening moments more than once while Show used the same strategy of constantly taking Ryback down & to the outside himself as this was one of those matches that was short & solid for what it was but more about furthering a storyline between all three participants.John Cena vs. Kevin Owens - The rematch from two weeks earlier at Elimination Chamber where Owens shocked the world by gaining not only a RARE clean pinfall victory over Cena but in his debut match on the main WWE roster.  The crowd showed that they were clearly in favor of Owens early as both men were evenly matched early with Owens attempting to use Cena's own offense against him while Cena was able to keep countering big offensive moves into his own as they traded momentum with Cena showing signs of frustration that we haven't seen from him previously whenever Owens kept kicking out of pin attempts to where he would question & lose his cool with the referee as we saw both men use moves that we normally don't see from them from a rana to the code red while both men attempted to go aerial off the top rope at one point as this was an incredible match as Owens got a performance out of Cena that we've seen from others such as C.M. Punk & Daniel Bryan where he was taken to the limit.Tag Team Champions New Day vs. Prime Time Players - Big E & Xavier Woods defended the championships due to Kofi's participation earlier in the night as they attempted to divide & conquer singling out one of their opponents in their half of the ring with double teaming & frequent tags including a unique way of doing their ""clap therapy"" while applying holds while the Players took advantage of mistiming by their opponents & used their strengths like Titus' power advantage in what was a quick but solid match.Ladder Match: WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - Both men started out brawling right from the start with the ladder coming into play throughout the match using it in different ways such as executing moves onto it to blocking their opponents offense using it while just using it recklessly in other cases such as such launching it towards their opponent with other weapons used as well such as the steps & chairs to the announce table & barricades around ringside as this fight even went into the crowd at one point as both men used different strategies against the other such as using the weapons to focus on a specific body part to just trying to create enough distance & obstacles away from the ring so they could climb without interruption as this overall was a ladder match that was a very physical fight from start to finish that literally came down to the last second.The pre-show match was R-Truth vs. King Barrett.  This was another solid show from start to finish with some good action & some standout matches (Ladder Matches, Cena vs. Owens, Divas) so in the end, this is worth checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25UVZJAPTG466/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5J5F4U#wasThisHelpful","R25UVZJAPTG466","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"He's one of the rare men in this business who was worked in aspects of the business from an owner to announcer to talent and be successful at each one along with being probably being known more for his talking than wrestling ability but despite other's being known & claiming his title to this day that he's the top name in wrestling when people refer to ""The King"" in Jerry Lawler with his career presentation being showcased here.  You hear from Lawler himself (while showcasing his artwork on the various subjects) throughout the presentation along with other superstars & personalities such as Jimmy Hart, wrestling editor Bill Apter, former Memphis Wrestling personalities Jerry Jarrett & Lance Russell & Jerry Calhoun, Vince McMahon, Harvey Whippleman, Superstar Bill Dundee, Brian Christopher, Gerald Brisco, Jim Ross, Andy Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne Margules & his business partner Bob Zmuda, Michael Cole, Natayla, Bret Hart, Road Dogg, The Miz, his girlfriend Lauryn McBride, and his ex-wife Stacy ""The Kat"" Carter.The documentary begins with Lawler talking about his ""Leave It To Beaver"" childhood such as the story of how he became such a fan of the city of Cleveland & his high school years such as what wresting personality that he actually went to high school with before going into what subject he took such an interest in & how that payed off for him in many different ways.  Jerry's start in the wrestling business was discussed next from how he lied & used his job to get booked to the story behind him actually becoming ""The King"" along with his crossover appeal throughout the territory & how that effected him as a father before talking about how he ended up become an owner of the territory.  One of the biggest discussions on this set is about his famous feud with actor Andy Kaufman such as who was the middle man that got these two together & how this feud made headlines not only the wrestling world but also in entertainment to the point where both men were on the David Letterman show before going into the struggles of the territory throughout the 1980's including a lawsuit he filed against WWE & issues with the AWA despite being the World Champion before discussing how Vince McMahon's steroid trial lead to Lawler coming to the WWE along with what he brought to the table as far as a character & eventually an announcer.  Why he decided to run for Mayor of Memphis, the issues that lead to his departure in 2001, what his original response to the WWE Hall Of Fame, and how his first challenge for the WWE Championship lead to his first WrestleMania match were discussed next before going into the specific details of his infamous heart attack on RAW with footage & audio never before seen with the documentary closing on everyone reflecting on Lawler's legacy.Empty Arena Match vs. Terry Funk - I'm not sure if this was a first of it's kind but definitely a rare match in wrestling today this day as there wasn't no audience or a referee but only Lance Russell & a cameraman to document the fight between these two with Funk having plenty to say for minutes before the match started as this was nothing but a brawl with them fighting on the outside into the empty seats using whatever they could get their hands on as a weapon to the point where one man was bleeding while taking advantage of the environment such as delivering the piledriver on the concrete floor as this was very physical for it's time to the point where this ended with one man was hurt so bad that he was yelling for help.""Memphis Wrestling"" Apr. '81vs. Andy Kaufman - This was the infamous ""match"" where Lawler ended up ""losing the battle but winning the war"" & teaching Kaufman a wrestling lesson that send Andy to the hospital & both men eventually to 'Late Night With David Letterman' as this was more of a segment than a match but definitely one of the most famous ones in wrestling history.""Memphis Wrestling"" Apr. '82Southern Heavyweight Championship/No Disqualification/Loser Leaves Town Match vs. Bill Dundee - Both men knew each other so well that they had stalemates early on before one man was able to get the advantage only to lose it when he his opponent caught on to his strategy as both men would go back & forth trading fist along with using the other's momentum against them along with taking some high risk of their own while brawling on the outside taking advantage of the ringside environment to the point where one man was cut above the eye & the referee had to pull back one man when started getting too aggressive as this ultimately came down to who was able to catch the other.""Memphis Wrestling"" June '83vs. Eddie Gilbert - Gilbert was able to catch Lawler off guard early only for Lawler to deliver a move of his own that had the same effect with the match briefly making it's way to the outside in with both men delivering some impact in what was a quick match but competitive for what it was.""Pro-Wrestling USA"" Oct. '84vs. AWA Champion Curt Hennig - Hennig was attempting to stall & break any momentum Lawler could build for several minutes by constantly going to the ropes & the outside while attempting to trade punches only for Lawler to connecting more of them although one of the Hennig's punches delivered such impact that it sent Lawler out of the ring as the match continued in what was a pretty much a teaser for their later encounters that would be more competitive than this one.""AWA Championship Wrestling"" Mar. '88AWA Championship/Unification Match vs. WCCW Champion Kerry Von Erich - Both men were on the same page early as they executed one big move only to follow it up by showing off to the crowd followed by both men delivering a move that sent their opponent to the outside with one man gaining the upper-hand by eventually following up with various punches only for his opponent to return the punches right back as tempers getting so hot that nobody was going to get in their way of their fighting as a match that never really left first gear & more of a preview for their upcoming match months later at 'Super Clash'.""World Class Championship Wrestling"" Sept. '88vs. Jim Powers - Power came out aggressive attacking Lawler on the floor & even ramming him into the post before taking the action in the ring using power moves & coming off the top rope causing Lawler to keep retreating to the outside where he was constantly taunted by the fans & Randy Savage on commentary before he was able to take advantage of a mistiming using every dirty tactic he could to keep the advantage.""RAW"""" Apr. '93vs. Owen Hart - ""The Rocket"" was out for revenge against Lawler for all of Lawler's comments towards his family & his attack on Bret back at the King Of The Ring that year. This was back when Lawler was his ""comedic heel"" character as Owen Hart dominated this match & had Lawler beat various times until one mistake cost Owen the match.""Wrestling Challenge"" July '93[Legends Of Wrestling: Jerry Lawler & Junkyard Dog]vs. Roddy Piper - This was the definition of a ""train wreck"" to the point where I'm not even going to try to summarize this match because it was just horrible...so horrible to the point where neither guy wanted to talk about it on Roddy Piper's DVD as they had no chemistry with each other & seemed like both had ""two left feet"" in the ring with the constant involvement of the other ""Roddy Piper"" only making matter worse.King Of The Ring '94[Legends Of Wrestling: Jerry Lawler & Junkyard Dog]Casket Match vs. Undertaker - Lawler kept trying to avoid Taker & had to constantly cheat in order to get an advantage which we saw here as he resorted to low blows & punches with objects in his hands but that was only temporary as this for the most part was a dominate victory by Undertaker.Sept. '94[Undertaker: He Buries Them Alive]Kiss My Foot Match vs. Bret Hart - This was the rematch from the previous month's ""In Your House"" with the special stipulation that the loser must kiss the foot of the winner resulting in Lawler making sure his foot had an absolutely horrible smell so Bret would have the worst experience possible if he lost. Bret was real aggressive from the start that came back to bite him giving Lawler control for a few moments before Bret got back control. Hakushi an appearance leading to Bret getting his revenge and for Lawler, that wasn't the only thing that didn't taste good.King Of The Ring '95[Legends Of Wrestling: Jerry Lawler & Junkyard Dog; Best Of King Of The Ring]vs. Al Jackson - Lawler did his own commentary during this match while taking some shots at this opponent & the crowd until Jackson was able to take advantage of an opening Lawler gave causing Jerry to get more serious in a short match that did it's job.""Superstars"" Mar. '96vs. Jake Roberts - Lawler wore a specific football team's jersey & own snake bag full of items for Jake that made everyone want to kill him on top of other comments he had for Mark Henry sitting ringside to the point where Jake pulled out what was in his bag before the match followed by taking out all of his aggression for Lawler's comments about his past on the outside including some questionable tactics to the point where Lawler had to use his trademark dirty & illegal tactics just to survive.SummerSlam '96[Jake The Snake Roberts: Pick Your Poison]w/Rob Van Dam vs. Headbangers - The Headbangers showed in the early moments that they had issues bending the rules in their favor as far as double teaming & antics behind the referee while singling out one member of the team keeping him grounded while Lawler used some dirty tactics of their own along with RVD's athleticism with his educated feet & top rope offense in an average match that's only noteworthy for RVD time in WWE as ""Mr. Monday Night"" associated with Lawler in his feud against ECW.""Shotgun Saturday Night"" June '97vs. Tommy Dreamer - Dreamer had out very aggressive from the start to the point where Lawler was bleeding in the opening seconds as they brawled around ringside & into the crowd using whatever he could get his hands on before Lawler was able to catch a break & returned the punishment using weapons of his along with his continuing to disrespect ECW in the process while continuing to use his dirty tactics to stop Dreamer whenever he was starting to build momentum as various allies & enemies to both men made appearances throughout the match including one that saw Beulah get involved in the match in what was a brawl from start to finish.ECW Hardcore Heaven '97w/Brian Christopher vs. Flash Funk & Scott Taylor - This wasn't much past a quick back & forth match to showcase Lawler & his son together with Brian being the workhorse of the team with Lawler picking his spots as both the legal & illegal man in the ring but only really noteworthy for one of the first interactions on WWE between two future tag team partners in Scotty 2 Hotty & Grandmaster Sexay.""Shotgun Saturday Night"" Oct. '97vs. Tazz - Tazz came out mocking Jim Ross about the incident between them on SmackDown allowing Lawler to blind side him with a punch & work him over before Taz was able to recover with his own series of strikes & punches while constantly having words with J.R. at ringside to the point where one man payed for opening his mouth one too many times.SummerSlam '00vs. Ric Flair - This was Lawler's birthday & given a special ""Legends Match"" against Flair with Lawler playing his own mind games against Flair early through his taunts or physical actions that knocked Flair down as they traded momentum early with Flair's chops & Lawler's punches along with executing their trademark offensive moves before one man delivered a move that ended up hurting himself allowing his opponent to take advantage in a solid match that was more about it's historical factor as this was only the fourth time they faced each other despite their long careers spanning decades.""RAW"" Nov. '04T.L.C. Match vs. WWE Champion The Miz - As a birthday gift for Lawler, he got his first ever WWE Championship match...which also happened to be in his first T.L.C. match as well & it should be noted that C.M. Punk was on commentary during this match. This started off as a wrestling match before Miz started using the chair only for Lawler to return the favor after miscommunication from Alex Riley gave Lawler an advantage. Miz was the first one to taste the ladder before Riley paid for getting involved one too many times but Miz was able to recover & worked over Lawler's back with a suplex onto a chair & several chairshots. Lawler kept fighting back but it was the unexpected involvement of someone nobody expected that helped The Miz retain.""RAW"" Nov. '10[Blu-Ray edition of The Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn]w/Special Guest Referee Steve Austin vs. Michael Cole - Booker T & Jim Ross joined Matthews to do commentary during this match. This match was almost a carbon copy of the Bret Hart vs. Vince McMahon match from last year's Mania where it build for so long that people wanted to see Lawler beat the hell out of Cole & we got good moments with Cole hiding in the ""Cole Mine"", the interaction between Austin & Swagger, and Austin forgetting this is a ""PG"" show with his censored language.  Unfortunately, the match was booked TOO LONG with Michael Cole on the offensive to the point where I didn't care if Lawler beat him up, I just wanted it over. The aftermath of the match actually entertained me more than the match itself.  The tag match from Extreme Rules or the ""Kiss My Foot"" rematch would have been better choices than this which unfortunately was Lawler's Mania debut.WrestleMania XXVII(Blu-Ray) vs. NWA Champion Ric Flair - This was Flair's first time at the Memphis Wrestling television studio which started as a verbal confrontation leading to a 10 min. match between both men with each having the same idea as far as working over a specific area of the body as each man traded momentum working each other over & countering the other's offense or using their opponent's own momentum against them before the way things ended didn't settle for one opponent only for him to make a request that he would later regret in what was a solid encounter.""Memphis Wrestling"" Aug. '82(Blu-Ray) ""Wrestler vs. Boxer & Manager"" Match vs. Andy Kaufman & Jimmy Hart - Lawler was able to take out each man one at a time including using the partners against each other before they resorted to some tactics to finally get the advantage for themselves which only made Lawler ""pull the strap down"" using Kaufman & Hart to use even more tactics in a match that was entertaining for what it was designed to be.""Memphis Wrestling"" Nov. '83Along with matches are bonus segments such as a promo on becoming the AWA Champion, his WWE debut, interrupting Bret Hart's coronation, him confronting Bret Hart's parents during a match, a moment when his arrival to the ring didn't go as planned, the training vignettes for the Kiss My Foot match, his debate with ECW owner Paul Heyman, and his Hall Of Fame induction.  Also included are various editions of the ""King's Court"" featuring Giant Gonzales, musician Tiny Tim, ""Roddy Piper"", and William Shatner.  Blu-Ray extras include a tag match from Ohio Valley Wrestling teaming with Nova vs. The Prototype (John Cena) & Sean O'Haire along with bonus stories along with another ""King's Court"" where he interviews himself & his birthday celebration after ""RAW"" from 2010.I would have to say this presentation was a ""mixed bag"" as I did enjoy Lawler's documentary while some of the segments were entertaining & I enjoyed most of the matches throughout his career but felt that based off the amount of extras dedicated to it that something should have been said about his feud with Bret Hart in the main documentary since I feel that's the feud that made his career in WWE while I would have loved to see more of the vignettes & ""face to face"" confrontations with Bret than some of the easily forgettable matches of his WWE career (Jim Powers) while I understand the purpose of putting some of the matches on her to showcase a period or relationship in his career (his involvement with RVD becoming ""Mr. Monday Night"", teaming with his son Brian, first Mania match) that they were just easily forgettable as well as I would have liked more of his early career (there is more Lawler/AWA footage) or other matches that were quality (such as him winning the #1 contender battle royal in 2001).  In the end, I had more positives than negatives but ultimately I would only recommend for those who are fans of Lawler or the Memphis Wrestling territory but those who aren't I wouldn't get as most of the story & extras probably wouldn't interest or entertain you.As a side note, for those who enjoy this presentation & want to know more about Memphis Wrestling to check out the independent documentary called ""Memphis Heat"" which features comments from Lawler himself along with other famous wrestling personalities featured & talked about on here such as Jimmy Hart & Jerry Jarrett & Jackie Fargo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WROB3WNF8X1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UA1BG66#wasThisHelpful","R1WROB3WNF8X1L","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zack Sabre Jr. was challenged at the previous show by P.W.G. Champion Roderick Strong & accepted it here in a match that featured many sequences of counters & reversals along with each man focusing on a specific body part with Zack using unique submissions while Strong was very impactful but calculated.  P.W.G. Tag Team Champions World's Cutest Tag Team faced off against the Beaver Boys in a non-title match that saw both teams use double teaming as Beavers be very aggressive trying to isolate one teammate from their partner while the champions took their opponents to ""Balls-plex City.""  Other matches include Monster Mafia against off against Matt Sydal & Chris Sabin in a clash of mat-based wrestling against athletic aerial style, Biff Busick vs. Brian Cage in match where both showcased some impactful & intense style, Mike Bailey vs. Trevor Lee saw what was definitely the most painful move I've never seen done on a ring apron, Tommy End facing off against Chris Hero in a match that was MMA/kickboxing oriented with strong strikes from both men while Excalibur went into ""professor"" mode on commentary giving the history of Tommy with the most knowledge on a competitor than I've ever heard before, ACH vs. Tomasso Ciampa in a competitive match that saw cameos from ""Stone Cold"" & ""Mutumbo"", and Andrew Everett vs. Ricochet in a heavy athletic & high flying encounter.This was your typical P.W.G. show where you saw a hybrid of different wrestling styles throughout the night & was a fun enjoyable show I recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XS40B2L3QZ6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTI7DWO#wasThisHelpful","R1XS40B2L3QZ6H","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Roderick Strong had his first P.W.G. Championship defense against a man who had a standout rookie year earning the shot in Trevor Lee in a strong back & forth match that featured several counters & reversals with fighting out in the crowd & wrestling in the ring.  Monster Mafia made their debut against the Young Bucks in a match that both teams using similar strategy from unique double teaming moves to using their opponents against each other while also having the most awkward Eddie Guerrero tribute you've ever seen.  Other matches include Ricochet vs. Matt Sydal in a very athletic match showcasing both mat wrestling & high flying, Drew Gulak vs. Chris Hero in a ""teacher vs. student"" match that was both technical & hard hitting, ACH vs. A.R. Fox in a evenly matched contest, Trent returns to P.W.G. after 8 months with an injury to team with Chuck Taylor as Best Friends against the Beaver Boys making their P.W.G. debut in a competitive contest with entertaining moments, Cedric Alexander vs. Tomasso Ciampa in a competitive match, and Mike Bailey making his debut vs. Biff Busick with Bailey showing offense that hasn't been previously seen before.A lot of the regular P.W.G. roster wasn't available for this show making the room for a lot of debuts making strong first impressions & was a strong show but not the blow away type of show this company has made a reputation on. In the end, you can never go wrong with P.W.G. but this was a step down from their previous outings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R86R2TBYWFRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJ49UY8#wasThisHelpful","R1R86R2TBYWFRS","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"He's the modern day underdog as he seems to be fighting the odds since he made his WWE debut on a new concept show called 'NXT' to his fight against The Authority both in front & behind the scenes to the point where he's gained one of the biggest fan followings in WWE history with the fans showcasing their love for him by chanting one word, ""YES!""...that man is known to the WWE Universe as Daniel Bryan and this is his story.  Now this was another presentation from WWE that originally aired as a special presentation for the WWE Network only for it to now be released onto DVD with additional comments & footage (similar to a ""Director's Cut"" version of a movie) featuring comments from Bryan & Brie himself along with other personalities such as John Cena, Seth Rollins, Cesaro, Shawn Michaels, William Regal, The Miz, Pat Patterson, Michael Cole, Sheamus, and Steve Austin.The theme for this documentary is Daniel Bryan's ""Journey To WrestleMania"" as we get a look at Bryan & his wife Brie Bella during WrestleMania XXX week (WWE Axxess, media appearances, Hall Of Fame, training, before & after WrestleMania) while discussing his feelings on certain elements of life & career such as being an underdog, how he views himself as a superstar & his celebrity status.  The documentary begins talking about Bryan's humble beginnings growing up & what inspired him to become a professional wrestler before attending school at Shawn Michaels' Wrestling Academy leading to his days on the independent scene & the impact he had in Ring Of Honor.  His WWE debut on NXT was discussed next as far as the issues & frustration he had from the first day & the impression given from his first match against Chris Jericho before going into the details & different opinions of the infamous incident that caused him to be fired to his return at SummerSlam.  What made him angry about his first WrestleMania appearance to the story behind his ""YES!"" chant was discussed next before going into heavy details of how what happened at WrestleMania XXVIII eventually turned out to be the best thing that happened to him.  The ""YES! Movement"" was heavily discussed next from how it translated over into pop culture to the point where it started ""taking over"" the shows in support of Bryan followed by how his relationship with Brie Bella & evolved to them attempting to have their wedding the same week as WrestleMania with the documentary concluding looking at his 'Cinderella' story at WrestleMania & reflecting on his life.While the documentary has been previously seen on the WWE Network, there is new interview footage of Bryan discussing various things before each match along with additional comments from various superstars talking about subjects such as Shawn Michaels' heavy influence in his first dark match, who's the most influential person in his career, what the plans were for his original WWE debut, did Michael Cole's heel commentary help or hurt him, the ""right place, right time"" circumstances that lead to his first World Championship, the one criticism on his WrestleMania 28 match that surprised him, what was the most memorable thing about his match against C.M. Punk, his opinion on being a ""B+ player"" & what started that mindset including an interesting comment on how he compared that to his reign in Ring Of Honor, the original plans for WrestleMania XXX, his health, and future goals.Matches Include:American Dragon & Shooter Schultz vs. Brian Kendrick & Lance Cade - It should be noted that Bryan competed under a mask for this match as it was a long competitive tag match that did what it was designed to do in showcasing each talent with Bryan's stiff strikes & submissions, Kendrick's aerial tactics, Cade's size including some moves that not only turned his opponents inside out but also leaving his feet on more than one occassion, and Shooter's strength with some impactful offense.Feb. '00Bryan Danielson vs. Jamie Noble - Both men started out on the mat trading different holds from a working over the upper body while countering their opponents attempt as Bryan continued to work over the body with strong kicks while Noble focused on the neck area as both men traded momentum getting more intense as the match went on leading to a very competitive contest that made a strong first impression for Bryan.""Velocity"" Jan. '03vs. Chris Jericho - This was on the debut episode of NXT when the original concept was to have rookies being taught by the pros & in this case, Miz was Daniel's pro while Jericho's rookie was Wade Barrett. Jericho tried to intimidate Bryan early only for him to respond with a slap before Jericho was able to control over Bryan. Bryan rebounded when Jericho miscalculated a move yet the same would happen to Bryan when we went for a suicide dive only for Jericho to use his momentum against him as both men traded momentum & able to have counters to each others offense. The match was less than 10 minutes but one of those debuts that definitely left an impression on those who didn't know about him before WWE.""NXT"" Feb. '10[Superstar Collection: Daniel Bryan]vs. WWE United States Champion The Miz - As it's become in the past few months whenever The Miz or Bryan is involved in a match, if you get annoyed by Michael Cole then turn the volume on MUTE as he once again goes into heavy ""heel"" mode here while Miz came out with his ex-NXT rookie from season two in Alex Riley. Bryan went for his LaBell lock early before Miz went working over Bryan's arms & shoulders with various armbars & a shoulderbreaker straight out of the pages of ""Arn Anderson"" according to Matt Striker. Bryan was able to regain momentum with a suicide dive onto Miz on the outside before both men had a dueling fist fight against each other. Bryan ended up getting crotched on the top rope before Miz was able to deliver a clothesline off the top rope that landed Bryan on the top of his head. Riley got involved as expected but that didn't stop Bryan as he ended up pulling off a victory that not only had Michael Cole upset but Miz in tears.Night Of Champions '10[Superstar Collection: Daniel Bryan]vs. World Champion Big Show - Big Show finally ended his 9 year streak of not being a world champion (5 years if you count the ECW Championship) defeating Mark Henry in a Chairs Match before Henry attacked him afterwords opening the door for Daniel Bryan to do the one thing that Big Show had been encouraging him to do for weeks & cash in his title shot resulting in the shortest World Title in history.T.L.C. '11[Blu-Ray Edition of Straight To The Top: The Money In The Bank Anthology]World Championship Match vs. Big Show - Mark Henry was on commentary for this match as Bryan kept trying to avoid Show only to get caught then hit with a big strike & tossed around various times before Bryan was able to use his speed advantage to ""hit & move"" using Show's momentum against him along with different kicks to keep Show off of his feet as both men went back & forth with Show not only keeping catching Bryan but delivering offense that had more of an impact with his size advantage to the point where Bryan was showing the effects while Bryan relied on his wrestling ability to apply submission moves from different positions before relying on other tactics to keep his title as this was a solid ""David vs. Goliath"" match but a different twist with ""Goliath"" in Big Show having the fan support behind him.As a side note, it should be noted that Michael Cole was the ""heel"" announcer at the time constantly putting down Bryan & disrespecting him while being obnoxious causing Henry to give the best response to Cole's antics that actually caused him to shut up & get serious.""SmackDown"" Jan. '122 Out Of 3 Falls vs. World Champion Sheamus - Bryan tried to heel the crowd earlier but they were heavily behind him in this town that was a regular stop during his days in Ring Of Honor while Sheamus came out with a shirt reminding them of their last encounter at WrestleMania. Sheamus went for the kick early which Daniel avoid but later catching Bryan in a sharpshooter/boston crab combination submission before catching Bryan coming off the apron & slamming him into the barrier. Bryan was able to mount some offense including a unique pinning combination locking Sheamus' shoulders with his legs & heavily targeting his shoulder with a grounded hammerlock & using the ringpost to his advantage. Bryan from there kept beating on Sheamus with his aggression eventually coming back to haunt him but that didn't stop Bryan from being able to get the YES-lock with Sheamus able later to be get his kick in that turned Bryan inside out. This was the yearly match on this PPV that was the quality of match we SHOULD have gotten WrestleMania (in this case, the previous two Mania's they had a scheduled match) because this was both men's best performance in recent memory & you saw just by how exhausted they were they gave you everything & told a story along the way.Extreme Rules '12[Blu-Ray Edition of Best PPV Matches Of 2012]No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Champion C.M. Punk with A.J. Lee as the special referee - Both men started unloading on each other with punches & kicks early on while trading momentum with moves like Bryan with a running knee off the apron & Punk doing a springboard clothesline off the barricade onto Bryan crouched on the other barricade. Both men them proceeded to take advantage of the No DQ rule with Bryan using the steel steps & a kendo stick to work over Punk's midsection along with later doing a version of the Yes Lock with the stick while Punk later used the stick himself & did an innovative version of a bodyslam using a chair before a table was later brought to use. Both men continued to go back & forth including a sequence of a GTS attempt into a Yes Lock attempt onto another GTS that was turned into a frankensteiner before a superplex that looked like it took as much out of who received it as the one who gave it. A.J. did play some factors here such as introducing the chair into the match & dropping it in the middle of both men but didn't have the story involving her overshadow the quality match expected from Punk & Bryan with both men using the No DQ rule to add to the match.Money In The Bank '12[Best PPV Matches Of 2012]w/Kane vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Kofi Kingston & R-Truth - Before the match started, pay attention of J.B.L. as he had a funny time towards Kane's old adversary in Pete Rose. Both teams traded momentum with Kofi & Truth working together while Kane & Bryan were working their singles offense including the way Bryan was able to get the No Lock on Kofi at one point. It backfired when Kane & Bryan attempted to work together only to result in a shoving match before hugging it out before there was a moment where it looked like Bryan was trying to save Kane only for him to take a shot at Kane himself that had a result that he didn't plan on or expect. The match was average but more about continuing the ""anger management"" storyline between the two.Night Of Champions '12Gauntlet Match vs. Jack Swagger, Antonio Cesaro, Ryback - RAW General Manager Brad Maddox setup this match to see Bryan was worthy of being chosen by John Cena for his championship match at SummerSlam.  Swagger was the first opponent overpowering Bryan & kept beating him down with later Ryback using the same strategy of using his power to pick the bones with power moves like the sidewalk slam & catching Bryan stopping his momentum dead with clotheslines along with delivering a beating on the outside as Bryan attempted to use the strategy of ""hit & move"" so Ryback couldn't catch him.  The real special treat here was the match against Cesaro as he used a mix of power moves such as a deadlift suplex & gutwrench suplex along with scientific wrestling such as constantly reverting back to a unique version of the chinlock to wear him down while Bryan worked over chopping Cesaro down working over the legs along with different strikes & dropkicks in what was the most physical encounter of the three as you saw them just beat each other into exhaustion.  The gauntlet match went over half an hour & was definitely the strong physical wrestling match to showcase Bryan.""RAW"" July '13vs. WWE Champion John Cena - Triple H was the special referee for this match while Cena was coming into the match with an elbow injury which Bryan targeted right away causing Cena to go to the outside to try to regroup & took control with the headlock takedown & a running forearm that knocked Bryan off the apron into the announce table but Bryan came back tossing Cena into the steps only for Cena to retaliate with a suplex off the steps. Bryan took back control in the ring with a running clothesline & kicks to the chest while Cena had his trademark shoulderblocks & side slam only for Bryan to be able to have counters to a five knuckle shuffle & A.A. on more than one occasion & even put Cena in his own STF as both men traded momentum back & forth hitting big moves like the superplex & top rope legdrop & diving headbutt while blocking & countering each other's holds such as the suicide dive & top rope head scissors & trading slaps as both men were just exhausted to the point where they were leaning on each other just to stay up. This was very similar to Cena's series of matches with Punk where Bryan was able to pull it out of Cena & this was definitely a highlight in both men's WWE careers but stay tuned after as what everyone was expecting to happen did (hell, WWE teased it for weeks coming into this match) but nobody expected HOW it happened.SummerSlam '13[Best PPV Matches Of 2013]No Disqualification Match vs. Randy Orton - Bryan came out very aggressive from the start with strong kicks & strikes along with using the ring post to his advantage before Orton also took advantage of the environment around ringside along with implementing a weapon into the match to heavily work over a specific area of his opponent as both men used the same offense against each other from top rope offense to delivering & receiving shots with different weapons both in & outside of the ring as I've always stated that Orton & Bryan have never had a bad match against each other (only bad finishes) and this was no different in what resulted as a very physical encounter.""RAW"" Mar. '14vs. WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Batista - Rev Theory performed ""Voices"" as Orton came to the ring as both Batista & Orton took advantage of the ""No Disqualification"" stipulation on the outside using the barriers & ringside steps as weapons while Bryan was able to work over both men in the ring with each man as the interaction between all three lead to such moments as the third man breaking up pins between the other two or stealing a attempt pin off the other man, one man hitting a big move only for the third man to come with another big move right after, and an unlikely alliance (or reunion) formed when two men decided together to take out the biggest threat in the match including one double team move that ended up hitting the receiver as much as the executor, and more than just other two competitors not wanting to see Daniel Bryan as WWE Champion. This was a great triple threat match that played to everyone's strengths while also giving one hell of a WrestleMania moment to end the show.WrestleMania XXXvs. Roman Reigns - The winner goes to face WWE Champion Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania as both men were evenly matched early applying the same holds while countering & blocking the other's offense with Bryan relying on wrestling & Roman using his power as Reigns got more aggressive on the outside along with a clothesline that turned Bryan inside out & Bryan attempting to take away his size focusing on the legs eventually hitting him in his previously injured hernia area with Reigns showing the effects as they continued to trade momentum with each man catching the other in the middle of an offensive move only to deliver a hard shot of their own on more than one occasion including a sequence of non-stop counters & reversals with both men shocked that the other kicking out of finishing moves in what was a very competitive match for close around 20 minutes with J.B.L. stating it perfectly on commentary, ""Bryan is out-wrestling Reigns & Reigns is out-powering Bryan.""Fastlane '15(Blu-Ray) Bryan Danielson vs. John Cena - Cena was doing his ""thuganomics"" character during this time as both men had the same idea early on working over the same body part before going into a series of counters & reversals with Cena using his power while Bryan relying on his wrestling & strong strikes in a very short but competitive match.""Velocity"" Feb. '03(Blu-Ray) vs. William Regal - They were in Regal's home continent of Europe with Bryan executing some strong strikes & rapid kicks along with some impactful offense & submissions while Regal was able to counter Bryan & delivered offense impactful offense of his own in what was another very short match only relevant for their first time in the ring together in WWE knowing their past history.""NXT"" Apr. '10(Blu-Ray) w/Brie Bella vs. Ted DiBiase & Maryse - This was another very short match that was only relevant for Bryan teaming up during the time period where they had a storyline together that actually brought them together as a couple & future spouses behind the scenes.""RAW"" Dec. '10(Blu-Ray) Steel Cage Match w/Bray Wyatt vs. The Usos - Kane was the gate keeper at ringside while the rest of the Wyatt Family was on the outside as this started out with all four men brawling with the cage being used as a weapon early on with bodies being bounced to slingshot into the cage as everyone continued to deliver offense from all over the ring from fighting at the top of the cage to coming off the top rope multiple times as it ultimately came down to one team being able to use their opponents against each other but the bigger story was the aftermath where one man was left laying in the cage while another celebrated his ""rebellion.""""RAW"" Jan. '14Other DVD extras include Daniel Bryan's big announcement after being out for most of 2014 while highlights of him anger management classes with Kane are included on the Blu-Ray.  Other Blu-Ray extras include bonus stories such as talking about his days in NXT, when he was fired, his proposal to Brie, and his infamous beard.The only real negatives I can state here is that some of the match selection could have been replaced with another of better quality against that opponent (i.e. William Regal) or just left off period because of it's lack of significance (Big Show) while other important matches of his career were left off (winning Money In The Bank) but overall this is a presentation I really enjoyed that I recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FBZ6J58FRE16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UA0TYWK#wasThisHelpful","R2FBZ6J58FRE16","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Lee as the special referee - Both men started unloading on each other with punches & kicks early on while trading momentum with moves like Bryan with a running knee off the apron & Punk doing a springboard clothesline off the barricade onto Bryan crouched on the other barricade. Both men them proceeded to take advantage of the No DQ rule with Bryan using the steel steps & a kendo stick to work over Punk's midsection along with later doing a version of the Yes Lock with the stick while Punk later used the stick himself & did an innovative version of a bodyslam using a chair before a table was later brought to use. Both men continued to go back & forth including a sequence of a GTS attempt into a Yes Lock attempt onto another GTS that was turned into a frankensteiner before a superplex that looked like it took as much out of who received it as the one who gave it. A.J. did play some factors here such as introducing the chair into the match & dropping it in the middle of both men but didn't have the story involving her overshadow the quality match expected from Punk & Bryan with both men using the No DQ rule to add to the match.Money In The Bank '12[Best PPV Matches Of 2012]w/Kane vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Kofi Kingston & R-Truth - Before the match started, pay attention of J.B.L. as he had a funny time towards Kane's old adversary in Pete Rose. Both teams traded momentum with Kofi & Truth working together while Kane & Bryan were working their singles offense including the way Bryan was able to get the No Lock on Kofi at one point. It backfired when Kane & Bryan attempted to work together only to result in a shoving match before hugging it out before there was a moment where it looked like Bryan was trying to save Kane only for him to take a shot at Kane himself that had a result that he didn't plan on or expect. The match was average but more about continuing the ""anger management"" storyline between the two.Night Of Champions '12Gauntlet Match vs. Jack Swagger, Antonio Cesaro, Ryback - RAW General Manager Brad Maddox setup this match to see Bryan was worthy of being chosen by John Cena for his championship match at SummerSlam.  Swagger was the first opponent overpowering Bryan & kept beating him down with later Ryback using the same strategy of using his power to pick the bones with power moves like the sidewalk slam & catching Bryan stopping his momentum dead with clotheslines along with delivering a beating on the outside as Bryan attempted to use the strategy of ""hit & move"" so Ryback couldn't catch him.  The real special treat here was the match against Cesaro as he used a mix of power moves such as a deadlift suplex & gutwrench suplex along with scientific wrestling such as constantly reverting back to a unique version of the chinlock to wear him down while Bryan worked over chopping Cesaro down working over the legs along with different strikes & dropkicks in what was the most physical encounter of the three as you saw them just beat each other into exhaustion.  The gauntlet match went over half an hour & was definitely the strong physical wrestling match to showcase Bryan.""RAW"" July '13vs. WWE Champion John Cena - Triple H was the special referee for this match while Cena was coming into the match with an elbow injury which Bryan targeted right away causing Cena to go to the outside to try to regroup & took control with the headlock takedown & a running forearm that knocked Bryan off the apron into the announce table but Bryan came back tossing Cena into the steps only for Cena to retaliate with a suplex off the steps. Bryan took back control in the ring with a running clothesline & kicks to the chest while Cena had his trademark shoulderblocks & side slam only for Bryan to be able to have counters to a five knuckle shuffle & A.A. on more than one occasion & even put Cena in his own STF as both men traded momentum back & forth hitting big moves like the superplex & top rope legdrop & diving headbutt while blocking & countering each other's holds such as the suicide dive & top rope head scissors & trading slaps as both men were just exhausted to the point where they were leaning on each other just to stay up. This was very similar to Cena's series of matches with Punk where Bryan was able to pull it out of Cena & this was definitely a highlight in both men's WWE careers but stay tuned after as what everyone was expecting to happen did (hell, WWE teased it for weeks coming into this match) but nobody expected HOW it happened.SummerSlam '13[Best PPV Matches Of 2013]No Disqualification Match vs. Randy Orton - Bryan came out very aggressive from the start with strong kicks & strikes along with using the ring post to his advantage before Orton also took advantage of the environment around ringside along with implementing a weapon into the match to heavily work over a specific area of his opponent as both men used the same offense against each other from top rope offense to delivering & receiving shots with different weapons both in & outside of the ring as I've always stated that Orton & Bryan have never had a bad match against each other (only bad finishes) and this was no different in what resulted as a very physical encounter.""RAW"" Mar. '14vs. WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Batista - Rev Theory performed ""Voices"" as Orton came to the ring as both Batista & Orton took advantage of the ""No Disqualification"" stipulation on the outside using the barriers & ringside steps as weapons while Bryan was able to work over both men in the ring with each man as the interaction between all three lead to such moments as the third man breaking up pins between the other two or stealing a attempt pin off the other man, one man hitting a big move only for the third man to come with another big move right after, and an unlikely alliance (or reunion) formed when two men decided together to take out the biggest threat in the match including one double team move that ended up hitting the receiver as much as the executor, and more than just other two competitors not wanting to see Daniel Bryan as WWE Champion. This was a great triple threat match that played to everyone's strengths while also giving one hell of a WrestleMania moment to end the show.WrestleMania XXXvs. Roman Reigns - The winner goes to face WWE Champion Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania as both men were evenly matched early applying the same holds while countering & blocking the other's offense with Bryan relying on wrestling & Roman using his power as Reigns got more aggressive on the outside along with a clothesline that turned Bryan inside out & Bryan attempting to take away his size focusing on the legs eventually hitting him in his previously injured hernia area with Reigns showing the effects as they continued to trade momentum with each man catching the other in the middle of an offensive move only to deliver a hard shot of their own on more than one occasion including a sequence of non-stop counters & reversals with both men shocked that the other kicking out of finishing moves in what was a very competitive match for close around 20 minutes with J.B.L. stating it perfectly on commentary, ""Bryan is out-wrestling Reigns & Reigns is out-powering Bryan.""Fastlane '15(Blu-Ray) Bryan Danielson vs. John Cena - Cena was doing his ""thuganomics"" character during this time as both men had the same idea early on working over the same body part before going into a series of counters & reversals with Cena using his power while Bryan relying on his wrestling & strong strikes in a very short but competitive match.""Velocity"" Feb. '03(Blu-Ray) vs. William Regal - They were in Regal's home continent of Europe with Bryan executing some strong strikes & rapid kicks along with some impactful offense & submissions while Regal was able to counter Bryan & delivered offense impactful offense of his own in what was another very short match only relevant for their first time in the ring together in WWE knowing their past history.""NXT"" Apr. '10(Blu-Ray) w/Brie Bella vs. Ted DiBiase & Maryse - This was another very short match that was only relevant for Bryan teaming up during the time period where they had a storyline together that actually brought them together as a couple & future spouses behind the scenes.""RAW"" Dec. '10(Blu-Ray) Steel Cage Match w/Bray Wyatt vs. The Usos - Kane was the gate keeper at ringside while the rest of the Wyatt Family was on the outside as this started out with all four men brawling with the cage being used as a weapon early on with bodies being bounced to slingshot into the cage as everyone continued to deliver offense from all over the ring from fighting at the top of the cage to coming off the top rope multiple times as it ultimately came down to one team being able to use their opponents against each other but the bigger story was the aftermath where one man was left laying in the cage while another celebrated his ""rebellion.""""RAW"" Jan. '14Other DVD extras include Daniel Bryan's big announcement after being out for most of 2014 while highlights of him anger management classes with Kane are included on the Blu-Ray.  Other Blu-Ray extras include bonus stories such as talking about his days in NXT, when he was fired, his proposal to Brie, and his infamous beard.The only real negatives I can state here is that some of the match selection could have been replaced with another of better quality against that opponent (i.e. William Regal) or just left off period because of it's lack of significance (Big Show) while other important matches of his career were left off (winning Money In The Bank) but overall this is a presentation I really enjoyed that I recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TEV4VD1Q3X43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UA15CCK#wasThisHelpful","R1TEV4VD1Q3X43","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dolph Ziggler vs. Sheamus - Sheamus attempted to again demoralize Dolph only for him to response by going right him aggressively sending him over the top & coming off the apron & top rope onto him which showed it's effects on Sheamus in the early moments causing Sheamus to attempt to take away Dolph's speed in varous ways while Dolph was able to use Sheamus' own momentum against him & hit some impactful moves of his own including was so impactful that everyone saw the result while also delivering something that Sheamus had coming to him in a very good opening match.2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Tag Team Champions New Day vs. Cesaro & Tyson Kidd - Kofi Kingston & Big E represented The New Day as we had a battle of power early on with Big E & Cesaro along with double team combinations before one team was able to single out one of their opponents keeping them in their half of the ring while isolating their other opponent from his corner to make the tag as the intensity was turned up with each fall delivering some impactful offense such as a running uppercut that you thought killed his opponent while having some entertaining moments such as Woods trying to invoke the ""Freebird Rule"" in the middle of the match in another solid match between both teams.Ryback vs. Bray Wyatt - Ryback showed his power advantage early on while Wyatt relied on using his own body as a weapon including one move delivered with such impact that you clearly saw Ryback in pain afterwords & throughout the rest of the match as both men traded momentum with each taking advantage of an opening left by their opponent along with blocking & countering the other's offense in a match that was good for what it was considering how Ryback was fighting through obvious pain.""I Quit"" Match: United States Champion John Cena vs. Rusev - For those trivia fans, this is Cena's fifth ""I Quit"" match with the lesser known fact being that all but one of those matches also took place during the annual PPV that occurs during the month of May.  Rusev was dominate early pounding Cena down & easily breaking any momentum Cena attempted to gain but kept allowing the fans reaction towards Lana distract him allowing Cena to fight back as both men took advantage of the ringside environment along with brawling throughout the crowd to the stage area itself with each man throwing the other into or through whatever possible including taking a piece of the ring apart juts to punish their opponent as the match got so physical that one man would have lost the match under the condition they were in during any other match except this one causing the match to continue resulting in not only a great brawl but their best encounter of their feud.Bella Twins vs. Naomi & Tamina - The Bellas started out working over their opponents both individually & using double teaming causing Naomi & Tamina to use some illegal tactics to regain the advantage singling out one Bella to work over in what was your typical solid tag team match but nothing special.Neville vs. King Barrett - Neville caught Barrett off guard right out the gate with his aerial offense causing Barrett to heavily focus on a part of the body to slow him down with strikes & grounded offense as they traded momentum with Neville being able to counter offense while Barrett kept catching him in a match that wasn't much different than their previous encounters but my least favorite of their series.WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Roman Reigns vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Randy Orton - The special stipulation for this match was that Kane would be fired from The Authority if Seth Rollins didn't retain his championship.  This match started off with a bang as you saw a series of back to back dives outside of the ring in the opening minute as the match was non-stop action with various highlights such as different unlikely alliances being formed between the competitors including a reunion a year in the making, the ringside environment coming into play on different occasions, series of hitting their signature moves & countering others, and the biggest story of the match being what was the most important to Kane in a great & physical main event filled from everyone involved.Preshow matches include R-Truth vs. Stardust and the ""reunion"" of the Mega Powers with Curtis ""#Axelmania"" Axel & Damien ""Macho Mandow"" Sandow vs. The Ascension.  This was a solid show with some good action & some standout matches (""I Quit"" & Fatal Four Way) so in the end, it's worth watching a replay on the network & for a rental/steam at best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHDM4R0CU61JI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJNYJDW#wasThisHelpful","RHDM4R0CU61JI","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Dangerously & Scorpio before the match as the match started off with some impactful offense from Guerrero & Taz showcasing their diverse styles of submissions & impactful offense while Malenko & Scorpio returned the intensity working the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" attempting to make this a glorified handicap match singling out one member of the opposing team for several minutes as this was a good wrestling match that not only including mat wrestling but also took to the air & deliver on intensity but more memorable for the one move performed that would forever change one of the participants.""Hardcore TV"" July '95Olympic Rules Match: Sabu vs. Cactus Jack - Cactus Jack originally had a special referee for this match to take place under amateur wrestling rules only for another man to anoint himself as the special referee under regular ECW rules as Sabu relied on his daredevil offense going aerial throughout different parts of the ring from over the top rope to a springboard position causing Cactus to resort to his hardcore antics as they traded momentum using weapons like a chair & table while sacrificing their own bodies just to hurt their opponent as this was a match that met the standards that both men are known for while telling a good story of Cactus during this stage of his career having the ""hardcore"" driven out of him.""Holiday Hell"" Dec. '95Rey Mysterio & 911 vs. The Eliminators - What originally started out with Joey Styles attempting to do the traditional opening of the show in the ring lead to various confrontations between not just wrestlers but other talents as well from authority figures to referees eventually leading to this match with Mysterio being able to avoid & counter the Eliminators unique athletic offense only to deliver his own lucha libre offense throughout different areas of the ring including using their own momentum against them before circumstances allowed the Eliminators to regain control with this match not only ending in a way you have to see to believe but also the bigger story being who was ultimately laid out in the ring once everything was said & done.""House Party"" Jan. '96Cactus Jack vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - This was ""fan cam"" footage as this match happened during a very interesting time as Cactus made it clear he was heading to the WWE & Bigelow had just came from there while Cactus had Stevie Richards & Blue Meanie in his corner as this was a pretty quick match that was more of a segment as this bigger story here was who made it clear that they wanted a piece of Bigelow.""Just Another Night"" Feb. '96ECW Television Champion Chris Jericho vs. Shane Douglas - Jericho was able to focus & heavily work over a part of the body in the early moments including using Shane's own momentum against him & countering his offense before Douglas was able to finally catch Jericho working on an area of the body using wrestling & taking advantage of the extreme environment as they traded momentum trading blows & countering each other as Douglas brought out a side of Jericho that hadn't really been seen in his ECW run up to this point in a competitive match.July '96ECW Champion Raven vs. Tommy Dreamer - This match took place from ECW's first official tour of Japan as this started out as a brawl that went to the outside & through the crowd with the fans getting involved in the action all within the opening minutes with both men taking some dangerous tumbles throughout the arena along with getting extreme with various weapons inside the ring with Raven using his typical tactics that played to his advantage but also came back to haunt him in what was overall an extreme brawl that saw more than just Dreamer & Raven left bleeding.""Hardcore TV"" Aug. '96ECW Tag Team Champions Eliminators vs. Dudley Boys - The Eliminators used their diverse offense from armdrags & armbars to heavily athletic moveset from different positions such as the springboard & top rope to gain the advantage resulting in the Dudley's turning the match into a brawl fighting out ringside & through the crowd for several minutes with various weapons being used along with some fans getting in on the action to the point where blood was shed as the action settled back in the ring with one team using the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" while the other continued to rely on their double team combinations & diverse offense in a match that wasn't as significant then but was history making looking back at it now.""Hostile City Showdown"" Mar.

'97Sandman vs. Big Stevie Cool vs. Raven - This was setup as the same rules from Barely Legal where the winner would get an immediate ECW Championship match as different stories where being told throughout the match from Raven attempting to get through to Stevie Richards through different methods along with the various associates of the participants making their presence known while Sandman made it clear it was every man for himself in what was a solid match leading to...May '97ECW Champion Terry Funk vs. Big Stevie Cool - ...this match where Funk took advantage of Stevie being in a previous match making the match a brawl with a body going through a table in the first 30 seconds heavily focusing on a body part along with doing such offense that hurt himself in the process while Stevie did whatever it took to fight back from behind including getting some help that caused a conflict with not just himself but another observer in a solid match considering the circumstances.May '97ECW Champion Shane Douglas vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - For those who don't already know, Rick Rude had an association with Shane Douglas to provide him the best competition possible in order for him to establish himself as the greatest ECW Champion only for Rude's handpicked opponent to be Bigelow who was also a fellow member of Douglas' Triple Threat faction as Bigelow was completely dominate using his strength to easily press & toss Douglas anywhere he wanted to along with taking advantage of the fact that he knew Douglas so well to counter his signature offense while Douglas relied on leaving his feet more than we usually see him do along with desperate tactics just to take Bigelow down & keep him off his feet.""Hardcore TV"" Oct. '97Lance Storm vs. Chris Candido - This was an usual situation as both men were ECW Tag Team Champions but couldn't get along after Candido turned on Storm resulting in Storm wrestling more aggressive than we've seen before with offense that not only knocked Candido into the front row but followed that with an aerial move that took out him & a fan as well while Candido attempted to ground Storm & use his own momentum against him with both men executing impactful moves from top rope with this match coming down to who was able to not only catch their opponent but made a statement with it as well.""CyberSlam"" Feb.

'00Kid Kash vs. E.Z. Money - Cyrus was attempting to get out of his scheduled match against Joel Gertner causing Commissioner Spike Dudley to make this match with Gerner getting the match if Kash wins.  Kash started out in control early with fast paced offense & using Money's own momentum against him on more than one occasion while continuing to execute various moves from a springboard position before E.Z. was able to gain momentum using different unique offense not only going aerial but also grounding Kash with submissions as they went back & forth trading chops along with hitting impactful maneuvers from a double springboad frankensteiner to tornado DDT to spinning suplex to piledriver with one being executing a counter from a top rope powerbomb into a mid-air frankensteiner you had to see to believe in a very fast paced & hard impact match.Anarchy Rulz '00Double Jeopardy Match: ECW Champion Jerry Lynn vs. Sandman vs. Justin Credible vs. Steve Corino - The rules to this match were that two separate singles matches were to take place during the same time with all four participants allowed to interact with each other (Sandman vs. Corino & Lynn vs. Credible) with the winners of the two separate matches facing off one on one to determine the champion.  This match set under the environment had it's share of different moments such as who decided to join the match minutes after the bell, one man attacking everyone in sight with whatever weapon he could get his hands on including a ladder & guardrail scaffold across steel chairs leading to all four participants bleeding throughout the match, all four men fighting each other in the ring & around ringside, and who prevented his manager from getting involved only to come back & haunt him later while another participant had no issues sacrificing his manager later on.  This was pretty much a hardcore brawl from start to finish involving not only the legal participants such also those at ringside.November To Remember '00(Blu-Ray) Eliminators vs. Steve Williams & Terry Gordy - This was hyped up as two of the best tag teams in the world finally facing off against each other however this was nothing more than Williams & Gordy heavily working over Kronis for a majority of the match as the crowd was completely dead past the hot tag to Saturn & the biggest elbow drop the ECW Arena has ever seen but it didn't live up to the hype at all past that as it wasn't competitive.""High Incident"" Oct. '96[ECW: Extreme Revolution](Blu-Ray) Masato Tanaka & Jerry Lynn vs. Mike Awesome & Justin Credible - Both individuals on each time were involved in heated feuds throughout the summer resulting in this tag match that saw Awesome & Tanaka going at right right away with hard chops & implementing a chair right away with a running chair from the entrance away but Awesome was able to recover & kept shoving off Lynn's offense using his power launching Lynn into the air allowing the opening for Credible to take advantage while Lynn was down with Awesome & Tanaka eventually getting tagged back in delivering some impactful offense such a shoulderblock, german suplex from the top rope, and an Alabama Slam. Both teams continued to trade momentum such as Lynn with a springboard crossbody onto Credible in the front row while Awesome did a top rope dive onto Tanaka into the front row on the other side of the ring, Awesome delivering a top rope splash onto Tanaka only for Lynn to drop a top rope legdrop onto Credible, a tornado DDT onto chairs, and a release Awesome Bomb over the top rope through a table. A hot tag match from start to finish.""Hardcore TV"" July '98[ECW: Deep Impact]Other Blu-Ray matches include Tommy Dreamer & Cactus Jack & The Pitbulls vs. Raven & Stevie Richards & Dudley Dudley & Big Dick Dudley (WrestlePalooza '95), Rob Van Dam with Brian Pillman in his corner vs. Mikey Whipwreck (""Hardcore TV"" June '96), and ECW Television Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn (Crossing The Line '99).I liked how Volume 3 took a different approach compared to the previous one as we got more profiles on the characters that haven't been talked about in depth before while Richards & Meanie co-hosting lead to more fun & relaxed segments than the previous editions where they were more serious past an occasional punchline with the inclusion of promos & behind the scenes footage was a welcomed bonus while the only negative I could say is that two of the matches came off as fillers because they were more about pushing a storyline than action.  In the end, it's a ECW collection that I can't deny needs to be in your collection if your a fan of the ""original"" extreme.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QXTXCT36FEXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RDTK402#wasThisHelpful","R3QXTXCT36FEXA","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

'95Rey Mysterio & 911 vs. The Eliminators - What originally started out with Joey Styles attempting to do the traditional opening of the show in the ring lead to various confrontations between not just wrestlers but other talents as well from authority figures to referees eventually leading to this match with Mysterio being able to avoid & counter the Eliminators unique athletic offense only to deliver his own lucha libre offense throughout different areas of the ring including using their own momentum against them before circumstances allowed the Eliminators to regain control with this match not only ending in a way you have to see to believe but also the bigger story being who was ultimately laid out in the ring once everything was said & done.""House Party"" Jan. '96Cactus Jack vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - This was ""fan cam"" footage as this match happened during a very interesting time as Cactus made it clear he was heading to the WWE & Bigelow had just came from there while Cactus had Stevie Richards & Blue Meanie in his corner as this was a pretty quick match that was more of a segment as this bigger story here was who made it clear that they wanted a piece of Bigelow.""Just Another Night"" Feb. '96ECW Television Champion Chris Jericho vs. Shane Douglas - Jericho was able to focus & heavily work over a part of the body in the early moments including using Shane's own momentum against him & countering his offense before Douglas was able to finally catch Jericho working on an area of the body using wrestling & taking advantage of the extreme environment as they traded momentum trading blows & countering each other as Douglas brought out a side of Jericho that hadn't really been seen in his ECW run up to this point in a competitive match.July '96ECW Champion Raven vs. Tommy Dreamer - This match took place from ECW's first official tour of Japan as this started out as a brawl that went to the outside & through the crowd with the fans getting involved in the action all within the opening minutes with both men taking some dangerous tumbles throughout the arena along with getting extreme with various weapons inside the ring with Raven using his typical tactics that played to his advantage but also came back to haunt him in what was overall an extreme brawl that saw more than just Dreamer & Raven left bleeding.""Hardcore TV"" Aug.

'97Taz vs. Rob Van Dam - Taz attempted some mind games early before both men relied on their different wrestling styles to gain momentum in their favor from Taz's submission wrestling & suplexes to RVD's educated feet & diverse style as Taz made it clear he was out to send a message to Sabu before their upcoming match at Barely Legal while RVD went aerial & used a weapon to this advantage as this came down to who was able to catch their opponent.""Hostile City Showdown"" Mar. '97Sandman vs. Big Stevie Cool vs. Raven - This was setup as the same rules from Barely Legal where the winner would get an immediate ECW Championship match as different stories where being told throughout the match from Raven attempting to get through to Stevie Richards through different methods along with the various associates of the participants making their presence known while Sandman made it clear it was every man for himself in what was a solid match leading to...May '97ECW Champion Terry Funk vs. Big Stevie Cool - ...this match where Funk took advantage of Stevie being in a previous match making the match a brawl with a body going through a table in the first 30 seconds heavily focusing on a body part along with doing such offense that hurt himself in the process while Stevie did whatever it took to fight back from behind including getting some help that caused a conflict with not just himself but another observer in a solid match considering the circumstances.May '97ECW Champion Shane Douglas vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - For those who don't already know, Rick Rude had an association with Shane Douglas to provide him the best competition possible in order for him to establish himself as the greatest ECW Champion only for Rude's handpicked opponent to be Bigelow who was also a fellow member of Douglas' Triple Threat faction as Bigelow was completely dominate using his strength to easily press & toss Douglas anywhere he wanted to along with taking advantage of the fact that he knew Douglas so well to counter his signature offense while Douglas relied on leaving his feet more than we usually see him do along with desperate tactics just to take Bigelow down & keep him off his feet.""Hardcore TV"" Oct. '97Lance Storm vs. Chris Candido - This was an usual situation as both men were ECW Tag Team Champions but couldn't get along after Candido turned on Storm resulting in Storm wrestling more aggressive than we've seen before with offense that not only knocked Candido into the front row but followed that with an aerial move that took out him & a fan as well while Candido attempted to ground Storm & use his own momentum against him with both men executing impactful moves from top rope with this match coming down to who was able to not only catch their opponent but made a statement with it as well.""CyberSlam"" Feb. '98ECW Champion Taz vs. Yoshihiro Tajiri - Taz executed his amateur wrestling style using submissions & different suplexes while Tajiri relied on his japanese style of various kicks along with high flying from different positions of the ring as each man started to pick up the intensity as the match moved on with each man having a counter to the other's offense as they were so evenly matched that it came down to one man catching the other in a very competitive encounter.""Hostile City Showdown"" June '99Street Fight Match: ECW Tag Team Champions Balls Mahoney & Spike Dudley vs. Dudley Boyz - This was Bubba & D-Von's final night as members of the ECW roster & wanted to go out on top challenging the champions for the titles that saw the match get out of control right away with Balls tossing Spike onto the Dudleys on the outside while weapons like cheese grader & chairs caused blood to flow while the Dudleys attempted to bully the referee to no avail that left an opening for Balls & Spike to hit both the acid drop & nutcracker sweep along with chairshots from Balls only for Bubba & Devon to put both men through a table either on the outside of the ring or filled with thumbtacks in the ring in what overall was an entertaining brawl.""ECW On TNN"" Aug.

'00Kid Kash vs. E.Z. Money - Cyrus was attempting to get out of his scheduled match against Joel Gertner causing Commissioner Spike Dudley to make this match with Gerner getting the match if Kash wins.  Kash started out in control early with fast paced offense & using Money's own momentum against him on more than one occasion while continuing to execute various moves from a springboard position before E.Z. was able to gain momentum using different unique offense not only going aerial but also grounding Kash with submissions as they went back & forth trading chops along with hitting impactful maneuvers from a double springboad frankensteiner to tornado DDT to spinning suplex to piledriver with one being executing a counter from a top rope powerbomb into a mid-air frankensteiner you had to see to believe in a very fast paced & hard impact match.Anarchy Rulz '00Double Jeopardy Match: ECW Champion Jerry Lynn vs. Sandman vs. Justin Credible vs. Steve Corino - The rules to this match were that two separate singles matches were to take place during the same time with all four participants allowed to interact with each other (Sandman vs. Corino & Lynn vs. Credible) with the winners of the two separate matches facing off one on one to determine the champion.  This match set under the environment had it's share of different moments such as who decided to join the match minutes after the bell, one man attacking everyone in sight with whatever weapon he could get his hands on including a ladder & guardrail scaffold across steel chairs leading to all four participants bleeding throughout the match, all four men fighting each other in the ring & around ringside, and who prevented his manager from getting involved only to come back & haunt him later while another participant had no issues sacrificing his manager later on.  This was pretty much a hardcore brawl from start to finish involving not only the legal participants such also those at ringside.November To Remember '00(Blu-Ray) Eliminators vs. Steve Williams & Terry Gordy - This was hyped up as two of the best tag teams in the world finally facing off against each other however this was nothing more than Williams & Gordy heavily working over Kronis for a majority of the match as the crowd was completely dead past the hot tag to Saturn & the biggest elbow drop the ECW Arena has ever seen but it didn't live up to the hype at all past that as it wasn't competitive.""High Incident"" Oct. '96[ECW: Extreme Revolution](Blu-Ray) Masato Tanaka & Jerry Lynn vs. Mike Awesome & Justin Credible - Both individuals on each time were involved in heated feuds throughout the summer resulting in this tag match that saw Awesome & Tanaka going at right right away with hard chops & implementing a chair right away with a running chair from the entrance away but Awesome was able to recover & kept shoving off Lynn's offense using his power launching Lynn into the air allowing the opening for Credible to take advantage while Lynn was down with Awesome & Tanaka eventually getting tagged back in delivering some impactful offense such a shoulderblock, german suplex from the top rope, and an Alabama Slam. Both teams continued to trade momentum such as Lynn with a springboard crossbody onto Credible in the front row while Awesome did a top rope dive onto Tanaka into the front row on the other side of the ring, Awesome delivering a top rope splash onto Tanaka only for Lynn to drop a top rope legdrop onto Credible, a tornado DDT onto chairs, and a release Awesome Bomb over the top rope through a table. A hot tag match from start to finish.""Hardcore TV"" July '98[ECW: Deep Impact]Other Blu-Ray matches include Tommy Dreamer & Cactus Jack & The Pitbulls vs. Raven & Stevie Richards & Dudley Dudley & Big Dick Dudley (WrestlePalooza '95), Rob Van Dam with Brian Pillman in his corner vs. Mikey Whipwreck (""Hardcore TV"" June '96), and ECW Television Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn (Crossing The Line '99).I liked how Volume 3 took a different approach compared to the previous one as we got more profiles on the characters that haven't been talked about in depth before while Richards & Meanie co-hosting lead to more fun & relaxed segments than the previous editions where they were more serious past an occasional punchline with the inclusion of promos & behind the scenes footage was a welcomed bonus while the only negative I could say is that two of the matches came off as fillers because they were more about pushing a storyline than action.  In the end, it's a ECW collection that I can't deny needs to be in your collection if your a fan of the ""original"" extreme.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RABE877VPYOYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RDTNK2Q#wasThisHelpful","RABE877VPYOYI","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Street Fight Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Luke Harper - This started before the opening bell as a brawl in the isleway with weapons used right away to just beat on their opponent or make moves more impactful such as a suplex onto an open chair as Ambrose relied on his unique style such as an elbow drop to a vertical Harper as they just continued to brawl all the way to the backstage area with something happening that had everyone asking questions for over half an hour resulting in a fun match that definitely lived up to both men's reputations as this was the type of ""fight"" that wasn't been seen since the Hollywood Backlot Brawl in almost 20 years.Kiss My Arse Match: Dolph Ziggler vs. Sheamus - The loser of this match would have to kiss the ""arse"" of the winner as both men started trading fist to the outside with both men hitting some big moves only for Sheamus to get the advantage keeping Dolph grounded with mat wrestling & attempting submissions while fighting off any offense while Dolph played defense being able to have quick counters & reversals as this was a good match that played up to the story of their feud with Dolph being the ""underdog"" that Sheamus was out to destroy.Tag Team Champions Tyson Kidd & Cesaro vs. New Day - Kofi Kingston & Big E represented The New Day in this match with the champions taking control playing to their strengths with Kidd using his superior quickness & wrestling ability & Cesaro showcasing his strength including how was caught Big E in mid-air without buckling or having to balance himself while using their opponent's own momentum against them causing New Day to attempt to single out one member & work him over in their half of the ring as both teams traded momentum through double team combinations & some impactful offense from a spear through the ropes to the deadlift superplex with even Woods & Natayla at ringside making their presence felt in what was a great match.Russian Chain Match: United States Champion John Cena vs. Rusev - This was held under the traditional rules of the first man to touch all four corners without their momentum being broken wins the match.  Both men showcased their strength in the early moments using the chain in a tug of war before both men would go on to use the chain in unique ways such as to isolate in order to deliver offensive moves or to pull their opposition into a certain direction like the ring post or off the top rope as each man had used different ways using making themselves dead weight to stop the other's momentum by either using the ropes to their advantage of going to the outside to add extra pressure as they traded momentum back & forth executing their trademark offense while also having counters to their opponent's as this was a match that's told a nice story using the stipulation & chain in other ways than just beating their opponent with it as this was one of the best matches I've seen with this type of stipulation but it was a step down from their previous encounters as the bigger story here was who was drawing the most attention from the crowd & how someone reacted to it.Divas Champion Nikki Bella vs. Naomi - Naomi had a completely different look (complete with boots that you had to see to believe) & attitude including new theme music as Nikki attempted to work over a specific part of the body before Naomi focused on the head & neck area with different types of facelocks along with some unique offense such as a bulldog directly into a turnbuckle as they went back & forth with both girls delivering some big moves in what was a solid match but missing something to make it truly click along with the fact that technically both girls were still heels so the crowd didn't have someone to cheer for didn't help matters.Last Man Standing Match: Roman Reigns vs. Big Show - Reigns was able to get the advantage early knocking Show over the top & pushing him into the ring post before Show showcased his own strength tossing Roman around ringside while physically showcasing that he didn't want or need to use a weapon while Reigns used various weapons such as a table & chair to inflict punishment on Show as they traded momentum with Show using his size to his advantage with the weapons sometimes working in his favor while Reigns continued to take advantage of any opening he had in & outside of the ring destroying whatever got in his way while continuing to throw whatever he had at the giant resulting in a good match showing that Reigns definitely had to ""work"" to earn that win with the only downfall being the ending which we've seen more than once in this same type of matches in the past few years.Steel Cage Match: WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Randy Orton - The RKO was banned for this match while Kane was in charge of the cage door for this match as Seth kept trying to escape early showing some Spiderman ability while Orton showcased he was more focused on punishment than victory including later delivering a move that was a direct message to The Authority as both men hit some big offense such as a running release powerbomb into the corner & flying knee of the top rope to a mid-air powerslam & superplex off the top of the cage while each man sent their opponent into the cage only for be thrown across it themselves multiple times before Kane was provoked to get make his presence known from ringside by more than just the participants in the ring as the winner ultimately came down to who was able to catch their opponent with something they never expected in a main event that delivered solid action but also continued the storylines involving all of the participants in the match.(Preshow) Neville vs. Bad News Barrett - Daniel Bryan wasn't cleared to defend his Intercontinental Championship resulting in this match with Neville showcasing his superior speed constantly staying a step ahead of Barrett with armdrags & close pinfall attempts before Barrett was able to take advantage of his surroundings to get the advantage by grounding him & heavily focusing on a part of the body as they traded momentum hitting their signature moves with the winner being the one man being able to avoid one big move to hit their own in a good opening match.Extreme Rules is usually one of my favorite PPV's of the year & this was no different as there wasn't a bad match on here with the action ranging from solid to very good so it's worth a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22FWGQ3JMXF3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UA15CFC#wasThisHelpful","R22FWGQ3JMXF3I","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazing how things can go from a triumph to a tragedy in less than a week as after 18 years of bad feelings on both sides that they finally made peace with each other to give him the opportunity to not only have his career reflected on in a positive life but also celebrated throughout the biggest weekend of the year only for it to end with his unfortunate passing leading to this presentation looking back at not only his career & the road to making peace within the industry but his life outside of wrestling with his family in ""Ultimate Warrior: Always Believe.""  Now this presentation is very similar to the previous release from The Shield & the upcoming Daniel Bryan documentaries were this was originally aired on their network only to be released onto home video with deleted scenes however this presentation also included close to 30 minutes of additional footage that was shot after the original airing featuring comments from Warrior himself along with his family (wife Dana & daughters Indiana & Mattigan), Triple H, John Cena, Cesaro, The McMahons (Vince, Linda, Stephanie), Sting, Jerry Lawler, Zeb Colter, Jim Ross, WCCW wrestler Bill Irwin, Hulk Hogan, Kofi Kingston, Batista, Dolph Ziggler, Dean Ambrose, Sheamus, and Sgt. Slaughter.  The theme of this presentation was following Warrior through the steps of his return to WWE from returning to ""Titan Towers"" for the first time to being backstage for WrestleMania weekend in New Orleans (Hall Of Fame, WrestleMania 30, RAW) having his thoughts on the whole experience along with his wife & daughter's experience returning to New Orleans after their loss in between the documentary itself.Normally I give my summary at the end of the review but I'll just give it now in that the positives for this set are what I stated earlier in how WWE heavily expanded this past what we already saw on the WWE Network presentation covering not just Warrior but his family as well plus I know some people would criticize how they didn't spend more time on his in-ring career & accomplishments but we've already heard those stories on the previous DVD sets so this was more personal covering his comeback & family life which I enjoyed very much.  The only negatives I can say is that there were still some Warrior matches that were better quality still unreleased onto DVD or missing from his previous sets only for us to still get some of these unimportant & uninteresting fillers but at least we still got some cool rare gems including rare tag matches.  Overall I have to say that I enjoyed the set that I would recommend.The documentary begins with strong words from his wife Dana going into Warrior's story of what he was originally studying in college & his career in bodybuilding followed by how he met Sting & their beginnings as a team along with the influence of the man we now know as Zeb Colter lead to their run as the Blade Runners before going into why he went on as a solo act into World Class Championship Wrestling with the funny story behind where the name ""Dingo Warrior"" came from.  His career in WWE was talked about next from the different unique elements of his character to memorable moments of his career such as SummerSlam '89 to how things came together for the ""Ultimate Challenge"" of WrestleMania VI to the Retirement Match at WrestleMania VII as far as why Savage was his best opponent & the importance of how he ""pinned"" Savage at the end of that match before going into how things started to go bad from there with what happened at the end of SummerSlam '91 and why the plans for him after return at WrestleMania VIII didn't happen followed by the importance of his life as a family man was discussed next as far as how he met Dana & the funny line he used when he first met her & the important relationship with his daughters including the things he would do every birthday to show his love before going into what went wrong during his short time in WCW.  One of the biggest discussions on his presentation was reflecting on ""The Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior"" DVD from Warrior's feelings on it along with Dana describing just how much it effected him to the lawsuit & Warrior's reaction to seeing Vince at the trial before briefly discussing the loyalty & getting his message to his fans throughout the years.  Another big part of the documentary came here discussing Warrior eventual return to WWE from who was the middle man between the negotiations & how instrumental Triple H was during the process leading up to the Hall Of Fame & the importance of not only why he chose his ""Mom"" as his inductor but the special gift he gave Vince & importance of his speech before showing his backstage meeting at WrestleMania with Hulk Hogan along with his appearance of RAW & what relevance of a specific picture taken.  The documentary concluded with Dana telling the story of his death & the support shown to the family including one specific diva's importance to Warrior's daughters along with returning to the arena in New Orleans before concluding with Dana & her daughters having their final words to Warrior.Matches Include:Dingo Warrior vs. Perry Jackson & Chico Cabello - It should be noted that not only was Gary Hart managing Warrior during this time but the match was held under elimination rules meaning that Warrior had to defeat both men as he utilized the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" as he was able to take one man out of competition in order to focus beating on the other on more than one occasion utilizing his power in a quick dominate showcase.""World Class Championship Wrestling"" July '86Dingo Warrior vs. Big Bear Collie - This was another quick match with Warrior using his power offense along with some mat wrestling such as a grounded armbar & athletic ability such as a dropkick & running crossbody with this being significant for him actually delivering this offense against a man of similar size with Big Bear weighing close to 300 lbs.""World Class Championship Wrestling"" June '87vs. Frenchy Martin - This was Warrior's Madison Square Garden debut as Martin's offense had to effect with Warrior just easily overpowering Martin shoving him to the outside & powering him down throughout the match.""Madison Square Garden"" Nov. '87vs. Brian Costello - This was your basic quick Warrior squash in that I think it's only relevant for it being his national television debut.""Wrestling Challenge"" Nov. '87vs. Mike Sharpe - ""Canada's greatest athlete"" kept stalling & avoiding him as Warrior was able to use his power causing Sharpe to resort to desperate tactics such as raking the eyes & choking Warrior using the ropes while keeping a slow pace & even used Warrior's own momentum against him at one point as Warrior continued to rely on his fast paced high impact power offense with Sharpe giving Warrior the most resistance he's had to to his early point in his career.Dec. '87vs. Conquistador #1 - This was your trademark Warrior squash match where he easily dominated with his power including punching him so hard that it knocked him over the top to the floor at one point.""Wrestling Challenge"" May '88Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Honky Tonk Man - Warrior came straight to the ring right after Honky at the start not only working him over around the ring but also getting his shot in on Jimmy Hart on the outside before Hart's assistance on more than one occasion was able to give Honky the advantage he needed before their intentions became clear it was more important to not just win but hurt Warrior as well.Oct. '88vs. Intercontinental Champion Rick Rude - Warrior came out very aggressive taking Rude over the top rope & bouncing his head on each side of the ring apron in the opening seconds while heavily working over the lower back with hard whips in the corner & a bear hug before Rude was able to take advantage of an opening working over Warrior's midsection & lower back area using all his weight & submissions like the reverse chinlock along with other moves like a piledriver that hurt his own back as they traded momentum until things got so out of control that it couldn't be contained in the ring with not just Warrior & Rude getting a piece of the action.May '89w/Jim Duggan vs. Rick Rude & Andre The Giant - Warrior & Duggan showed their team unity in their own special ways before the match & what they did to Rude to take advantage of a mistiming between him & Andre before illegal tactics allowed the Heenan Family to single out one man with Andre utilizing his size advantage along with Rude's technical skills along with various illegal tactics & double teaming causing their opponents to fight ""fire with fire"" in a fun tag match.June '89vs. John Weiss - Another quick match where Warrior was so dominate that he didn't even bother removing his Intercontinental Championship.""Wrestling Challenge"" Sept. '89Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Andre The Giant - Andre caught Warrior early then worked him over in the corner by either pounding or choking him repeatedly only for Warrior to eventually attempt to return the choking with his own hands & using clotheslines to knock Andre off his feet only for Andre to keep stopping Warrior's momentum dead with bear hugs & nerve holds in what was a very slow paced match.Oct. '89vs. Brooklyn Brawler - Another dominate match by Warrior that I can only describe in two words, ""don't blink.""""Wrestling Challenge"" Mar. '90WWE Championship Match vs. Haku - This was Warrior's first televised title defense as Haku attempted to attack once Warrior got in the ring to no avail as Warrior took control repeatedly knocking Haku off his feet & to the outside multiple times before Haku was able to catch Warrior coming in working him over repeatedly giving offense that took Warrior off his feet in what was a short match but solid match.""Saturday Nights Main Event"" Apr. '90vs. Sgt. Slaughter - This was a rematch from the Royal Rumble earlier in the year as Warrior was dominate early slamming Slaughter off the top rope then constantly knocking him down & to the outside causing Slaughter to resort to dirty tactics along with Gen. Adnan & Col. Mustafa on the outside to regain the advantage & heavily focus on working over Warrior's back as the biggest story behind this match was not only who else decided to come to ringside but what they brought with them that was a big distraction to Warrior.""Saturday Nights Main Event"" Apr. '91[Bonus Disc of Self Destruction Of The Ultimate Warrior]vs. Rick Martel - Warrior started out very dominate using his power to keep knocking Martel down & to the outside to the point where Martel had to use Warrior's own momentum against him to gain an advantage focusing on the back with offense like the backbreaker & his trademark Boston Crab along with other tactics on the outside in a short match but Martel telling a good story in that limited time.""Wrestling Challenge"" Apr. '91vs. Smash - Warrior came out very aggressive taking Smash down repeatably in different ways before Smash was able to catch a break taking Warrior down & keeping him down with strikes while working on the throat & chest area along with Mr. Fuji on the outside making his presence known as well.""Superstars"" May '91vs. Skinner - Skinner attempted to get the early advantage spitting his tobacco into Warrior's eyes right away only for Warrior to shrug it off & get very aggressive both in & outside of the ring in a very quick dominate match to the point where he literally beat the tobacco out of Skinner.""Superstars"" May '92vs. Papa Shango - Warrior came out more aggressively than he usually is in this match taking Shango out the ring right away & bouncing his head off the steps along with relying with his usual power offense while Shango being able to get momentum taking advantage of an opening attempting to work him over & slow him down with moves like a nerve hold.May '92w/Randy Savage vs. Nasty Boys - Savage & Warrior were scheduled to be opponents for the upcoming WWF Championship Match at SummerSlam but there were rumors of Mr. Perfect being in one of their corners for that match resulting in neither man being able to trust each other to the point where the referee had to make the decision of who started the match as both Savage & Warrior were able to dominate one or both opponents individually but kept having verbal arguments against each other which the Nastys were able to eventually take advantage of singling out one man to work over including using illegal tactics before things broke down into more chaos causing more confusion of who's side Mr. Perfect was really on.""SummerSlam Spectacular"" Aug. '92vs. Isaac Yankem D.D.S. - This was the in-ring ""RAW"" debut of Warrior with Jerry Lawler not only in Yankem's corner but still had his headset on to do commentary as well in what was a quick dominate performance by Warrior.""RAW"" Apr. '96vs. Owen Hart - Warrior was able to take advantage of Owen using his own momentum against him in the early moments while using his trademark offense of clotheslines & shoulderblocks & slams along with using his own power to reverse Owen's attempt at offense before Owen was able to take advantage of an opening working on grounding Warrior by any method including some illegal tactics including Jim Cornette being involved on the outside in a solid match but more significant for being Warrior's last televised match in his WWE career.""RAW"" July '96(Blu-Ray) vs. Rick Rude - It should be noted that Gary Hart was the manager of Warrior while Percy Pringle III was the manager of Rude as not only Rude & Warrior had a staredown before the match but the managers did too as the wrestlers kept playing a game of ""can you top this"" with them delivering the same offense to different effects along with having an arm wrestling challenge in the middle of the match as they traded momentum with one man being dominate with power & the other using any tactic he could as this match ended when tensions boiled over that just couldn't be contained anymore.""WCCW"" Aug. '86(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship Match vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - This was (at the time) the most unique World Title match in history as the two most popular wrestlers in the company fought each other in the main event with both the Intercontinental & World Title on the line. Both men were pretty even early on as both had an advantage with the test of strength before going into a game of one upping the each as Warrior no sold Hogan's slam only for Hogan to take Warrior's & show the effects of it before hurting his knee going to the outside with Warrior capitalizing on it causing Hogan to resort to going to the eyes & Warrior getting dirty himself taking a shot at Hogan when the referee was trying to separate them. Hogan continued to wrestle outside of his trademark offense go surprise the Warrior like going for an inside cradle & grounding Warrior with a reverse chinlock while Warrior used his power with holds like a bearhug with both men coming so close to a win to the point where each man had the other one beat at one point with the referee not being available to count the fall. This was one of the best Ultimate Warrior matches in his lifetime as they just told a great story resulting in a classic.It should be noted that the version of this match presented has no commentary & is completely shown through the ""hard camera"" angle only so it's a different presentation than previously seen (similar to Hogan/Andre from WrestleMania III on the ""History Of WWE"" DVD set).Wrestlemania VI[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; History Of The WWE Championship; Ultimate Warrior: The Ultimate Collection](Blu-Ray) w/Legion Of Doom vs. Demolition - Warrior & L.O.D. were dominate early working over each member of Demolition individually easily overpowering them before Demolition was able to take advantage of a mistimed move cutting the ring off singling out one opponent keeping him in their corner for double & triple teaming on the inside & outside of the ring in what was a back & forth contest between both teams.""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Oct. '90(Blu-Ray) vs. Earthquake - Earthquake tried to get the jump on Warrior behind while it took Warrior more power than usual to take him down as they traded momentum with Earthquake was taking advantage of a distraction to heavily slow down the pace working over a section of Warrior's body using his natural power while also repeatably dropping his weight onto it while Warrior relied on his trademark offense but had to do more than usual for it to have an effect due to Earthquake's massive size.Feb. '91(Blu-Ray) w/Undertaker vs. Papa Shango & Berzerker - Warrior & Undertaker had a standoff with each other based off their past issues a year earlier before both men focused on their opponents with both teams using the same strategy of singling out one opponent with Warrior & Taker working him over both in & outside of the ring at a fast pace while Shango & Berzerker attempted to slow the pace down & trying to keep their opponent grounded along with resorting to dirty tactics such as illegal participants getting involved in the match in what was a basic tag match.June '92DVD extras include over 2 hours of interviews & promos along with his Hall Of Fame induction & final appearance on RAW after WrestleMania 30.  Blu-Ray Extras include bonus stories & footage such as the ""match"" between Natayla & Warrior's daughter Matt, his family being presented the Slammy Award, and the Warrior tribute on the TV show ""The Goldbergs"", and Batista's tribute to Warrior.I already gave my positives & negatives earlier & once again I recommend this for fans of Warrior.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24JFE698V5K6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RDTK43E#wasThisHelpful","R24JFE698V5K6K","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazing how things can go from a triumph to a tragedy in less than a week as after 18 years of bad feelings on both sides that they finally made peace with each other to give him the opportunity to not only have his career reflected on in a positive life but also celebrated throughout the biggest weekend of the year only for it to end with his unfortunate passing leading to this presentation looking back at not only his career & the road to making peace within the industry but his life outside of wrestling with his family in ""Ultimate Warrior: Always Believe."" Now this presentation is very similar to the previous release from The Shield & the upcoming Daniel Bryan documentaries were this was originally aired on their network only to be released onto home video with deleted scenes however this presentation also included close to 30 minutes of additional footage that was shot after the original airing featuring comments from Warrior himself along with his family (wife Dana & daughters Indiana & Mattigan), Triple H, John Cena, Cesaro, The McMahons (Vince, Linda, Stephanie), Sting, Jerry Lawler, Zeb Colter, Jim Ross, WCCW wrestler Bill Irwin, Hulk Hogan, Kofi Kingston, Batista, Dolph Ziggler, Dean Ambrose, Sheamus, and Sgt. Slaughter. The theme of this presentation was following Warrior through the steps of his return to WWE from returning to ""Titan Towers"" for the first time to being backstage for WrestleMania weekend in New Orleans (Hall Of Fame, WrestleMania 30, RAW) having his thoughts on the whole experience along with his wife & daughter's experience returning to New Orleans after their loss in between the documentary itself.Normally I give my summary at the end of the review but I'll just give it now in that the positives for this set are what I stated earlier in how WWE heavily expanded this past what we already saw on the WWE Network presentation covering not just Warrior but his family as well plus I know some people would criticize how they didn't spend more time on his in-ring career & accomplishments but we've already heard those stories on the previous DVD sets so this was more personal covering his comeback & family life which I enjoyed very much. The only negatives I can say is that there were still some Warrior matches that were better quality still unreleased onto DVD or missing from his previous sets only for us to still get some of these unimportant & uninteresting fillers but at least we still got some cool rare gems including rare tag matches. Overall I have to say that I enjoyed the set that I would recommend.The documentary begins with strong words from his wife Dana going into Warrior's story of what he was originally studying in college & his career in bodybuilding followed by how he met Sting & their beginnings as a team along with the influence of the man we now know as Zeb Colter lead to their run as the Blade Runners before going into why he went on as a solo act into World Class Championship Wrestling with the funny story behind where the name ""Dingo Warrior"" came from. His career in WWE was talked about next from the different unique elements of his character to memorable moments of his career such as SummerSlam '89 to how things came together for the ""Ultimate Challenge"" of WrestleMania VI to the Retirement Match at WrestleMania VII as far as why Savage was his best opponent & the importance of how he ""pinned"" Savage at the end of that match before going into how things started to go bad from there with what happened at the end of SummerSlam '91 and why the plans for him after return at WrestleMania VIII didn't happen followed by the importance of his life as a family man was discussed next as far as how he met Dana & the funny line he used when he first met her & the important relationship with his daughters including the things he would do every birthday to show his love before going into what went wrong during his short time in WCW. One of the biggest discussions on his presentation was reflecting on ""The Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior"" DVD from Warrior's feelings on it along with Dana describing just how much it effected him to the lawsuit & Warrior's reaction to seeing Vince at the trial before briefly discussing the loyalty & getting his message to his fans throughout the years. Another big part of the documentary came here discussing Warrior eventual return to WWE from who was the middle man between the negotiations & how instrumental Triple H was during the process leading up to the Hall Of Fame & the importance of not only why he chose his ""Mom"" as his inductor but the special gift he gave Vince & importance of his speech before showing his backstage meeting at WrestleMania with Hulk Hogan along with his appearance of RAW & what relevance of a specific picture taken. The documentary concluded with Dana telling the story of his death & the support shown to the family including one specific diva's importance to Warrior's daughters along with returning to the arena in New Orleans before concluding with Dana & her daughters having their final words to Warrior.Matches Include:Dingo Warrior vs. Perry Jackson & Chico Cabello - It should be noted that not only was Gary Hart managing Warrior during this time but the match was held under elimination rules meaning that Warrior had to defeat both men as he utilized the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" as he was able to take one man out of competition in order to focus beating on the other on more than one occasion utilizing his power in a quick dominate showcase.""World Class Championship Wrestling"" July '86Dingo Warrior vs. Big Bear Collie - This was another quick match with Warrior using his power offense along with some mat wrestling such as a grounded armbar & athletic ability such as a dropkick & running crossbody with this being significant for him actually delivering this offense against a man of similar size with Big Bear weighing close to 300 lbs.""World Class Championship Wrestling"" June '87vs. Frenchy Martin - This was Warrior's Madison Square Garden debut as Martin's offense had to effect with Warrior just easily overpowering Martin shoving him to the outside & powering him down throughout the match.""Madison Square Garden"" Nov. '87vs. Brian Costello - This was your basic quick Warrior squash in that I think it's only relevant for it being his national television debut.""Wrestling Challenge"" Nov. '87vs. Mike Sharpe - ""Canada's greatest athlete"" kept stalling & avoiding him as Warrior was able to use his power causing Sharpe to resort to desperate tactics such as raking the eyes & choking Warrior using the ropes while keeping a slow pace & even used Warrior's own momentum against him at one point as Warrior continued to rely on his fast paced high impact power offense with Sharpe giving Warrior the most resistance he's had to to his early point in his career.Dec. '87vs. Conquistador #1 - This was your trademark Warrior squash match where he easily dominated with his power including punching him so hard that it knocked him over the top to the floor at one point.""Wrestling Challenge"" May '88Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Honky Tonk Man - Warrior came straight to the ring right after Honky at the start not only working him over around the ring but also getting his shot in on Jimmy Hart on the outside before Hart's assistance on more than one occasion was able to give Honky the advantage he needed before their intentions became clear it was more important to not just win but hurt Warrior as well.Oct. '88vs. Intercontinental Champion Rick Rude - Warrior came out very aggressive taking Rude over the top rope & bouncing his head on each side of the ring apron in the opening seconds while heavily working over the lower back with hard whips in the corner & a bear hug before Rude was able to take advantage of an opening working over Warrior's midsection & lower back area using all his weight & submissions like the reverse chinlock along with other moves like a piledriver that hurt his own back as they traded momentum until things got so out of control that it couldn't be contained in the ring with not just Warrior & Rude getting a piece of the action.May '89w/Jim Duggan vs. Rick Rude & Andre The Giant - Warrior & Duggan showed their team unity in their own special ways before the match & what they did to Rude to take advantage of a mistiming between him & Andre before illegal tactics allowed the Heenan Family to single out one man with Andre utilizing his size advantage along with Rude's technical skills along with various illegal tactics & double teaming causing their opponents to fight ""fire with fire"" in a fun tag match.June '89vs. John Weiss - Another quick match where Warrior was so dominate that he didn't even bother removing his Intercontinental Championship.""Wrestling Challenge"" Sept. '89Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Andre The Giant - Andre caught Warrior early then worked him over in the corner by either pounding or choking him repeatedly only for Warrior to eventually attempt to return the choking with his own hands & using clotheslines to knock Andre off his feet only for Andre to keep stopping Warrior's momentum dead with bear hugs & nerve holds in what was a very slow paced match.Oct. '89vs. Brooklyn Brawler - Another dominate match by Warrior that I can only describe in two words, ""don't blink.""""Wrestling Challenge"" Mar. '90WWE Championship Match vs. Haku - This was Warrior's first televised title defense as Haku attempted to attack once Warrior got in the ring to no avail as Warrior took control repeatedly knocking Haku off his feet & to the outside multiple times before Haku was able to catch Warrior coming in working him over repeatedly giving offense that took Warrior off his feet in what was a short match but solid match.""Saturday Nights Main Event"" Apr. '90vs. Sgt. Slaughter - This was a rematch from the Royal Rumble earlier in the year as Warrior was dominate early slamming Slaughter off the top rope then constantly knocking him down & to the outside causing Slaughter to resort to dirty tactics along with Gen. Adnan & Col. Mustafa on the outside to regain the advantage & heavily focus on working over Warrior's back as the biggest story behind this match was not only who else decided to come to ringside but what they brought with them that was a big distraction to Warrior.""Saturday Nights Main Event"" Apr. '91[Bonus Disc of Self Destruction Of The Ultimate Warrior]vs. Rick Martel - Warrior started out very dominate using his power to keep knocking Martel down & to the outside to the point where Martel had to use Warrior's own momentum against him to gain an advantage focusing on the back with offense like the backbreaker & his trademark Boston Crab along with other tactics on the outside in a short match but Martel telling a good story in that limited time.""Wrestling Challenge"" Apr. '91vs. Smash - Warrior came out very aggressive taking Smash down repeatably in different ways before Smash was able to catch a break taking Warrior down & keeping him down with strikes while working on the throat & chest area along with Mr. Fuji on the outside making his presence known as well.""Superstars"" May '91vs. Skinner - Skinner attempted to get the early advantage spitting his tobacco into Warrior's eyes right away only for Warrior to shrug it off & get very aggressive both in & outside of the ring in a very quick dominate match to the point where he literally beat the tobacco out of Skinner.""Superstars"" May '92vs. Papa Shango - Warrior came out more aggressively than he usually is in this match taking Shango out the ring right away & bouncing his head off the steps along with relying with his usual power offense while Shango being able to get momentum taking advantage of an opening attempting to work him over & slow him down with moves like a nerve hold.May '92w/Randy Savage vs. Nasty Boys - Savage & Warrior were scheduled to be opponents for the upcoming WWF Championship Match at SummerSlam but there were rumors of Mr. Perfect being in one of their corners for that match resulting in neither man being able to trust each other to the point where the referee had to make the decision of who started the match as both Savage & Warrior were able to dominate one or both opponents individually but kept having verbal arguments against each other which the Nastys were able to eventually take advantage of singling out one man to work over including using illegal tactics before things broke down into more chaos causing more confusion of who's side Mr. Perfect was really on.""SummerSlam Spectacular"" Aug. '92vs. Isaac Yankem D.D.S. - This was the in-ring ""RAW"" debut of Warrior with Jerry Lawler not only in Yankem's corner but still had his headset on to do commentary as well in what was a quick dominate performance by Warrior.""RAW"" Apr. '96vs. Owen Hart - Warrior was able to take advantage of Owen using his own momentum against him in the early moments while using his trademark offense of clotheslines & shoulderblocks & slams along with using his own power to reverse Owen's attempt at offense before Owen was able to take advantage of an opening working on grounding Warrior by any method including some illegal tactics including Jim Cornette being involved on the outside in a solid match but more significant for being Warrior's last televised match in his WWE career.""RAW"" July '96(Blu-Ray) vs. Rick Rude - It should be noted that Gary Hart was the manager of Warrior while Percy Pringle III was the manager of Rude as not only Rude & Warrior had a staredown before the match but the managers did too as the wrestlers kept playing a game of ""can you top this"" with them delivering the same offense to different effects along with having an arm wrestling challenge in the middle of the match as they traded momentum with one man being dominate with power & the other using any tactic he could as this match ended when tensions boiled over that just couldn't be contained anymore.""WCCW"" Aug. '86(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship Match vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - This was (at the time) the most unique World Title match in history as the two most popular wrestlers in the company fought each other in the main event with both the Intercontinental & World Title on the line. Both men were pretty even early on as both had an advantage with the test of strength before going into a game of one upping the each as Warrior no sold Hogan's slam only for Hogan to take Warrior's & show the effects of it before hurting his knee going to the outside with Warrior capitalizing on it causing Hogan to resort to going to the eyes & Warrior getting dirty himself taking a shot at Hogan when the referee was trying to separate them. Hogan continued to wrestle outside of his trademark offense go surprise the Warrior like going for an inside cradle & grounding Warrior with a reverse chinlock while Warrior used his power with holds like a bearhug with both men coming so close to a win to the point where each man had the other one beat at one point with the referee not being available to count the fall. This was one of the best Ultimate Warrior matches in his lifetime as they just told a great story resulting in a classic.It should be noted that the version of this match presented has no commentary & is completely shown through the ""hard camera"" angle only so it's a different presentation than previously seen (similar to Hogan/Andre from WrestleMania III on the ""History Of WWE"" DVD set).Wrestlemania VI[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; History Of The WWE Championship; Ultimate Warrior: The Ultimate Collection](Blu-Ray) w/Legion Of Doom vs. Demolition - Warrior & L.O.D. were dominate early working over each member of Demolition individually easily overpowering them before Demolition was able to take advantage of a mistimed move cutting the ring off singling out one opponent keeping him in their corner for double & triple teaming on the inside & outside of the ring in what was a back & forth contest between both teams.""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Oct. '90(Blu-Ray) vs. Earthquake - Earthquake tried to get the jump on Warrior behind while it took Warrior more power than usual to take him down as they traded momentum with Earthquake was taking advantage of a distraction to heavily slow down the pace working over a section of Warrior's body using his natural power while also repeatably dropping his weight onto it while Warrior relied on his trademark offense but had to do more than usual for it to have an effect due to Earthquake's massive size.Feb. '91(Blu-Ray) w/Undertaker vs. Papa Shango & Berzerker - Warrior & Undertaker had a standoff with each other based off their past issues a year earlier before both men focused on their opponents with both teams using the same strategy of singling out one opponent with Warrior & Taker working him over both in & outside of the ring at a fast pace while Shango & Berzerker attempted to slow the pace down & trying to keep their opponent grounded along with resorting to dirty tactics such as illegal participants getting involved in the match in what was a basic tag match.June '92DVD extras include over 2 hours of interviews & promos along with his Hall Of Fame induction & final appearance on RAW after WrestleMania 30.

"Normally Bound For Glory is pushed as TNA's biggest event of the year however they went a different direction this year with the event taking place in Tokyo, Japan at the Korakuen Hall in a joint ""live"" (one day tape delay in the United States) PPV event with the Wrestle-1 promotion leading to most of the various current ""Impact Wrestling"" feuds & championships (no World or Tag Team title defense) being put aside in favor of inter-promotional matches throughout the card (similar to WCW's Super-Shows with New Japan).  It should also be noted that TNA used the four sided ring for this event, highlights of Team 3D's TNA career & their Hall Of Fame ceremony were shown throughout the night, and Taz & Mike Tenay were calling the action from a studio instead of in the arena with Tenay reverting back to his ""Professor"" ways giving a lot of detailed information in regards to the japanese history & participants throughout the entire show as well.Manik vs. Minoru Tanaka - They went back & forth with mat wrestling early on before one man was able to get an advantage working over the neck while his opponent gained momentum with a series of various dropkicks on the ground & in the air only for the opposition to respond with dropkicks of his own including from the springboard position as they traded momentum with some big kicks & moves such as a superplex armdrag combination in what was a competitive athletic contest.Ethan Carter III vs. Ryota Hama - For those who've never seen Hama should know that's he's the japanese equivalent of Rikishi as far as his heavy size which EC3 decided to heavily mock only to be easily overpowered in response with Hama using his weight to his advantage along with embarrassing EC3 whenever possible while EC3 was able only able to get offense in when taking advantage of mistiming or resorting to desperate tactics leading to an average match with some comedic moments.M.V.P. vs. Kazma Sakamoto - M.V.P. came out to a big pop based off his previous history in Japan (first I.W.G.P. Intercontinental Champion) while U.S. audience may remember Sakamoto from his brief time in WWE which M.V.P. joking mentioned while being in control early in the match causing Sakamoto to keep going to the ropes & outside to break the momentum eventually following him to the outside before Sakamoto was able to come back with various strikes along with even stealing a page out of M.V.P.'s playbook as they traded momentum throughout the match leading to a nice encounter that definitely saw a different showing from M.V.P. than we've seen previously in TNA due to the different environment.X Division Champion Samoa Joe vs. Low Ki vs. Kaz Hayashi - It should be noted that this is the same Kaz Hayashi from the Yung Dragon's group in WCW over a decade ago.  Each man started off with strong strikes against each other such as strong kicks with Joe using his size to his advantage taking out both men all in the opening seconds as each man had attacked their opponents with strong kicks & chops to various areas of the body from different areas such as a springboard to aerial throughout the match along with other highlights such as one man powerbomb out of a corner into a submission, a double submission between all three men, and one man reversing a slingshot into a double foot stomp in what was a hard hitting physical match between all three men in what I consider the match of the night.Andy Wu & Hijo Del Pantera vs. Kuroshio Ikemen Jiro & Yusuke Kodama - This was a special Wrestle-1 exclusive match with Jiro showing signs of Ric Flair with his ""styling & profiling"" by always showing off & fixing his hair down to even wrestling with his jacket on as Wu & Pantera showcased a lucha libre influenced style of high flying moves from either a springboard position or flying over the top to the floor including going over the referee at one point only to be matched by Jiro & Kodama going aerial as well with moves like a different variations of the moonsault as both teams executed some high impact moves like a tilt-a-wirl backbreaker, handstand head scissors takeover, and a move Mike & Taz didn't know how to call because they didn't know the area code in what was a real good match showcasing the promotion.Team 3D vs. Tommy Dreamer & Abyss - Dreamer came out dressed as a tribute to Terry Funk & payed respect to Team 3D with a handshake while Abyss simply walked away as this started out with both teams delivering big moves only to get right back up from it causing one team to use the divide & conquer strategy focusing on one man while keeping the other out of the match before things eventually got out of hand with all four men brawling outside of the ring throughout the crowd using whatever they could get their hands on eventually making their way back to ringside with even more weapons being tossed into the ring to be used from chairs to kendo sticks to tables to Abyss' black bag of thumbtacks with the japanese crowd chanting throughout the entire match ""WE WANT TABLES...ECW! ECW! ECW!...HOLY S..."" resulting on the hardcore match expected from all four names involved.  As a side note, Team 3D's challenge to New Japan Pro Wrestling's Bullet Club was edited out of the broadcast.Knockouts Champion Havoc vs. Velvet Sky - It should be noted that Velvet Sky came out as her babyface persona & not the current heel ""Beautiful People"" character that we've seen for most of the year as she attempted to use the strategy of ""hit & move"" using quick punches & kicks along with coming out the top rope from each corner of the ring before Havoc was able to eventually catch her & use her power to her advantage heavily working over the back with Velvet only able to get offense in whenever Havoc missed a big time move in a match that was very similar to her clashes earlier this year against Lei'd Tapa where it was a female version of ""David vs. Goliath.""Yoshihiro Tajiri & Great Muta vs. Great Senada & James Storm - Two of the most well known japanese wrestlers in america for the last quarter of a century teamed up here for revenge against Muta's former protege in Senada & the man who transformed him in Storm with Muta & Tajiri giving quite the visual with their mist before the match as it started with ""student vs. teacher"" as both men focused on each others legs with grounded leglocks before Storm & Senada used illegal tactics on more than one occasion to keep control for their team causing Muta & Tajiri to resort to those same tactics themselves as both team traded momentum both in & outside of the ring with one team resorting to their signature trademark offense while the other did some high flying of their own resulting in a good solid match with an aftermath of more than one associate of the participants getting involved.As I stated earlier, normally Bound For Glory is the biggest event of the year for TNA however with their current situation & future of the company very questionable around this time that they went this direction to present their PPV as a special ""live"" experience with Wrestle-1 leading to completely different matches & audience to even the commentary that you wouldn't usually get which is a positive for this show with the big negative being that many of their top names & champions were unavailable to make the trip for one reason or another which did effect the star power & availability to have the best possible card and the quality of the card makes this my least favorite of their events from Japan.  In the end, if your looking for this show being their yearly ""WrestleMania"" then you will be disappointed but if your looking for a special event similar to their ""One Night Only"" events where it's a special unique one night show then I would check this out behind their previous events from Japan such as the ""One Night Only"" earlier this year & their Global Impact back in 2008.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21VFOBY9VWA0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUB9T9I#wasThisHelpful","R21VFOBY9VWA0U","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This PPV is part of the second season of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme.  The second edition of ""World Cup"" was the theme of this event however the international teams were abandoned for four captains drafting 3 males & 1 female onto their team to compete in a single & a tag team & a knockouts match for points with the two teams with the highest amount of points competing at the end of the night to win the trophy.  The four teams include Team Young (Eric Young, Bully Ray, Eddie Edwards, Gunner, O.D.B.), Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Davey Richards, Mr. Anderson, Sanada, Madison Rayne), Team EC3 (Ethan Carter III, Jessie Godderz, Robbie E, Magnus, Gail Kim), and Team Roode (Bobby Rodde, James Storm, Kenny King, Samuel Shaw, Angelina Love).Eddie Edwards vs. James Storm - Eddie took control early send Storm to the outside & working him over on the floor before Storm regained control working over the throat area as they traded momentum trading kicks on the apron along with each man catching their opponent coming off the top rope with a move of their own in a nice match.Madison Rayne vs. Gail Kim - Both women had stalemates early with Madison getting the upper hand with various takeovers & quick pin attempts before Gail was able to work her over including a unique head scissors submission putting her leg over Madison's head along with dropping all over weight across the back as both men fought hard against each other going back & forth as it came down to one woman being able to take advantage of a mistiming by the other.Mr. Anderson & Senada vs. BroMans - Anderson & Senada had some fun with the ring entrances & at the expense of their opponents throughout the match while showing some strong teamwork with repeated quick tags to keep a fresh man in while either working over a body part or repeating his partners offense to the point where it took the numbers game for the BroMans to gain control singling out one man & keeping him grounded in a match that was entertaining with it's comedic moments.Eric Young vs. Bobby Roode - The former Team Canada members started out with Young in control being able to keep staying one step ahead of Roode by reversing his offense & keeping a fast pace while constantly going back to working an armbar before Roode was eventually able to slow the pace down keeping Young grounded working his neck as they went back & forth resulting in a solid encounter.Kurt Angle vs. Magnus - Former Main Event Mafia members started out with Magnus being able to gain the early upper hand working over Angle's neck with a strong side headlock from both a standing & grounded position holding on to it while also working over Angle's back area with his power & own body weight before Angle was able to come back with some big offensive moves including his trademark triple german suplexes & running top rope superplex & anklelock while Magnus was able to have some counters for Angle's offense along with hitting his signature moves as well in a match that was good considering how it happened right before Angle was scheduled to have knee surgery so they never left first gear & kept the same pace throughout the entire match.O.D.B. vs. Angelina Love - O.D.B. showcased her superior strength advantage early on causing Velvet Sky to get involved to the point where the most unlikely person was showing the effects of their involvement in the match before Love kept trying to neutralize O.D.B.'s power while using Velvet to her advantage whenever possible as this was another match that was more entertaining for the interaction with EVERYONE involved in during & after the match more than anything else.Davey Richards vs. Ethan Carter III - Davey started out in control in & outside of the ring with his various kicks before EC3 responded overpowering Davey heavily working over the midsection with bear hugs & abdominal stretches as both men went back & forth with Davey delivering a series of offense consisting of various kicks & aerial offense before both men went into a series of executing one big move or submission after another in what turned out to be the best match of the night.Bully Ray & Gunner vs. Kenny King & Samuel Shaw - ""Calf-zilla & Quad-zilla"" were dominate early taking advantage of King trying to show up his opponents early causing King & Shaw to resort to illegal tactics to gain & keep the momentum in their favor working over the neck & throat area while Gunner & Bully continued to some good teamwork together in an average match.Elimination Match - Team Young vs. Team Roode: Team Young (Eric Young, Bully Ray, Eddie Edwards, Gunner, O.D.B.) vs. Team Roode (Bobby Rodde, James Storm, Kenny King, Samuel Shaw, Angelina Love) - This was under inter-gender rules meaning that the women & men were allowed in the ring at the same time leading to various highlights such as DJ Zema Ion getting involved & Bully Ray giving a response that only a ""bully"" would do while later Bully had a response after Gail Kim dared to chopped her, the teamwork with Team EC3 from double to 4 on 1 teaming, surprising eliminations, Rockstar Spud involvement in the match, issues between certain teammates, and when it gets down to the final two.  A fun match.This was one of those events that didn't have a bad unwatchable match on it as there was some average & solid wrestling along with comedic & entertaining moments but didn't have a match that was very memorable or worth going out of your way to watch.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DZ8TRV0E8QX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUBJLLO#wasThisHelpful","R3DZ8TRV0E8QX0","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This PPV is part of the second season of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme with this season being more recently taped than the previous season so it reflects the talents current gimmicks & feuds.  The second edition of ""X-Division Xtrazaganza"" was the theme of this event based around six independent X Division wrestlers (at the time of this taping) facing off against members of the X Division roster with the stipulation that they would advance to the Ultimate X match later in the night where the winner of that match receiving a future X Division Championship match as Mike Tenay & Jeremy Borash did commentary on this show & various past X Division highlights were shown throughout the event.  This would be a rare appearance for some of these wrestlers for TNA wrestling so had their names changed for copyright reasons but I'll reference the names they are better known as well in other promotions.Low-Ki vs. Chris Sabin - Sabin attempted to avoid Low-Ki early & kept going to the floor whenever Ki was able to get a hit on him before Ki was able to catch & work him over in the corners only for Sabin to work over the midsection in various ways using the ropes or an abdominal stretch or grounding him with Ki continuing to come back using his various style of kicks.  Good back & forth match in what ultimately turned out to be the final TNA performance of Chris Sabin.Rashad Cameron (BLK Jeez/Sabian) vs. DJ Zema Ion - Both men tried to take advantage of their opponents unique hair style along with mocking each other in other ways causing Mike Tenay of all people to do a reference to Questlove of The Roots as DJZ was able to gain the advantage working over the throat area using the ring ropes & grounding him on the mat while Rashad worked a more athletic style going over the top rope & other offense like a running head scissors takeover in a short but solid match.Rubix (Jigsaw) vs. Kenny King - This match started very fast with Rubix constantly catching & reversing King's offense into various pin & submission attempts before King was able to slow the pace down working over Rubix in & outside of the ring as Rubix continued to attempt past face high risk maneuvers as the match eventually came down to one man using his opponents strategy again him.Ace Vetter (Trent Barretta) vs. Manic - Manic was very dominate early on with head scissor takeovers & offense from a springboard position while Ace was more focused on grounding him with stretches & impactful offense focusing on the head & neck area in a short match that went back & forth between both men.Sonjay Dutt vs. Rockstar Spud - Dutt was very dominate in the beginning catching Spud off guard with his fast pace offense causing Spud to lose his temper & take it out on the referee on more than one occassion before Spud was able to catch Dutt but not able to follow up on so many occasions leaving an opening for Dutt to recover & regain momentum with some aerial offense.Petey Williams vs. Tigre Uno - Both men started out intense causing one man's nose to bleed within the opening minute as Tigre went fast pace with his offense along with going aerial while Petey focused on Tigre's leg with stretches along with his own strength to ground Tigre.EC3 $20,000 Invitational Ladder Match: The Wolves vs. Bad Influence - Ethan Carter III put up his own money to the winner of this match as both teams started out double teaming each other in the opening moments along with using the steps on the outside before the ladders came into play leading to some highlights such as a double suicide dive blocked with a ladder, all four climbing up & knocked off the ladders together, dives onto their opponents laying on the ladder, dropkicks & double foot stomps onto the ladder, and some unique double team offense knocking their opponents off the ladder in a match that lived up to the expectations of both teams with a special presentation afterwords as it should also be noted as well that this was Daniels' last match with TNA (again).2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: X Division Champion Sanada vs. Austin Aries - This was Aries rematch from the previous ""One Night Only"" event from Japan as both of them were evenly match starting out outsmarting each other before Sanada was able to get ahead catching Aries & staying a step ahead before Aries was able to take advantage of an opening working over Senada with various submissions as they traded momentum picking up the pace showcasing their athleticism & aerial offense in an evenly matched encounter from start to finish.Ultimate X Match: Low-Ki vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Rashad Cameron vs. Ace Vetter - All of the non-roster stars who won their matches earlier met here with the winner getting a future X-Division Championship match as the signature match of the X-Division was full of various highlights such as one man trying to grab the X off a backdrop, another being tossed inside out from the top rope, an innovative head scissors takeover piledriver, a full force dropkick that launched his opponent back into the corner, and a fight on the structure above the Ultimate X ropes that included a camel clutch submission in what was wasn't the ""highspots/car crash/highlight reel"" type of match that this is known for but still a good four way match.I always enjoy the events where X-Division is allowed to be heavily showcased & this is no exception as it was an overall good show but with only few matches coming off as fillers & underwhelming but in the end, I still recommend for fans of his concept.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R134JZB9F2IS2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUBF25S#wasThisHelpful","R134JZB9F2IS2C","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second DVD collection coming from a man who goes under a heavy variety of nicknames, made wrestling history on more than one occasion, and became a crossover entertainment superstar from his acting to music to most recently hosting a popular podcast...this man is Chris Jericho. This set takes the format of a match anthology with Jericho himself not only hosting the DVD set during a limo ride from New York to Philadelphia (having some funny blooper moments on the way there) but also speaking on various subjects before each match such as either his opponent or feud going into that match along with other subjects such as the importance of the ECW Television Championship, his history with Ultimo Dragon dating back to their days in Japan, being able to finally showcase his personality in WCW, the difficulties of going from WCW to WWE & who Vince had tutor him, various innovations & ideas he had that WWE still uses today, who he feels is the most underrated performer, his definition of ""Dicaprio"", why Triple H didn't like him & the significance of the match picked for this set, how he compares himself to George Harrison & matches to ""Stairway To Heaven"", who his original WrestleMania XIX opponent was suppose to be, the ""IT"" factor, significance of Madison Square Garden to him since before wrestling, and a funny story behind his jacket at WrestleMania.Normally I give my summary at the end of the review but I'll just give it now as the positives is that this set delivered what was advertised for the most part in that we've gotten quality encounters that usually are forgotten about when looking over Jericho's career while hearing him speak on certain subjects is a bonus as well.  The negatives is what I just said in ""for the most part"" as some of these matches just weren't good quality or significant at all (his Booker T match in 2001) & some matches never released onto a ""Chris Jericho"" set but been released elsewhere or is available through the WWE Network so I would have preferred if a different match that isn't available besides one previously released in some cases up to twice or three different times before (i.e. Mysterio at the Bash could have been replaced by their rare final encounter on SmackDown for the I.C. title, the World Title rematch between Jericho vs. Rock or their SmackDown match from April 2002, the Steel Cage match for the World Championship with Punk back in 2008, ect.) but I can't win them all so overall it's still a quality collection.Matches Include:vs. ECW Television Champion Pitbull #2 - Pitbull showcased his strength advantage early by easily overpowering Jericho in the early moments by repeatably forcing him down to the mat & even to the outside while being able to keep catching him in mid-offense only to counter with a power move only for Jericho to change his strategy with an aerial assault using various lucha libre influence offense along with various kicks as they traded momentum with both men being able to counter each other's offense along with Pitbull continuing to not only use his power to keep catching Jericho but also ground him & Jericho continuing to go to the air & use his educated feet before another man who had an interest in this championship match made his presence known around ringside.ECW Hardcore Heaven '96WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match vs. Ultimate Dragon - It was noted by the commentators in the early stages of this match that both men knew each other so well from facing each other numerous times not only in WCW but Japan & Mexico as well. That fact was showcased early as both men were exchanging & countering the same holds against each other that either one was able to get the advantage leading to a stalemate & a moment later on when Jericho attempted a cradle only for Dragon to counter it & do the move right back to Jericho. They get more aggressive such as Dragon hitting Jericho with loud stiff kicks & even catching Jericho in midair during the Lionsault with a dropkick while Jericho delivered back to back powerbombs. This was a highly intense & competitive match that showcased what Jericho has said himself numerous times, ""crusierweight action was one of the forgotten reasons WCW was able to dominate during the Monday Night Wars.""WCW Bash At The Beach '97[Wrestling's Highest Flyers]WCW Crusierweight Championship Match vs. Dean Malenko - For weeks leading up to this match, Jericho mocked Dean Malenko to the point where he made up his own his moniker of being ""The Man Of 1,004 Holds"" & had the #1,004 on his outfit. Malenko out-wrestled Jericho early to the point where he almost walked out of the match leading Dean to break the count. They traded momentum throughout the match with Jericho attempting backbreaker & chinlock submissions while Malenko at one point was able to reverse an attempted frankensteiner off the top rope into his famous top rope gutbuster. Jericho was eventually able to catch Malenko in the Liontamer for the submission victory causing Gene Okerland afterwords to call Malenko out on the fact that he's lost all his attempts to regain the Crusierweight Championship in the past few months causing Malenko just declare he was going ""home.""  Little did anyone know it at the time but this was the beginning of what can be considered one of the first times the crusierweight championship was beginning to be given ""storylines"" to it instead of it being just based off wrestling alone.WCW Uncensored '98Steel Cage Match vs. X-Pac - This was held under the rules where you could only win by escaping the cage as both men started brawling on the outside before finally entering the cage with one man having the door slammed on him face first allowing his head to be heavily focused on as both men had their bodies thrown against the cage several times including a backdrop directly into it before landing directly on their head while delievering some impactful offense such as powerbomb off the top rope while later just being tossed off the top of the cage along with a submission applied on the top of the cage & a chair being brought into the match as this was competitive between both men from start to finish to the point where one man was out of action for months following this.No Mercy '00Last Man Standing Match vs. Kane - This started over coffee but after the constant attacks by Kane, Jericho himself started to be more aggressive taking the fights to Kane resulting in this match as they met each other in the isleway fighting backstage right away using whatever was around from an anvil case to a shovel before making their way to ringside with the ringpost & steps used as a weapon as Kane as dominate beating on Jericho's back with holds like a powerslam on the floor & bearhug into the post before Jericho refused to stay down & kept begging for more which Kane delivered with a powerful chokeslam & chairshot to the back. Jericho resorted to tactics like using the chair himself including a lionsault onto the chair on top of Kane & taking the fight to the stage area with a faceplant through a table & literally ""breaking the walls down"" onto Kane. This was a physically aggressive match.Armageddon '00[The Twisted & Disturbed Life Of Kane]with special outside enforcer Mick Foley vs. WWE Champion Steve Austin - Austin came into this match with a sore back from his battles (and heavy amount of german suplexes) with Chris Benoit the week before as Austin jumped on Jericho before the bell to the point where Jericho wasn't able to take off his tag team title belt before he was able to recover with various dropkicks & chops along with countering Austin's own offense making Austin resort to his brawling tactics on the outside while focusing on the lower back as they traded momentum including using the same dirty tactics against each other while Foley did get involved when necessary on the outside before someone else who resented Foley's authority decided to make his presence known as well in what was a competitive match between both men.""RAW"" June '01[WWF Action]vs. WCW Champion Booker T - Shane McMahon was in Booker's corner as Jericho started out in control by taking Booker off his feet multiple times while going aerial with his springboard dropkicks & top rope crossbody while Booker resorted to his various styles of kicks along with Shane McMahon causing a distraction when necessary as this was a solid encounter but they would go on to have better (see their feud in 2003) as this was more of a backdrop to the various storylines in regards to how the issues between the WWE & WCW/ECW Alliance went further than just the wrestlers.""RAW"" July '01WCW Championship Match vs. Kurt Angle - It should be noted that not only was Angle the WCW United States Champion coming into this match but also recently joined the Alliance setting up this match here was they traded momentum early on with each other taking the other down multiple times while trading fist & executing their own styles of suplexes before Jericho was able to take advantage of the environment around ringside to gain an advantage only for Angle to get more aggressive with his strikes & various suplexes including one executed catching Jericho off the top rope as both men continued to go back & forth countering & even attempting their opponents signature moves in what was a back & forth competitive contest.Rebellion '01WWE Undisputed Championship Match vs. The Rock - Jericho mocked Rock's ""Just Bring It"" which fired up the Rock to the point where he chased after Jericho & tackled him back into the ring before Jericho was able to get some offense in by grounding Rock with moves like his Lionsault & bulldog but kept making very arrogant covers. Rock was caught Jericho off guard into the sharpshooter but Jericho regained the momentum due to a few distractions & even ripped off the Rock Bottom but was caught when attempting the People's Elbow with the Rock punishing Jericho using the steps & announce table on the outside. They kept fighting back in the ring with Jericho eventually catching Rock in the Walls Of Jericho while Rock was able to execute an impactful DDT & later the People's Elbow. This was like their previous No Mercy championship match with the difference being that Jericho was in full heel mode from relying on cheating & outside help while mocking The Rock whenever he could but still a competitive match.Royal Rumble '02[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]vs. Triple H - The winner of this match would face the Undisputed Champion Hulk Hogan next week & their one on one rematch from WrestleMania as Triple H immediately targeted Jericho's arm & shoulder including using part of the ring to his advantage before Jericho was able to use the outside of the ring to his advantage busting open Triple H in the process while focusing on the head & neck area as they went back & forth with a series of counters & reversals while executing some of the same offense against each other along in a match that was better quality than their previous Mania match.""SmackDown"" Apr. '02vs. Jeff Hardy - Hardy came out real strong with punches & a head scissors takeover causing Jericho to resort to tactics such as choking Hardy with his own towel as Hardy continued to use his daredevil offense to his advantage both in & outside of the ring while Jericho attempted to ground Hardy by heavily focusing on his back area as they traded momentum until one man was finally able to catch the other.""RAW"" Feb. '03vs. Edge - A ladder was setup at ringside as both of these men were set to participant in the first Money In The Bank Ladder Match at WrestleMania as Jericho targeted Edge's bad arm with stretches & submissions while staying one step ahead countering Edge's repeated attempt at offense to the point where Edge ended up hurting himself at times when performing moves of his own causing him to adjust his offense using moves like the body scissors as they went back & forth throughout the rest of the match using similar tactics such as avoiding each other's signature moves.""RAW"" Mar. '05Last Man Standing Match vs. Shawn Michaels - This was set to the final match in their feud throughout the year with HBK dominating & taking the match to the outside early where both men continued to fight in the isleway & use the props on the stage area to their advantage such as a catapult into the mailbox & being hit with the camera boom while both men took their bumps on the cab car parked to the side of the entrance before another infamous weapon that both men had a reputation for using in the past as early as their last match at the previous PPV came into play before more weapons from a chair & the announce table to the World Championship itself came into play as this came down to one man delievering the perfect blow that the other couldn't recover from with the bigger story being exactly who delivered that knockout blow.""RAW"" Nov. '08Street Fight vs. World Champion John Cena - This was a post-RAW ""dark match"" as Jericho took advantage of a referee distraction taking advantage of the environment around ringside using whatever he could get his hands on to beat on Cena along with taunting Cena's father in the front row before settling back in the ring as Jericho brought weapons into the ring while along countering whatever offense Cena was able to attempt while continuing to take shortcuts when possible.  This was the stereotypical type of match that Cena gets criticized for before he was on the defense for the entire match until the very end which completely goes against all the comments Jericho made in regards to Cena's in-ring work ethic in the interview segment before this match.Dec. '08Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Rey Mysterio - Mysterio must win the championship or forever unmask as Jericho targeted the mask right away while using his superior size to his advantage such as catching Rey various times & swinging him into the outside barricade before Rey was able to use Jericho's own momentum against him along with his lucha libre high flying offense including a legdrop executed from a double springboard as they traded momentum with both men finding unique ways to constantly counter the others signature offense as this came down to one man's obsession working against him in what was a very competitive contest.The Bash '09[Best PPV Matches Of 2009-2010; Superstar Collection: Rey Mysterio]w/Big Show vs. D-Generation-X vs. John Cena & Undertaker - This was a preview match for the upcoming Survivor Series where both sets of champions were facing one of the other tag teams in a triple threat match for their title so the champions in Cena & Taker teamed up to face both teams here with one man from each team being legal at the same time & it was non-stop fast paced action that had it's various highlights such as old rivalries being renewed between all the participants including Shawn Michaels & Undertaker facing off for the first time since their WrestleMania 25 encounter & one signature move delivered after another at one point with not one team but one man leaving the last impression at the end.""RAW"" Nov. '09[Best Of RAW 2009; Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden; Blu-Ray Edition of DX: One Last Stand]Street Fight Match vs. WWE Champion C.M. Punk - Punk not only returns home but also returns of ""the scene of the crime"" of where he first became a WWE Champion close to a year earlier in Chicago with Punk's family at ringside & both men dressed in their street clothes for this match. You knew where this match was going when Punk brought in a kendo stick during the first minute of the match with Jericho kept going outside to break Punk's momentum & even went as far as to hide behind the referee to gain the advantage & use the stick himself. Both men brawled on the outside with Jericho going as far as to taunt Punk's sister which made Punk ""snap"" resulting in Jericho getting slammed through the announce table hood before Jericho retaliated with the monitor & breaking the rest of the hood over his back before Jericho got too cocky & began pouring beer on Punk's back with Punk coming back with a low blow using the stick. They went back & forth after this with counters to the Lionsault & GTS along, the unique escapes from the Walls Of Jericho & Anaconda Vice, a SAVAGE elbow through the announce table followed by a Codebreaker with a steel chair, and attempting to use the other's finisher. They topped their WrestleMania match which was quality in it's own right as it really did come off as a brawl between two men who wanted to beat the hell out of each other with the added drama of Punk's sister being the crowd definitely helped.Extreme Rules '12vs. Rob Van Dam - This was RVD's first singles match in WWE since 2007 as they went back & forth early with RVD relying on his educated feet & athleticism such as the standing moonsault along with grounding Jericho with his own body scissors while Jericho was able to counter his offense with some impactful offense of his own along such as a powerbomb & spike DDT with using his own athleticism as they continued to trade momentum avoiding the other's signature moves in a hard fought quality match.""RAW"" July '13Steel Cage Match: Chris Jericho vs. Bray Wyatt - Both men were trading blows & stopping each other's attempts at escaping early on before one man was able to start using the cage to his advantage using his opponents momentum against him to send him into & sandwitching him against the cage only for his opponent to use the same tactics as well using the cage as a weapon as both men traded momentum such as countering each other's trademark offense along with taking some big high risk attempts from the top rope & even off the top of the cage as it literally came down to the wire between both men in such an evenly matched contest from start to finish.""RAW"" Sept. '14[Best Of RAW & SmackDown 2014]vs. Randy Orton - Jericho started out in control with a fast pace & taking the action to the outside early on using the ringside environment to his advantage before Orton was able to gain the advantage & keep it slowing down the pace & taking advantage of any openings such as coming into the ring or when he was on the top rope or coming into the corner along with also giving a receipt for Jericho's actions on the outside earlier as both men continued to trade momentum delivering sequences of counters & reversals to each others offense followed by delivering a signature move of their own including each man playing mind games suckering the their opponent in resulting in a competitive match that saw Orton show more personality than usual as far as interaction with not only the crowd but a moment with an announcer at ringside.Night Of Champions '14(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship/Ladder Match vs. Christian - These two were feuding with each other for months over Trish Stratus but after going through regular matches, handicap matches, and cage matches (where Christian injured his back & was out of action for months) they settled their score in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship after Edge had to forfeit the title due to injury. Both men started out wrestling before it turned into a brawl in the crowd & the outside using the cable cord to choke while Christian was able to do his Unprettier on the floor. The ladder then came into play with both men being thrown into the ladder, ladder using it as a weapon like Jericho using it to work on Christian's back while Jericho's leg was damaged when thrown into it, and making moves more impactful like the Lionsault & bulldog, and both men taking face first falls from the ladder & even from the hanging title. This match was more about trying to tell a story throughout the match instead of doing a bunch of ""high spots"" & turned out to be a great match.Unforgiven '04[The Ladder Match](Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Rey Mysterio - Rey came after Jericho right away with a double leg takedown & taking him over the top rope only for Jericho to use the environment on the outside of the ring to his advantage as Rey continued to use his aerial assault from top rope to springboard offense along with some impactful moves such as powerbomb against Jericho while Jericho was able to stay a step ahead countering some of the Rey's moves into either his own or pin attempts while constantly focusing on the one thing that distracts Rey more than anything else in a non-stop fast paced match.""RAW"" June '09(Blu-Ray) vs. Evan Bourne - The fans were split between these two as this was a very fast paced match that had a mix of both high flying & grounded wrestling from both men. Bourne early on showed great athleticism as he did a standing vertical leap that was high enough to deliver a frankensteiner onto Jericho who was sitting on the top rope while later doing a move that Jericho was able to counter into the Walls Of Jericho in one quick motion & Bourne doing Air Bourne but landing on his feet right into a codebreaker. Personally, this was my favorite match of the night as I felt these two stole the show.Fatal 4 Way '10(Blu-Ray) vs. C.M. Punk - Punk's first appearance since RAW two weeks after WrestleMania as both men stated grounding each other early with Jericho starting to gain an advantage before Punk was able counter his springboard dropkick to gain the advantage working over Jericho's arm with a keylock as Jericho picked up the pace with a double axe handle & bulldog. Both men from here started to trade momentum with countering each other's offense such a lionsault into a swinging neckbreaker only for the lionsault to be executed after countering a bulldog, the Walls Of Jericho reversed into the Anaconda Vice but Jericho eventually applying the hold after countering the GTS while both men just went back & forth with their offense like Punk's Savage elbow & GTS along with Jericho catching Punk in mid-air while Paul Heyman made his presence known at one point only for it to distract both men. This match was the high quality that's expected & deliver from both men against each other.Payback '13I already have my summary earlier so it's not a perfect collection but still quality that I would recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BD9NXGHX3PJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUJRZJ4#wasThisHelpful","R1BD9NXGHX3PJB","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This was like their previous No Mercy championship match with the difference being that Jericho was in full heel mode from relying on cheating & outside help while mocking The Rock whenever he could but still a competitive match.Royal Rumble '02[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]vs. Triple H - The winner of this match would face the Undisputed Champion Hulk Hogan next week & their one on one rematch from WrestleMania as Triple H immediately targeted Jericho's arm & shoulder including using part of the ring to his advantage before Jericho was able to use the outside of the ring to his advantage busting open Triple H in the process while focusing on the head & neck area as they went back & forth with a series of counters & reversals while executing some of the same offense against each other along in a match that was better quality than their previous Mania match.""SmackDown"" Apr. '02vs. Jeff Hardy - Hardy came out real strong with punches & a head scissors takeover causing Jericho to resort to tactics such as choking Hardy with his own towel as Hardy continued to use his daredevil offense to his advantage both in & outside of the ring while Jericho attempted to ground Hardy by heavily focusing on his back area as they traded momentum until one man was finally able to catch the other.""RAW"" Feb. '03vs. Edge - A ladder was setup at ringside as both of these men were set to participant in the first Money In The Bank Ladder Match at WrestleMania as Jericho targeted Edge's bad arm with stretches & submissions while staying one step ahead countering Edge's repeated attempt at offense to the point where Edge ended up hurting himself at times when performing moves of his own causing him to adjust his offense using moves like the body scissors as they went back & forth throughout the rest of the match using similar tactics such as avoiding each other's signature moves.""RAW"" Mar. '05Last Man Standing Match vs. Shawn Michaels - This was set to the final match in their feud throughout the year with HBK dominating & taking the match to the outside early where both men continued to fight in the isleway & use the props on the stage area to their advantage such as a catapult into the mailbox & being hit with the camera boom while both men took their bumps on the cab car parked to the side of the entrance before another infamous weapon that both men had a reputation for using in the past as early as their last match at the previous PPV came into play before more weapons from a chair & the announce table to the World Championship itself came into play as this came down to one man delievering the perfect blow that the other couldn't recover from with the bigger story being exactly who delivered that knockout blow.""RAW"" Nov. '08Street Fight vs. World Champion John Cena - This was a post-RAW ""dark match"" as Jericho took advantage of a referee distraction taking advantage of the environment around ringside using whatever he could get his hands on to beat on Cena along with taunting Cena's father in the front row before settling back in the ring as Jericho brought weapons into the ring while along countering whatever offense Cena was able to attempt while continuing to take shortcuts when possible.  This was the stereotypical type of match that Cena gets criticized for before he was on the defense for the entire match until the very end which completely goes against all the comments Jericho made in regards to Cena's in-ring work ethic in the interview segment before this match.Dec. '08Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Rey Mysterio - Mysterio must win the championship or forever unmask as Jericho targeted the mask right away while using his superior size to his advantage such as catching Rey various times & swinging him into the outside barricade before Rey was able to use Jericho's own momentum against him along with his lucha libre high flying offense including a legdrop executed from a double springboard as they traded momentum with both men finding unique ways to constantly counter the others signature offense as this came down to one man's obsession working against him in what was a very competitive contest.The Bash '09[Best PPV Matches Of 2009-2010; Superstar Collection: Rey Mysterio]w/Big Show vs. D-Generation-X vs. John Cena & Undertaker - This was a preview match for the upcoming Survivor Series where both sets of champions were facing one of the other tag teams in a triple threat match for their title so the champions in Cena & Taker teamed up to face both teams here with one man from each team being legal at the same time & it was non-stop fast paced action that had it's various highlights such as old rivalries being renewed between all the participants including Shawn Michaels & Undertaker facing off for the first time since their WrestleMania 25 encounter & one signature move delivered after another at one point with not one team but one man leaving the last impression at the end.""RAW"" Nov. '09[Best Of RAW 2009; Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden; Blu-Ray Edition of DX: One Last Stand]Street Fight Match vs. WWE Champion C.M. Punk - Punk not only returns home but also returns of ""the scene of the crime"" of where he first became a WWE Champion close to a year earlier in Chicago with Punk's family at ringside & both men dressed in their street clothes for this match. You knew where this match was going when Punk brought in a kendo stick during the first minute of the match with Jericho kept going outside to break Punk's momentum & even went as far as to hide behind the referee to gain the advantage & use the stick himself. Both men brawled on the outside with Jericho going as far as to taunt Punk's sister which made Punk ""snap"" resulting in Jericho getting slammed through the announce table hood before Jericho retaliated with the monitor & breaking the rest of the hood over his back before Jericho got too cocky & began pouring beer on Punk's back with Punk coming back with a low blow using the stick. They went back & forth after this with counters to the Lionsault & GTS along, the unique escapes from the Walls Of Jericho & Anaconda Vice, a SAVAGE elbow through the announce table followed by a Codebreaker with a steel chair, and attempting to use the other's finisher. They topped their WrestleMania match which was quality in it's own right as it really did come off as a brawl between two men who wanted to beat the hell out of each other with the added drama of Punk's sister being the crowd definitely helped.Extreme Rules '12vs. Rob Van Dam - This was RVD's first singles match in WWE since 2007 as they went back & forth early with RVD relying on his educated feet & athleticism such as the standing moonsault along with grounding Jericho with his own body scissors while Jericho was able to counter his offense with some impactful offense of his own along such as a powerbomb & spike DDT with using his own athelticsm as they continued to trade momentum avoiding the other's signature moves in a hard fought quality match.""RAW"" July '13Steel Cage Match: Chris Jericho vs. Bray Wyatt - Both men were trading blows & stopping each other's attempts at escaping early on before one man was able to start using the cage to his advantage using his opponents momentum against him to send him into & sandwitching him against the cage only for his opponent to use the same tactics as well using the cage as a weapon as both men traded momentum such as countering each other's trademark offense along with taking some big high risk attempts from the top rope & even off the top of the cage as it literally came down to the wire between both men in such an evenly matched contest from start to finish.""RAW"" Sept. '14[Best Of RAW & SmackDown 2014]vs. Randy Orton - Jericho started out in control with a fast pace & taking the action to the outside early on using the ringside environment to his advantage before Orton was able to gain the advantage & keep it slowing down the pace & taking advantage of any openings such as coming into the ring or when he was on the top rope or coming into the corner along with also giving a receipt for Jericho's actions on the outside earlier as both men continued to trade momentum delivering sequences of counters & reversals to each others offense followed by delivering a signature move of their own including each man playing mind games suckering the their opponent in resulting in a competitive match that saw Orton show more personality than usual as far as interaction with not only the crowd but a moment with an announcer at ringside.Night Of Champions '14(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship/Ladder Match vs. Christian - These two were feuding with each other for months over Trish Stratus but after going through regular matches, handicap matches, and cage matches (where Christian injured his back & was out of action for months) they settled their score in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship after Edge had to forfeit the title due to injury. Both men started out wrestling before it turned into a brawl in the crowd & the outside using the cable cord to choke while Christian was able to do his Unprettier on the floor. The ladder then came into play with both men being thrown into the ladder, ladder using it as a weapon like Jericho using it to work on Christian's back while Jericho's leg was damaged when thrown into it, and making moves more impactful like the Lionsault & bulldog, and both men taking face first falls from the ladder & even from the hanging title. This match was more about trying to tell a story throughout the match instead of doing a bunch of ""high spots"" & turned out to be a great match.Unforgiven '04[The Ladder Match](Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Rey Mysterio - Rey came after Jericho right away with a double leg takedown & taking him over the top rope only for Jericho to use the environment on the outside of the ring to his advantage as Rey continued to use his aerial assault from top rope to springboard offense along with some impactful moves such as powerbomb against Jericho while Jericho was able to stay a step ahead countering some of the Rey's moves into either his own or pin attempts while constantly focusing on the one thing that distracts Rey more than anything else in a non-stop fast paced match.""RAW"" June '09(Blu-Ray) vs. Evan Bourne - The fans were split between these two as this was a very fast paced match that had a mix of both high flying & grounded wrestling from both men. Bourne early on showed great athleticism as he did a standing vertical leap that was high enough to deliever a frankensteiner onto Jericho who was sitting on the top rope while later doing a move that Jericho was able to counter into the Walls Of Jericho in one quick motion & Bourne doing Air Bourne but landing on his feet right into a codebreaker. Personally, this was my favorite match of the night as I felt these two stole the show.Fatal 4 Way '10(Blu-Ray) vs. C.M. Punk - Punk's first appearance since RAW two weeks after WrestleMania as both men stated grounding each other early with Jericho starting to gain an advantage before Punk was able counter his springboard dropkick to gain the advantage working over Jericho's arm with a keylock as Jericho picked up the pace with a double axe handle & bulldog. Both men from here started to trade momentum with countering each other's offense such a lionsault into a swinging neckbreaker only for the lionsault to be executed after countering a bulldog, the Walls Of Jericho reversed into the Anaconda Vice but Jericho eventually applying the hold after countering the GTS while both men just went back & forth with their offense like Punk's Savage elbow & GTS along with Jericho catching Punk in mid-air while Paul Heyman made his presence known at one point only for it to distract both men. This match was the high quality that's expected & deliver from both men against each other.Payback '13I already have my summary earlier so it's not a perfect collection but still quality that I would recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPYDUVG4GA1RR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUKZQTE#wasThisHelpful","RPYDUVG4GA1RR","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Never before in history had individuals who made a name for themselves on the independent wrestling scene came through the WWE developmental territory living up to their hype only from there only to have such an impactful debut & build from there not only defeating but also taking out some of the biggest superstars & legends in WWE history to the point where they were either involved or main eventing PPV's both as a group & individuals as ""the Hounds Of Justice"" themselves in Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns also known as The Shield.  Now this was a unique presentation from WWE as the documentary portion was originally aired as a special presentation for the WWE Network only for it to now be released onto DVD with additional comments & footage (similar to a ""Director's Cut"" version of a movie) as the documentary featured comments from The Shield members themselves along with other personalities such as Paul Heyman, John Cena, Triple H, Daniel Bryan, Michael Hayes, Cesaro, Sami Zayn (formerly El Generico), former ROH employee & DragonGate founder Gabe Sapolsky, wrestling trainer & promoter Les Thatcher, Drake Wuertz (formerly Drake Younger), The Usos, John Laurinaitis, Billy Gunn, Terry Taylor, Bill DeMott, and William Regal.Normally I give my summary at the end of the review but I'll just give it now in that the positives for this set are that they gave a slightly different presentation than the one already available on the WWE Network by adding more chapters & comments & using some different footage than before while WWE continued the trend of expanding outside of their ""universe"" to get additional footage & comments from those currently involved in other promotions (ROH/CZW/DragonGate) along with their own archives as this is the first time I can recall matches & footage from their FCW developmental & current version of the NXT brand used on a DVD presentation.  The only things negative I can say about the match selection is that I would have loved to see the six man tag with Orton & Kane & Bryan actually giving The Shield their first loss as a Blu-Ray replacement for the Payback tag match later in the week while I wish they didn't edited the finish of the Regal vs. Ambrose match or at the very least switch the camera angle so it wouldn't have been as noticeable but past that I have no complaints.The documentary begins with various superstars describing what they think The Shield was & what each member brought to the group before going into each members beginnings from Seth Rollins' going from a backyard wrestler to Ring Of Honor & what went wrong there causing him to just say ""I'm going to WWE"" before talking about Dean Ambrose's training & work in both CZW & DragonGate along with his one specific talent that got him noticed by a specific WWE producer followed by Roman Reigns' background as far as his family lineage in wrestling to the point where he played high school football with two current WWE superstars & why ultimately his football career didn't work out in the end.  The instant chemistry & attention the Ambrose vs. Rollins rivalry in FCW was discussed next before going into each man's time in NXT from how Seth was the face of the new NXT brand but running into problems backstage to the point where he was almost fired & Roman's learning ability along with the frustration Dean was having including what went wrong with a planned feud he was scheduled to have with a Hall Of Famer.  The documentary continued talking about all three men forming The Shield & their immediate impact from their first appearance & debut match to the different top names & importance of the championships they held to each member before going into other important landmarks of the group such as their first Survivor Series & Royal Rumble matches along with the feud with Evolution followed by the reasoning behind the breakup to the group.  Each man's journey to SummerSlam was the focus for the rest of documentary discussing next along with what each superstar brings to the table as an individuals, each man's different training methods, analyzing their matches with one man saying about the Rollins vs. Randy Orton match, ""Orton made his name being a legend killer but now Orton's the legend & Reigns is the killer"", and following each man before & behind the scenes & after their matches with one superstar discussing the Rollins vs. Ambrose saying ""what's the last thing they'd expect"" in a lumberjack match before concluding on what's in the future for each man with one member saying it perfectly, ""friends or enemies, we're going to own the business.""Matches Include (with a member of The Shield give a brief commentary about the upcoming match):FCW 15 Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - It should be noted that the FCW 15 title were matches contested under ""ironman rules"" where the winner with the most falls within the 15 minute time limit was the winner while it was also pointed out on commentary that this was their first ever meeting.  They started out back & forth in the early moments with both men being very evenly matches as neither man had an advantage for very long as Seth resorted to his high flying style with offense coming off the top over over the top rope or a springboard position while Dean used his unorthodox methods of strikes along with strategy such as clawing & scratching at his back as both men continued to trade momentum down to the last second with the final statement left by one competitor ensured this was only the beginning.""FCW"" Aug. '11FCW 15 Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - This was the third match in their trilogy over the championship with the time limit being increased to 30 minutes while it should be noted that FCW Champion Bo Rotundo & Aksana & FCW General Manager Maxine were setting at ringside to watch this match.  Both them wrestled a very technical styles starting out while exchanging chops & forearms as they were evenly matched before one man decided to use the strategy of ""sacrificing"" to get the advantage as they continued to trade momentum as both men continued to deliver offense that not only hurt their opponents but themselves in the process as well while countering & reversing whatever their opponent gave them to where they literally wrestled into exhaustion in a wrestling clinic that ultimately came down to ""sudden death"" to the point where everyone from the fans to talents at ringside to even the announcers gave both men a standing ovation.""FCW"" Sept. '11Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins vs. Leakee - It should be noted how Ambrose gave William Regal at the commentary booth an acknowledgment before the match as Leakee was the odd man out in the beginning being singled out & worked over by both men only to showcase his superior strength taking down both men together causing Seth & Dean to form an unlikely alliance to keep Leakee down & out of the match before it eventually broke back down to being every man for himself with one man being able to execute a move on one opponent them immediately hitting another the other or avoiding one's move then hitting their own on the other or just taking out both opponents at once in what was a great match telling a good story.""FCW"" Feb. '12Dean Ambrose vs. William Regal - This was a year in the making after Regal dislocated Ambrose's arm a year earlier which Regal targeted right away with various stretches & twist while along with moves such as the keylock & repeatably dropping his weight on it as both men played mind games with each other as Regal kept allowing Dean to get to his feet only for him to respond ""you better take this arm home with you!"" which resulted in the intensity being heavily picked up with both men using the ringside environment to their advantage to focus & repeatably pound on a certain part of the body to the point where one man was so heavily effected by it that the trainer had to get involved to see if a participant could continue only for his response to signal his opponent to put him out of his misery in what was a great physical match based off not only the storytelling but an aftermath that resulted in the entire staff having to get involved in this situation.As a side note, the match is edited to go to black & white instead of color towards the end due to the amount of blood.""FCW"" July '12NXT Championship Match: Seth Rollins vs. Jinder Mahal - This was the finals of the Gold Rush tournament to determine the first NXT Champion as Seth controlled Jinder early with wrestling & using his own momentum against him causing Jinder to resort to dirty tactics & taking advantage of the ringside environment allowing him to heavily ground Seth heavily working over his lower back to the point where Seth showed signs of it even when performing his own offense as they traded momentum with Jinder continuing to focus on Seth's weakened back while Seth resorted to his high flying offense from the top rope & springboard positions resulting in a competitive match & definitely the best Jinder Mahal performance you'll ever see on DVD.""NXT"" Aug. '12Roman Reigns vs. CJ Parker - This was debut of Leakee under the name ""Roman Reigns"" for where showcased dominance easily overpowering Parker & catching him in mid-air at one point while also heavily working over a body part throughout the match.""NXT"" Oct. '12T.L.C. Match: The Shield vs. Ryback & Team Hell No - This was the first T.L.C. match (but not the first ladder match) where you can win by pinfall & submission and you saw exactly how this match was going to go when all the teams started brawling on the floor the moment The Shield made their way to ringside. There were plenty of hard hits & falls as expected in this type of match like one man sandwitched in between a ladder with a chair striking it, a DDT on a chair, a double suplex onto a ladder, a powerbomb through a table, a double suplex from a table setup on the top turnbuckle & Kane's top rope clothesline from that same table that turned one of The Shield inside out, a spear through the barricade before being buried underneath everything in sight, Daniel Bryan doing a ""NO Lock"" to everyone in sight, a curb stomp onto an open chair, and a dangerous fall off a ladder through tables. This was definitely a highlight performance for everyone involved as Kane & Ryback were made to look like monsters, Daniel Bryan came off like a little pitbull who kept bringing the fight, and The Shield looked like a tight unit who kept using the strategy of trying to single out one person for double & triple teaming.T.L.C. '12[Blu-Ray Edition of Wrestling's Greatest Factions]Dean Ambrose vs. United States Champion Kofi Kingston - Reigns & Rollins didn't accompany Ambrose to ringside making this match truly one on one as Kofi started out with his typical face paced offense of some high flying moves mixed with various kicks while Dean implied more of a grounded & slower pace with moves such as an impactful clothesline & crossface chicken wing plus showing that he's scouted Kofi at one point backing away from the Trouble In Paradise before both men hit some big moves like the S.O.S., double arm suplex, springboard crossbody, a Trouble In Paradise that knocked Dean to the outside, and one hell of a face plant. Solid match.Extreme Rules '13Tornado Match: Roman Reigns & Seth Rollins vs. Tag Team Champions Team Hell No - Tornado Tag rules are simply that everyone in the match is legally allowed in the ring at the same time & The Shield was represented by Seth Rollins & Roman Reigns as Dean Ambrose already wrestled earlier in the night. Bryan & Kane came out strong with Kane hitting a running DDT & Bryan holding Rollins in a surfboard setup for Kane to score a low dropkick but The Shield stuck to what kept working for them in the past using their numbers game by double teaming one individual at a time by beating them down in the corner but offensive moves such as a double suplex before Hell No kept using their teamwork such as back to back top move maneuvers & Kane taking both men over the top rope so Bryan can deliver his suicide dive. This was another solid match.Extreme Rules '13WWE Tag Team Champions Seth Rollins & Roman Reigns vs. The Usos - The Usos took control early relying on their fast pace double teaming offense keeping one member away from his partner not allowing The Shield to build any momentum at all before The Sheild was able to rebound by grounding their opponents slowing the pace down & using The Usos own strategy of isolating their partner & double teaming against them as both teams traded momentum pulling off their signature offensive throughout the match from The Usos high flying to The Shield's hard hitting impactful moves.Money In The Bank Kickoff Show '13Elimination Match: The Shield & Real Americans vs. The Usos, Rhodes Brothers, Rey Mysterio - A traditional elimination match here with four of the top established tag teams & the return of Rey Mysterio that had various highlights such as pre-match twerking (yes, you read that right), how one participant ""talked himself out of the match"", back to back giant swings, the teamwork between all the team members, and one of the most dominate single performances in Survivor Series history. This was a fun opening match.Survivor Series '13The Shield vs. The Wyatt Family - Both teams had the same strategy in the beginning in that they isolated one member of the group working him over in their corner with their teammates making quick tags & having no problem taking their shots in on the apron with members of each team delivering offense that we haven't seen from them previously such as Luke Harper's dropkick & suicide dive along with Seth Rollings series of aerial offense that made the commentators compare him to Spiderman before things eventually did break down in the all out brawl between all six men that went not just in & outside of the ring but throughout the crowd as well that resulted in participants in the match being taken out one by one allowing the numbers game to take effect. This turned out to be the intense fight you was expecting with Jerry Lawler describing it best saying ""what a battle"" with the crowd being hot for this with duel chants for both teams & ""This Is Awesome!"" before they touched along with this match causing one of the funniest Twitter trends in WWE history.Elimination Chamber '14No Holds Barred/Elimination Match: The Shield vs. Evolution - Before I get started, apparently ""Bluetista"" didn't get the memo on what to wear for this match as he stuck out like a bodybuilding smurf leading to the funniest WWE related trend I've ever seen on Twitter. This started right off the bat as a war with all six men fighting throughout the crowd & ringside area all the way to the stage before the action finally settled into the ring with each team having the same strategy of working over a member of the other team in their half of the ring either individually or through double & triple teaming with frequent tags with the action eventually breaking down once again into a huge brawl going all over the building with one man getting knocked out with what looked like a metal sheet while another body went through the spanish announce table to bodies were flying out of what seemed like nowhere including the top of the titantron along with bodies being punished with various weapons from chairs to kendo sticks. While the other matches on the card I described as physical or a brawl, this was both of those descriptions as both teams were evenly matched throughout the contest making this match & entire feud up to this point come off as an all-out war between both teams with the factor of when the eliminations happened along with who was & wasn't eliminated I didn't expect.Payback '14Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Rob Van Dam vs. Jack Swagger - It should be noted that Bad News Barrett was injured earlier in the week eliminating him from this match as this match was full of various highlights including Ambrose staying true to his word targeting Rollins right away fighting into the timekeepers area, the unique way Kofi caught himself falling off the ladder, ladder used as a weapon, superstars sacrificing themselves to hurt the other, one man getting taken out due to injury only to return later, one man backdropped onto a scaffold ladder, a chair coming into play, signature moves executed using the ladder, and ""there's always a Plan B."" This was one of those ladder matches that had tons of hard work & crazy spots where everyone has having their moment to shine with my opinion being Jack Swagger being the M.V.P. of the match getting without a doubt his strongest singles performance in almost a year.Money In The Bank '14Lumberjack Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins - Dean dominated early punishing & torturing Rollins while taking advantage of the lumberjacks on the outside tossing Seth to them more than once before Seth attempted to use the lumberjacks the same way only for Dean to react differently having no issues fighting back with the lumberjacks as both men traded momentum in the ring before the action went to the outside with both men fighting the lumberjacks to either get to or away from their opponent with the action spilling out throughout the crowd with the lumberjacks eventually having to physically carry to men back to the ring with the action just being unable to be contained between the two legal men in the match. J.B.L. pretty much said it best, ""this was the wildest most chaotic lumberjack match in history.""SummerSlam '14Roman Reigns vs. Randy Orton - Reigns went after Orton right away with punches & headbutts taking the match to the outside where Orton was able to reverse the momentum in his favor slowing down the pace working him over with offense such as the garvin stomp & a superplex with both men going back & forth as Orton used the ringside environment on his advantage while Reigns kept fighting with his trademark apron dropkick & superman punch as they continued to counter each other's signature moves while executing their own in a great match.SummerSlam '14Falls Count Anywhere Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins - Both former Shield members started trading blows against each other in the ring right away & continued throughout the crowd onto the stage area before making their way back into the ring where both men found creative ways to use a chair against each other along with other weapons such as a kendo stick as they were able to counter each other's signature moves while continuing to just beat the hell out of each other including sacrificing themselves just to hurt their opponent to the point where the only way this match stopped was that one man had to take it too far to ensure the other guy wouldn't get back up.""RAW"" Aug. '14[Best Of RAW & SmackDown 2014]Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins - They were already scheduled to go at the Night Of Champions PPV later in the week but couldn't wait as Reigns was in control early tossing Seth around & beating him down in the ring & around ringside including sending him clear over the announce table at one point before Seth was able to find an opening keeping him grounded while executing his own such as the suicide dive as both men traded momentum showing how well they know each other by countering & avoided each other's signature offense as it just came down to one man being able to catch the other.""RAW"" Sept. '14(Blu-Ray) FCW 15 Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - This was a rematch from their first encounter with the time limit increased to 20 minutes with Seth showing that this was more personal than before by fighting before the bell & brawling around ringside including using the steps while Seth did a much more technical approach with various submission moves while adding his own twist to it such as rubbing his forearm across the face or bridging his body as they continued to go back & forth to the point where the ring just couldn't contain these two as they beat on each other until neither man had nothing left with William Regal on commentary after the match challenging not just those in FCW but on the main roster of WWE to step their game up because these two just ""raised the bar"".""FCW"" Aug. '11(Blu-Ray) Dean Ambrose vs. Undertaker - This was Undertaker's first match on SmackDown in 3 years but was outnumbered from the rest of the members of The Shield at ringside which caused a distraction right from the start allowing Dean to get some punches in before Taker retaliated with his series of strikes as they traded momentum with both men trading punches throughout the match with both men with each man executing offense such as the legdrop on the apron & DDT as the bigger story of this match was the aftermath that resembles the phrase ""you won the battle but lost the war.""""SmackDown"" Apr. '13(Blu-Ray) WWE Tag Team Champions Roman Reigns & Seth Rollins vs. Randy Orton & Daniel Bryan - The Shield used the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" as they worked over each man individually by double teaming in the corner & keeping them grounded while taunting their partner allowing them to distract the referee before Orton started to fight back suplexing one into the other in the corner while Bryan attacked both men over with dropkicks & a suicide dive that hit Orton as well while later Orton went for the RKO only to collide into Bryan & later shove him into a spear from Reigns. This tag match wasn't much past continuing the build the issues for weeks between Orton & Bryan while also still playing off the fact that The Shield wrestle as a team while their opponents wrestle as individuals.Payback '13(Blu-Ray) Royal Rumble Battle Royal - Various moments include two previous World Champions from another ""honorable"" company starting out, the various surprise entrants including one man making his debut from NXT, Kofi Kingston making his yearly Rumble elimination highlight reel, Zeb Colter's signs depending on your sense of humor, the Cesaro Swings, who really believed in The Shield?, a new record broken after over a decade, the crowds response to one man being excluded from the match, the reaction that couldn't be denied at the end no matter how high they tried to drown it out with theme music and as of right now (a week & a half later after the event) what looks like to be the final performance of one of the biggest stars in recent years. It was your typical Rumble match that had it's entertaining & shocking (good & bad) moments.Royal Rumble '14Blu-Ray extras include additional discussions about the Dean Ambrose vs. William Regal rivalry & Roman Reign's character ""Leakee.""  I already stated my positives & negatives but this was without a doubt the strongest faction in the past few years in the WWE with each man moving on to become a superstar in their own right currently in WWE with the matches from their FCW developmental territory being lost gems or maybe even go as far as a ""lost classics"" so it's set I would definitely recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KX8IT9LJBQK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7SF0RW#wasThisHelpful","R3KX8IT9LJBQK7","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Never before in history had individuals who made a name for themselves on the independent wrestling scene came through the WWE developmental territory living up to their hype only from there only to have such an impactful debut & build from there not only defeating but also taking out some of the biggest superstars & legends in WWE history to the point where they were either involved or main eventing PPV's both as a group & individuals as ""the Hounds Of Justice"" themselves in Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns also known as The Shield.  Now this was a unique presentation from WWE as the documentary portion was originally aired as a special presentation for the WWE Network only for it to now be released onto DVD with additional comments & footage (similar to a ""Director's Cut"" version of a movie) as the documentary featured comments from The Shield members themselves along with other personalities such as Paul Heyman, John Cena, Triple H, Daniel Bryan, Michael Hayes, Cesaro, Sami Zayn (formerly El Generico), former ROH employee & DragonGate founder Gabe Sapolsky, wrestling trainer & promoter Les Thatcher, Drake Wuertz (formerly Drake Younger), The Usos, John Laurinaitis, Billy Gunn, Terry Taylor, Bill DeMott, and William Regal.Normally I give my summary at the end of the review but I'll just give it now in that the positives for this set are that they gave a slightly different presentation than the one already available on the WWE Network by adding more chapters & comments & using some different footage than before while WWE continued the trend of expanding outside of their ""universe"" to get additional footage & comments from those currently involved in other promotions (ROH/CZW/DragonGate) along with their own archives as this is the first time I can recall matches & footage from their FCW developmental & current version of the NXT brand used on a DVD presentation.  The only things negative I can say about the match selection is that I would have loved to see the six man tag with Orton & Kane & Bryan actually giving The Shield their first loss as a Blu-Ray replacement for the Payback tag match later in the week while I wish they didn't edited the finish of the Regal vs. Ambrose match or at the very least switch the camera angle so it wouldn't have been as noticeable but past that I have no complaints.The documentary begins with various superstars describing what they think The Shield was & what each member brought to the group before going into each members beginnings from Seth Rollins' going from a backyard wrestler to Ring Of Honor & what went wrong there causing him to just say ""I'm going to WWE"" before talking about Dean Ambrose's training & work in both CZW & DragonGate along with his one specific talent that got him noticed by a specific WWE producer followed by Roman Reigns' background as far as his family lineage in wrestling to the point where he played high school football with two current WWE superstars & why ultimately his football career didn't work out in the end.  The instant chemistry & attention the Ambrose vs. Rollins rivalry in FCW was discussed next before going into each man's time in NXT from how Seth was the face of the new NXT brand but running into problems backstage to the point where he was almost fired & Roman's learning ability along with the frustration Dean was having including what went wrong with a planned feud he was scheduled to have with a Hall Of Famer.  The documentary continued talking about all three men forming The Shield & their immediate impact from their first appearance & debut match to the different top names & importance of the championships they held to each member before going into other important landmarks of the group such as their first Survivor Series & Royal Rumble matches along with the feud with Evolution followed by the reasoning behind the breakup to the group.  Each man's journey to SummerSlam was the focus for the rest of documentary discussing next along with what each superstar brings to the table as an individuals, each man's different training methods, analyzing their matches with one man saying about the Rollins vs. Randy Orton match, ""Orton made his name being a legend killer but now Orton's the legend & Reigns is the killer"", and following each man before & behind the scenes & after their matches with one superstar discussing the Rollins vs. Ambrose saying ""what's the last thing they'd expect"" in a lumberjack match before concluding on what's in the future for each man with one member saying it perfectly, ""friends or enemies, we're going to own the business.""Matches Include (with a member of The Shield give a brief commentary about the upcoming match):FCW 15 Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - It should be noted that the FCW 15 title were matches contested under ""ironman rules"" where the winner with the most falls within the 15 minute time limit was the winner while it was also pointed out on commentary that this was their first ever meeting.  They started out back & forth in the early moments with both men being very evenly matches as neither man had an advantage for very long as Seth resorted to his high flying style with offense coming off the top over over the top rope or a springboard position while Dean used his unorthodox methods of strikes along with strategy such as clawing & scratching at his back as both men continued to trade momentum down to the last second with the final statement left by one competitor ensured this was only the beginning.""FCW"" Aug. '11FCW 15 Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - This was the third match in their trilogy over the championship with the time limit being increased to 30 minutes while it should be noted that FCW Champion Bo Rotundo & Aksana & FCW General Manager Maxine were setting at ringside to watch this match.  Both them wrestled a very technical styles starting out while exchanging chops & forearms as they were evenly matched before one man decided to use the strategy of ""sacrificing"" to get the advantage as they continued to trade momentum as both men continued to deliver offense that not only hurt their opponents but themselves in the process as well while countering & reversing whatever their opponent gave them to where they literally wrestled into exhaustion in a wrestling clinic that ultimately came down to ""sudden death"" to the point where everyone from the fans to talents at ringside to even the announcers gave both men a standing ovation.""FCW"" Sept. '11Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins vs. Leakee - It should be noted how Ambrose gave William Regal at the commentary booth an acknowledgment before the match as Leakee was the odd man out in the beginning being singled out & worked over by both men only to showcase his superior strength taking down both men together causing Seth & Dean to form an unlikely alliance to keep Leakee down & out of the match before it eventually broke back down to being every man for himself with one man being able to execute a move on one opponent them immediately hitting another the other or avoiding one's move then hitting their own on the other or just taking out both opponents at once in what was a great match telling a good story.""FCW"" Feb. '12Dean Ambrose vs. William Regal - This was a year in the making after Regal dislocated Ambrose's arm a year earlier which Regal targeted right away with various stretches & twist while along with moves such as the keylock & repeatably dropping his weight on it as both men played mind games with each other as Regal kept allowing Dean to get to his feet only for him to respond ""you better take this arm home with you!"" which resulted in the intensity being heavily picked up with both men using the ringside environment to their advantage to focus & repeatably pound on a certain part of the body to the point where one man was so heavily effected by it that the trainer had to get involved to see if a participant could continue only for his response to signal his opponent to put him out of his misery in what was a great physical match based off not only the storytelling but an aftermath that resulted in the entire staff having to get involved in this situation.As a side note, the match is edited to go to black & white instead of color towards the end due to the amount of blood.""FCW"" July '12NXT Championship Match: Seth Rollins vs. Jinder Mahal - This was the finals of the Gold Rush tournament to determine the first NXT Champion as Seth controlled Jinder early with wrestling & using his own momentum against him causing Jinder to resort to dirty tactics & taking advantage of the ringside environment allowing him to heavily ground Seth heavily working over his lower back to the point where Seth showed signs of it even when performing his own offense as they traded momentum with Jinder continuing to focus on Seth's weakened back while Seth resorted to his high flying offense from the top rope & springboard positions resulting in a competitive match & definitely the best Jinder Mahal performance you'll ever see on DVD.""NXT"" Aug. '12Roman Reigns vs. CJ Parker - This was debut of Leakee under the name ""Roman Reigns"" for where showcased dominance easily overpowering Parker & catching him in mid-air at one point while also heavily working over a body part throughout the match.""NXT"" Oct. '12T.L.C. Match: The Shield vs. Ryback & Team Hell No - This was the first T.L.C. match (but not the first ladder match) where you can win by pinfall & submission and you saw exactly how this match was going to go when all the teams started brawling on the floor the moment The Shield made their way to ringside. There were plenty of hard hits & falls as expected in this type of match like one man sandwitched in between a ladder with a chair striking it, a DDT on a chair, a double suplex onto a ladder, a powerbomb through a table, a double suplex from a table setup on the top turnbuckle & Kane's top rope clothesline from that same table that turned one of The Shield inside out, a spear through the barricade before being buried underneath everything in sight, Daniel Bryan doing a ""NO Lock"" to everyone in sight, a curb stomp onto an open chair, and a dangerous fall off a ladder through tables. This was definitely a highlight performance for everyone involved as Kane & Ryback were made to look like monsters, Daniel Bryan came off like a little pitbull who kept bringing the fight, and The Shield looked like a tight unit who kept using the strategy of trying to single out one person for double & triple teaming.T.L.C. '12[Blu-Ray Edition of Wrestling's Greatest Factions]Dean Ambrose vs. United States Champion Kofi Kingston - Reigns & Rollins didn't accompany Ambrose to ringside making this match truly one on one as Kofi started out with his typical face paced offense of some high flying moves mixed with various kicks while Dean implied more of a grounded & slower pace with moves such as an impactful clothesline & crossface chicken wing plus showing that he's scouted Kofi at one point backing away from the Trouble In Paradise before both men hit some big moves like the S.O.S., double arm suplex, springboard crossbody, a Trouble In Paradise that knocked Dean to the outside, and one hell of a face plant. Solid match.Extreme Rules '13Tornado Match: Roman Reigns & Seth Rollins vs. Tag Team Champions Team Hell No - Tornado Tag rules are simply that everyone in the match is legally allowed in the ring at the same time & The Shield was represented by Seth Rollins & Roman Reigns as Dean Ambrose already wrestled earlier in the night. Bryan & Kane came out strong with Kane hitting a running DDT & Bryan holding Rollins in a surfboard setup for Kane to score a low dropkick but The Shield stuck to what kept working for them in the past using their numbers game by double teaming one individual at a time by beating them down in the corner but offensive moves such as a double suplex before Hell No kept using their teamwork such as back to back top move maneuvers & Kane taking both men over the top rope so Bryan can deliver his suicide dive. This was another solid match.Extreme Rules '13WWE Tag Team Champions Seth Rollins & Roman Reigns vs. The Usos - The Usos took control early relying on their fast pace double teaming offense keeping one member away from his partner not allowing The Shield to build any momentum at all before The Sheild was able to rebound by grounding their opponents slowing the pace down & using The Usos own strategy of isolating their partner & double teaming against them as both teams traded momentum pulling off their signature offensive throughout the match from The Usos high flying to The Shield's hard hitting impactful moves.Money In The Bank Kickoff Show '13Elimination Match: The Shield & Real Americans vs. The Usos, Rhodes Brothers, Rey Mysterio - A traditional elimination match here with four of the top established tag teams & the return of Rey Mysterio that had various highlights such as pre-match twerking (yes, you read that right), how one participant ""talked himself out of the match"", back to back giant swings, the teamwork between all the team members, and one of the most dominate single performances in Survivor Series history. This was a fun opening match.Survivor Series '13The Shield vs. The Wyatt Family - Both teams had the same strategy in the beginning in that they isolated one member of the group working him over in their corner with their teammates making quick tags & having no problem taking their shots in on the apron with members of each team delivering offense that we haven't seen from them previously such as Luke Harper's dropkick & suicide dive along with Seth Rollings series of aerial offense that made the commentators compare him to Spiderman before things eventually did break down in the all out brawl between all six men that went not just in & outside of the ring but throughout the crowd as well that resulted in participants in the match being taken out one by one allowing the numbers game to take effect. This turned out to be the intense fight you was expecting with Jerry Lawler describing it best saying ""what a battle"" with the crowd being hot for this with duel chants for both teams & ""This Is Awesome!"" before they touched along with this match causing one of the funniest Twitter trends in WWE history.Elimination Chamber '14No Holds Barred/Elimination Match: The Shield vs. Evolution - Before I get started, apparently ""Bluetista"" didn't get the memo on what to wear for this match as he stuck out like a bodybuilding smurf leading to the funniest WWE related trend I've ever seen on Twitter. This started right off the bat as a war with all six men fighting throughout the crowd & ringside area all the way to the stage before the action finally settled into the ring with each team having the same strategy of working over a member of the other team in their half of the ring either individually or through double & triple teaming with frequent tags with the action eventually breaking down once again into a huge brawl going all over the building with one man getting knocked out with what looked like a metal sheet while another body went through the spanish announce table to bodies were flying out of what seemed like nowhere including the top of the titantron along with bodies being punished with various weapons from chairs to kendo sticks. While the other matches on the card I described as physical or a brawl, this was both of those descriptions as both teams were evenly matched throughout the contest making this match & entire feud up to this point come off as an all-out war between both teams with the factor of when the eliminations happened along with who was & wasn't eliminated I didn't expect.Payback '14Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Rob Van Dam vs. Jack Swagger - It should be noted that Bad News Barrett was injured earlier in the week eliminating him from this match as this match was full of various highlights including Ambrose staying true to his word targeting Rollins right away fighting into the timekeepers area, the unique way Kofi caught himself falling off the ladder, ladder used as a weapon, superstars sacrificing themselves to hurt the other, one man getting taken out due to injury only to return later, one man backdropped onto a scaffold ladder, a chair coming into play, signature moves executed using the ladder, and ""there's always a Plan B."" This was one of those ladder matches that had tons of hard work & crazy spots where everyone has having their moment to shine with my opinion being Jack Swagger being the M.V.P. of the match getting without a doubt his strongest singles performance in almost a year.Money In The Bank '14Lumberjack Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins - Dean dominated early punishing & torturing Rollins while taking advantage of the lumberjacks on the outside tossing Seth to them more than once before Seth attempted to use the lumberjacks the same way only for Dean to react differently having no issues fighting back with the lumberjacks as both men traded momentum in the ring before the action went to the outside with both men fighting the lumberjacks to either get to or away from their opponent with the action spilling out throughout the crowd with the lumberjacks eventually having to physically carry to men back to the ring with the action just being unable to be contained between the two legal men in the match. J.B.L. pretty much said it best, ""this was the wildest most chaotic lumberjack match in history.""SummerSlam '14Roman Reigns vs. Randy Orton - Reigns went after Orton right away with punches & headbutts taking the match to the outside where Orton was able to reverse the momentum in his favor slowing down the pace working him over with offense such as the garvin stomp & a superplex with both men going back & forth as Orton used the ringside environment on his advantage while Reigns kept fighting with his trademark apron dropkick & superman punch as they continued to counter each other's signature moves while executing their own in a great match.SummerSlam '14Falls Count Anywhere Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins - Both former Shield members started trading blows against each other in the ring right away & continued throughout the crowd onto the stage area before making their way back into the ring where both men found creative ways to use a chair against each other along with other weapons such as a kendo stick as they were able to counter each other's signature moves while continuing to just beat the hell out of each other including sacrificing themselves just to hurt their opponent to the point where the only way this match stopped was that one man had to take it too far to ensure the other guy wouldn't get back up.""RAW"" Aug. '14[Best Of RAW & SmackDown 2014]Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins - They were already scheduled to go at the Night Of Champions PPV later in the week but couldn't wait as Reigns was in control early tossing Seth around & beating him down in the ring & around ringside including sending him clear over the announce table at one point before Seth was able to find an opening keeping him grounded while executing his own such as the suicide dive as both men traded momentum showing how well they know each other by countering & avoided each other's signature offense as it just came down to one man being able to catch the other.""RAW"" Sept. '14(Blu-Ray) FCW 15 Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - This was a rematch from their first encounter with the time limit increased to 20 minutes with Seth showing that this was more personal than before by fighting before the bell & brawling around ringside including using the steps while Seth did a much more technical approach with various submission moves while adding his own twist to it such as rubbing his forearm across the face or bridging his body as they continued to go back & forth to the point where the ring just couldn't contain these two as they beat on each other until neither man had nothing left with William Regal on commentary after the match challenging not just those in FCW but on the main roster of WWE to step their game up because these two just ""raised the bar"".""FCW"" Aug. '11(Blu-Ray) Dean Ambrose vs. Undertaker - This was Undertaker's first match on SmackDown in 3 years but was outnumbered from the rest of the members of The Shield at ringside which caused a distraction right from the start allowing Dean to get some punches in before Taker retaliated with his series of strikes as they traded momentum with both men trading punches throughout the match with both men with each man executing offense such as the legdrop on the apron & DDT as the bigger story of this match was the aftermath that resembles the phrase ""you won the battle but lost the war.""""SmackDown"" Apr. '13(Blu-Ray) WWE Tag Team Champions Roman Reigns & Seth Rollins vs. Randy Orton & Daniel Bryan - The Shield used the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" as they worked over each man individually by double teaming in the corner & keeping them grounded while taunting their partner allowing them to distract the referee before Orton started to fight back suplexing one into the other in the corner while Bryan attacked both men over with dropkicks & a suicide dive that hit Orton as well while later Orton went for the RKO only to collide into Bryan & later shove him into a spear from Reigns. This tag match wasn't much past continuing the build the issues for weeks between Orton & Bryan while also still playing off the fact that The Shield wrestle as a team while their opponents wrestle as individuals.Payback '13(Blu-Ray) Royal Rumble Battle Royal - Various moments include two previous World Champions from another ""honorable"" company starting out, the various surprise entrants including one man making his debut from NXT, Kofi Kingston making his yearly Rumble elimination highlight reel, Zeb Colter's signs depending on your sense of humor, the Cesaro Swings, who really believed in The Shield?, a new record broken after over a decade, the crowds response to one man being excluded from the match, the reaction that couldn't be denied at the end no matter how high they tried to drown it out with theme music and as of right now (a week & a half later after the event) what looks like to be the final performance of one of the biggest stars in recent years. It was your typical Rumble match that had it's entertaining & shocking (good & bad) moments.Royal Rumble '14Blu-Ray extras include additional discussions about the Dean Ambrose vs. William Regal rivalry & Roman Reign's character ""Leakee.""  I already stated my positives & negatives but this was without a doubt the strongest faction in the past few years in the WWE with each man moving on to become a superstar in their own right currently in WWE with the matches from their FCW developmental territory being lost gems or maybe even go as far as a ""lost classics"" so it's set I would definitely recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RIZ74AXR7UMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7SBAVW#wasThisHelpful","R3RIZ74AXR7UMQ","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, Combat Zone Wrestling, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood.P.W.G. Champion Kyle O'Reilly's scheduled title defense was against the B.O.L.A. '14 champion Ricochet cashing in his title match in a match with both men having different styles as Kyle was more mat based submission wrestling while Ricochet was more athletic with some high flying in a competitive match that also saw both men playing mind games with each other from getting ""sleazy"" to delivering some ""electrifying"" moves ""outta nowhere.""  The biggest story of the night happened after that match when Roderick Strong attacked Kyle leading to them competing in a ""Guerrilla Warfare"" match for the P.W.G. Championship that saw both men use weapons such as a trash can & both men going through a table together at one point while completely destroying a heavy amount of chairs by either forcefully putting their opponents head or body through it along with choking each other with anything they could get their hands on including a chain & taking apart the ring ropes as this was a physical fight that kept going on until one man's body just couldn't take it anymore.  Chris Sabin & Matt Sydal faced off against Young Bucks was an evenly matched contest as both team had similar strategy against each other not only on the mat but in the air while Sabin & Sydal had natural chemistry for what I think was their first time teaming together with each team having unique double teaming tactics.  Other matches include P.W.G. Tag Team Champions World's Cutiest Tag Team (Joey Ryan & Candice LaRae) defended their belts against The Addiction (Frankie Kazarian & Christopher Daniels) in a match that went back & forth that had it's comedic moments such as how a blowpop ended up being the one foreign object that everyone was more scared of as the match went on, a fatal four way between Biff Busick vs. Brian Cage vs. Tomasso Ciampa vs. Uhaa Nation in a non-stop action match with one move after another that not only saw a 619 to three men at once (with neither guy being the size of Rey Mysterio) but also enough suplexes between all four during the match that would make Brock Lesnar lose count, Chris Hero vs. Trevor Lee who was an underdog here fighting from behind as Hero attacked before the bell & didn't let up throughout the match including a counter to the frog splash that I've never seen before, Adam Cole had a shoulder injury he suffered a week earlier but put off surgery to face ACH...I mean Cedric Alexander (watch the match to get the joke), and ACH & A.R. Fox & Rich Swann vs. Bobby Fish & Johnny Gargano & Chuck Taylor that was full of Christmas spirit from ""Ho Ho ACH"" to Chuck Taylor being ""Mr. Grinch"" with some comedic moments including how a regular wastelock turned into a very ackward worm.Nine times out of ten, you can't go wrong with a P.W.G. show & this was no different as it was a very solid & entertaining show but I was only a small step below their usual performances but definately a better improvement than their previous ""Untitled II"" show with the story of the night being Kyle O'Reilly wrestling two different matches against two competitors back to back with two completely different styles for close to an hour so I recommend checking this out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WBKUMLDB6LU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCGHMDM#wasThisHelpful","R2WBKUMLDB6LU2","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based off their Mattel toy collection of the same name, WWE has produced a short cartoon series called ""Slam City.""  The concept of this series is that a man named The Finisher has taken control of WWE from Mr. McMahon & fired all of the WWE superstars in an effort to find the WWE Championship & declare himself champion forcing them to take regular jobs throughout Slam City including John Cena as a mechanic, Sheamus as a movie usher, Rey Mysterio as a crossing guard, Kane as a elementary school cafeteria cook, Randy Orton as a zookeeper, Alberto Del Rio as a coffee shop barista, Mark Henry as a mascot for a children's pizza place, and C.M. Punk as an ice cream man while other superstars such as Daniel Bryan, The Miz, Big Show, Brock Lesnar, Santino Marella, Damien Sandow, The Rock, and Stone Cold Steve Austin make appearances at their different jobs throughout the series.  The wrestlers maintain their regular personalities in their new jobs leading to various incidents throughout the series such as what happens when Big Show comes to John Cena because he's too big to fit into his car, how Alberto Del Rio makes Steve Austin's coffee ""stone cold"", Santino finds himself unemployed & tries to take more than one superstar's job, how Sheamus & Brock Lesnar end up stuck inside a movie, Rey Mysterio & Damien Sandow battle to save an old lady crossing the street, The Rock & Mark Henry battling over the last pizza only for it to be stolen, and Randy Orton's emergency call to capture a wild goat...Daniel Bryan.It should should be noted that the only negatives of this presentation are that Undertaker is on the cover but doesn't appear throughout the series & all 26 episodes are only around 2 minutes each making the entire presentation together last less than an hour.  This series isn't like the Hulk Hogan cartoon of the 1980's where it's the wrestlers in a realistic cartoon environment but more of WWE characters in a ""Looney Tunes"" type of setting using stop motion animation (with a behind the scenes look of this as a bonus feature) which is very evident in some episodes reusing some of the same classic cartoon gags but was very entertaining & appeals the child/family target audience as my youngest child who's never seen wrestling or know any of the real life characters was able to watch this & be entertained with laughter.  This is not a product for the traditional professional wrestling fans but that's not the demographic this release is targeting as it's definately something I would recommend for the younger fans who enjoy the characters featured or parents like myself to watch with their kids as I said again & can't emphasise enough, WWE superstars in a ""Looney Tunes"" cartoon environment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JETMQ6NZ6RU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7SLCHO#wasThisHelpful","R3JETMQ6NZ6RU8","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"New Age Outlaws vs. The Ascension - The Outlaws took the early control constantly taking their opponents off their feet before The Ascension cut the ring in half isolating one man away from his partner working him over with double teaming in a match that was very short but did it's job in giving The Ascension their first legitimate win against one of the legendary tag teams they've been referencing since their debut.WWE Tag Team Champions The Usos vs. The Miz & Damien Mizdow - Miz started out the match while Mizdow continued to copy everything he did to the crowds approval & The Usos having a chuckle at it resulting in The Miz continuing to tease but ultimately refusing to tag him in & only used him when as a human shield against The Usos trademark offense as this was pretty much the same match they've been having for the past few weeks (including the previous PPV) where the match was a background to the bigger story of Miz starting to resent Mizdow's popularity as this was a glorified handicap match.Natalya & Paige vs. Bella Twins - Natalya & Paige started out in control including some teamwork such as a double suplex while Natalya showcased her superior strength such lifting one of the Bella on her shoulders from a dead squat position while the Bellas used classic tag team wrestling tactics in keeping one member of the team away from her partner in their half of the ring while working her over as either individuals or together. I'll give the divas credit in that this match was given more time that you would normally get from a divas tag match (outside of NXT) but it was pretty flat & dry for the most part with some botched spots.WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena vs. Seth Rollins - It should be noted that the crowd was very creative with their John Cena chants during his entrance that gave me flashbacks to when Kurt Angle used to come to the ring. This match was filled with various highlights such as Brock german suplexing anything in sight repeatedly throughout the match weather it was each individual or two at the same time including the first two in the opening seconds or the one that had a nasty landing for one of the opponents, an unlikely alliance made to take out the biggest threat in the match, Seth's aerial assault that even at one point took out both opponents at the same time along with the amazing way he was eventually caught in mid-air & one move he did later on that I don't recall seeing from him in WWE, action spilling to the outside with the ringside environment coming into play including one move that finally eliminated one of the opponents for several minutes, and various counters & reversals to trademark offense. This was definitely the first ""match of the year"" candidate & match of the night.Royal Rumble Battle Royal - As usual, WWE put together a great ""by the numbers"" video package featuring facts & highlights from the previous Rumble matches but I have to give extra credit in that this was the best one yet as we got facts & figures that we've never gotten before along with J.B.L. continuing to give those extra facts that nobody thinks about (such as Albert/A-Train/Tensai being the most Royal Rumble matches without having one elimination). The various highlights include an ""extreme"" return to WWE after 10 years, the Wyatt Family reunion, ""the eater of worlds"" vs. ""the eater of worms"", one man domination in the match picking off opponents one at a time, another surprise return from a former World Champion that caused J.B.L. to reference yoga of all things, the traditional ""how Kofi Kingston avoided elimination"" spot, Miz & Mizdow, when it got down to the final four...or five?, and without a doubt the biggest moments that will be remembered were was the lack of ring time & elimination of one specific participant had that resulted in the crowd completely turning against this match & the eventual winner both in the arena & on social media to the point where the special surprise guest who appeared couldn't turn the crowd around. I actually enjoyed this match more than the previous years match but it was completely overshadowed by ""the movement"" making their voices heard for the second year in a row.(Pre-Show) New Day vs. Cesaro & Tyson Kidd - New Day combination here was Kofi & Big E with Xavier Woods on the outside while Kidd & Cesaro had Natalya & Adam Rose with his rosebuds in their corner as New Day showcased their trademark offense double team moves using Big E's strength & Kofi's athleticism including Kofi launched by Big E over Cesaro on the apron onto Kidd on the floor while Cesaro & Kidd used similar strategy to perform such moves as the giant swing into a low dropkick & superplex followed by a springboard elbow in what was actually the best match on the card outside of the main events as both teams evenly matched throughout the contest.This years event was a ""thumbs in the middle show"" as I enjoyed the Rumble match despite the fan outcry while the WWE Championship match stole the show but the rest of the card was easily forgettable to the point where I said that the pre-show match was the best match on the undercard.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJTP5VRM3S3IN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7SLCLA#wasThisHelpful","RJTP5VRM3S3IN","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It should be noted that the show started out with The Authority (HHH & Stephanie) & John Cena in the ring with Vince McMahon adding the special stipulation that if Team Authority loses then Cena would be the only man capable of reinstating their positions while Roman Reigns gave an interview later in the night updating everyone on his medical condition.Tag Team Champions Goldust & Stardust vs. The Usos vs. Los Matadores vs. The Miz & Damien Mizdow - Mizdown was completely in ""stunt double"" mode as he continued to simulate every move Miz with some of the opponents were confused at what he was doing with the crowd heavily showing their support for him more than anyone else in the match to the point where Miz & others refused to tag him while others blind tagged him out of the match the moment he got him as all four teams delivered non-stop action at a good pace with great back to back sequences including multiple dives to the outside resulting in a fun opening match.Elimination Match: Natalya, Emma, Naomi, Alicia Fox vs. Paige, Layla, Summer Rae, Cameron - There isn't much to this match here as some divas having their best showcase I remember seeing since their NXT days as the girls did try to work hard but it was just missing something with the action being very hit & miss while the announce team was more focused on talking about past Survivor Series teams including Lawler's own history at the event while the crowd continued to chant that they wanted someone else from the previous match as the only relevant part of this match was who decided to join in & steal the spotlight during the post-match celebration.Dean Ambrose vs. Bray Wyatt - Both men started brawling at the bell trading big blows in & outside of the ring including bodies being sent into the outside steps as Bray was able to use his size to his advantage while Dean continued to use his unorthodox offense as both men just continued to be evenly matched either executing the same move at the same time with neither guy countering or blocking the moves & just hitting each other along with playing mind games against the other ending with a wild scene to finish the match as this fun brawl was described perfectly as ""crazy trying to out do crazy!""Adam Rose & The Bunny vs. Slater Gator - This was pretty short & sweet as was only about continuing the story of The Bunny overshadowing Rose not only in the ring but with his own Exotic Express.Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Nikki Bella - Bree Bella was in her sisters corner for the final 48 hours of being her assistant but completely replicated what happened between A.J. & her husband Daniel Bryan at WrestleMania years earlier helping Nikki win the championship within seconds as this was all about the reunion of the Bellas & screwing A.J.Elimination Match - Team Cena vs. Team Authority: John Cena, Big Show, Erick Rowan, Ryback, Dolph Ziggler vs. Seth Rollins, Rusev, Mark Henry, Luke Harper, Kane - Either Cena's teammates were going to be fired or The Authority would lose their power in this traditional elimination match that saw various highlights such as the surprising first elimination, who caused multiple eliminations for one team without being the legal man, the Wyatt Family against each other, teamwork from both teams including double & even triple teaming, the impressive power of Rusev, what one man did that shocked both teams when it looked like his back was against the wall, when it got down to the final participants for each team, the aftermath of the match and the two biggest stories coming out of this match being the ""glass shattering"" performance for one man throughout the entire match and what Triple H was doing that caused the appearance of ""The Icon"" who had never been previously seen at ANY WWE live event in the history of the company. This was without a doubt one of the best elimination matches in the history of the event as it was given a heavy amount of time (close to an hour) filled with great wrestling & performances from both teams with some surprising & shocking developments throughout the entire match.This event was a mixed bag as the main event lived up to the hype & definitely ""broke the internet"" with everything that happened while Ambrose/Wyatt was the other standout match on the card with the opening tag match being very fun however the big issue here was that the other half of this event was pretty much unimportant filler or the same things you see for free on TV for the past few weeks (Divas elimination, Rose & Bunny, Divas Title, Roman Reigns interview) along with starting the show off with a long promo plugging the main event that people had already tuned in to see which more people capable of watching than before due to WWE offering this PPV for free on their network. In the end, this is an event worth watching for what I stated earlier but I would recommend for a rental or stream only because half of the show is worth watching.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DGC5IE0L3CSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLZAC2W#wasThisHelpful","R1DGC5IE0L3CSL","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This PPV is part of the second season of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events with each one having a special theme with this season being more recently taped than the previous season so it reflects the talents current gimmicks & feuds.  The matches on this edition took place in Japan as part of the Wrestle-1 promotion's ""Kaisen: Outbreak"" PPV in early March (only to be shown four months later in July) with every match (except for the knockouts) being an inter-promotional encounter between the promotions.Bad Influence vs. Junior Stars (Koji Kanemoto & Minoru Tanaka) - This match had an interesting setup with the rivalry between Daniels & Kanemoto with Daniels being known for the Koji Clutch submission hold when Kanemoto was the man who invented the hold.  Koji started out working over both men working them over in the corner using his feet before Bad Influence regained the advantage with classic double teaming isolating one of their opponents keeping him grounded to the point where he had a busted nose as the teams continued to trade momentum throughout the contest using very similar strategy against each other to the point where they were playing a game of ""can you top this"" resulting in a very good match between two evenly matched teams.Madison Rayne vs. Gail Kim - This was a non-title match with both girls being very aggressive from the start with strong strikes against each other along with taking each other down with a strong clothesline or spear along with big moves that landed each girl either directly on their head or neck while having no issues using the ringside environment to their advantage.  This was a strong knockouts match as the girls were intense from start to finish.Abyss vs. Yoshihiro Takayama - Mike Tenay pointed out on commentary that Takayama is one of only two men to hold the World Championship in all three major japanese promotions (New Japan, All Japan, NOAH) with Abyss attacking before the bell with strikes & chokes in the ring & brawling on the outside with Takayama fighting back before the brawl was taken to the entrance stage with weapons they decided to implement to the point where the action got out of control & nobody was able to control these men.Bobby Roode vs Masakatsu Funaki - Both men started off delivering the same offense against each other before Funaki was able to deliver a shot so stiff that it took Roode to the outside where Roode was able to take advantage of the ringside environment to heavily work over Funaki's arm while Funkai used his educated feet for rapid kicks & leg lariat to the chest as both men traded momentum with various submissions & counters resulting in a hard fought contest.Keiji Mutoh, Rob Terry, Taiyo Kea vs. Masayuki Kono, Rene Dupree, Samoa Joe - It should be noted for those who don't already know but Keiji Mutoh is also known by his alter-ego The Great Muta & he put his career on the line in this six man tag that saw each team have a TNA star team with members of the Wrestle-1 roster.  This match started out with Joe & Kea literally beating respect into each other in the opening minute before getting into a ""battle of the bodies"" between Terry & Dupree in which Terry gained control for his team using his strength allowing Muta to deliver this style of trademark offense & submissions while using double & triple teaming tactics singling out a member of the opposite team before the other team resorted to illegal tactics to gain control over Muta before he was saved by an unlikely ally as the match eventually broke down into a six way brawl with both teams trading momentum & using frequent tags with the miscommunication of one team continuing to play a heavy role as one member of the team was not happy with the desperate & illegal tactics of his team resulting in him showing he had more respect for his opponents than his own team.TNA Tag Team Champions The Wolves vs. BroMans vs. Team 246 (Kaz Hayashi & Shuji Kondo) - The Wolves recently defeated The BroMans at a non-televised event to walk into this match as champions where one member of each team was legal that started out with one man being the taken out of the action with one chop allowing his opponents to face off with each other but kept trying to attack whenever the focus wasn't on him as each team used double team tactics throughout the match such as one team working over both opponents on different sides of the ring with various double teaming such as multiple suicide dives while another team showcased their strength advantage and another team being able to use the other teams partners against each other before things finally broke down between all three teams hitting one big move after another.  This was a match full of non-stop tag team action.X Division Champion Austin Aries vs. Sanada - Both men were so evenly matched early resulting in stalemates as one man was able to get a series of offense in only for his opponent to counter with a series of their own before Sanada was finally able to catch Aries attempting to ground him before Aries picked up the intensity with a series of aerial offense while working over a specific body part as they traded momentum with Senada being able to keep catching Aries & countering his offense while Aries continued to rely on his trademark offense & submissions with both men giving repeated impactful moves over & over that did last their opponent right on their head on more than one occasion.  Both men delivered a high quality wrestling match that was evenly match from start to finish.TNA Champion Magnus vs. Kai - Both rosters showed support to their representative before the match as Magnus got the early advantage keeping Kai grounded along in the ring while working him over on the outside of the ring as well focusing on his lower back before Kai was able to recover & trade momentum with each man delivering one impactful move only for the other to come back with another one such as a package driver & powerbomb to a superplex & release bridge suplex as it took a non-stop series of hard hitting maneuvers to finally keep one man down for the win.  It's no secret that Magnus' TNA Championship reign was a complete disappointment due to the fact that all his title matches were filled with non-stop outside interference or heavily overbooked endings along with other things under ""Magnus Rules"" but that wasn't the case here as it was a clean traditional wrestling match making this the best match he had as champion.It's no big secret that wrestling is taken more seriously as a ""sport"" in Japan than ""entertainment"" in the United States so this show allowed the talents to play to their strengths which was the in-ring action resulting in without a doubt one of the best showcasing of TNA talent in recent history with some talents giving the best performances at this stage of their career so I would definitely check this event out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPGM0OPF32NYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQYXFKM#wasThisHelpful","RPGM0OPF32NYG","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This PPV is part of the second season of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme with this season being more recently taped than the previous season so it reflects the talents current gimmicks & feuds.  The second edition of ""Jokers Wild"" was the theme of this event taped during their tour of the United Kingdom where tag teams are put together via random drawing to compete against each other with the winning teams advancing to a gauntlet battle royal with the sole winner receiving a check for $100,000 as Mike Tenay & Taz did commentary on this show.Gunner & Chris Sabin vs. Douglas Williams & Magnus - The former tag team championship combination of the British Invasion reunited in their home country here with them looking like they hadn't lost a step with their classic double team offense & diverse strategy of grounding their opponents to take away their individual advantages of the other team while there were clear issues between Sabin & Gunner as Sabin was heavily on defense with Gunner regaining control with his power advantage only for Sabin to attempt to steal the spotlight resulting in both men tagging themselves back in frequently.  This was a nice tag match that told a good story of two people working as a team against their opponents working as individuals.Robbie E & Christopher Daniels vs. Samoa Joe & Bad Bones - Bad Bones was a local talent who participated in the  international Gut Check as him & Joe dominated both Robbie & Daniels with their power advantage easily catching both men various times while avoiding their offense causing Daniels & Robbie to resort to cheating tactics to gain the advantage for the team in what was pretty much an easy dominate match for one team.Bully Ray & Rockstar Spud vs. Mr. Anderson & Austin Aries - Rockstar Spud heavily trash talked his opponents while standing behind Bully Ray only to show how much ""his bark is as big as his bite"" from the moment Bully Ray tagged him in & hurt his own hand in the process with him getting beat up so bad that the crowd was actually getting behind him with Bully trying to motivate him & even work together as a team while Spud kept doing Bully mannerisms & trying to channel the spirit of his former partner Devon only to not have the same effect on more than one occasion including one time where everyone just stopped & look at him with a result that pretty much left everyone speechless & one of his opponents couldn't help but just laugh when it happened.  This was the most talked about match from this event not because of the actual wrestling but because of the heavy entertainment value of everyone involved with Rockstar Spud being the highlight as I personally just couldn't stop laughing at his antics from start to finish & his interaction with Bully Ray was classic comedy.The Wolves vs. Bobby Roode & James Storm - One of the best tag team in TNA history in Beer Money reunited here to face off against one of the greatest tag teams in recent wrestling history (in & outside of TNA) in The Wolves as they took control with various double team combinations that ultimately left Roode & Storm in a compromising position before Beer Money was able to regain control once they were finally on the same page singling out one member of their opposition & heavily working him over before The Wolves were able to regain control & use the same strategy against them as both teams continued to trade momentum executing their various trademark double team combinations against each other.  This was a modern day tag team dream match that delivered & was the match of the night strictly based off their wrestling.Kazarian & Curry Man vs. Ethan Carter III & Eric Young - ""Is the enemy of my enemy my friend or my enemy?""  Well both sides of that catchphrase applied here as Curry Man & Eric Young had no problems facing off with each other's partners but decided to take a different action whenever they were face to face while Kazarian & EC3 got on the same page attempted to work together only for one man to go into business for himself as the referee had to keep reminding them who their partners were while even one man had to remind the other that he was his partner in the match only to get the response ""I know, IT SUCKS!""  Eric Young's comedy is usually hit & miss but everyone played it out perfectly here as this was another match that was very entertaining.DJ Zema Ion & Jesse vs. Abyss & Samuel Shaw - Two thirds of the the BroMans against what can be described as the most mentally disturbed tag team in TNA history as Abyss was easily dominate from the start without taking much effort including Ion getting completely burned out doing repeated chops with no effect but Shaw & Abyss kept having the issues with each other starting from each other giving blind tags to Shaw constantly focusing on Christy at ringside to the point where even Abyss of all people called him ""creepy"" allowing the BroMans to take advantage of the situation with double teaming when possible.  This was another match similar to earlier where it was about one group working as a team against the others working as individuals.Elimination Match: O.D.B., Velvet Sky, Madison Rayne vs. Gail Kim, Lei'd Tapa, Alpha Female - Alpha Female was another local talent TNA used during this tour as this match as the match started out as a battle of the ""pigeons"" between Tapa & Velvet only for Tapa to showcase her dominance over each member of the opposing team individually at some points in the match while Velvet attempted to use a ""hit & move"" strategy only to get an unexpected distraction on more than one occasion that did help benefit & not help her team while issues were definitely surfacing between a set of partners with one constantly ordering around the other with things really coming to ahead when she decided to go into business for herself & let her ego get out of hand.  The match wasn't much past telling the story of the two teammates having constant issues with each other.Gauntlet Battle Royal Match - This battle royal happened ""Royal Rumble"" style where a new competitor entered in after a certain amount of time with the last man standing receiving a winners check resulting in some moments such as who the first two participants were, the interaction between some of the teams from earlier in the night, everyone on the same page as far as who was the most dominate man in the match, and the antics of Rockstar Spud as this was entertaining & served it's purpose.The talent from TNA both in & outside of the ring praised this event as the best ""One Night Only"" event to date & I'll agree to a degree that this was without a doubt one of the best ones they've done as everything clicked here from start to finish with the various tag team reunions to the most unusual tag team combinations complete with solid wrestling & entertainment throughout the matches with Rockstar Spud definitely making the lasting impression of the night so it's one event I would check out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MN05CXFBX1BU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PKRKBJS#wasThisHelpful","R3MN05CXFBX1BU","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amy (Danielle Harris) is working a graveyard shift at the city morgue with Seth (Kaj-Erik Eriksen) when the bodies from the murders at the Blackwell Hotel arrive including the murderer himself Jacob Goodnight (Kane) causing her to miss an evening out for her birthday only for their boss Holden (Michael Eklund) to invite her brother Will (Greyston Holt) & her friends Tamara (Katharine Isabelle) & Kayla (Chelan Simmons) & Carter (Lee Majdoub) to the morgue for a birthday party.  The crowd eventually splits up with Amy & Will getting into a fight over comments he made towards Seth & her in regards to her career choice when one of the couples decide to get intimate in the same room as Jacob only for the act to awaken him resuming his murder spree while still dealing with the mental issues of his mother but having access to brand new surgical tools & other methods of torture.The one thing I'll give credit to in this movie was that they were creative with some of the ways the death's happened but was just pretty much your typical ""slasher chases kids"" movie that I would only watch once & probably never again unlike how I actually watched & enjoyed the first one on more than one occasion so I would recommend this for a stream or rental at best.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPN3ECC3VGKO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6X9ZI2#wasThisHelpful","RPN3ECC3VGKO1","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A group of young couples named Ben (Andrew Dunbar) & Sophie (Stephanie Bennett) & David (Brendan Fletcher) & Jeni (Melissa Roxburgh) where backpacking through the irish countryside before going into a local pub where some of the local townsmen Ian Joyce (Bruce Blain) & Francois (Adam Boys) offered them an old cabin out in the woods for them to stay at.  Things start to go wrong though when members of the group keep hearing different noises & seeing quick images of things that start scaring them the moment they arrive only for one of the girls to get her gold earring ripped out of her ear by some monster while the doors to the cabin being locked from the outside trapping them inside causing them to try to escape with another member of the group suffering heavy injury to his leg causing them to run to safety inside another cabin only for them to discover they were ""outsiders"" sent to the cabin to be sacrificed to this monster who is revealed to be a leprechaun (Dylan ""Hornswoggle"" Postl) by the people of the town causing the group to try to get away from not only the leprechaun but the local villagers who do whatever possible for the leprechaun to kill them so it doesn't come after them with one local resident Sean McConville (Teach Grant) having conflicting views on the whole ritual.Now this was designed to be a complete reboot of the Leprechaun movie series with this movie taking a more darker & serious tone than the previous movies which is did but by doing that pretty much made this the type of low budget monster movie that didn't do much to keep my attention once you understood the plot & what was going to happen including the Leprechaun itself missing any qualities or a personality to keep your interest in him.  I watched this one just to check out the reboot but it's not a movie I would watch a second time & I wouldn't even recommend for a streaming so just skip this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M7RWU196G4XT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LDCJ19A#wasThisHelpful","R1M7RWU196G4XT","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thanks to the WWE Network, I was able to relive an event in the fifth Clash Of The Champions which was titled ""St. Valentine's Day Massacre.""  Now for those who don't already know, the Clash Of The Champions events were the NWA/WCW's equivalent of WWE's ""Saturday Night's Main Event/The Main Event"" where it was a big event broadcast for free on cable which in this case was the warm-up to the upcoming Chi-Town Rumble PPV less than a week later.  It should also be noted that along with the matches during this event was a big angle were Ric Flair came out in an expensive suit with lovely ladies to have a verbal confrontation with Ricky Steamboat that lead to a physical one where Steamboat literally beat the pants (and other clothing) off of Flair.Midnight Express vs. Russian Assassins - Paul E. Dangerously was on commentary for this match as the Express had the early advantage keeping a fast pace & frequent tags while staying one step ahead of their opponents including using them against each other with Cornette on the outside not being afraid to get his shots in as well as Jones getting hit as well before the Assassins were able to slow down the pace & keep breaking the Express' momentum focusing on one part of the body on one of their opponents using their power or illegal tactics whenever possible in a solid tag team match with the only real negative being that they went to commercial & you never saw the finish to the match.Steven Casey vs. Butch Reed - Casey was being built as ""undefeated"" coming into this match as he was able to gain early offense here using his superior quickness to his advantage when it came to reversing Reed's offense as both men used the same tactics against each other to neutralize each other's strengths while Reed resorting to taking shortcuts & using his power to keep the momentum in his favor as this was a match that never left first gear & went too long for what it was designed to be.Lex Luger vs. The Blackmailer - Luger was set to challenge Barry Windham at the upcoming PPV so Hiro Matsuta hired & was in the corner of The Blackmailer as Luger showcased his power offense along with easily shaking off whatever The Blackmailer gave him while not only showcasing some strategy that he would use against Windham but also using some of Windham's own signature maneuvers as his own resulting in this being exactly what it was designed to be in a ""preview"" of what was to come for Windham at the PPV.NWA United States Tag Team Champions Varsity Club vs. The Fantastics - This was the rematch from Starrcade with Rotunda replacing Sullivan as the Varsity Club dominated with Williams strength & Rotunda's wrestling ability as they kept the pace slow & grounding them also using some illegal double teaming & working them over on the outside while The Fantastics kept up a faster pace with using the strategy of ""hit & move"" using their athleticism & double team offense of their own including being able to use their opponents own momentum against them in a back & forth competitive match.Ricky Steamboat vs. Bob Bradley - Bradley was able to get some offense in but this was just a short offensive exhibition for Steamboat that's only noteworthy for the mixed reaction Steamboat got.Rick Steiner vs. Rip Morgan - This was a non-Television Championship match that was a short back & forth match with Steiner showcasing his style of mixing power with amateur offense.NWA Six Man Tag Team Champions Road Warriors & Tenryu vs. Varsity Club - The challengers were originally suppose to be Sting & Junkyard Dog & Michael Hayes but they were locked backstage allowing the Varsity Club to take their place in what the commentators called the ""the bullies vs. the bullies"" as it was a quick six way brawl with each team exchanging big hits against each other before the original challengers were able to make it out ending this in a nine way brawl between everyone involved as this was just an angle to officially make the Road Warriors babyfaces again (since the crowd never stopped cheering them when they were heels anyways) while it should be noted that this was the last appearance of Tenyru forcing the titles to be vacated & inactive for an extended period of time after this match.This was one of those events where it was a ""one match show"" with that one match being the U.S. Tag Team Title match along with the other thing to watch on here was the Flair/Steamboat confrontation & comparing the different crowd reactions to Steamboat when they went back & forth verbally before getting into it physically.  Past those two, this was pretty much a prime time edition of their weekly TV show with the matches pretty much speaking for themselves based off who's competing against whom & a main event that was only an angle.  It should also be noted that I noticed more than ever on this show that they kept cutting away from the match to show the crowd more than ever before including one shot of a couple not even watching the match & making out with each other which got annoying throughout the show.  In the end, I stated it previously that there was really only one match & one angle worth watching here but a show you can easily skip past that.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21MUDFFDITZEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085QNMJ2#wasThisHelpful","R21MUDFFDITZEY","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thanks to the WWE Network, I was able to relive an event in the fourth Clash Of The Champions which was titled ""Season's Beatings.""  Now for those who don't already know, the Clash Of The Champions events were the NWA/WCW's equivalent of WWE's ""Saturday Night's Main Event/The Main Event"" where it was a big event broadcast for free on cable while in this case was to setup the upcoming Starrcade PPV a month later as Lex Luger was the special guest host of the event giving his insight into the matches & his upcoming title match against World Champion Ric Flair.NWA United States Tag Team Championship Tournament Finals: The Fantastics vs. Ron Simmons & Eddie Gilbert - It should be noted that The Fantastics were scheduled to face the Sheepherders in this match only for Simmons & Gilbert to be reinstated into the finals when they left for WWE to become better known as the Bushwackers.  Both teams traded momentum with Simmons giving his team the superior strength advantage & Gilbert's wrestling ability keeping a slow pace while Fantastics showcased athleticism at high speeds with even Gilbert & Fulton at various points in the match having a stalemate staredown as both teams continued to work over the same body part of their opponents with various stretches & submission attempts to the point where one man had actually had ran that part of the body into the ring post on three separate occasions throughout the match as both teams gave a real competitive performance that went just seconds shy of 30 minutes.Italian Stallion vs. Steve Williams - This was Williams first major match since joining the Varsity Club as both men went for takedowns early with Williams relying on his amateur wrestling while Stallion resorted to basic moves like a hip toss & dropkick before Williams was able to rely on his power advantage that sent Stallion to the outside more than once with it being accidental at times as well continuing to not only keep Stallion grounded but also using dirty tactics in the ring out with Kevin Sullivan on the outside.  This match accomplished what it was designed to do in showcasing the ""new"" Steve Williams under the Varsity Club with the only downfall being that the match went too long where was dry at parts to showcase this point against this level of talent.Ivan Koloff vs. Paul Jones - Ivan Koloff had one arm tied behind his back but was able to use the rest of his body to keep getting the best of Jones to the point where Jones had to use the ringside environment & other illegal tactics to finally get the momentum & keep it in his favor as this was an entertaining match for what it was designed to be.Dusty Rhodes vs. Animal - This match had a unique stipulation in that the winner of the match would be able to claim his opponent's (in Dusty's case, both Road Warriors) ownership of the Six Man Tag Team Championship while Dusty was looking for revenge for the Warrior's attack on him that injured his eye as Dusty went after Animal relentlessly with whatever he could use around him & attacked whoever got in his way along with allies of both men getting involved in the match too.  This was more of an angle than a match (ended by disqualification in under 2 minutes) but was non-stop chaos the entire time.Midnight Express vs. Ric Flair & Barry Windham - This was a unique match for this time as Flair & Windham were not only the top two singles wrestlers in the company (holding the World & U.S. titles) but also the final two members of the Horsemen against not only one of the top tag teams in the company but also the team who took the tag team titles from the other two Horsemen members in Anderson & Blanchard right before they left for WWE. Flair tried to intimidate Eaton early who his ""Whoo!"" before Eaton responded by popping him in the mouth & knocking Flair down with both members of the Express eventually showing off against Flair as they had control with their counters to the double team attempts by the Horsemen. Flair & Windham did whatever they could to get the advantage & keep it from double teaming moves to their manager J.J. Dillion getting involved leading to a fight between him & Cornette. Good quality tag team match.[Blu-Ray Edition Of Best Of The Clash Of The Champions]This was another one of those Clash's that was a mixed bag as the tag team matches where quality wrestling, the ""wrestler vs. manager"" match & Dusty/Animal were entertaining for what they were, and the big negative being the Williams/Stallion match.

Now for those who don't already know, the Clash Of The Champions events were the NWA/WCW's equivalent of WWE's ""Saturday Night's Main Event/The Main Event"" where it was a big event broadcast for free on cable.NWA Television Champion Mike Rotunda vs. Brad Armstrong - Brad took the early control with his athleticism working over Mike with hip tosses & dropkicks before Mike was able to slow the pace down grounding Brad & wearing him down while Kevin Sullivan made his presence known on the outside as Armstong kept putting up a fight & refusing to stay down as this match told a great story about how it's the challenger's job to beat the champion but could the champion be the challenger.Nikita Koloff & Steve Williams vs. The Sheepherders - Koloff & Williams dominated from the very start using their superior strength advantage with power moves while also showing some agility leaving their feet & coming off the top rope as well before the Sheepherders were able to take advantage of a mistiming by their opponents to slow down the pace & grounding their opponent taking away their power advantage doing whatever they could including some illegal tactics in & outside of the ring as this was a really good tag team match with both teams evenly matched & using some of the same strategy against each other.Dusty Rhodes vs. Kevin Sullivan - This was built as a ""Grudge Match"" which is appropriate for anyone knowing the history of these two men dating back to other territories years earlier which you saw in the early seconds with one man's head bouncing off the announce table on the outside & being so relentless in his assault that the referee kept trying to separate both men as this match just got completely out of hand with more observers from the outside getting involved along with various weapons being put into play as well with a finish that was just as crazy as the match itself.Russian Chain Match: Ricky Morton vs. Ivan Koloff - This chain match was held under the rules that you had to touch all four corners to win. Both men used the chain as a weapon throughout the match from choking, using it to give a low blow, and whip each other while also telling the story of Morton being lighter in weight, he had more trouble pulling Koloff. The quality is what you usually expect in this type of match but the biggest story came afterwords due to Paul Jones making it clear that this was ""make it or break it"" for the weak link in Koloff.[Best Of The Clash Of The Champions]NWA United States Champion Barry Windham vs. Sting - It should be noted that San Francisco 49er John Ayers was at ringside to observe this match as Sting started out very fast paced keeping Windham off his feet or knocking him to the outside before Windham was able to move the momentum in his favor resorting to dirty tactics such as taking the fight to the floor & raking the eyes along with his size & power advantage as well before it worked against him allowing Sting to take control giving receipts to Windham on the outside for this illegal tactics earlier as they went back & forth throughout the rest of the match with both men eventually applying submissions on each other & J.J. Dillion on the outside making his presence felt when necessary in a very competitive match.This Clash was a mixed bag as it didn't have as high of quality of wrestling as the previous two editions but was still a mixed bag for everyone with solid wrestling matches, some entertaining moments, brawls, and their current storylines continued to be pushed so it's an event I would check out on the network.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LZUYUY43DIPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085QQ7I0#wasThisHelpful","R3LZUYUY43DIPL","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thanks to the WWE Network, I was able to relive a classic event in the second Clash Of The Champions which was titled ""Miami Mayhem.""  Now for those who don't already know, the Clash Of The Champions events were the NWA/WCW's equivalent of WWE's ""Saturday Night's Main Event/The Main Event"" where it was a big event broadcast for free on cable with limited commercial interruptions (no interruptions during the matches) which in this case was to setup the upcoming Great American Bash PPV a month later.  It should also be noted that along with the matches during this event was a big angle were Ric Flair & Lex Luger signed the contract for the World Heavyweight Championship at that upcoming with Flair giving Luger the warning that would play itself out later in the night, ""you have to make it to Baltimore.""NWA United States Champion Barry Windham vs. Brad Armstrong - Both men started out trading momentum early such as armdrags & different types of takedowns while having counters & reversals to each other's offense while as Brad continued to work over Barry with a grounded side headlock & use his athletic offense such as a dropkick or high crossbody causing Windham to not only use his size & power advantage but also use whatever illegal advantage he could get weather it was using the ringside environment or J.J. Dillion on the outside in what was a evenly matched contest.NWA United States Tag Team Champions The Fantastics vs. The Sheepherders - Fantastics started out showcasing their athleticism with various dropkicks only for Sheepherders to respond with brawling tactics along with using Rip Morgan on the outside to their advantage as both teams traded momentum as Fantastics kept up a fast pace while Sheepherders continued to use whatever tactics possible to slow the pace down & keep their opponents grounded including using whatever objects they could get their hands on in what was a competitive tag team match.Jimmy Garvin & Ronnie Garvin vs. Varsity Club - Steve Williams was on commentary for this match while Kevin Sullivan was locked in a cage at ringside with Precious having the key to the cage to prevent any interference from him as this started out as a four way brawl with the match settling down as Steiner & Rotunda kept using their amateur wrestling skills to single out one member of the team heavily working over a body part along with taking shortcuts behind the referee as the Garvins attempted to use the same strategy against them only for Sullivan on the outside to keep drawing Precious to him distracting Jimmy as they traded momentum throughout the contest with the bigger story being what happened to Sullivan & Precious during & after the match along with how it effected her.Nikita Koloff vs. Al Perez - Both men went back & forth early with Perez being able to take the advantage due to a mistiming by Nikita with Gary Hart getting involved on the outside before Nikita was able to make a comeback when more of a numbers advantage worked against him in a pretty basic average match.NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Sting & Dusty Rhodes - This was a classic ""faces vs. heels"" encounter as Sting & Rhodes kept getting the upperhand & dominating the Horsemen resulting in Anderson & Blanchard resorting to double teams & illegal tactics with J.J. Dillion at ringside and even Sting on the receiving end of a DDT on the floor. This was a back & forth match with the crowd hot from start to finish but this match did it's job in establishing matches & feuds going into the ""Great American Bash"" PPV the next month.[The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story; The Best Of Clash Of The Champions]This wasn't as high of quality as the previous Clash event but still a good event with quality wrestling matches that I would definitely check out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROND5C6JI740L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016G40DK#wasThisHelpful","ROND5C6JI740L","AZ2YLC0GWTAH2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ2YLC0GWTAH2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thanks to an internet download, I saw able to see this VHS tape of the second annual Great American Bash tour which was hosted by Tony Schavonie & David Crockett who gave the introductions & showed some background footage leading into each match.Matches Include:Hair Match: Jimmy valant vs. Shaska Whatley - Shaska attacked Valant as he got into the ring & kept beating on his head with repeated punches & headbutts until he was bleeding while Paul Jones had no issues getting his shots in from the outside before Valant was able to start gaining offense leading to allies of both men appearing making their presence known.  This was a pretty basic match with an entertaining aftermath.As a side note, they showed the finish & aftermath of Hair Match between Valant & Paul Jones after this match.Taped Fist Match: Ronnie Garvin vs. Tully Blanchard - This was a non-title match held under boxing rules of 10 3 minute rounds with a 30 second rest period between rounds with Wahoo McDaniels & J.J. Dillion in their respective corners as this match started out with a bang literally with one man getting knocked out before the match started as this was a one sided dominate performance for the first few rounds with one man being so ""punch drunk"" that he wasn't connecting any punches at all against his opponent but almost hit the referee a few times & even bleeding from his head before finally able to mount some offense busting his opponent open as well as this was limited with the match stipulations but definitely physical with some entertaining moments.Chain Match: Road Warriors vs. Ivan & Nikita Koloff - This was held under tornado tag rules with all four men legal as this was a physical brawl from the start with each team double teaming & delivering big blows against each other using the chain heavily to their advantage with chokes & whips along with making their strikes more impactful to the point where one man was bleeding from the forehead as the referee kept getting caught up in the action on more than one occasion as this was just a very physical fight that couldn't be contained in the confines of a scheduled match.[Road Warriors]NWA Tag Team Champions Rock N' Roll Express vs. Arn & Ole Anderson - Not only did Arn Anderson come into this match also being the World Television Champion but the Andersons were also involved in the attack that broke Ricky Morton's nose weeks earlier. The Andersons attempted to maneuver the Express into their corner only for them to quickly escape each time & taking control with double dropkicks while also Ricky got revenge for the Andersons breaking his nose before the Andersons were finally able trap & singled out one member of the team heavily working him over in their corner singling out body parts while also taking advantage of the referee to break the rules whenever possible in what resulted as a good match between two evenly matched teams.[United We Slam: Best Of Great American Bash]Magnum T.A. vs. Nikita Koloff - This was the forth match in their Best Of Seven series with Nikita ahead 3-0 meaning that Magnum was in a no lose situation as both men went back & forth trading momentum throughout the first half of the match with neither man gaining a series of momentum with Ivan Koloff getting involved on the outside as well whenever possible as this just came down to one man being able to catch the other by surprise for the win as this was an average match that never left first gear.Steel Cage Match: America's Team (Dusty Rhodes & Magnum T.A.) & Baby Doll vs. Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton & Dennis Condrey) & Jim Cornette - Cornette's bodyguard Big Bubba was on the outside of the cage with Baby Doll getting the first offensive move in the match that caused Cornette to attempt to climb out of the cage for safety with one man fighting off both members of the Express with Cornette getting his shots whenever possible only to keep running whenever Baby Doll got close to him with the numbers game eventually catching up to the point where he was bleeding from the cage & attacks coming off the top of the cage before things eventually broke down with not only Baby Doll finally getting her hands on Cornette but who was left laying after the match.[Blu-Ray Edition of United We Slam: Best Of Great American Bash]Steel Cage Match: NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes - Both men attempted to play mind games with each other through trying to show the other man up before Dusty was able to keep staying one step ahead of Flair working him over & keeping him down before Flair was able to get the advantage heavily working over Dusty's leg & previously injured ankle as both men traded momentum using the cage various times resulting in both men heavily bleeding & constantly attacking the cut.[Bloodbath: Wrestling's Most Incredible Steel Cage Matches; The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story; United We Slam: Best Of Great American Bash]This was a nice 2 hour tape showing a collection of the complete matches showing most of the big attraction matches from the Bash that year.

"The Church of Marvels by author Leslie Parry in set in New York in the late 1890s. This is a world of dirt, disease, noise and squalor, opium dens, brothels, and fight clubs, and where children are often commodities. The tale is told from several different perspectives:-Sylvan, a night-soiler, someone who cleans out the privies in Manhattan. The only thing that makes the job bearable is the many treasures he has found on the job but he has never found anything like he has found this night  a live baby girl. Although he is told by the boss to abandon the baby, he cannot  up until now he has felt lonely and isolated but finding the girls family gives him purpose.-Odile who was raised in a circus called the Church of Marvels on Coney Island. Thanks to a physical handicap, she has always lived in the shadow of her twin sister Belle who is a sword-swallower and a shapeshifter. But when the circus is burned down, killing her mother and several of the performers, Belle disappears and Odile follows the only clue she has to the slums of Manhattan.-Alphie who was thrown out by her strict religious father at the age of twelve for kissing a boy. She was forced into prostitution but found a job doing concealing makeup for men on the way home after a night of drinking, drugging, and brawling. She met Anthony, an opium smoker and undertaker, who, despite his mothers protests, marries her. But Alphie has secrets that, when discovered, will have devastating effects for her.These may be the main characters but Parry has created a huge cast of characters who are often outcasts due to no fault of their own living lives at the edge of proper society but who are all complex, diverse, and fascinating  even the villain of the piece has shades of grey that make the reader, if not empathize, at least understand.Parrys Church of Marvels is a beautifully written novel, haunting and memorable. It is both very colourful and exceedingly dark, full of wonders and tragedies but in the end, a very satisfying read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35K9YNDI3P0OH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQOYH6M#wasThisHelpful","R35K9YNDI3P0OH","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nella and her brother Robert live a hard life. Their mother is a drunk and their father is in and out of prison. Robert is bullied mercilessly at school and Nella has become his protector. She commits petty crimes to buy off his tormentors. She has become an expert on dealing with bad situations on her own but when she witnesses the school psychopath torture and kill a kitten, he accuses her of tattling on him and demands more money than she can steal. She asks her friend, Tommy for help. His brothers have always got some scheme on the go but they have been more secretive than usual lately. Tommy shows her the secret, a real live creature that looks like a Merman. Suddenly it seems that, if she can save the creature she can save herself and Robert.The Merman by Swedish author Carl-Johan Vallgren is a bleak dark tale with very few bright spots and if you asked me why I like it I would have to say Im not sure but I did  a lot.<i>Theres not much thats been written about mermaids, you see. Mainly fairy tales with tragic endings.</i>And there is a definite fairy tale quality to this tale although more Hans Christian Anderson than Charles Perrault.  Dont look for a happy ending here although it is a realistic one. Nella and her brother might survive and the bad guys might be vanquished but there will be no perfect happily ever after for anyone. The story combines the fantastic with the painfully real and somehow Vallgren not only makes it work, he makes it seem right.The Merman is a story about family and friendship and what we will do for both. It is a fast read and a deceptively simple tale with memorable characters but it packs a wallop. It is the kind of story you can read in an afternoon but will stay with you long after you finish the last page.Trigger Warning: the killing of the kitten is particularly graphic and disturbing","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIFRMUZ1804QO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1843914735#wasThisHelpful","RIFRMUZ1804QO","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When a plane crashes outside the town of Redemption, a man walks out of the fire. He has no memory of who he is or why he is here or even if he was on the plane. Yet he seems to have a great deal of knowledge about medicine, firefighting, and the town. He gives the name of Solomon Creed although he is not sure if that is right. He is convinced he is here to save a man except the man is already dead and buried. Yet, he cant shake the feeling and he is determined to stay and discover what he came to do. The towns leading citizens seem less than happy to have Solomon in their town but they are determined to make sure he doesnt leave. Redemption has deadly secrets and Solomon is just one loose end too many.The Searcher is the first in a new series by author Simon Toyne. It reminded me of John Connollys Charlie Parker series especially in the Solomon Creed character and, at least for me, thats a very good thing. Its a fast-paced thriller with just a touch of the supernatural and a smidgen of the old west and it kept my attention from beginning to end. Definitely a big Yes! from me.

"There have been attempts to find a biological explanation for human behaviour since the Enlightenment in the 18th c. Whether it was the Social Darwinism of the 19th c., Eugenics of the early 20th c., Sociobiology of the late 20th c., or the present theory of Evolutionary Psychology, as author Richard J Perry points out, it all suggests that human behaviour is written indelibly in our genes.  These theories have been used to `prove' racism and to do away with programs of aid to disadvantaged groups. If who and what we are today was selected for in the Pleistocene Era and, despite our very large brain in relation to our size or our long developmental period, we cannot change then programs like Head Start are just a waste of taxpayers' money.  In his book, Killer Apes, Naked Apes, and Just Plain Nasty People, Perry looks at the history of varying theories of biological determinism, how they stand up to research, and how they have influenced social ideology:'In most respects, these arguments have amounted to ideological assertions rather than scientific discoveries - a matter of ""faith without proof"". It often seems to be a short step from assertions of ""what evolved to be"" to ""what's meant to be"".'I have read several reviews on this book and the consensus among many of the reviewers (other than scientific reviewers) seems to be that Professor Perry gives a rather facile and cursory examination of evolutionary psychology. Putting aside the rather condescending `damning by faint praise' nature of these reviews, I wonder how many of them are deliberately missing the point. Perry is not condemning the scientific research so much as the use often made of it outside the scientific arena. Scientists look at theories, test them, and open them to peer review - if the results don't stand up, they discard the theory and move on. Too often, though, these theories are picked up by the media, put forward as proven fact, then used to sway social and political debate and policy. If anyone doubts that Biological Determinism influences political discourse, they haven't been paying attention to the news lately: the arguments used to justify Neoliberalism, deregulation, racism, misogyny, the demonization and criminalization of the poor, not to mention cut-throat competition and violence in society as well as war all sound surprisingly like the arguments used by Social Darwinists throughout the Industrial Revolution and the Gilded Age, by the Eugenicists right up until the end of WWII when it became horribly evident how it had influenced the Nazis, and by the Sociobiologists who used it as an excuse to sterilize African Americans, First Nations, and the mentally and physically challenged in the United States and Canada up until the 1970s ie Man is, by nature, competitive, violent, selfish and all of this is good because it ensures the survival of the fittest.Killer Apes, Naked Apes, and Just Plain Nasty People gives a cogent, well-researched, and easily understood outline of the history of biological determinism over the last century and a half, how the theories have changed and how they remain the same, the pseudo-science, misinformation, and outright lies that have arisen around the actual research, and the effects it has had on our social and political lives. Whether you agree with Professor Perry or not, biological determinism has had and continues to have a profound effect on social policy and we should all be aware of its influence. This book is a very good place to start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YAMRS1FP2O0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421417510#wasThisHelpful","R1YAMRS1FP2O0X","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She imprisons the present queen in a mirror and proceeds to remake Oz in her own cruel and violent image. The citizens send for Dorothy to help them but, when she realizes she cannot succeed on her own, she decides to search for Alice, an old foe of the queen, to aid her.The Battle for Oz is a novella by author Jeyna Grace combining two classics, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland, two of my favourite books from childhood.

"It is the year 1784 and Josephine Drollery is writing to a publisher because someone else has written an account of her adventures full of errors and she will now set the record straight.  Thirty years ago, her life was a pretty good one - that is, until her parent's dinner party where everyone including Josephine were murdered. Now, Josephine is a ghost with a mission - she is determined to discover the murderer(s) and bring them to justice. With the aid of two orphaned African American cousins, a Harvard Professor who, though dead, continues to teach, and a fraudulent spiritualist known as The Great Montesquieu who is a bit disconcerted to discover a real ghost contacting him. But before she can solve the murders, she must first learn the skills of being a ghost.The Drollery Letters Number one: The Devil's Interval by author Emily Butler is aimed at a Middle Grade audience and is definitely not your typical ghost story. It is more historical mystery with ghost and just a touch of steam punk thrown in so don't expect any frights or chills. It is, however, a fun fast read - Josephine is spunky, her friends are an interesting lot and there's plenty of humour to keep the reader engaged.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PKTHTPGJ0FNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606846019#wasThisHelpful","R3PKTHTPGJ0FNC","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On Christmas day in 1893, the entire population of Abandon disappeared without a trace.  The town has remained empty ever since and is believed to be haunted. Because of its inaccessibility, and the dangers of crossing through the mountains especially in winter, it is almost impossible to get permission from the authorities to enter it. But, in 2009, a group including a history professor, his estranged journalist daughter and a married couple with psychic credentials have gained permission to explore the area and have hired two guides to lead them. They all claim to be searching for answers to what happened to the town but some of them are there for another reason, another mystery, one they are more than willing to kill for but the question they should be asking themselves: is it one they're willing to die for.Abandon by author Blake Crouch is one hell of a ride. There are no monsters except of the human variety and no ghosts or ghoulies but this is definitely a horror story and a very bloody one at that. The novel switches back and forth between the two time periods and in many ways they mirror each other: sorrow, betrayal, murder, greed, madness, even the weather is unremittingly bad. Character development gets short shrift here. There a lot of characters in both time periods and, as a result, the reader doesn't really get a chance to get to know and empathise with anyone which did tend to reduce the amount of chills. However, this lack is offset to a great extent by the amount of action and atmosphere which keeps the adrenaline pumping and the tension rising. Besides I suspect the lack of likeable characters in Abandon may have been intentional - after all the town is Abandon and, if you go there, you should be prepared, to quote Dante, to""Abandon hope all ye who enter here.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD6S0XR6DV3V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCLPC6E#wasThisHelpful","RD6S0XR6DV3V8","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""People like us - we wind up like carcasses at the side of the road, and the best we can hope for is that someone will stop and chase away the ravens.""Lance Hanson has survived what he thought was an attack by his brother, Andy, at the end of Only the Dead and has been hiding out by pretending to be in Norway. In fact, he actually went to northern Ontario in Canada but now he is back in Minnesota where his niece Chrissy runs into him in a bar. He tells her he has been working undercover and makes her promise not to reveal that he's back. He is still obsessed with the murder of a Norwegian tourist and he still suspects his brother's involvement. As he learns more about his niece's drug problems and her relationship with both her father and Lenny Diver, the man charged with the murder, he begins to learn more unsettling truths about his family than he had previously thought or wanted to know.The Ravens is the third and final book in Norwegian author Vidar Sundstl's Minnesota Trilogy.  If the first book, Land of Dreams, was a strong police procedural and the second book, Only the Dead, was a claustrophobic thriller, in style The Ravens lies somewhere in between the two, a literary mystery, with elements of both books. It contains descriptions of the northern Minnesota landscape as well as Lance's efforts to solve the case through examining the evidence like in the first book while maintain much of the mystic qualities of the second but here much of the book is taken up with the slow and heart-breaking dissolution of a family, torn apart by secrets and lies and Lance's inability to act faced with knowledge that could free an innocent man but could also send someone he loves to prison. Most of all, like the first two books, The Ravens is an intelligent, beautifully written and original mystery novel almost lyrical in its prose, and a fitting end to the trilogy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ELSBJU9QA1OD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2VBG26#wasThisHelpful","R1ELSBJU9QA1OD","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When the body of a man is found shot execution style in a farmer's field and there is nothing pointing to the perpetrators, the local constabulary is ill-equipped to deal with it. The Ontario Provincial Police send in Detective Inspector Ellie March to lead the investigation. Detective Constable Kevin Walker is excited to work with her but, as their investigation digs deeper into this close-knit community, it becomes clear that this was not the crime of outsiders and, as they get closer to the solution, he is in danger of losing more than just his enthusiasm or his career.Sorrow Lake by author Michael J. McCann is a well-plotted, well-written and intelligent police procedural. Rather than focus on all the more sensational aspects of the crime, instead it focuses on the investigation itself. Clues are collected, leads are followed, forensics is examined, and suspects are identified. All of this may sound boring but, in fact, it was fascinating - it was like getting a glimpse of real police work and it was great fun following March and Walker as they navigate through both the evidence and the politics of solving a murder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27OU6R42I36AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZBQ6XE#wasThisHelpful","R27OU6R42I36AF","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brianna is a clinical therapist and founder of the Twinless Twins support group for people grieving the loss of a twin - she lost her own twin to drowning.  When a member of the group tells her that her twin daughters have disappeared on the eve of their 21st birthday, she is convinced it is the work of a serial killer known as the 21 Killer. But this is not the killer's usual killing grounds and besides, her own cousin was convicted for the crime and is now in prison. She is convinced he is innocent but unfortunately she's the only one so how can she convince the police of the seriousness of the disappearance of Zoe and Chloe?Never Die Alone by author Lisa jackson is a fast-paced, heart-pounding, adrenaline surge of a novel.  The narrative is told in several voices including Brianna, Zoe, Chloe, and the killer but the quick change in `voice' never becomes confusing; instead, it helps to slow things down to allow the reader to catch their breath when the pace becomes too frenetic, speeds it up before the reader can become too complacent, and helps to ramp up the suspense as it races from one scene to another. Definitely one for readers who like their thrillers fast and furious.Trigger Warning: there are some fairly graphic scenes that some readers may find disturbing","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ELLA2NFFRJ91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1420136054#wasThisHelpful","R3ELLA2NFFRJ91","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is the year 1759 and there has been a multiple murder on a plantation in Craven County, North Carolina. A small boy and his parents were slain, then posed, but the baby was spared. Pretty much everyone is convinced it must have been an Indian attack, everyone but Royal Constable James Henry Woodyard who is not so sure. When his friend and mentor Comet Elijah, a member of the Tuscorora tribe, is found in the vicinity of the crime, he is arrested. Woodyard is convinced he is innocent. He has found a medal with a Masonic crest on it and is sure it must belong to the real perpetrator of the crime. He sets out on a long and perilous journey to prove Elijah's innocence across several of the American colonies and north to Quebec into the camps of both Generals Montcalm and Wolfe and eventually into the middle of the battle that would decide the fate of a nation on the Plains of Abraham.The Constable's Tale, the debut novel by author Donald Smith, is a fascinating combination of historical details about a period of history that is rarely seen in fiction and a cracking good mystery. Harry is a very likeable character, smart, just, curious but tough, and a mean hand with a tomahawk, one of the many skills he learned from Elijah when he was a boy. He is a small plantation owner and volunteer constable but is endeavouring to raise his status. Each chapter is headed by a quote from a book called Rules of Civility & Decent Behaviour In Company and Conversation, `[R]ooted in some ancient Italian court, later written out by an elderly Frenchman...translated into English' (a real book, by the way)which Henry had had to learn as a boy and which he tries to live by.  He doesn't always do the right thing but he tries.Smith manages to keep the details of colonial life and the dialogue true to the period while moving the story along at a galloping pace. Definitely a very enjoyable read, full of interesting history, characters, and plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader's attention throughout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ADZQPK1MHV6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605988618#wasThisHelpful","R2ADZQPK1MHV6H","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For every nerd, every geek, every wallflower who ever suffered through the petty cruelties of high school and who has secretly harboured dreams of revenge against their own private schoolyard bullies ever since, The perfect Comeback of Caroline Jacobs by author Matthew Dicks may be the perfect panacea. Caroline Jacobs, happily married and possibly a very talented photographer if she would just let others see her work, has spent most of her life since high school trying to fly under the social radar. However, when another shy woman is attacked verbally at a meeting by the smugly pretensious president of the Parent Teacher Organization, Caroline can't take it anymore - she lets loose with her own attack which unfortunately contains a rather strong expletive. The next day, she gets called to the school because her daughter, Polly, has been caught fighting. When Caroline learns that the fight was the result of her own behaviour at the PTO meeting, she pulls Polly out of school. She will take her on a road trip so that Caroline can confront her high school bully. On the road, Caroline tells Polly about Emily Kaplan, the girl who had been her best friend until she dumped Caroline for a cooler, more popular girl.  This seemingly small event has coloured every aspect of her life since and, with Polly's support, she is determined to confront Emily. But this road trip has some surprising side effects - mother and daughter discover that not only do they have more in common than they ever dreamed but, more important, they actually like each other a lot.The Perfect Comeback of Caroline Jacobs: A Novel by author Matthew Dicks is a fun fast and often humorous look at how we too often carry and nurse the small hurts from childhood throughout our lives and how they can keep us from appreciating the people and events that truly matters. It is proof positive that revenge not only can be sweet but also heartwarming if done with someone you care about and who will support you even when they think you've lost it.3.5","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLBTKAUV4YS44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UG4V4KU#wasThisHelpful","RLBTKAUV4YS44","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Last Quarrel by Duncan Lay was originally released in five separate parts. Then The Last Quarrel: The Complete Edition was released containing all of the parts and I dived in with anticipatory glee. And, for the most part, I wasn't disappointed. It's a very enjoyable book with plenty of action and likable characters. At times, some of the characters seemed a bit nave and their actions somewhat incomprehensible given past actions of other characters. But that was okay  - it's fantasy and, overall, pretty decent fantasy...except...except, as I got deeper into the story and closer to the end, instead of winding down, it seemed like more details and questions were being added and there was still no resolution in sight. I anticipated some mighty action-packed and bloody last few pages at this rate but nada. The story ended on one gigantic cliffhanger with pretty much nothing resolved. Turns out Complete just doesn't mean what I though it did. Rather, this is the Complete Edition of the first in a series of I don't know how many books which would have been nice to know beforehand in case I didn't feel like starting a new series right now given the number I am already committed to.So would I have read it had I known? Most likely. It's my favourite kind of fantasy. Sword and Sorcery with very little of either, interesting world-building and story-line, plenty of action, and very little romance. (One caveat: there is, however, a very disturbing rape scene)  But I would have anticipated the ending and wouldn't have been annoyed by it.Would I still recommend it? Absolutely. This is a very entertaining fantasy novel just not a Complete one. So you might want to keep that in mind before you start it. Personally, I am already looking forward to the Sequel: The Complete Edition.3.5","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPI9ANZWVTPHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1760300195#wasThisHelpful","RPI9ANZWVTPHD","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alistair, a promising young Haida carver is murdered in Vancouver and the totem pole he was working on has been stolen. Meg Harris and Eric Odjik, her new husband and Ojibway Chief from Ontario, are in town for a meeting of First Nations when they hear about the death. Through an unexpected encounter, they learn that the young man was the adopted son of Cloe, Eric's adoptive sister. This encounter forces Eric to confront his past and eventually sends Meg, Eric, and Cloe to the isolated islands of Haida Gwaii where a totem pole raising ceremony is taking place to commemorate the naming of the new Chief.Silver Totem of Shame by author RJ Harlick gives a fascinating look at the culture of the Haida peoples on Canada's west coast while providing a very entertaining mystery. There's plenty of excitement and action and lots of twists and turns to keep the reader's attention. One warning though: if you suffer at all from seasickness, you might want to skip over the journey across to the islands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28SWDBHFLERYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1459721691#wasThisHelpful","R28SWDBHFLERYI","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1987, a man and a woman are seen making love in a water tower in Chiswick. When the woman leaves, she slams the door closed trapping the man inside. A group of children had been playing soldier in the tower and witnessed the couple. This fact will become important as the story moves between 1987 as we learn more about the children and their relationships to the couple and to each other and forward to the present where Stella Darnell and her friend Jack work together both in her cleaning business and in solving crimes. Jack is also a train driver in the London Underground. Recently a man fell under a train (called a One Under by the drivers). The police are satisfied that it was a suicide but the man's brother is convinced it was murder and hires Stella and Jack to investigate. Meanwhile, Stella's mom finally returns from a long trip to Australia with a man she introduces as Stella's brother and Jack moves into the water tower that is in the process of being converted into flats.The Detective's Secret by author Lesley Thomson is the third in The Detective's Daughter series but it is the first I've read. This is an odd story made odder by references (I assume) to the other books which are never explained like Jack's talk of True Hosts(?) which tended to break my willing suspension of disbelief at times. However, once it became clear that these things really had no bearing on this novel and I could just ignore them, I really began to enjoy the story.  The main characters are likable if a bit neurotic and there is a quirkiness to both the characters and the tale that made it a lot of fun to read. Much of the plot is taken up with Stella's and Jack's private lives and the solution to the mystery seems to rest on some rather unlikely coincidences and luck rather than any real skill by the two main protagonists - in most mystery novels, this would have been unforgiveable; somehow though, here, it not only fit, it seems right. Since this is not your usual mystery, all the usual tropes and rules need not apply. So if you're looking for something a little different in the mystery genre, I highly recommend The Detective's Secret.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RSVMKUL5NEOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010KN78GU#wasThisHelpful","R1RSVMKUL5NEOV","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1970, Arizona sheriff Brandon Walker had arrested John Lassiter for the murder of Amos Warren, a man Lassiter had once considered like a father. Lassiter is still in prison in 2015 and suffering from MS but, when offered a plea deal, he refuses. He wants Walker, who is now retired and working for a group that reviews cold cases, to look into Warren's murder to find the real killer. At first reluctant, as he looks deeper into it, Walker begins to have doubts about the conviction. He discovers a link between the Lassiter case and an unsolved homicide in Seattle. He contacts retired Seattle detective JP Beaumont to help him unravel what is turning out to be a very far-reaching mystery. When two boys disappear from the Tohono O'odham reservation where Walker's daughter Lani and her husband Dan Pardee live, Walker is convinced this is somehow tied in and he has very little time left to solve the case if there is any hope of finding them alive. Then Lani disappears...In Dance of the Bones, author J.A. Jance brings two of her most popular detectives out of retirement and they work very well together to solve one of the most challenging cases either has ever faced. With a plot full of twists and turns and infused with the legends and culture of the Tohono O'odham people, Jance has created a very intelligent, entertaining, and suspenseful novel, one that keeps the reader's attention from the first page and never lets up until the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CG221AT1IXM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006229766X#wasThisHelpful","R2CG221AT1IXM7","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Someone has trapped Death in a human body so he can't collect the dead. As a result, no one is dying but the hospitals are full of coma patients.  He has come to James Stark AKA Sandman Slim to help him and is now residing in Maximum Overdrive, Stark's video store while Stark tries to find who is responsible. Problem is, Stark can no longer shadow walk which makes his investigation a whole lot harder as he must confront some very dangerous adversaries both old and new.Killing Pretty is the 7th in the Sandman Slim urban fantasy series by author Richard Kadrey and, although it is a bit slower than some of the others, it is just a whole lot of fun. The story is told in the first person by Stark who is, at least for now, earth-bound but he is at his wittiest best as he roams the streets of San Francisco from nightclubs populated by vampires to a very unusual fight club and as he tries without a whole lot of success to act as a responsible member of a team.For fans of urban fantasies, it doesn't get any better than Sandman Slim and Killing Pretty is no exception to this rule. It is dark and gritty, occasionally violent, often humorous, and always entertaining.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWP2NNYXZ3OO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLMC8TK#wasThisHelpful","RWP2NNYXZ3OO8","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sell-sword Aeryn Ravane is determined to fulfill her late father's dream and enter the cave of Tynan Selvantyr, a legendary adventurer who, upon his death long ago, not only sealed the cave but placed a curse on it. Unfortunately, she is not the only one seeking entry into the cave and, inside she meets Theo, a young thief as well as Tynan's ghost. When the curse is triggered, the three are forced to flee the cave and find themselves hunted by those who want what Aeryn has found and they will stop at nothing to recover it.Into the Darkness by author A M Rycroft is reminiscent of early sword & sorcery tales or perhaps more accurately, Dungeons & Dragons RPGs. We've got a sell-sword, a thief, a sorcerer, cleric, and ranger. There is also a vampire but she fills more the role of fighter than bloodsucker. However, Rycroft manages to flesh them out, making them more than just simple one-dimensional stock characters. There is also some impressive world-building and battle scenes. There were times when the story dragged but, fortunately, there is enough action leading to the final battle to keep the reader's attention. Overall, a satisfying read closing off enough storylines so that the reader doesn't feel frustrated while leaving it open to a sequel, one I look forward to reading.3.5","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13E2I817M7GFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YHTILI8#wasThisHelpful","R13E2I817M7GFO","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Leon combines Greek, Arabian, and Celtic myths and legends with modern America to create an action-packed urban fantasy.  Told in the first person by Steve/Diomedes, he is just enough of a smarta** to give the story a nice touch of humour and although there is a love interest, romance takes a very far backseat to action.

"It is 1989 and retired police inspector, Auguste Jovert, has received a letter from a woman in Algiers claiming to be his daughter.  He throws the letter in the trash but then stumbles into the path of a car, breaking his leg and keeping him home bound. Two days later, a new neighbour appears at his door - Tadashi Omura, a former professor of law in Japan who relates to him the story of Katsuo Ikeda, a brilliant but arrogant writer who was once his best friend and the women in his life. Entwined in his tale is Jovert's own story of the Algerian woman he loved and lost.The Snow Kimono by author Mark Henshaw is a hard book to categorize or describe. This is a complex tale that seems to unfold in layers - sometimes seemingly unrelated but always bringing the reader closer to the heart of the story. It is, as the narrator describes it, like a Japanese puzzle:`Each piece is considered individually. No shape is repeated, unless for some special purpose. Some pieces are small, others large, but all are calculated to deceive, to lead one astray, in order to make the solution of the puzzle as difficult, as challenging, as possible... how a puzzle is made, and how it is solved, reveals some greater truth about the world.' Suffice it to say that its hauntingly beautiful prose captivates the reader as the various aspects of these different lives unfold.  There is a lyrical rhythm to the story that kept me enthralled throughout. It is a book rich with beautifully crafted imagery and sentences that demand to be read out loud. It is also, for me, that rare book that I know I will read and read again and it will never fail to draw me in each and every time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O034I6CJWM77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KK3NT6E#wasThisHelpful","R3O034I6CJWM77","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fall is the 16th in author John Lescroart's Dismas Hardy legal thrillers series and, in this outing, Dismas hands the legal torch over to his daughter, Rebecca AKA The Becks. Anlya Johnson, a pretty 17-year-old African American girl in foster care, dies after falling from a San Francisco overpass. Although there are no eyewitnesses to the event, a man claimed to have heard a struggle right before her fall. Greg Treadway, a white teacher and volunteer advocate for foster kids is the last person to be seen with her in a restaurant and, according to witnesses, they were holding hands. Not only that but another witness identifies him as the white man seen walking away from the underpass after her fall. Lately, there have been charges made that African American victims don't get equal treatment in the courts causing prosecutors to rush to charge Treadway.After meeting Rebecca and talking to her about his chances, he asks her to represent him. Fresh out of law school, she has no experience in criminal law but, after talking to her father, she decides to go ahead. Fortunately, most of the evidence seems circumstantial. There are other possible culprits who, in their rush to prosecute, the opposition ignored.  Unfortunately, the old defense of SODDIT or `some other dude did it' is no longer an acceptable defense without direct or circumstantial links to the crime.  Even with Dismas' help, Rebecca may have just bitten off a lot more than she can chew.It's been a while since I read one of Lescroart's novels and after reading this one, I'm wondering why. The book is well-plotted with plenty of twists and turns.  The topical storyline makes for a very engrossing read. It gives an interesting perspective on the question of race within the judicial system as well as the rush to justice and trial by public opinion. My one criticism - I did find the last part a bit contrived. Still, this was only a mild irritant and the book kept my attention throughout so if you are a fan of Lescroart's or legal thrillers in general, The Fall gets a high recommendation from me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6E47R3XAF2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1RZL2#wasThisHelpful","R2R6E47R3XAF2J","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the opening of Rage Against the Dying, an older woman is attacked by a serial killer who has a `thing' for granny types. Thing is though this older woman isn't your usual middle-aged victim - she's 59-year-old Brigid Quinn, retired FBI agent, who is more than a match for any predator despite her gray hair. When the proverbial fan gets hit, Quinn is left with a dead guy and, although it was a clear case of self-defense, she is afraid that if she explains what happened to her new husband and ex-priest he couldn't handle it. So she walks away hoping that somehow her role won't be discovered - of course, this will come back to bite her.Then she receives a call from agent Laura Coleman about another crime, the Route 66 killer, `the one that got away' in Quinn's long career and who has haunted her ever since. A suspect has been apprehended who seems to have real knowledge about the murders, stuff that was never released to the public. However, Coleman doesn't think he did it and, after meeting him, Quinn also has doubts. Now, Coleman is missing and Quinn is convinced that she is another victim of Route 66 but she can't convince anyone of the fact. Worse, she is now a suspect in the murder of the man she killed and, since she not only didn't report the incident, she has lied about her role, it's going to be damn near impossible to claim self-defense.  She is forced to go on the run from both the FBI and a serial killer stalker hoping she can solve the case before one or the other catches up with her.Rage Against the Dying by author Becky Masterson makes for some very fun reading mainly down to Quinn who makes it clear that older women can be just as interesting and feisty, not to mention hot, as the usual young heroines of thrillers - she is, by her own definition, a kick-ass-take-names kind of person and she lives up to the hype.  My one criticism - I admit I found the part about her doomed efforts to keep her encounter with the serial killer from her husband somewhat problematic - one would think that someone who is married to an FBI agent, even a retired one, would have some idea of what they do for a living. But that aside, Rage Against the Dying is a real roller coaster of a ride. Overall, a pretty decent read.3.5","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F76GM2ATTKSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AW0DM8U#wasThisHelpful","R3F76GM2ATTKSK","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loving Day - an annual celebration held on June 12, the anniversary of the 1967 United States Supreme Court decision Loving Vs Virginia which struck down all anti-miscegenation laws remaining in sixteen US states citing ""There can be no doubt that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the equal protection clause"".  -WikipediaWarren Duffy's life has not been going well. He has just come out of a rancorous divorce and he's behind on his alimony; he makes his living doing illustrations for comics with African American storylines which means he doesn't make much money; and his father recently died and left him a dilapidated old mansion in the middle of one of the most crime-ridden areas in Philadelphia. He has never felt comfortable fitting in as a black man in America. His mother was African American and his father was Irish and he is very light-skinned, something that has always made him feel insecure because, although he has always identified as black:""I am a racial optical illusion. I am as visually duplicitous as the illustration of the young beauty that's also the illustration of the old hag...The people who see me as white always will, and will think it's madness that anyone else could come to any other conclusion...The people who see me as black cannot imagine how a sane, intelligent person could be so blind not to understand this, despite my pale-skinned presence.""And if things aren't sucking enough, he is heckled by a woman at a comic book convention for denying the white side of his biracial heritage. She tells him he's the worst sunflower she has ever seen. Warren doesn't know what a sunflower is but he's damn sure he's being insulted - which kind of makes the fact that he finds her extremely attractive a bit, well, difficult. So when she stalks off after her harangue, he decides to go after her. As he searches for her in the crowd, he is approached by an old Jewish man and his sixteen-year-old granddaughter who claim that Warren is her father - maybe things are finally starting to look up in his otherwise sad life.Author Mat Johnson is an expert at satire and at uncovering the contradictions and confusions inherent in our sense of self. He is also a master at creating characters who are flawed, complex and who grow as the story and their lives change - Duffy makes a very sympathetic narrator as he tries and seemingly fails to fit in comfortably anywhere despite all his efforts to be not only what others expect of him but what he wants for himself. Other characters are less complex but, given that Duffy is telling the tale, that makes sense - we see them as he sees them. But it is with his relationship with his teenage daughter that this novel truly shines at least for me. Despite all his trials and tribulations, Duffy never gives up in his attempts to win her over because once he meets her, she becomes the most important person in his life.Loving Day is at once poignant and humorous as it takes a satirical look at what it means to be biracial in America today, what constitutes `family', and the desire we all have to find our own identity and a place we belong.  Like all good satire, it will likely amuse you and frustrate you in almost equal parts. One thing for sure, though, it will make you think long after you have finished reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F66Q5ZC5A02T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812993454#wasThisHelpful","R1F66Q5ZC5A02T","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Dr Doob, who is kind of a Neil DeGrasse Tyson kind of guy, an astrophysicist with his own popular TV show, calculates, that in approximately two years, pieces of the moon will start entering earth's atmosphere at a remarkable rate of speed, force, and number and it is very unlikely that anything or anyone can survive this `hard rain'. Governments throughout the world hold a lottery to save at least some remnants of humanity by sending a few lucky souls representing as diverse a gene pool as possible (except Venezuela) up to a Cloud Ark beside a group of real science guys. Everything seems to be going, if not swimmingly, surprisingly well until politics rears its ugly head led by an extremely egocentric and cunning ex-President of the US and soon chaos ensues eventually leading to the demise of all but eight women, one of whom is postmenopausal resulting in the seven Eves of the title whose job it is to repopulate the human race and eventually the earth. But they will not allow a genetic lottery to decide the future of mankind:""What keeps us alive isn't bravery, or athleticism, or any of the other skills that were valuable in a caveman society. It's our ability to master complex technological skills. It's our ability to be nerds. We need nerds.""All of that's in the first 500 pages.Fast forward 5000 years and to the last 300 pages: the human descendants of the Eves have survived and thrived but have remained as seven distinct races who have divided into two antagonistic groups.  They have begun to terReform the earth to make it eventually inhabitable for the populations. However, earth may hold secrets that neither group had anticipated and, in their push to gain and maintain control over larger areas of the surface, the two sides are in a race to be the first to uncover these secrets.No one does speculative fiction like Stephenson and, if at times, the characters seem to take a far-back seat to the science and if the science becomes at times, somewhat overwhelming for those of us who are not science nerds, well, isn't that the point? We rely on science daily for our very survival, something we rarely notice except in the case of a major disaster and they don't get any bigger than an exploding moon. I will admit I did wonder, for example, if the moon exploded wouldn't there be more immediate concerns like tides and gravity and stuff but putting that aside, I found all of this fascinating even the parts I admittedly didn't fully understand. Stephenson's visions of this future world pushed my imagination in wholly new directions. And if I tend to feel that a world made up exclusively of nerds (and only science nerds at that) might be a bit, well, socially awkward, it certainly makes for some very original and exciting reading.Despite its length, Seveneves is one rollicking adrenaline-fueled ride. In the immortal words of the Man in the Magic Mirror `Be prepared to be amazed beyond all expectations'. After all, that is what Stephenson does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R183YP9D7LBZ3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZWV8JO#wasThisHelpful","R183YP9D7LBZ3I","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An illustrator journeys across most of the globe searching for dragons. In Search of Lost Dragons is the journal of his travels and his discoveries.I can think of only one word to describe In Search of Lost Dragons: beautiful. Every page is a feast for the eyes. I do have one complaint although it is more a personal thing than an actual criticism - I received this as an ebook ARC from Netgalley (and I really have to thank Netgalley and Diamond Book Distributors for that) and although the font which is meant to look like the scribblings of a Victorian writer, complements the art, it was, at times, very difficult for my less than perfect eyesight. Some of it I was unable to read at all and, at times, I had to put the book down to rest my eyes from the strain. But that's just me and I suspect it wouldn't be a problem for most people. Besides, the art is so visually stunning, the book could have been written in ancient Samarian and I would have still loved it.  I would definitely recommend buying it for anyone who loves art, dragons, or graphic novels preferably in hard cover - I know I intend to because this is the kind of book that you want to be able to peruse and enjoy more than once.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUH7FCVI632GK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606904647#wasThisHelpful","RUH7FCVI632GK","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like so many other readers, fairy tales were a huge part of my childhood. They were my cautionary tales, my morality plays, and my protection against the evil that lurked under the bed.  As much as I loved the sanitized versions in the Disney movies, it was the older tales in which there was no huntsman to save Little Red and Bluebeard had ways to deal with curious wives. Even as I grew out of childhood, I never completely outgrew the magic of fairytales. So when a few years ago, a treasure trove of fairy tales were discovered in a vault that had been locked for 150 years, I, like so many others, was thrilled at the prospect of reading them. The tales were originally collected by Franz Xaver Schonwerth in Bavaria in the 1850s. According to the Introduction, he wanted to preserve them in their original form so what we get here are the tales as they were first told to him and as he wrote them down. They were beautifully translated by Harvard Professor and folklorist, Maria Tatar.The Turnip Princess offers 72 of these rediscovered stories. Many are familiar and are clearly regional variations on familiar tales like Cinderella and Snow White but many like the title story are completely unique. The stories are collected into six parts, each representing the type of tale: animals, magic, nature, legends etc. and they are all quite short, some as little as a paragraph. There is also an introduction that explains the history and significance of the discovery and, at the end, a synopsis of the tales.As is pointed out in the introduction, fairy tales were not originally for children but were `cleaned up' in later years to be more child-friendly. Thankfully, these tales have not been sanitized for a younger audience so that we not only get to see fairy tales as they were originally told but, with this, we are given a better understanding of the original audience - there are, for example some interesting scatological references in some of the tales that suggest that a 19th c. audience appreciated a good `fart' joke as much as we do.  There is also an interesting amount of gender-bending in many of these tales so that Cinderella becomes `Cinderfella' as well as several overt Christian references often linked with more pagan imagery. As Professor Tatar says, these stories are `almost on steroids' full of sex and violence and they will completely change your perspective on `happily ever after'","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V0Y5X5LST8MF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143107429#wasThisHelpful","R3V0Y5X5LST8MF","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bone Tree by author Greg Iles is the second in a trilogy and picks up where the first book, Natchez Burning ended.  Penn Cage's father, Dr Tom Cage is still on the run for the suspected murder of Viola Turner and now that of a state trooper. Penn and his fiance had only recently escaped from an almost certain death at the hands of Brody Royal, the multi-millionaire backer of the Double Eagles, a violent but powerful splinter group of the KKK. FBI Agent John Kaiser is convinced that Frank Knox, the founder of the Double Eagles, was the real shooter in the JFK assassination and is determined to find the evidence. It has been rumoured for decades that this evidence as well as the bodies of many of the mostly black victims of the Eagles are hidden inside a huge cypress tree in the Lusahatcha Swamp known as the Bone Tree but so far, no one outside of the Eagles or their many supporters has been able to locate it. Despite every effort by Penn and Kaiser to find the truth, the Eagles, now led by Forrest Knox, seem to be one step ahead of them.Coming in at just over 800 pages (just slightly longer than Natchez Burning), The Bone Tree is definitely not a sleepy afternoon's pleasure but it is well worth the read.  Although the story is set in the modern south, it combines historical details and figures of the Civil Rights-era south with many of the conspiracy theories related to the assassination of President Kennedy to produce a tale that is at once compelling and emotionally charged. Its portrait of the racially motivated killings of the old south and the people who committed them is chilling and more so because Iles gives it a real sense of authenticity. That he then puts these same people in positions of power in the present only makes the tale more gripping as the power struggle between these old-line racists and the few who oppose them ramps up. Iles really knows how to build tension and keep the reader completely engaged and invested in the outcome, not just wanting but needing to know the fate of the many characters.  The story ends on a bit of a cliffhanger so now we have to wait a bit longer to know the end of the story - probably a good thing because after this roller coaster of a ride, the reader may feel like they need to lie down for a bit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FBAUIHRR8LBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M70YWKK#wasThisHelpful","R3FBAUIHRR8LBD","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When 17-year-old Francie receives an urgent phone call from her great-aunts, she immediately flies from New York to Minneapolis to check on them. According to them, there has been a rash of odd accidents on Enchantment Island where they live... except they're convinced these were no accidents and what's worse, they're convinced that they'll be next. Francie, a struggling actor, had once played a detective on TV and now her aunts think she's a real PI and they want her to investigate. Although she is sure her aunts, who have always been a little eccentric are just being paranoid, she promises to look into it. Soon she begins to suspect that they may be onto something - not only are there a whole lot of very weird but deadly accidents but it seems like all of the victims had recently sold their property to a local real estate broker with the proviso that they can remain on their properties for the rest of their lives. She soon discovers that many of the other inhabitants have also sold their properties with the same proviso. In fact, there are few other holdouts besides her aunts and, as the body count rises, Francie begins to suspect she is in a race against time if she is to save not only her aunts but the island itself.Despite the high body count, Enchantment Lake by author Margi Preus is aimed at a fairly young YA audience (11 - 16) and perhaps even younger. It reminded me a great deal of the old Trixie Belden books that were popular with girls in the mid-20th c.:  the murders themselves are not portrayed; there is little violence until near the end when the perpetrator is finally unmasked and that is quickly dealt with by Francie with the aid of a couple of friends; and none of the main characters dies. There is a bit of romance here but it is definitely of the G-rating variety.It is always hard to know how to rate a book like this since I am definitely way outside the target audience. Not to say I didn't enjoy the story. Francie is likeable and, if at times, she seems a bit obtuse like `go for a boat ride to the middle of the lake alone at night with a suspected killer' obtuse, she is feisty and fun to watch as she struggles to play the role of a real detective to please her aunts. As an adult and having lived fairly close to northern Minnesota on the other side of the border, I particularly enjoyed Preus' descriptions of the beauty of the area - certainly more than I did the mystery which I suspect due to the age of the intended audience, never seems to engender much tension. However, the story is very well-written and I'm guessing it will have strong appeal with its target audience so, with that in mind, 3.5 stars it is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D8E0IF4L9ELV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3UMTUW#wasThisHelpful","R2D8E0IF4L9ELV","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""His thoughts shifted to the Reykjavik nights, so strangely sunny and bright, yet in another sense so dark and desperate.""When the drowned body of a homeless man is found by three boys, no one seems to care. After all, derelicts are found dead all the time and chances are he just passed out drunk and unfortunately landed in water.  But Erlander, a young policeman working the night shift in Reykjavik, was one of the first on the scene and he knew the man, Hannibal slightly, and part of him sympathized with him, even, on some level, respected him. Erlander was less convinced that Hannibal's death was an accident. He had heard Hannibal claim that someone had tried to set the cellar he lived in on fire but his landlord believed he was responsible and had evicted him.One of the reasons Hannibal's death got such little interest from the police was the disappearance of a woman on her way home from a night out with her friends on the same night. It is assumed that she left on her own volition and that it is probably a suicide. Erlander has a personal fascination with missing people, has read everything about this disappearance and is not so sure it's that simple.It has been a year since these incidents and Erlander is still dissatisfied with the official verdicts. Although, he isn't assigned to either case, he finds himself investigating both in his spare time. Soon, he becomes convinced that neither of these deaths was as simple as everyone else thinks and he sets out to prove it.Reykjavik Nights by Icelandic author Arnaldur Indridason and translated by Victoria Cribb is not nearly as dark as most Nordic crime fiction I have read. Unlike much Nordic noir, it focuses less on the darker angels of man's nature and more `but for the grace of God'. There is little violence and much of the story is taken up by Erlander's investigation and his thoughts on the two victims. Despite this, it is a very enjoyable and engrossing read and much of this is down to the character of Erlander whose sense of compassion towards Hannibal and the other homeless vagrants he interviews as well as his concern for the many damaged people he meets on the job kept me enthralled throughout.  Don't get me wrong - I am not suggesting Erlander is the only reason to read this book. There are plenty of other really good reasons like it's well-written and well-plotted with the kind of clean precise language that keeps the pace moving and the reader engaged. It's just that I'm a sucker for sympathetic characters.The story is set in 1974 and is a prequel to the Erlander series by Indridasan. I was unaware of this fact before I began the book but it reads very well as a standalone. However, I will definitely be rectifying my oversight as quickly as possible and am already looking forward to reading the other books in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU9ACQE53B8MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L57BHIG#wasThisHelpful","RU9ACQE53B8MH","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Things had not been going well for the Tierneys in Manhattan. Ben, a writer, was suffering from writers block; his wife, Caroline has been diagnosed as bipolar; eight-year-old Charlie was being bullied at school; and Bud's birth meant a need of more space. When they purchase The Crofts, a slightly dilapidated but still beautiful house in the small village of Swannhaven, they are determined to make a new better life here.  At first, things go well as the family settles into village life.  Ben begins to delve into the history of the town where his ancestors were among the first settlers giving him new material for his novel; renovating the house as well as the teas an elderly neighbour is making for her seem to be helping Caroline control her disease; and, if Charlie isn't making any friends at school, he loves exploring the woods surrounding the house. But then strange frightening things begin to happen and it all starts to fall apart. Ben finds a deer head left on their porch, Caroline begins to act strangely causing Ben to lose patience with her, and Charlie is becoming withdrawn and secretive. There is an old saying in Swannhaven - ""demons in the wood and devils at the door"" - and Ben is beginning to believe that there is more than a grain of truth in it. He begins to believe that the move was a mistake but winter has come and it may already be too late for the Tierneys - winter holds particular significance for Swannhaven and it definitely isn't good for its newest family.Alfred Hitchcock once said that `there is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it'. Clearly, author Brendan Duffy shares this sentiment and works it beautifully in his debut novel, House of Echoes. The story begins quietly creating an image of a family healing thanks in great part to the friendly and welcoming village. It builds slowly, offering a sense of new beginnings to the family but slowly tearing it away and replacing it with tension and terror. This slow buildup makes the story that much more chilling. House of Echoes is one creepy and atmospheric tale - it may start slow, but, as it moves towards the terrifying denouement, the anticipation will keep you on the edge of your seat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28EMJ3R919XDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178119#wasThisHelpful","R28EMJ3R919XDN","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charles Brockden (not his real name) is the owner of several bookstores dedicated to the mystery novel. He has acquired these stores through unconventional but perhaps fitting means. Now he has found a new store that he just has to have. Unfortunately, the present owner isnt ready to give it up but, then, Charles was never one to take no for an answer.Im not usually a fan of the short story  unless its really well-done, it always seems at least to me that theres just too much missing for me to feel satisfied after finishing one. But Mystery, Inc. is Joyce Carol Oates entry in the Bibliomysteries series for Mysteriouspress and her typical clean, precise language makes it a complete and fully self-contained tale examining the inner workings of the obsessive mind and the lengths it will go to obtain the object of its obsession. There is even a touch of the macabre to ramp up the creep factor. The story, to be sure, is predictable in the way that, say, Poes The Cask of Amontillado is predictable  there is no doubt that we, the reader, know long before the main character what is going to happen  but this foreshadowing just makes the tale that much more chilling.Mystery, Inc. is both a satisfactory murder mystery and an homage to the murder mystery from Poe to Chandler and to the bookstores dedicated to them.  The pace is more like a slow-acting poison than a quick thrust to the heart with a sharp knife but that just serves to give the goose bumps more time to rise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BMT8TW6VNNB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRP519O#wasThisHelpful","R1BMT8TW6VNNB8","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son is in the Canadian Military. He is also an atheist. I had never considered that that fact would matter. After all, isn't the purpose of the Military, at least ostensibly, to protect liberty and doesn't that include freedom from as well as freedom of religion?  One would think that if anyone should enjoy these freedoms, it would be the men and women who are willing to risk their lives for little pay to protect them. So when I saw this book on Netgalley, I thought it might give me some insight even though it is about the US Military.Author Bonnie Weinstein and her husband Michael founded the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) in 2005 and since then, the Foundation has been nominated six times for the Nobel Peace Prize. However, as Ms Weinstein writes`...it has taken an extreme amount of intestinal fortitude to stay the course. We fight against those who, at worse, seem hell-bent on dismantling our Constitution, and at best, seem to have little idea of what they are talking about.'The book, itself, is a very quick read divided between letters from some of the people who object to the Foundation and a list of some of the important successes it has achieved.The letters are divided into categories and go from bad to worse .  Many of the writers seem to aim their vitriol at Jewish people in general, believing, based solely on their name, that somehow the Weinsteins are motivated by a Jewish anti-Christian bias despite the work of the MRFF in aid of soldiers of all faiths or none including Muslims, atheists, and both Protestants and Catholics who do not share the same beliefs as the far right Christians and do not enjoy being a captive audience to the proselytizing of both fellow enlisted men and officers. The anti-semitism, Islamaphobia, racism, and gay bashing of these letters are, to say the least, shocking especially as it is all coming from self-avowed Christians.The worst letters are from the far right Christians who believe that the United States is a Christian nation and that the purpose of the Military is to bring their  (ie far-right Dominionist) Christian values to the `lost' nations and peoples of the world even at the end of a gun.  If these letters are examples of how they want the world to look, it is truly a terrifying place. I would give an example of one of thee letters but I doubt they would pass Amazon's guidelines.Many of these letter writers make it clear that they consider themselves the only Real Americans and any effort to curtail their proselytizing is, in their opinion, tyranny and they refuse to be tied by it.  Suffice it to say that these Real Americans also won't be tied to the tyranny of spell check or rules of grammar. By the time I finished reading these letters, I literally felt ill - I wanted to take a shower and wash my eyes and brain out. I found myself thinking (and hoping) that the writers of these letters must suffer from a mental illness and that they make up only a tiny fraction of the American population. Nothing, judging from these letters, is too vile, too beyond the pale in the fight to protect the rights of these so-called Christians to force their brand onto those who don't share their beliefs.Clearly, this book is not for everyone. The Religious Right will obviously hate it and those outside Military families may not see its value although, given the influence the religious Right has gained in the political arena I would suggest otherwise. I am not sure I can say I enjoyed reading this book but I'm glad I did. For those of us with relatives in the Military who hold different religious views than those of the Right-wing Evangelists, this makes for a very interesting and eye-opening read but, if you do decide to read it, I hope you have a strong stomach.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKAZT2H39NCRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940207835#wasThisHelpful","RKAZT2H39NCRS","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Confession time: I studied history at university and one of the first thing I learned -  you can't judge the past by the present for a whole lot of reasons not least of which is that they didn't have the same access as us to, well, history. Which brings me to the recent book by Nobel Prize winning theoretical physicist Steven Weinberg, To Explain the World.  Weinberg isn't an historian and feels no need to follow this rule. In fact, he rejects it out of hand which meant at least to me once I got over the shock of his approach some rather unorthodox but still interesting thoughts on the history of science. Take for instance his views on Aristotle versus Plato:""I confess that I find Aristotle frequently tedious, in a way that Plato is not but although often wrong Aristotle is not silly, in the way that Plato sometimes is.""He begins his foray into the history of science in classical Greece. He feels the early Greek philosophers were arrogant and smug in their ruminations about science while lacking any proper methodology or, to be precise, any methodology. To make matters worse, they were almost invariably wrong even about things they could have easily verified if they tried doing some real work outside of their heads.  He is more impressed with the Hellenistic Greeks who actually developed methods to calculate such things as the size of the earth and were surprisingly accurate in their calculations.  After Greece, he looks at other non-western countries only as they influenced western thought and even then pretty much dismisses any contribution by them to science.  The one exception to this is the Arab scientists who made some very important scientific advances.His main concern, however, remains the west and he has some interesting views on many of the thinkers who are often seen as the precursors of modern science. For example, he admires Galileo and Isaac Newton despite some of their more wacky theories but he clearly thinks Descartes gets way too much praise for his contributions to science. He also limits his ruminations pretty much to pre-Enlightenment and to physics and astronomy.One thing I learned way back in those halcyon university days: all history has biases if only in the facts an historian chooses to look at and regardless of whether I agree with his tendency to make judgmental statements about his subjects and their lack of real scientific methods, it certainly made for some interesting reading. Admittedly, I am not a scientist although I find it intriguing but it's hard to study any history without encountering science eg Newton, not Luther, is considered by many historians as the beginning of Early Modernity. I will also admit I didn't always understand the science as Weinberg laid it out, especially the astronomy. But, despite his unorthodox approach to history and my lack of knowledge on the subject, it was definitely fascinating and more than a little enlightening to read a history of science written by a scientist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN5RYKO1NM8JR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFG18Q4#wasThisHelpful","RN5RYKO1NM8JR","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the Water's Edge by author Sara Gruen is the story of three spoiled rich brats who make a scene at a party, are disowned by their fabulously wealthy parents, and decide to go off to Scotland in the middle of WWII to discover the Loch Ness monster.Okay, so I might be understating things a bit and it probably sounds like I didn't like the book when I actually enjoyed it a lot. I've seen it compared to many things both good and bad and some of them were genius but, to me, it felt like a modern fairy tale. Don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about those modern romance fairy tales Hollywood constantly makes for us womenfolk, I'm talking more Grimm which, admittedly, are sanitized versions of earlier folk tales.  I know, sounds like a bit of a stretch but hear me out:1-after being abandoned by her guardians or inlaws for an infraction outside of her control, an orphan (well, okay father's alive but uninterested) is captured by two evil witch types ie her rich spoiled husband and his even richer and more spoiled BFF who, having her under a kind of sleeping spell, take her to a far-away and dangerous land (Scotland during WWII) and keep her locked up in a tower or, in this case, a hotel2-in a very short space of time, she is awakened or to be more accurate is shown the error of her ways by the kind and gentle denizens of this land and she makes everyone around her love her even though she's a bit of an insipid passive weakling because fairy tale heroines are almost always passive `good girls'. Although they cannot openly free her, the denizens take pity on her especially after she offers to help around their cottage or, in this case, said hotel. Some of these good folk must suffer but only because they attempt to abandon their proper place in the story - in this case, fall for a Canadian soldier3-which brings us to Prince Charming who any Snow White must fall in love with suddenly and without any real explanation of why and who is in disguise as a peasant, farmer, sheepherder or bartender and hotel manager but turns out to be a prince or Lord (because class structure and all) who rescues her from the evil doers who are punished quickly as in two paragraphs quickly and everyone except said evil doers lives happily ever after.4-there are supernatural elements: magic, giants, or, here, a dragon AKA the Loch Ness monster but they are mostly incidental to the real purpose of the tale5- which is to give the audience both a morality and cautionary tale meant to warn of the dangers lurking outside the pale whether in the woods or relationships for innocents but promising that, in the end, there will always be a happy ending if the innocent remains or, in this case, becomes pure and goodAnyway, that's my take-away from this book. As I said, I did like it a lot. It's very well-written and Gruen has a deft hand with description - her Scotland even in wartime is a magical place. And, if it's a bit black and white with mostly one-dimensional characters who rarely depart from their role as hero or villain and if it's implausible in many parts, well, that's the way of fairy tales. On the other hand, I might just be over-thinking this whole thing and it's simply a very well-written romance novel.3.5","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R265SDS7COECA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0286XW#wasThisHelpful","R265SDS7COECA","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But when he receives a strange invitation from the Colonel to join him and his family for Christmas at their remote mansion, he doesn't hesitate because there must be something terribly wrong for the Colonel to summon him. Despite a raging snowstorm, he rushes to the manse but when he arrives, the Colonel has disappeared.  As the storm worsens preventing anyone from leaving, it becomes clear that there is someone or something trapped here with them and it's very very hungry.The Dark Side of the Road is the latest by author Simon R Green and introduces his new character Ishmael Jones.

This comparison is, in many ways, a fair one what with the setting in a remote country manor; a dinner party among the gentry; everyone trapped inside by a snowstorm; a rising body count; the fact that Ishmael is not a native of Britain albeit from a bit further than Belgium; and the gathering of suspects in the drawing room to unmask the evil-doer; well, and there's that subtitle, A country house murder mystery with a supernatural twist which, if you'll pardon the pun, is kind of a dead give-away.Despite the `whodunnit' quality, Dark Side is pure Simon R Green. The tale is told by Jones in a first person narrative and, because of his need for secrecy, the reader can't always be sure he's reliable.  Nor is he much of a detective, depending more on an extremely good sense of smell, strength and hearing rather than any `little grey cells'. He is, however, like all of Green's heroes, wittily sardonic, making this a whole lot of fun to read. Definitely for fans of Green's other series or urban fantasies in general.3.5","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VY7EEE0PS6C0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0727883887#wasThisHelpful","R3VY7EEE0PS6C0","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Skull Throne is the fourth installment in The Demon Cycle series by Peter V Brett and it takes up where The Daylight War stopped with the battle between Arlen and Ahmann which ended abruptly when they threw themselves off the cliff leaving the world without a Deliverer and the Skull Throne without an occupant.  The struggle for control of the throne pits Ahmann's sons against each other. In her attempt to prevent chaos, Inevera uses the dice to convince Jayan, her first-born son to lead an invasion against Docktown, an event that will have far-reaching consequences.Meanwhile, Leesha and Rojer are in the Hollow with both of his wives. Leesha's relationship with Thamos has developed into love and she is fearful of what will happen when her baby is born and it becomes clear that it isn't Thamos'.  Rojer has problems of his own when Jasin, the man who killed his mentor and left him for dead, arrives to summon Leesha and her people to Angiers, a summons fraught with danger for everyone.Okay, I know that all of this may not sound terribly interesting but I'm trying to avoid spoilers here and it's hard to talk about this book without giving too much away. But trust me, if you've been following this series, you are really going to enjoy this installment. I even found the relationship parts interesting and I usually skip over them. My one criticism: there is very little about Arlen here and his presence is missed. Still, there is so much else going on that this was just a tiny irritation.For me, The Demon Cycle by Brett had started out brilliantly with the first book, The Warded Man but lost some of its lustre with the following two books. Don't get me wrong - I still loved the series as evidenced by the fact I continued to read it - it's just that the first book was so dang good, it eclipsed the following two books. The Skull Throne brings back a great deal of the shine - it is chock-full of twists and intrigues and I am really looking forward to the next book in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVPDUA0B6DGIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LYXV5U6#wasThisHelpful","RVPDUA0B6DGIA","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Thomas Pitt is ordered to protect Sofia Delacruz, an ex-pat returned to London from Spain to preach her own brand of religion, he is less than enthusiastic. He considers it a job for the police, not Special Branch. But her preaching has gained her as many enemies as followers and, with the political situation somewhat heated between England and Spain, it could cause an international incident should anything untoward happen to her.Thomas takes the job reluctantly but, when she and two of her followers disappear and then the two followers are found brutally murdered, he must rush against time to discover what has happened to them. Soon, he finds himself entangled in a web of plots, schemes, and lies with implications that could bring down the British economy.The Angel Court Affair is not perfect. At times it felt rushed and it was very clear who dunnit if not why they dunnit it rather quickly. However, having said that, I can also say I enjoyed this novel a lot. To be honest, I don't read Perry for her plots or, for that matter, the mystery. I read them for the characters and for the sense of passion and empathy she always imparts to them. They are flawed but in ways we can relate to. And I read her for the portrait she draws of the period about which she is writing. She understands the mores and morals of the era and she rarely deviates from them. She has a deep understanding of the people and the roles they play in society whether by choice or by situation. Most of all, I read her because her stories are always well-written and never fail to keep the reader engaged and entertained and The Angel Court Affair is no exception to this rule.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R4CLLPJXB40D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391356#wasThisHelpful","R3R4CLLPJXB40D","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is 1944 and two British pilots, James and Bryan, are on a reconnaissance mission over Germany when they are shot down. To escape capture they jump aboard a train that turns out to be carrying wounded SS officers. The pair take the place of two of the officers hoping for a chance to escape unnoticed later. Unfortunately, the chance doesn't come and they have to act as if they have had some sort of mental breakdown. Their act is so convincing that they are taken to The Alphabet House so named because of the Nazis' penchant for bookkeeping, giving everything including different types of psychogenic ailments like those suffered by the inhabitants of The Alphabet House an alphabetical and numerical designation.  The two continue to feign mental illness, an act that is aided by drugs, and electric shock. Soon, though, they discover that they are not the only malingerers and these others are not above murder to protect themselves from discovery.Eventually, Bryan escapes alone. The story then switches to 1972. Bryan is a successful doctor and businessman. He had spent years searching for James after the war but eventually gave up. However, when he meets a man who is from the area of The Alphabet House, he hires him to find any information he can about any survivors. With his information, Bryan is on the trail again but rather than James, he finds the other malingerers who benefitted financially from the war and are determined to stop anyone from uncovering their crimes.This is the first book I have read by author Jussi Adler-Olsen and, as it turns out, it was the first book he wrote; it is, however, the first time it's been released in North America so firsts all around. Despite its setting, The Alphabet House is not, according to Adler-Olsen, a war story. It's also not a perfect book. At times, it strains credulity almost to the breaking point and it says a great deal about the writing and the sheer adrenaline rush of the story that, despite the occasional `huh', it never interferes with the enjoyment of the book.  This is one edge-of-your-seat, nail-bitingly intense, unputdownable and a whole lot of other adjectives and adverbs that can be used to describe one hell of a psychological thriller. In other words, I liked it a lot.  This may have been my first book by Adler-Olsen but it will definitely not be my last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15E72OQD5YOR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9AXWKK#wasThisHelpful","R15E72OQD5YOR7","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Justis Fearsson is a private investigator. He is also a weremyste with some fairly formidable magical abilities. Unfortunately, these abilities come with some fairly nasty side effects like he tends to lose his mind during a full moon, a problem which led to him having to leave the police force and which will likely become permanent.When he is hired to look into the death of the daughter of a prominent politician, he begins to see similarities to an unsolved case from his time on the force, the Blind Angel murders. But the deeper he digs, it becomes apparent that the perpetrator has his own magical abilities and they put Justis' to shame. Worse, the perp always seems to be one step ahead and is willing to kill anyone who gets in his way and that includes Justis.Spell Blind by author David Coe is a pretty decent urban fantasy. It starts out a bit slow and I found the romance part somewhat distracting- I mean, will someone explain to me the whole `we just met so I think I love you' thing because it seems to be a requisite part of way too many urban fantasies - but that's just me and I tend to be a bit of a curmudgeon. Anyway, put that aside and once I got into the book, I quite enjoyed it. It has a good storyline, an interesting magic system, and Justis is a likeable character. If you're a fan of Jim Butcher or if you like Coe's other fantasy books, this one should be right up your alley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W1F017A1IEDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R33IE9Q#wasThisHelpful","R1W1F017A1IEDF","AADTY431R5CUK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AADTY431R5CUK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The game strategy finally defeats the player by overwhelming the board with more and more targets so there's no chance of actually accomplishing or ""winning"", save just accumulating tokens to buy different screens. The same challenges & strategy remains. Regardless of acquired skill, defeat is inevitable. Collecting coins is the goal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CCCXVFM2BPTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005V58Z8I#wasThisHelpful","R2CCCXVFM2BPTY","A2E91MDKANPJ63","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E91MDKANPJ63?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Installed & played on my Kindle Fire HD with no problems thus far. Early evaluation doesn't lend itself to comprehensive application. Regardless, the game delivers as promised. Graphics are good. Game play moves as expected but controls are a little flaky. It plays like all 1st-person shooters, perhaps better than most, same weapons array, commentary, selections, missions, etc. Yet more sanitized violence. The aerial view reduces 3D rendering so the game acts more responsive than most of this genre.I'm a little wary of the permissions. Since there's no team play, they seem a bit excessive.

"I have F18 CL1 as well. This version II is visually more impressive than the 1st, but at a performance price. Installed on my Kindle Fire HD, control response is sluggish. Loading a scenario or environment takes a while longer as well.  It takes some adjustment over the previous version. I suspect the much enhanced graphics is at root cause, something that's not going to improve until the Kindle's performance improves.  A big plus is in the flap control. It's been move from its original location, under the Kindle's menu tab. What was a major problem is now fixed. However, the sluggish response applies to touch recognition as well.

"Installed on my Kindle Fire HD, we got off to a very bad start. After crashing and locking up my Kindle, it crashed a couple more times immediately after being installed. Normally I would have uninstalled it there and then.Once getting past this initial impression, I have found its operations and presentation very satisfactory and thorough... actually,  quite impressive. The extra features are definitely an added value.Other reviewers have pointed out that this app is a clone of some on-line mapping services and I would agree. However, the convenience of a rapid and direct interface from the Kindle without the extra steps through an inet nav tool like Silk has a definite advantage. However, with no screen capture, off-line storage and wi-fi requirement, the benefits are greatly restricted by radio connectivity.I use some other stand-alone map apps and while they have the advantage of working without the connectivity problem, this app delivers a far superior result even with its limitations.

"Well this book is certainly a whirlwind, I don't think the main character managed to stop and have a break for even a minute. It was non-stop fast-paced action. Faster than Chance's usual pace that's for sure. She usually gives us some drawn out moments of passion or touchy feely scenes.If you have been following the life and troubles of Cassie Palmer since the beginning then you will understand the difference between the two of them when you read this book and this Cassie, as opposed to the Cassie of the first book.Chance has kicked up the erotic scenes a notch. Easing slowly towards a romantic relationship between Pritkin and Cassie. She spends a lot of time reflecting upon the why of her relationship with Mircea. Is it love, is it lust or is it just compulsion? If so, has she possibly been ignoring a real connection between her and Pritkin all this time?It seems as if Cassie spends all her time in the buff, in a towel or in general with no clothes in her general vicinity. She also seems to have an unfortunate amount of bathroom, shower and bedroom incidents. Old Cassie used to do all her stunts and crazy missions with clothes on, she also never used to spend half her time playing hole in one with her flavour of the month.It is almost as if Chance is bowing down to the pressure of appealing to a mass audience and using the quick thrills to keep them captivated, instead of sticking to her unique style of writing and creativity.In my opinion Chance is still quite underrated as an Urban Fantasy writer. She certainly deserves more recognition than she gets, especially for her Dorina Basarab series. She spins the worlds of vamps, fey, shifters and magic together like a well-constructed spider's web, and combines all of it with her feisty characters and charming wit.I received a copy of this book via NetGalley, courtesy of Penguin Berkley/Signet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ETU30JHMLXL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451419073#wasThisHelpful","R3ETU30JHMLXL7","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in the Stephens and Mephisto series. The combination of police inspector and magician/actor is unusual, although to be honest I don't think Mephisto really carries his half of the detective work.Two children have gone missing and the hope to find them unharmed is dwindling fast. There seem to suspects galore and plenty of strange connections to nefarious scenarios.Annie has an obsession with the real origin of fairy-tales. The dark murderous side of old children's tales. Is that where the truth lies? Is the person who took them connected to her obsession or is the truth hidden in the world of magic and theatre.Griffiths mixes the pain of the World Wars with the close knitted community of theatre performers. Actors and magicians with their secrets, mysteries and quirks.The story is set in the 1950's, before crime scene technology was available and police had to rely on proof other than DNA. Each lead is followed no matter how bizarre or outlandish it may seem.The beginning was good, but I think Griffiths could have done with making the plot a little tighter towards the end. Incorporating the folk tale and darker side of fairy-tales with the dysfunctional dynamics of family and reality was very interesting.Overall a pleasant read.I received a free copy of this book via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NA257V1HMPLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0118MR2UE#wasThisHelpful","R3NA257V1HMPLG","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fascinating premise and perhaps not quite as unrealistic as one might think. Given the power of social media and how vulnerable and easily influenced young people are, it isn't really that far-fetched.Imagine a social media site that will fulfil any need you might have. Not your wants or your wishes, but your needs. An Ipad, a phone, a trip to Disneyland or perhaps you need a car.It all starts out with simple invitations and the fledgling members have the ability to invite a specific number of other users. (Reminds me of the way the social media platform Ello started out, and how coveted the invitations were at the beginning.)Each user has to request a need, which is then submitted only when invites have been sent out. At least that's the way it starts out. All innocence and fun until the Need site starts asking their members for more than just extra members.Things quickly become insidious and dangerous. Teenagers are manipulated into doing seemingly innocent deeds, all of which are connected in some way.In the midst of all this is Kaylee, a young girl living with the an enormous burden on her shoulders. She has been looking for a solution to her problems and has lied, stolen and deceived to do it. Her mother no longer trusts her and everyone else thinks she is desperate and crazy.Charbonneau has a fresh voice with innovative ideas. I think she let the story run away with her a little towards the end, because it wasn't as tight as in the beginning, but other than that it was an interesting idea and read.I received a copy of thisbook via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12JUU8G7X3CPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPIJG3S#wasThisHelpful","R12JUU8G7X3CPA","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:41 Mins To show you how much room you have in this bag I have used a thinner yoga mat and then a thicker yoga mat.The bag has an adjustable shoulder strap , so you can carry it or store your yoga mat in it. It has an outside pocket with a zipper. large enough for a wallet, phone or keys.I have quite a few yoga bags, they aren't really that well known or used that often here in the UK yet. Now I can't imagine not having one. It is an excellent way of keeping the mat stored and clean. It also means I don't have to take an extra bag for a towel ect. I like the basic colours of the YogaAddict bags, because they can be used for other activities, for instance for camping mats and sleeping bags. My older children have been using them for overnight stays, camping at festivals and carrying sleeping mats.It is made of a durable, washable material. It is quite thick, so no flimsy material. Reminds me of rucksack material.As always the product is great quality.Included in the bag are the details for the Yoga-addict website to access the VIP membership.*I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OJKXA3GWV5SY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EKUZ2Y#wasThisHelpful","R3OJKXA3GWV5SY","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:59 Mins I know a lot of people mistakenly think the infuser is supposed to make your drink taste like a fruit juice. It just makes gives your water a slighty fruity taste. If you make it and let it stand in the fridge for an hour or so you will be able to taste it. It is refreshing and it has the added benefit of not having any artificial fruit flavours and sweeteners in it. my personal favourite are the lime and lemon based infusers. In the video I am trying out a strawberry and lime combo, which is my daughter's favourite water-based drink.Will there be condensation if you cool the bottle to the point of ice cold. Yes. I think the no-sweat bag is supposed to be used to ensure the condensation is on the inside of the the bag and not on your hands, as opposed to people thinking there will be no condensation at all.It is fairly straightforward to use the bottle. Unscrew the top and lift out the infuser, which has a separate lid. Fill the infuser with fruit. Add water to the bottle before inserting the fruit infuser again, then screw the lid back on.Pros- holds a lot of water- the no-sweat bag will keep it cooler for a longer period of time- rubber grip on side makes it easy to hold- the infuser is easy to insert and take outCons-You have to fill the water to the highest level to get complete benefit from the infuser- have to fill with water before inserting the fruit infuser- The no sweat bag is a tight fit, sometimes a struggle to get it on- it is a bulky bottle, perhaps less suitable for a gym environmentThe bottle is well made and easy to use.*I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZ94MDLWVKPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QL4ZJA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZ94MDLWVKPD","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:17 Mins The most important thing you need to know is that fits Ipad 2/3/4. I have an Ipad Air 2 and an Ipad mini 2, it doesn't fit either of those. I have used the Ipad mini to demonstrate how to use it.Insert size 7in x 9.5in or 24cm x 18cm.I have had Cooper Cases before and their cases made for children (and the elderly) or the more accident prone amongst us are very good.The case is made of a sturdy bendy plastic. Looks foamy but isn't. It has a handy grip on the top to carry it around, a bit like a small bag or ghetto blaster. Cooper have made these in bright vibrant colours to make sure you always know where it is and the kids enjoy the fun vibrant element of it. Also easy to identify if you have multiple devices around the house.To connect via bluetooth you have to turn the bluetooth on on your device and switch the case from on. Make sure the TF/FM button on the case is on the bluetooth TF setting. It will show on your device as a Headset or 808. Connect and start listening via the speakers incorporated in the case. I find as I am getting older that either people on TV are mumbling more or I need to turn up my device, so I often use headphones or connect an external speaker. This is why this case is also an alternative for the elderly and not just for children who want to listen to Frozen at full volume.The back of the case also has a slot for a TF or microSD card and input for the charging cable. Just above those buttons are pause/play and volume buttons.When you insert your tablet in the case you have the perfect display and stand for your tablet. It stands secure on a 8.5cm wide base, so no danger of it just toppling over and even if it does the rim around the tablet is raised slightly to keep it from smashing straight onto the front of the tablet.It's interesting to note that although the colour is quite bright it is barely noticeable and certainly doesn't distract from the image on screen, when a tablet is put inside it. It is easy to carry and use, and suitable for both young and old.*I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.*","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WEOQDC1BW8Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ABGBCW#wasThisHelpful","R2WEOQDC1BW8Z0","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:47 Mins It is better suited for the shredding of leafy herbs, as opposed to fine grinding a herb, so it is more of a shredder than a grinder.The top opens to reveal a both halves of the grinder, the middle gives access to the sieve and the bottom half of the grinder and the bottom opens up to the sieve and the result of the grinding. The bottom compartment also has a very small plastic scraping tool/spatula to clean the sieve and the bottom half of the grinder. I already managed to misplace it before my review, because it is quite small.It is well-designed, unobtrusive and can be put or stored anywhere. The design also makes it an item you can pop in your glove compartment or bag, although I am pretty sure only the grinders of certain 'herbs' would need to do that. It is a little on the heavy side, a bit like carrying  a small ice hockey puck around.I have to admit to not knowing this also being used for grinding weed, despite it being in the description. So when my 22 year old walked in and asked why I had one, I was sort of 'What on earth are you talking about? How do you know that is what it is?' Well, now I know, and I also know that my kid knows for some inexplicable reason.I would like to see the company design a grinder for larger items, such as coffee beans or peppercorns. It is definitely something I would buy as a gift.*I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVUQS6SAJQQZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QII9R5M#wasThisHelpful","RVUQS6SAJQQZ0","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:34 Mins I have started buying generic Lightning cables, because quite frankly it is getting quite expensive to replace faulty Apple ones with original products. If the are in use often they tend to fry at the end of the cable, which could damage your device as well.Frieq makes quality products. Their braided or clothed cables are especially sturdy, durable and they don't tangle.This particular Lightning cable is 1.2 meters in length, which makes it longer than the Apple Lightning cable. The extra length makes it easier to load your devices.It is MFI certified and it syncs without any problem with my Ipad Air, my Ipad mini and my daughter's Iphone 5. (She needs an endless supply of Lightning cables).The Frieq products always come in minimal and recyclable materials.

" 2:23 Mins In a day and age of reckless driving, road rage nuts and the roads that are filled with more traffic than ever before, it has almost become a necessity to have a dashcam on board when you drive anywhere.As you can see in the video, the camera records with the same standard and quality regardless of whether it is night or day.We have edited the sound out of the video, because my daughter was chatting with a friend in the car, but I can assure you that the audio picks up everything.The camera records in 3min intervals or clips, which makes it easier to find footage I suppose. You can play back any of the recorded video on the camera display.The dashcam set comes with a camera, cables, charging cable,16GB SDcard and instructions ( unfortunately the instructions could do with an update, because they don't really have all the possible functions listed. I found most of them by scrolling through the menu.) I liked the fact I didn't have to go out of my way to buy an SD cad for this and was able to use it straight away.One of the handy functions for long journeys is the lane drift warning system (LDWS). Really excellent function for when you're on the motorway. The camera also has a front collision (FCWS) warning system, which is useful when you get to close to the driver in front of you.I would have liked to have tested the G-sensor (such an unfortunate name for it), which detects a crash and stores any video recorded during such an event, but I didn't feel like jinxing my luck. It also has an SOS function, for such incidents as rowdy road ragers, you just have to press the lock button and it will record. (Always handy in emergencies). The camera also has a motion sensor, so it turns on automatically when it detects any vibration. If I take our street for instance, we have quite a lot of people who think nothing of scratching bumpers and car doors, then they just drive off.The camera has a 2.7in display and the camera itself isn't very big, so it doesn't obstruct the view when you have it stuck to the front or the back of the car. It is also really simple to transfer the footage from the camera to the computer or laptop.* I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15CPQWL17Y7RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WOUZUS#wasThisHelpful","R15CPQWL17Y7RW","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:39 Mins The speaker has a clock and alarm feature.The alarm clock sound cannot be replaced by music, so if you want to be woken by the soft tones of your favourite singers you will have to buy a different device. What it does do is play the music of your choice when you connect a bluetooth device. In the video I have connected my laptop. You can then use the buttons on the speaker to skip a track, pause ect. To connect to bluetooth you switch the speaker on via the on/off button on the bottom of the speaker then press the call button on the front. A 'BT' will appear on the screen to indicate that the bluetooth is on. You also turn on the bluetooth on the second device and the speaker will come up as Lightspeaker1.I like the fact the light feature can be set from soft to hard lighting. you can do that by using the touch feature on the top of the speaker or by pressing the light button on the front of the speaker.When you are connecting you might want to make sure you don't have multiple bluetooth devices on, because the speaker sometimes has difficulty connecting if that is the case.You can also insert an SD card into the back of the speaker to listen to pre-chosen tracks.The speaker comes with a USB charging cable, which you insert into the back of the speaker.*I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I2ZZCWIHLRAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOVKLKY#wasThisHelpful","R3I2ZZCWIHLRAI","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Ripper Gene has quite a fascinating premise, perhaps not really as far-fetched as it may seem. We live in an era of technology and amazing advancements in medicine and genetics. Now in the 21st century parents can dictate the gender of their child, filter out hereditary diseases or extra chromosomes. Designer babies in a world of commercialism.So, let's say scientists made it possible, in the near future, to not only discover whether someone has the so-called warrior gene, but also find out if they are a psychopath or sociopath. Then taking it one step further being able to discover the genetic footprint of their possible heinous crimes,  and how they will perpetrate them.The ability to recognize and perhaps even track specific individuals, who are predetermined to commit horrific crimes. Not quite a simple as that is it? First of all there is simply no way to determine whether they will actually kill or which external factors they will be influenced by. Would you want to know if you have a gene like that or whether one of your loved ones could possibly be a serial killer in the making?Even with all of the information on the Ripper Gene, Dr Lucas Madden still can't manage to keep up with a vicious serial killer. Always one step and one body ahead of the police, the murderous monster is playing cat and mouse games with Lucas.When events take a personal turn Lucas finds himself in the middle of a dangerous triangle of lies, death and false memories. He suddenly comprehends that although he thinks he is in control of the situation and his analysis of the Ripper Gene in the killer, he is actually just a pawn in a violent killing spree.The Ripper Gene is an intriguing blend of science, crime and psychological thriller. It grips you and draws you in from the first few pages. Ransom knows how to combine the science and fictional elements without losing the attention of the reader.

" 2:22 Mins On the bottom there are three inputs. (Usually they are colour coded, because the ground cable is put in the middle/COM. The earth/ground  COM input is always black to distinguish it from the other two.) Left to right; Amps Max 10A/250V, COM is earth/ground negative, Voltage Max 600V. Usually you have a fourth input for mA, but they have combined it with the Voltage inut instead. (Max 200mA/250V)The big button in the middle is to select and  switch between voltage, direct current DC, alternating current AC, resistor, diode test,combined with circuit test, frequency Hz, microAmps, mA milliAmps, A Amps ( all the Amps are available in DC and Ac, if you push the Function button on the top left of the meter. The basic setting is DC if you want AC yo have to push the Function button.On the select button diode option, diode is the basic setting and  to use the circuit test and connectivity option you have to push the function button.You have an OFF position in both directions of the select button.On the outer side of the display it clearly shows which function you have chosen.As a  safety suggestion  for the digital meter it is advisable to always pick the 10A input and the Amps setting to find out the Max Amps of the device your checking. Never choose the milliAmps mA. ( Just as a hint, it will save you having to buy fuses, because if it is bigger than 200 millAmps it will blow the fuse in the meter straight away and you won't be able to measure anything at all)Buttons at the top of the Meter, function button is explained aboveHold button: If you want to remember your measurement you have to measure and then push the hold button , whilst still measuring. It will stay on the display until you press Hold again or move the select button in any direction. The Hold button works on every option.Max Button: When you are measuring , for example measuring Voltage on a car battery which is 12V and the Max is 14.5 when the is car is running, the meter will remember the highest point of measurement. You can use this on all options of  the meter.Back-light button: Which most meters do not have, so a plus. To get the back-light on you have to hold the button for a second for it to turn on and it stays on for about 10 seconds, then turns itself off automatically ( or move select button to off position)It is a full range digital multimeter. You don't need to select the minimum or maximum Voltage or whatever you want to measure, because it does it automatically. It is very easy to measure any resistor.The meter comes with two test leads. One black/negative and one red/positive.It needs a 9 Volt block battery ( Not included in the set).You can attach the test leads to the holder in the back of the meter.

" 0:47 Mins There are no buttons you need to find in the dark. You just simply pull the top of the lantern upwards and the light turns on.It is LED, so obviously the light is quite bright. Exactly what you need when you are camping, have an emergency (car or at home) and you can also use it in your workspace area (garage, workshop).It is quite lightweight and is compact enough to just slide into a corner. You can keep it in the boot of your car (changing tires ect) or next to your bed (power outage, zombie apocalypse). Personally I think it would be a bit bright for using it as a reading lamp.The lantern has practical metal rectangle shaped handles at the side, which can be moved upwards to become carrying handles, and then moved back down when you are finished.If you are worried whether the light is still on and using batteries when the lantern has been slid down and closed, you can see in the video how the light shuts off automatically, as soon as the light is slid down to a certain point.Batteries are not included, so you will need 3 x AA batteries.My daughter is looking forward to trying this out on her next road trip aka camping trip.I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LBHBH7HPQ4BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012W147SA#wasThisHelpful","R2LBHBH7HPQ4BE","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third part in the Puffin Island trilogy. First time in Forever introduces us to Emily and Ryan, Some Kind of Wonderful is about Zach and Brittany, and Christmas Ever After features Skylar and Alec.Sarah Morgan is a literary wizard when it comes to creating romance. Reading one of her books is often like eating a deliciously frosted cupcake with sprinkles on top. She will make your heart sob, fuel your ire and then make you feel all fluffy and warm inside.An excellent choice if you are looking for a sometimes complicated, but ultimately happy read. Not everyone wants to finish a last page and feel distraught. Some readers just want a chance to relax and feel like a unicorn has marched in with a years supply of cotton candy and marshmallows.When you read a Morgan you need to make some room for the unicorn happy, the feeling that everything is right in the world at this moment in time, and the feeling of being content. You disappear inside the pages of a book, and for a few hours you are transported into another world.In Christmas Ever After the two people from the Puffin Island group, who were voted most likely to never get along with each other, end up getting to know more about each other than they ever wanted to know.Skylar and Alec come from completely different families. Skylar is used to doing whatever pleases her parents and being subjected to their disappointment when she doesn't. In the midst of a family full of status seeking power-hungry individuals, Skylar is a creative free spirit with a mind of her own. She doesn't quite fit. They see Christmas as business opportunity, as a great time to make business and social connections.Alec comes from an open fun-loving family, who embrace each person as an individual and try to support their choices in life. Christmas is a time of loving and giving to them. They are warm-hearted, funny and they clearly love Alec very much.When Skylar ends up in a spot of trouble she discovers another side to Alec, an unexpected soft and understanding side. She isn't just completely thrown by this, Skylar also finds it oddly attractive. The two of them find themselves in a strange predicament of mutual irritation and attraction. This whirlwind of emotions comes to a head on the infamous Puffin Island.If this your first Sarah Morgan then I also recommend her Snow Crystal series.I received a free copy of this book, courtesy of Mira Uk and Harlequin UK, for purposes of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B6I10PSVUPII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848454449#wasThisHelpful","R2B6I10PSVUPII","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review is based on a testing period of over 10 weeks.I think they are more suitable for the occasional outbreak of zits, pimples or spots. They are not the suitable solution for full blown acne, which needs treatment from a dermatologist.They are simple to apply. Just wash or cleanse the area you intend to apply the patch/dot to, peel off, place over the spot and leave on overnight.The biggest plus of these dots is that the urge to scratch, pop, press and touch the spot, becomes a secondary thought.They reduce the redness and inflammation.

" 1:45 Mins As you can see in the video it is well made, brightly coloured and and great way of teaching your child sounds and musical notes.The xylophone has a string attached, so the child can pull the xylophone truck along behind them.The xylophone comes with two sticks ( so you can play on it obviously) and a pamphlet with songs.I think the company could improve the included music pamphlet by including English song titles and a few more more songs.A little warning in advance though, if your child likes this toy they are likely to drive you completely bananas when they bang on it all the time. Even my 10 year old decided to show me how you can play the Stars Wars and Jurassic Park theme song on the xylophone. 'Sigh.'

" 2:18 Mins If your child tends to stick things in their mouth, ear , nose or any other handy place then please be aware that the plastic snowflake shaped puzzle pieces are small enough to fit in certain places. The age recommended is 3 plus, but I would always suggest adult supervision if you are intending to buy this for younger children.The writing on the box and on the instruction manuals is in Chinese with an English translation underneath. They are non-toxic and environmentally friendly, however I still wouldn't suggest leaving a child alone with this toy if they still like to discover their world with their by taste.The plastic pieces are about 3 cms wide.Their is a small manual with suggestions of designs and pictures, but I am sure no child will have any problem making up their own snowflake pictures and animals.It is an excellent toy to improve hand to eye coordination and fine motor skills. Children can work on their colour skills and it will certainly get their creative juices flowing.If you are a parent with smaller and older children buying this for the older child I can only repeat the above warning of bits of pretty plastic in curious hands. Please be aware of the potential danger with younger children.Aside from that the puzzle pieces come in a practical bucket (cardboard), which means you can clean them up and keep them stored, when your child has finished playing with them.*I received a free copy of this item, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7PVIC9CK3TC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GP1MTQ#wasThisHelpful","R7PVIC9CK3TC","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:22 Mins On the bottom there are three inputs. (Usually they are colour coded, because the ground cable is put in the middle/COM. The earth/ground  COM input is always black to distinguish it from the other two.) Left to right; Amps Max 10A/250V, COM is earth/ground negative, Voltage Max 600V. Usually you have a fourth input for mA, but they have combined it with the Voltage inut instead. (Max 200mA/250V)The big button in the middle is to select and  switch between voltage, direct current DC, alternating current AC, resistor, diode test,combined with circuit test, frequency Hz, microAmps, mA milliAmps, A Amps ( all the Amps are available in DC and Ac, if you push the Function button on the top left of the meter. The basic setting is DC if you want AC yo have to push the Function button.On the select button diode option, diode is the basic setting and  to use the circuit test and connectivity option you have to push the function button.You have an OFF position in both directions of the select button.On the outer side of the display it clearly shows which function you have chosen.As a  safety suggestion  for the digital meter it is advisable to always pick the 10A input and the Amps setting to find out the Max Amps of the device your checking. Never choose the milliAmps mA. ( Just as a hint, it will save you having to buy fuses, because if it is bigger than 200 millAmps it will blow the fuse in the meter straight away and you won't be able to measure anything at all)Buttons at the top of the Meter, function button is explained aboveHold button: If you want to remember your measurement you have to measure and then push the hold button , whilst still measuring. It will stay on the display until you press Hold again or move the select button in any direction. The Hold button works on every option.Max Button: When you are measuring , for example measuring Voltage on a car battery which is 12V and the Max is 14.5 when the is car is running, the meter will remember the highest point of measurement. You can use this on all options of  the meter.Back-light button: Which most meters do not have, so a plus. To get the back-light on you have to hold the button for a second for it to turn on and it stays on for about 10 seconds, then turns itself off automatically ( or move select button to off position)It is a full range digital multimeter. You don't need to select the minimum or maximum Voltage or whatever you want to measure, because it does it automatically. It is very easy to measure any resistor.The meter comes with two test leads. One black/negative and one red/positive.It needs a 9 Volt block battery ( Not included in the set).You can attach the test leads to the holder in the back of the meter.

" 0:47 Mins There are no buttons you need to find in the dark. You just simply pull the top of the lantern upwards and the light turns on.It is LED, so obviously the light is quite bright. Exactly what you need when you are camping, have an emergency (car or at home) and you can also use it in your workspace area (garage, workshop).It is quite lightweight and is compact enough to just slide into a corner. You can keep it in the boot of your car (changing tires ect) or next to your bed (power outage, zombie apocalypse). Personally I think it would be a bit bright for using it as a reading lamp.The lantern has practical metal rectangle shaped handles at the side, which can be moved upwards to become carrying handles, and then moved back down when you are finished.If you are worried whether the light is still on and using batteries when the lantern has been slid down and closed, you can see in the video how the light shuts off automatically, as soon as the light is slid down to a certain point.Batteries are not included, so you will need 3 x AA batteries.My daughter is looking forward to trying this out on her next road trip aka camping trip.I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20GA43GVI8QKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JHBS6U#wasThisHelpful","R20GA43GVI8QKW","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is a quick read, kind of a penny novel crime with the focus on con-men and scams instead. White Collar set-up and as fast-paced as the A-Team on a role.It is a light-hearted read with two flamboyant main characters. It doesn't have a lot of substance or depth, which is fair enough if you really are just looking for flighty venture into the world of con and crime.Nick and Kate have plenty of sexual tension between them, and the majority of their dialogues are innuendo. Nick is Bomer's Neal Caffrey and Kate is DeKay's Peter Burke.Can he be trusted or not? Will Nick always choose the con instead of the straight and narrow path? Where does Kate crossing the boundaries become too much? Fox and O'Hare meander into the world of hardened criminals and ruthless scam artists.

" 1:29 Mins You can pop this beauty device into your handbag it is literally only 11cm or a little over 4 inches long and about 2cms wide. It fits easily into the palm of your hand. The gold metallic colouring gives it the appearance of a perfume bottle, so it will fit well in any handbag.Apparently the nano ionic mist improves the absorption of the water into the skin.You can barely feel the mist on your face. It is like a cool layer of wind blowing lightly upon your skin. It doesn't leave the skin moist or wet, because the skin absorbs it so quickly.The sprayer comes in a smart-looking hard-case lined with a satiny material. Included in the set is also a pipette to use when you fill the sprayer up and the USB cable to charge the device. You can keep the device, the pipette and the USB cable in the case when you aren't using it. If you decide to buy this as a gift then the recipient will love the quality of the product and the packaging.It doesn't need a lot of water and do not overfill. You can use distilled or regular water and even add a little facial toner to the water. Do not add lotion ect because the nozzle will clog.On the back of the device there are two vertical windows that show you how much water is left in the device. When you slide the window panel upwards you can fill up the water tank.To use just hold the sprayer about 30cms away from your face, slide the bottom front panel downwards and a 1 minute mist stream will begin. If the device is empty and you try to use it, the device will emit a high pitched tone to signal the need to fill it up. (Unfortunately it is so high I can't hear it)It comes with a 1 month free trial and 2 years Warranty.This is quite an innovative beauty must-have for the skin conscious.I received a copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R205V37JNR9L94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T1R3L8G#wasThisHelpful","R205V37JNR9L94","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Robotham manages to draw you in with his strangely compelling main character. As a reader you're not sure whether he is the good or the bad guy. Is he a criminal intent on revenge and profit or is he a good guy who made the wrong choices?It is a mystery to everyone one around him, what exactly has kept Audie alive and fighting for the last ten years? No matter how vicious the fights or how audacious the murder attempts, he just keeps getting back up again for another round.It doesn't become clear until well into the book why Audie escapes the day before his release and you wonder if it was so easy why didn't he do it sooner?I enjoyed the kind of abstract way Robotham went about it. The plot really does revolve around just the one person the entire time and everyone else is secondary. It is done in a way that draws you in, You need to know the why, when, who and how.The suspense is layered and spread in a way that keeps the tension the alive, well and kicking until the end.I received a free copy of this book via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30U7R63845R0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HP4HABG#wasThisHelpful","R30U7R63845R0F","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think I figured it out somewhere in the middle of the book. It was something that was said or perhaps just a specific gesture and I suddenly had this whole scenario in my head, but I thought it might be a little outlandish.I have to give it to Cohen, it was certainly a really interesting plot and ending.I'm not sure whether Megan's Angels is just a morbid extension of the extreme events. Is it really helping the parents or just making them tread water?Much like the family liaison officers, who are assigned to each of the families. They are like odd family member nobody wants to see. It is their job to inform the families of new developments or in this case another murder. Of course then the families have to go through the whole events over and over again, which means they can't move on.Not that you ever really move on from the death of a child, especially when it involves abduction and homicide. In this particular scenario questions of guilt are bounced around and suspicions grow where certain family members are concerned.To complicate matters Leanne has let her personal life interfere with her professional one. I found her actions quite unprofessional and hard to swallow. Not only does she ignore vital evidence she also crosses the line of ethical behaviour.Talking about unethical, Cohen really sheds a light on the behaviour of the press and media in these tragic situations. Reporters are willing to blackmail, lie, steal and betray anyone for a good story. They have no respect for the victims or those left behind.If you're looking for a crime with a bit of a twist then this certainly delivers a big one.I received a copy of this book via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYEFJ0MZGKTE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5H3XAI#wasThisHelpful","RYEFJ0MZGKTE8","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a story about the clashes of culture in countries colonized by the British. Native traditions and myths mixed with the stiff upper lip attitude of the British.I wandered between feeling frustrated about Gwen's apathy, anger at her silence, and feeling sympathy for her plight. I can imagine her fictional story coming quite close to reality for many families living in the colonies.Dark secrets hidden in the folds of genealogy, secret children abandoned and forgotten or even disposed of in a more permanent manner. All because their skin isn't or wasn't the quite the right shade of colour.The timid English wife grows with the years. It might be the pain and distress or possibly the guilt she carries with her. Perhaps she toughens up, because she is sick of the lies and the games. Regardless of the why, the fact is somewhere along the line Gwen finally finds a voice.Jefferies pays tribute to the location and surroundings of her story in the form of beautiful descriptive prose, which makes up for the sometimes disjointed flow.Overall Jefferies delivers drama, sorrow, anger and guilt, all wrapped up in the marriage and romance of young woman and her husband, who brings a lifetime of baggage with him.I received a free copy of this book via NetGalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LESS6E2VR253/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0241969557#wasThisHelpful","R3LESS6E2VR253","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a gorgeous set. It includes Hematite Buddha Bracelet, one antique Silver-Tone Charm Thong Pendant. All the items came in little drawstring gift bags, so you can gift them or keep them safe.The Hematite bracelet has a Buddha head in silver-tone on it. You can feel the weight of the stone, but it is very comfortable. Some bracelets can catch the small hairs on your arm and wrist, but this doesn't.The Pendant necklace has a leathery strap instead of a chain. It looks and feels much more aesthetic that way.Hematite is called the Stone for the Mind or Blood Stone. It is used to ground or stabilize and for protection. It is a stone often used for anxiety.Earth Therapy is family run UK business. Their business is focused on products that promote wellness and health.

"The Waist Trainer Cincher in the pictures is an L-36 and the girl wearing it is a size 10.So if you are ordering smaller than L you need to take that into consideration.In the picture it is on the smallest and second smallest setting. It has 6 settings in total, each being 1cm apart, which means you will or can reduce your waist by a little over 6cms. It is made of a soft material and can be worn comfortably under clothing.Now for those of you not interested in training the waist in this fashion, it is also a lovely item to wear. Corsets may not be every person's cup of tea, but I am sure someone will take a liking to this.It is in a comfortable sheer-like material without being completely see-through. It holds up that pesky bust and makes it look a tad more perky rather than a wee bit droopy. Regardless of whether you want to channel your inner Moulin Rouge babe, play the Dominatrix or perhaps just like the tight waisted look, then this will certainly serve its purpose.I received a free copy of this item, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFXNZ78P1F7F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVFEXHK#wasThisHelpful","RFXNZ78P1F7F0","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:46 Mins You get two pairs of socks in this pack. I have the black socks with rainbow stripes.They look quite funky and are extremely comfortable.I've found myself not only using these socks for exercise and yoga, I also use them for walking around the house. I have never liked being barefoot, so these are perfect for when my feet are too hot for slippers (yes, that is a thing) and still want something on my feet without having to worry about slipping. I have the full yoga socks, so these are a great hot weather alternative.When I am exercising (I'm so glad nobody tapes those torture sessions) they have a great grip, regardless of whether I am on the floor or using a yoga mat.It's best to hand-wash the socks, so they don't shrink and the non-slip dots don't lose any traction.The Hobbit wears a UK size 5/6 and the socks in the video are a size S-M.The socks come with a link to the yoga-addict website and a free bonus guide 'Top 10 Tips A Yoga Practitioner Should Know To Get The Most From Your Yoga Practice' and a discount for further purchases.Overall a quality product.I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R90UO1W7UXESA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCL4VES#wasThisHelpful","R90UO1W7UXESA","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What do you if you have totally failed at dating and are still looking for Mr Right? Start your own exclusive dating agency of course. That is exactly what Ellie Rigby decides to do. Help all those other good-looking singles out there to find their perfect match.Sounds simple enough, eh? Well it does until Ellie realises just how many of her potential clients are just ever so slightly eccentric and high maintenance. I'm not sure I would be able to find a partner for a macho playboy gynaecologist with a porn-star name either.Of course the problem with sifting through all those handsome men is that inevitably there will be one of them, who just happens to caught your eye. Not even matchmakers are immune to the charms of Cupid.It's got to be Perfect is a comedy of errors with a bevy of pretty people with one thing in common, the search for Mr or Mrs Perfect.Hill doesn't mince her words when it comes to the dialogues, They are refreshing, witty and occasionally slightly on the graphic side. She has her main character concentrate her efforts on the top ten percent, as opposed to the more normal looking single.

"I really enjoyed the in-depth view into anorexia. Although the storyline flows into the lives of the characters and melds flawlessly into the other sub-plots, there is still a level of understanding about this eating disorder, which is quite remarkable. The kind of depth you usually only get when you read a book written specifically about eating disorders.Kate Long really does have Helen's character down to a tee. Anorexics are often described in a way that defines them as victims, as attention seeking individuals, who could stop being anorexic if they wanted to.Those descriptions could not be more wrong. It is a mental illness, a feeding and eating disorder. Girls, boys men or women, who suffer with it need professional medical and psychological help.Getting back to the way Long has portrayed Helen. She has pinpointed the manipulative, cunning and deceptive nature of her personality. Anorexics learn to lie, deceive, cheat and manipulate their surroundings and the people around them.Feeding and Eating disorders are about control. Controlling the one thing no one else can control for you or take away from you. The way you eat, how much you eat or if you eat at all. It takes an incredible amount of inner discipline to control your eating habits that way.Helen describes the anorexia as an entity, a person, someone who lives within her and tells her how useless, fat and ugly she is. Alive to the point of having inner dialogues with her or it. Like an inner demon sitting on your shoulder.Long also describes the way the anorexia can make and break a family. Everything evolves around the eating disorder, which means everyone suffers, not just the anorexic. In this story we follow the healthy sister Jen on her quest for love and her constant juggle of work-life balance. Even now her sister has recovered there is always this doubt about her honesty. Is she in distress, is she getting skinnier again or is she eating her food?When Helen asks Jen to find one of the people partly responsible for the initial meltdown, she finds herself in the middle of a moral dilemma. Help her and perhaps watch Helen spiral into her anorexia again or trust that Helen will leave the past alone.This isn't just a story about family dynamics when one of the family members suffers from an eating disorders, it is also a story about the relationship between two sisters and how romance can sneak up on you in the strangest situations.I received a free copy of this book courtesy of the author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T6E07AB4GCB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147112892X#wasThisHelpful","R3T6E07AB4GCB5","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the moment my girls are all trying to bag all of these Kabuki brushes and sharing seems to be the last thing on their minds, that is how nice these brushes are.There may be chemical smell emanating from the bag when you get it. You need to wash them before use anyway, and it will rid the brushes of any smell. Just soak them in warm water with some shampoo for about 30 minutes. Then air dry them if possible hair-end down. After you have used them and want to clean them it will suffice to just wash them out with a very mild shampoo.The only thing that was slightly negative is the gold feature, it doesn't gel with the rest of the brush, from a quality point of view. Other than that the bristles are super soft. On the pics I have included, the colour of the bristles is slightly beige because they are already in use by the high maintenance girls in our household (Just Kidding...they are not high maintenance, just finnicky about the make-up apparel they use)EmaxDesign also has a similar set in bamboo, which is also very nice and it has a eyebrow brush and smaller fat Kabuki brushes.Knowing how much just a single Kabuki brush costs, even the synthetic ones, this is quite a good price for the set.I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQAW57TUVIDYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012SBVNY0#wasThisHelpful","RQAW57TUVIDYC","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The colour is actually more of a vibrant red, as opposed to the orangey auburn red shown in the product images (the customer images show a more accurate colour. I think the colour in the image should be updated to reflect the actual colour of the wig.It comes in a bag you can use to store the wig in, a wig comb/brush and a wigcap.It is easy to wash.

"You should clean the brushes first before you use them. Just wash with warm water and a little shampoo and soak for 30 mins, to eliminate any smell.

"Leofric is what I would call a wee bit of an anti-hero. He has the bad luck of a thrice cursed peasant, suffers with debilitating health issues and has the get-go of a snail. Everyone around him equates his ill health to an overall weakness in character, and because they believe it Leofric believes it.Luckily, despite all that he is a sympathetic chappy, who just always seems to draw the short end of the straw. The real issue with Leofric isn't really all of the above, although it has a lot to do with it, is the fact he hasn't found his inner dragon yet.In essence this whole story is about Leofric becoming the man he was always intended to be. The reader follows him on his road to growth, which is filled with violence, murder, fear and the occasional bout of wit.Arnott has created a main character with flaws and a propensity for failure. He doesn't look for trouble, but trouble sure finds him quite a lot. Something tells me Leofric will eventually rise like the phoenix from the ashes.I found myself being drawn in by Leofric and his unusual story. I needed to know what else could possibly go wrong for him. How on earth was he going to make it to the end of the book?Arnott knows how to reel you without you even realising it. It wasn't just his storytelling though, for me it was the way I connected as a reader to the main character. I am looking forward to reading the rest of his journey now that his inner dragon is starting to pipe up and breathe fire.I received a free copy of this book, courtesy of the author, for purposes of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39M53I30L5ONK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UOTIBDU#wasThisHelpful","R39M53I30L5ONK","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works with horizontal vent slots, so it will depend on the make and model of your car. The size and weight of your phone might not work with this car mount.

"After the phenomenal success of her novel The Good Girl, Kubica is back with another compelling read. The type of read that makes you have a conversation with the fictional main characters of a book.Women are expected to shut up and endure, swallow and forget. It doesn't really matter why or what, they are just expected to grin and bear whatever comes their way. When you spend years of bottling up your emotions without any outlet, then psychological and sometimes even physical damage is the result of those pent-up emotions.In Heidi's case the shut up and put on a brave face faade begins to crumble when she invites Willow and Ruby into her house and her life. She slowly becomes obsessed with Ruby, and the thought of Willow leaving makes her almost irrational.Once again Mary Kubica leaves it up to the reader to decide who the bad guys and the good guys are. Believe you me, it is never so cut and dry with a Kubica story. The truth of the matter is that there is a bit of both in all of us.Kubica merges important social topics with emotional scenarios and family dynamics. She delves into the foster care system, child abuse and most importantly the apathy of our society towards the most vulnerable.The opening chapters are an eye-opener and are food for thought. What would you do in the same situation? Look away or show some compassion? Unfortunately in the world we live in the number of incidents taking place in connection with the so-called bystander effect are on the rise. People look away rather than get involved. In a way this is one of the reasons Heidi reaches out instead of just turning her back.This is a psychological thriller with muddied waters when it comes to the good guys and the bad guys, but then that is exactly what Kubica excels at.I received a free copy of this book, courtesy of Mira UK and Harlequin UK, for purposes of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJFX7CT89VU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317706#wasThisHelpful","R1JJFX7CT89VU2","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suggest reading the first book in the series, Queen of the Tearling, before this one. It isn't a necessity, but it does make things a whole lot clearer. In the beginning of Invasion of the Tearling.A lot of the fates of the characters from the first book are introduced in the first few chapters, so a new reader to this series might have a wee bit of difficulty keeping track of who, why and when.It has one of the strangest present to past time evolution plots I have read in quite a while.The past is described as a post-apocalyptic misogynistic world, and the present is an almost medieval fantasy like world with plenty of magic, but with echoes of the 21st century.Although the slipping from one life into another is quite interesting it doesn't seem to have much point other than to validate family connections.Lily's story or rather the world she lives in is quite interesting. A world where women have no rights at all, and men are free to do with them as they please. Including abuse them when they feel like it. Sounds rather medieval, despite all the modern trappings, doesn't it? Whereas in Kelsea's world the women rule the roost. Although some of those misogynistic elements are reflected in Kelsea's world, especially in certain male high-born leaders.Overall it is a creative fantasy driven by power struggles and family secrets.I received a copy of this book via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMP8HD3PAMYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T19UNLW#wasThisHelpful","R1GMP8HD3PAMYL","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I believe this is because both of the buds are exactly the same, as opposed to being slightly formed in one direction, depending on the ear you wear them in. Then again it saves me from having an 'moment' when I need to ame sure the right bud is in the right ear.It doesn't block out all the external noise and the music can be heard by others if it is turned up loud.

" 1:14 Mins This is definitely my type of phone case, and no matter which phone/upgrade, I always end up getting a wallet type case, because it makes me feel as if my phone is safer.It has two horizontal pockets for cards and a larger vertical pocket on the left-hand inside of the case. The right-hand inside has two things, it holds the secondary case that holds the phone. This secondary case is magnetic, which means you can extract it from the wallet case at any time, and put it back in.The secondary case can be used by itself as a case, if you don't feel like carrying the wallet part around.

"I have to say I do prefer the enclosed wallet or book-like type of cases. The one-side open ones always make me feel as if it is an accident waiting to happen.Saying that, I have a Samsung 6 user at home, who prefers this type of open case. she likes to be able to access the phone straight away, as opposed to opening it up to use it.This is clear It has an anti-scratch coating and the material absorbs shocks, ergo falls and bumps. The case has a protective sheet over it, so it arrives with shiny clean with no marks on it.

"This was my first Lisa Gardner and it certainly won't be my last. She really knows how to keep the story compelling to the very end.Nicky is haunted by a girl called Vero. The two of them have conversations with each other all the time, or do they? Is it reality, a call from her subconscious or perhaps just hallucinations due to the complications of Nicky's traumatic brain injury?Nicky comes to the attention of the local police when she is found hailing help by the side of the road and her car is found at the bottom of a ravine. At the scene of the accident she screams for Vero, so the hunt is on for the missing child.When the police come up empty handed they start to question not only the accident, they also question Nicky's sanity. Something just doesn't ring quite right for Wyatt and he starts taking a closer look at the husband, especially because Nicky has had multiple serious accidents in the last few months.I really enjoyed the way Gardner kept the question about the identities very fluid throughout the book. Nothing is certain, and the reader is always second guessing who she might be. You automatically feel sympathy for Vero the child and Nicky the adult, regardless of whether they are in the past or present. For the victims of the abuse and the adult, who lives in sheer terror of the truth. Her own truth is so devastating she is literally falling apart bit by bit.Although this is a Tessa Leoni mystery/case she doesn't really play a major role in this story. More like the sidekick to Wyatt. The two of them do get a wee bit closer, but overall she plays more of a secondary part in the book.I have to admit it kept me riveted till the end.I received a free copy of this book via Netgalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TAVD804ZA3Q7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NT7YO1W#wasThisHelpful","R2TAVD804ZA3Q7","A25HWUX0L2DCFM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HWUX0L2DCFM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I didn't think it would work like most, but it really does! Awesome! Keep in mind this tightens and breaks down your fat in the area you apply. I lost several inches using the body wraps. However, if you don't use them correctly the wraps will not be effective. When you wrap the most benefit is going to come from using a full treatment which is 5 wraps. The first time I wrapped I didn't notice any results.  After full treatment my skin was tighten and firm; and I did it along with healthy eating and exercise. It is not a permanent fix, but is great for using before vacation. The reason I give the product 4 stars and not 5 is because I wished the results lasted longer. This product is worth a try.

"As soon as my order arrived, I opened it. My sister said she never had this product before and wants to try. She was blessed with decent skin, but having reached a 'certain age' she was slightly disturbed by the little lines and bagging under my eyes. My sister finds this mask easy to use. She loves it and thinks it is a fabulous product. When she applied this mask, she looked silly \_()_/  LOL After half an hour, when she removed it, Voil no more bags or tiny lines. All gone! I could see and feel the difference, immediately. Her skin felt silky and soft. This product worth every penny.Product was received complimentary for review purposes.

"This mouse looks and feels great. I have had an amazing experience with this mouse. The ergonomics fit my hand well especially in palm. I spend most of my day using this mouse at work, often working within AutoCAD and SolidWorks. I really appreciate the accuracy and ability to change sensitivity on the fly. It allows me to set the mouse exactly how I want it when I want it without having to mess with the control program.The grips are very nice even when worn down and I know I always have a grip. Buttons are well placed, scroll wheel is comfy. The mouse has two side buttons which can be mapped to controls in games, and used as forward/back buttons when browsing the web. The clicks are satisfying and feels good. The scrolls are defined and also feels good. The sensor if to be top of the line with no acceleration or angle snapping at all. Glides well on my cloth mouse pad surface. Cord is sufficient for most desktop arrangements, whether desktop is on the floor or desk.All in all, a solid mouse for any player looking for something ergonomic but without sacrificing accuracy and precision. Good for the casual gamer. Great value for the money.Product was received complimentary for review purposes.

"I'm not exactly an expert on headphone quality. My review is just my experience. I must say these earphones look very nice. Durable and sounds amazing.  The materials used to make these earphones are of pretty good quality, and it actually looks very pleasing to the eyes. The design is very subtle and simple. The flat headset cable is of fairly high quality. It is light and tangle free.I have used these every day from work, to the gym, to everything in between.  Deep Bass, good Mid Range, Treble is sharp and clear, but not at all shrill.The noise isolation is good too. I tried out the head phones at the gym, they were good at cancelling out the background noise and did not fall out the minute I got warm! The fit was comfortable; they dont slip even while I am working out.  They come with more than one earbud size which is always a plus.The overall balance and sound experience for the earphones in $20 price bracket is great.

"Recently I injured my knee and various muscles in both legs. I applied this Kinesiology Tape to my knee and calf muscle. I was expecting a long recovery, but three days later I feel that the injuries are recovering well. First time of using Kinesiology tape, so I have nothing to compare it with, however, it does seem relatively easy to apply and does what is expected. Honestly, I don't know how or why this works, but it certainly does. This is an excellent item for any active person to keep in sports bag in case of injury. If you are not sure on how to use it, you can get an assistance from a qualified professional such as a physical therapist or doctor. They can show you the right way to apply the tape to get the most benefit for your particular situation, so that you get the best results in reducing any swelling from excessive lymphatic fluid.

"I love it. The buttons to operate the speaker are located on the top. The unit is solid and feels well built. The sound quality is great. Music is crisp and clear. Charging the speaker only took a few hours and lasted well almost 12-hour period at moderate volumes. It was able to sync to my phone with no problem, and immediately reconnects upon being powered up. If we need, Bluetooth range is very good. I can go two rooms away. Rubber finish protects it from light rain and also makes the unit very stable on a slick table. It can be used outdoors as well as indoors.

"I'm not exactly an expert on headphone quality. My review is just my experience. I must say these earbuds look very nice, immensely aesthetically pleasing. The headphone look just got me in -- everything has a nice, stylish look, from the linen bag to the braided cord and wooden phones themselves.

As far as the sound quality is concerned, it is good, but not great, they are a little bass-y for my own tastes.

Along with this she uses a slimming belt, which I am sure will help her get results even earlier.This Twisting Balance Board is 10 inch in diameter.

"I absolutely LOVE these Toe Separators. I started using them to relax my feet at the end of the day. I love to come home and put these on, use lotion on your toes they go on a lot easier, my feet and toes feel so much better afterward as they get a good stretch. Look and work great. These are somewhat large, but are this large to fit a fair variety of feet. I love to wear these because they are a soft gel. Not only do they relieve pain in my toes and feet, but they help straighten my toes after being shoved into shoes all day. Comfortable, squishy, and feel good. Not really made to walk around in, walking in them is silly, it doesn't really work unless you waddle around. Overall it is a good product.

"I got this to keep in my glove compartment for whenever I need to check my tire pressure. Keeping the tires of my car right inflated save me a lot in fuel and tires as well.  This Digital Tire Pressure Gauge works great. It is perfect upgrade from those crappy pen gauges that always get stuck and need resetting for every read. For me, it's worked great every single time I've had to use it. With gentle pressure, the nozzle seals onto valve stem quickly and delivers an accurate measurement.  No more guesswork or estimation like reading a pen gauge LED is clear and readable. Reading are nearly instant. Measure tire pressures in PSI, BAR, or KPA. One minor complaint is accidentally changing the units of measure and having to cycle back to PSI, but it's not that big of a deal. Auto shut-off is nice, and you just click to turn it on.  Fits comfortably and naturally in your hand. Turn the flashlight on and off with the simple slide of a button. The built-in mini tools are easily accessible. This tool is pretty sturdy too. I haven`t tried either window smashed or seatbelt cutter yet and I hope I will never have to use it; although it is good to have such tools. I love this tire gauge.

"We seem to go through grill brushes quickly. Perhaps because we cook out all the time! The brush is working really well. We have had these brushes for a couple of weeks so far and it still is working like the day we got it! If you warm up the grill for five, ten minutes before using your grill brush, it will do an excellent job. The brush diameter and curved edges are perfect for brushing between the grate slots.

"This is a fantastic toy and it keeps my nephew engaged for a long time, he likes to ride on it and play with the buttons in front.

I hope he is learning the ABC song too from it. He has loved to look at it, talk to it, & play with the ears. I am sure he will get enjoyment out of this gift for many months.This toy has met and exceeded my expectations.  The Baby Ride-on Dragon is well made, not to mention fun and attractive!

I use the Headlamp by Magnus Innovation a lot for camping and hiking, and I also found it handy for walks around areas of the neighborhood with no street lamps.

"I got this to keep in my glove compartment for whenever I need to check my tire pressure. Keeping the tires of my car right inflated save me a lot in fuel and tires as well.  The Antetek 4 in 1 Digital Tire Pressure Gauge works great. It is perfect upgrade from those crappy pen gauges that always get stuck and need resetting for every read. For me, it's worked great every single time I've had to use it. With gentle pressure, the nozzle seals onto valve stem quickly and delivers an accurate measurement.  No more guesswork or estimation like reading a pen gauge. I do wish that there was a way to lock whatever setting you are currently in, perhaps by just holding down the button for a few seconds, since I've found myself on multiple occasion accidentally switching to BAR right after I've started checking my pressure, making me lose pressure in my tires while I had to click back to PSI. It's pretty sturdy too. I haven`t tried either window smashed or seatbelt cutter yet and I hope I will never have to use it; although it is good to have such tools.

"This nail file is one of the best I've ever had. I am glad I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation purposes in return for a honest review because my old one just broke. I had no idea it would work so great! It files easily and effortlessly and doesn't bend like most files do. The whole thing is about the size of a desk pen and the colors are really cute. I like that it's sturdy and can be rinsed off under running water after each use. It doesn't wear down like regular files and will last a long time. The best part? It doesn't leave nails feeling rough or scratchy. It buffs while it files! It's effective and smooth and heavenly and I can't live without it. Product was received complimentary for review purposes.

"I bake a lot and usually do the separating egg yolks and whites by hand, using the eggshells. I used the cracked shells and pour the eggs back and forth into the shell trying to keep the yolk from breaking, getting pierced by the jagged egg shell edge or falling into the bowl beneath where the egg white goes. Messy. Yuk!  Not anymore.  I finally got an Egg Yolk Separators. Yay!!! Something so tiny can please so well No more sticky fingers while separating when it comes to baking time.Pros:  Mess free solution to separate the egg whites and yolks.  Stainless Steel, rust resistant  Durable, solid, heavy duty  Has Egg break help  Easily separate egg yolks and whites  Sits securely on cups and bowls if needed  Dishwasher safe, easy to cleanCons:NoneOverall, this a great invention, so easy to use and it works like a charm. The separator is compact which makes it convenient to store.  Fantastic kitchen tool for those who bake a lot or like egg white omelets.Other thoughts: Make sure the eggs are at room temperature. This helps the white to fall easily.Sample product for review courtesy of The 5 Star Collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VLVI6SFB32PP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXUTDI6#wasThisHelpful","R2VLVI6SFB32PP","AKMTYZTHBXD9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKMTYZTHBXD9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not exactly an expert on headphone quality. My review is just my experience. I must say these earbuds look very nice, immensely aesthetically pleasing.  The black and red look just got me in -- everything has a nice, stylish look, from the linen bag to the braided cord and wooden phones themselves. The cord does, unfortunately, have the habit of tangling-up quite easily, but nothing that can't be sorted out.  As far as the sound quality is concerned, it is good, but not great, they are a little bass-y for my own tastes. The highs are muted and get distort slightly when you reach the high notes, however the bass and quality of sounds for midtones makes up for it.The noise isolation is good too. These truly cut out the music in the gym that other earphones failed to do. The fit was okay, they dont slip even while I am working out.  They come with more than one earbud size which is always a plus. A good solid pair of earphones for the casual user.

"For the past five years or so, I experienced significant hair loss on the front of my head.  In the past few years my hair has gone from extremely thick to very thin. I tried several products, but the hair loss persisted and my hair just kept falling out.

"I use this for trimming branches on fir and pine. It cuts very close to the trunk and is easily sharpened with a small flat file similar to a file used on chain saw teeth. Some of the plantings that came with the house had been allowed to get too large and woody. I was able to cut through 3/4 inch diameter woody stalks without much trouble. I have arthritis in my thumbs, so you know I do not have much squeeze power. It is solid construction and feels good in your hand, and cuts easily. It is one of the best pruners I have owned.

"I was amazed that as soon as I plugged in the diffuser, mist came out immediately, and my room was filled with the scent of the lavender essential oil that I added to it. It's been in use for several days, usually 6-8 hours per day (1-2 water refills per day) and it performs perfectly.It's very easy to use. Just add 120 ml of water in water tank, a few drops of essential oil in essential oil, and turn it on. Beautiful to look, very hypnotizing and relaxing, very quiet and cool to the touch. The Pure Mist Essential oil diffuser has a few nice features. One of the features is the LED light which is changing colors. It is very soothing; the colors are rich and vibrant; you could choose one color to stay on or let it cycle. Having this feature the diffuser could be used as a night light. I like having the diffuser on and letting the lights cycle, it creates such ambiance. It also works without the light so is ideal for a bedroom since there is an automatic shut-off function if water tank get empty, it means oil diffuser can be safely left running while you sleep.

"This is a great alternative to the traditional foam roller which tends to break down in firmness after a couple of months of daily use This roller holds its firmness much longer than the standard foam rollers. The hollow plastic core provides the extra support and the foam is the right weight to provide pressure and padding. I have a few rollers and this is my favorite. Just hard enough to mash in the muscles and soft enough it isn't masochistic. It can be very hard if your muscles. I found this is better than a deep tissue massage in my opinion. It can be painful, but that indicates you need this and the pain does subside after some use.

This mount is sturdy when attached to the headrest and do a good job and staying put once adjusted. It needs to be attached to both poles in the headrest. It has a good range of movement. Flexible holder can rotate 360 degrees, freely adjust to any desired viewing angles. Adjustable tilt for ultimate viewing experience. Tablet can be viewed in landscape and portrait position. It uses a magnet to hold the tablet and the magnet itself is strong enough to hold variety of different tablet models. I am glad I was provided a sample of this product for a test. It keeps the tablet secured and visible so the children will have something to entertain them during long car rides.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLTJFTAOW2VJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SLYRE9W#wasThisHelpful","RLTJFTAOW2VJS","AKMTYZTHBXD9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKMTYZTHBXD9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This power bank is a compact, slim, lightweight, simple looking device. When testing the battery on its functionality, I was able to get at least one full charge for my phone before the battery pack ran out of power and this is with the phone on, connected, and with apps running in the background. I can carry the portable battery with me in my hoodie pocket or backpack effortlessly. The USB ports is a 5V/1.0A (max) standard output charge port that is compatible with an assortment of USB-chargeable electronics. Basically, this is inexpensive backup that will give all but the power user a margin of capacity. Product was received complimentary for review purposes.

"I've been looking for a nice looking yet working set of cheese knives. These fit the bill perfectly. The knives style works well for a casual setting as well as when I want to dress up the table for a special occasion.This set is offering a good selection of knives to serve any cheese. Knives are good size for a cheese plate. The knives themselves are not heavy-weight, but they feel comfortable in the hand. These big fat handles make it easy to grip for arthritic hands.  The stainless steel knives are single-piece construction so that you won't be prying cheese out of cracks with a toothpick. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are really sharp, so you can cut through cheeses easily. Best of all, they cut through hard cheeses with minimal effort.These are affordable, nice-looking, and practical. The compactness of this set makes it great to bring out for picnics and potluck parties at the office.Sample product for review courtesy of The 5 Star Collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AS09S0S1KJTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXUT8P4#wasThisHelpful","R3AS09S0S1KJTK","AKMTYZTHBXD9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKMTYZTHBXD9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These cut resistant gloves are awesome. I would use them primarily in the kitchen. I love to use sharp knives and I know when I get busy I don't always pay attention to my little fingers. I decided to get these after cutting myself yet again doing some rather ordinary kitchen prep.I like these gloves. Each glove features a lightweight design that allows you to maintain dexterity easily. They are great for dicing and peeling with knives. The sturdy mesh creates a barrier that helps prevent minor scrapes and cuts and completely protect your. An ambidextrous design means you can wear it on your right or left hand.

"I'm not exactly an expert on headphone quality. My review is just my experience. I must say these earbuds look very nice. The headphones are in an attractive, brass effect metal finish with black earbuds. Deep Bass, good Mid Range, Treble is sharp and clear, but not at all shrill. The overall balance, and sound experience is good.  However, they sounded much bassier than my previous earphones. There is plenty of power at under half volume. It's hard to believe that so much bass can come from these earphones. These headphones are definitely louder, although can lose a bit of clarity at highest volumes, they are in fact the first set of headphones that I've had to use the equalizer to reduce bass as it can sound a bit muddy otherwise. I do listen to mainly electronic music which probably relies more on bass than other genres.The noise isolation is good too. I tried out the head phones at the gym, they were good at cancelling out the background noise and did not fall out the minute I got warm! The fit was comfortable; they dont slip even while I am working out.  They come with more than one earbud size which is always a plus. A good solid pair of earphones for the casual user.I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF1G1CWUH4240/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TU5NZR6#wasThisHelpful","RF1G1CWUH4240","AKMTYZTHBXD9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKMTYZTHBXD9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not exactly an expert on headphone quality. My review is just my experience. I must say these earbuds look very nice, immensely aesthetically pleasing.  The wooden look just got me in --  everything has a natural look, from the linen bag to the braided cord and wooden phones themselves. The cord does, unfortunately, makes some irritating noise when brushing against my clothing, but nothing that can't be sorted out.  As far as the sound quality is concerned,  it is good, but not great, they are a little bass-y for my own tastes. The highs are muted and get distort slightly when you reach the high notes, however the bass and quality of sounds for midtones makes up for it.The noise isolation is good too. These truly cut out the music in the gym that other earphones failed to do. The fit was okay,  they dont slip even while I am working out.

"In the morning before I go to work I like to make myself a cup of good tea, as soon as I make it, I realize I need to leave for work. To carry a mug full of tea while walking to work is not the best idea, but now I have this slick, stylish looking tea tumbler.When I was offered to test this product, I was beyond excited to get one. I've been experimenting with it since I received mine. I should state that this is my first tumbler and I cannot rave enough about it. It is a glass bottle with a stainless steel strainer that sits inside the top of the tumbler. The strainer itself is very nice quality metal with a little handle and small holes so that less loose tea gets into the beverage while steeping. The lid is spill proof, I tipped it over on its lid while full of tea and none came out. The only drawback I found is that this tea infuser is NOT dishwasher or microwave safe.For tea with long steeping times I like this method:This is preferred to steep your tea on the go and then pour into a mug at work and whatnot than as a travel mug. How I used it was to put the tea leaves in the tumbler, add water, and then place the strainer, lock it. You can turn tumbler upside down to steep, if you like, and then turn over when finished.Possible issues: While this method is great for those long steep time, most teas will get bitter if over steeped.Another method for tea with limited steeping times.Place strainer in the bottle. Once you've put your tea leaves into the strainer, the glass container with water, screw the lid on very tight and you need to turn tumbler upside down to steep. When the steeping is complete, turn it back over and remove strainer with leaves.Possible issues: Some of the leaves do tend to get through, because the holes on the strainer are a little too big. I recommend using larger leafed teas with this tumbler.All in all, really neat tea infuser, perfect for on the go.Sample product for review courtesy of WeiHeng","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD3M0063M381N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGMC5UE#wasThisHelpful","RD3M0063M381N","AKMTYZTHBXD9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKMTYZTHBXD9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love using my Washi Tape to add some excitement to regular items. Mikoka washi tape is charming and a more elegant alternative to color duct tape. The color and texture is simply more beautiful than I had imagined it would be. I used these to decorate a plain vase, gifts, picture frames, and to add a border to some coasters. There are several very attractive tapes. Uses are only limited by your imagination.This decorative tape is really easy to use in projects. Tape is high quality. The adhesive qualities are good and these seem to hold better than some others. The tape is thick enough to be sturdy, but still slightly transparent, so if you use it on high contrast things, the underlying patterns will show. They have great designs, tear easily and if you place them in the wrong spot first you can easily remove it and re-applied in the right place!

"Excellent product. I used it several times and found that is better than expected.  Using these you can grab hot pans, ovens and grill grates, really hot food directly from the grill without a problem. I used it to remove a couple of big beer chickens from the grill and carry it over to the cutting board. It was very easy because the grip is great. These gloves offer a good heat protection straight from the grill if you use both hands. Long enough to protect wrists from oven shelf burns. Compared to knitted gloves, even the really good ones, these are so much better. The dexterity is pretty good because the silicone allows for a fair amount of bend. They don't fit like a glove but hey, you won't be wearing them for all day. Easy to clean I can pop them in the dishwasher to keep them really clean. No burnt or messy hands.

"I wanted to put a light out front of our house to shine on one of our trees, so I figured a solar spot light might be the easiest option. Lights work as advertised.  It was a breeze to setup and it looks great at night.  They do best when receiving full, direct sunlight during the day. This is fairly bright LED light, producing 80 lumens at the High setting. Although the light is made from plastic, it appears to be sturdily built, and the spike is sharp enough that it slides into fairly hard ground without difficultly. It casts a decent amount of light for a garden or lawn light, even on the ""low"" setting. I've had no trouble with it. It charges, even on a cloudy day, and continues to shine until the next morning. It could be perfect if the solar panel would pivot from side to side to better collect the light. It only pivots up or down. Mine are placed in the sun, but I wouldn't call it direct by any means. Would purchase again as these are definitely better than other solar lights we have tried.

"These Beckly Travel Bottles are simply wonderful. They are attractive, soft, translucent, silicone bottles that hold up to (3) three ounces of fluid (Available in 1.2 fl. oz., 2 fl. oz. and 3 fl. oz.). They are BPA-free, safe for foods and hold anything you can think of carrying. There is a removable cap attached to the product with an opening and closing lid and this comes off and goes back on very easily. There is also a small rubber suction pad on the side of the product and this allows you to attach it to shower and bath tiles. I can take them to the gym with me and when I shower after getting out of the pool I can carry my body wash, soap, lotion, etc with me and stick them to the wall and not have to worry about them falling.They bottles are well made and come in a clear zipper bag which can be used for storage when traveling so that any leaks or spills will not ruin your luggage. They do come with flip type cap but also have a leak-proof nozzle and after leaving them filled and attached to my bathroom tiles overnight with the cap undone no product had leaked from the nozzle. They are easy to clean and dry quickly too. I will definitely use these when I am going to the gym or traveling from now on, I think they are an excellent and reliable product and I would recommend them to friends and family.I received a sample of this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.

"I am a big fan of Matcha Green Tea. I have always loved Matcha green tea and would always order green tea lattes at any coffee shop that makes them. I love the taste of green tea powder and it is a plus that there are so many nutritional benefits to it. Matcha is extremely healthy; it's loaded with antioxidants and vitamins, helps lower blood pressure, and can also be used as a weight loss supplement (in conjunction with a healthy diet, of course), and because of the L-theanine amino acid that is present in the leaf, it will actually produce a drip-effect when it comes to caffeine. That is, the caffeine you consume will be distributed evenly throughout the day instead of you getting it all at once and then crashing when it's gone. This Matcha is great, isn't as bitter/pungent as the last one I've had from another retailer. This one mixes better as well, no more tea clumps floating around my mug. The taste is sweet, light, and airy. This tea is quite smooth and carries almost no astringency or bitterness. A very light chalkiness coats the mouth. The light coat is mainly in the front and is a bit lacking in the back. I found this to be a very enjoyable ceremonial grade matcha. I will be drinking it again for sure.

"This is without a doubt one of the best teas. The Arya Classic Darjeeling Black Tea is just an extremely satisfying product. I have finally noticed that when I really like a Darjeeling, no matter what flush it is, it comes from Arya Estate. There is a very clean citrus finish, and quite a light astringency. Aroma is both fruity and floral, but there are some strange vegetal notes lurking in the background. When using water that is bit too hot, these vegetal notes are more pleasing. It leaves a sweet aftertaste in your mouth after you've finished the tea and it's gorgeous.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDTG774AO656I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T1S8T1E#wasThisHelpful","RDTG774AO656I","AKMTYZTHBXD9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKMTYZTHBXD9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The book really skims the surface of the popular NFL star's life, lacking depth of detail but covering everything.The end of this life is a moving and distressing section which the author really leaves us with more unanswered questions.

"Rosemary, The Hidden Kennedy Daughter, explores the life of Rosemary Kennedy, the eldest daughter of Rose and Joseph Kennedy, and sister to John F., Robert and Edward (Ted) Kennedy.I believe the author, Kate Larson has done her best to unearth new information and present that information in a non-provocative and edifying way.Rosemary was intellectually challenged in an era when families (especially those of status) didn't acknowledge such disabilities.Larson, shows just how much effort the Kennedy's (Joe and Rose) invested in attempting to hide their daughter's challenges and also how intensely they tried to help her move forward (or 'cure' her) before resorting to the difficult decision to proceed with a lobotomy.I can question why and how certain decisions were may have been made in this family, which is a tribute to the author; she allows as best she can to show various sides of Rosemary's story.ROSEMARY is a quick and engaging read. At times I think there was information relayed (like the constant changes in schools by the subject) which read like a travelogue without a guide. that aside, Larson does a good job of sharing Rosemary's story without being distracted by the Kennedy family itself. Rosemary, is highlighted, her family is the sidebar.I thought it promised more than it delivered to a small extant but regardless, makes for informative reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGD3URHX3ZLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547250258#wasThisHelpful","R1EGD3URHX3ZLD","A2X3ZCTZ6PUHMC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X3ZCTZ6PUHMC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

True to size would have been a medium which is what I would have ordered.The colors are beautiful (Greek Isle), the mesh on the side really allows it to breath and I love the zipper...it has some real length to it.Well made.

"""Professor Wolf tells the incredible story of how one woman was able to perform deception, heresy, seduction and murder in the heart of the Catholic Church.""The trailer is more descriptive and exciting than the book.This is an excellently written work on the deceptive and evil practices of the convent of Sant'Ambrogio in Rome by its young mistress Maria Luisa which occurred in and about 1858 and were brought to light by the German princess Katherina Von Hohenzollern. The Princes was a rather fragile, matronly soul and certainly not a figure one would think to bring about such a scandal to the open yet with her society and familial connections she was exactly the type of hysterical personality unable to mentally cope, she broke, she 'escaped ' she sparked an investigation.And Wolf chronicles this investigation minutely, covering every detail available, making use of primary and secondary source materials and while informative it's dry going. He has a writing style of breaking his trail of information and diverting down another alley before returning to his main thought which became darn irritating and at times irrelevant.Which is not to say this is not a well sourced nor well written book nor does my history have to be spoon fed to me but a little dose of sugar and a drop less confusion plus the promised dirty scandal  makes for a more enjoyable read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FSPM59ZE5096/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385351909#wasThisHelpful","R1FSPM59ZE5096","A2X3ZCTZ6PUHMC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X3ZCTZ6PUHMC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As someone who repeatedly has to wash their hands through out the day CeraVe Diaper Rash Cream has become a product I don't have to continually reapply.It is nowhere near as thick as ordinary cream of this nature which is what makes it a particularly good hand cream.It's also very effective for dry patches of skin...though I love Aquaphor and find it quite effective, it's greasy. This isn't so it's perfect for daily application.This is so just not for diaper rash!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FM90NOD2ZIHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF3SKJ6#wasThisHelpful","R2FM90NOD2ZIHJ","A2X3ZCTZ6PUHMC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X3ZCTZ6PUHMC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The suit fit perfectly, it fit exactly to size, for once I didn't have to size up for a bathing suit.One reviewer stated this doesn't really keep the prostheses in place...half true. The insert pocket is on the side and large, no struggling to place it...I simply took black thread (doubled) and overlapped a dozen stitches. Perfect.At this price I was thrilled to do it.

"I'm not deducting stars but probably the worst thing about this revamped Polaroid is the price of the film.It's a delightful camera which of course brings lots of memories for those of us of a certain age.

We've used this on Girls Nites, (loads of fun that), family gatherings and vacations for fun moments. It always generates a buzz.My teens think it's a blast.I love the instant photos for craft projects, bulletin boards, messages.....CLEAN YOUR ROOM!I just have to keep enough film around....film bundles are the best options.This would be a great graduation gift.Welcome back Polaroid!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12Y8SQCX3DD7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HR9W44#wasThisHelpful","R12Y8SQCX3DD7H","A2X3ZCTZ6PUHMC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X3ZCTZ6PUHMC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Really this is a 4/12 review -- I'm withholding that 1/2 star since they haven't been washed more than once so I can't verify how they'll hold up.( I'm thinking pretty good, having seen my fair share of clunkers)They really are good quality for the price point. I bought two sets. My 18 year old is quite happy with them, soft, not stiff or scratchy and def not poor quality.This is a purchase I'm happy with. The white is a white with a hint of grey undertones meaning - not blinding pure, and not yellow undertones. Nice.

"This is a great deal for a top of the line product. At our office this is the 'Cadillac' version of power toothbrushing. One for this price is amazing, two is out of this world.The heads move at a rapid, controlled speed (no more toothbrush abrasion!) which provides a highly significant removal of plaque.The timer will alert you when to move on from one quadrant to the next. Using it for the full two minutes is key!The travel case is a great bonus, charge it and go, it should stay charged for at least five days if not longer so most of the time there is no need to take the charger with you.It's important to know with power toothbrushes to get the best life span from them ( the only problem I've had is when I dropped it onto a tile floor) is to charge fully, then unplug the unit. You'll know when it's time to charge -- there's not a significant difference in the movement of the head but you will notice its a tad slower.

"The Set Up Man is T.T.Monday's debut novel and pun intended, he hits a homerun.Johnny Adcock is a relief pitcher for the San Jose Bay Dogs with a side job as a private investigator, granted most, perhaps all of the jobs have to do with investigating his teammates and other players in MLB.Cheating wives and finances are his specialty although this time out he's stumbled upon a murder investigation when his current client (catcher Herrera) comes to him for both a standard job yet one that becomes increasingly more complex.The story has some unexpected turns and has the potential to turn into an enjoyable series, Monday has created a nicely flawed main character.The baseball background is well done, informative and interesting but in no way overwhelms the plot, it enhances it. I actually enjoyed this detail -- it was well done and added a different element.Monday has also created great side characters.So treat yourself to this little gem with a lot of plot, heart, detail, action and a really good read!Hope the Bay Dogs and Adcock stick around!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQUZG0YHKE5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538456#wasThisHelpful","R3AQUZG0YHKE5L","A2X3ZCTZ6PUHMC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X3ZCTZ6PUHMC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"fantastic LED bulbs at a good price. We installed these in regular old-fashioned kitchen spotlights that were sucking up an enormous 60W per bulb. With 12 of these new LED lamps taking only 6W per bulb, we're able to operate 10 lamps for the cost of one. We were always in the kitchen, so having 720W of lighting on almost constantly was a huge drain on the electric bill.

"Wow, nice, fast drive. Very cute little guy. I was concerned that the drive would be too heavy/awkward hanging out of the laptop but what you don't see/read in the descriptions is that this drive comes with a very wide cable, meaning the cable is about 1/4 inch wide. Therefore the drive can literally hang out of your laptop while the laptop is elevated with little to no wear or stress on the connector or cable.

"UPDATE JULY 3, 2015:I ended up buying the laptop from HP directly - cheaper than on Amazon plus you get the full HP warranty directly. The issue with the keyboard I mentioned below is not that big of a deal. First, you can turn on and off the backlighting (F5 key). Second, the letters are a dark gray, not white, on my machine. They are also transparent so when you turn on the backlighting you can actually see through them. I was also wishing for a black machine, but I really like this metal one. It reminds me of a Mac Air I had a couple years ago. The PC is extremely well built. Very solid. And it's very fast - better than the 4th gen i7 laptop it's replacing (with the same RAM). Boot up is also noticely faster than my prior i7 SSD (it was a Lenovo) (6 seconds with this machine vs about 15 for the Lenovo). The only criticism i have is where the power cord attaches into the socket. The jack is at an angle and it's hard to get it to stay firmly in the power out hole. It says mostly in, but wiggles out often. Not major. Still, this is the best laptop on the market right now. Oh, did i mention the screen? Great colors!PREVIOUS REVIEW:I was looking forward to purchasing this as my next laptop. I was really, really looking forward to it. Everything - almost - about it was perfect: the SSD, good screen, folding screen, etc. I went to see the laptop in person at a computer store and that's when I was devastated: the keyboard was unusable - and here's why. The characters on the keyboard are written in white. That's gray paint on silver keys. The silver keys are surrounded by a backlight from the LED lights underneath. So basically you are entirely unable to discern which keys are which on the keyboard. On the model I saw in the store, the keys were already being worn down so what I was starting to see was a day when you would have 100 silver keys on a keyboard and have no ability to figure out which key went where. This is one of those stupid mistakes that never should have happened. If this laptop had a normal black keyboard like the Dell or Lenovo models, I would have bought it without hesitation. Shame.UPDATE 5 June 2015:I have since discovered that one can purchase silicone keyboard overlays for less than US$10 that will fit this laptop. OK that's a great workaround but really HP? You didn't think this through.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36I2ZDSZP29UL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCENG14#wasThisHelpful","R36I2ZDSZP29UL","A39H670PD32Z1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39H670PD32Z1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Second card I've had in 2 years and both failed. On the first card, the connector grooves broke apart. For the second card, the card suddenly wouldn't let me write to or copy from it, then all of a sudden it needed to be reformatted - with all my data on it! Lexar replaced the cards but what about all the data I lost - both times. Cannot trust a Lexar SD card anymore.  To be clear, these cards were used only with light use. They were cared for in protected sleeves when not in use. They were used 1-2x per week. I always clicked on stop the drive before removing from the SD card slot. These cards were not abused or mishandled. There is a fundamental design flaw that causes them to break down prematurely.

"I was impressed when unpacking it. I thought, this looks great. Build felt nice, etc. First, let me say that I was only able to use this computer 2 days before I got a ""bootable drive not found"" error that fully prevented rebooting and I had to return the machine. Luckily all data was backed up in the cloud or I would not have been happy. At all.My first problem is the crapware that was loaded onto the PC. Acer insists to include its AbCloud tools so that you can store your music, pictures and documents in the cloud. Oh, you mean like dropbox. I wish PC manufacturers would quit trying to be clever and spend valuable development resources inventing something that already exists and works so well - oh, and dropbox is free too.The keyboard layout is wonky. The up and down arrows are tiny little things that you could easily mis-press an adjacent key. The delete button is a massive square which is kind of nice. To get page up or page down, you have to use an alt+ function - not nice.The screen quality is just OK. even at the 1920 x .... resolution, it just doesn't seem as sharp as it should. Once I figured out how to turn off the adaptive brightness (dims screen because it knows better than you), then the screen was bright enough. But everything on the screen - like the program icons were all grainy. This shouldn't happen.Oh, Acer has a bunch of other programs - something like 10 to 15 programs and you have to go hunting to find what you want to change. Very awkward. Why not put all software tools in one, nice, tidy Acer console. Nope. Instead, the first screen page in Add/Remove programs is full of Acer junk.The easel/hinge situation seemed fine. The tablet mode was also nice. The PC is definitely lightweight, which was also nice. And the speakers/sound quality was excellent, much better than I expected.In summary, Acer could have a great machine if it solved the clunkware issue, redesigned the keyboard (hint: look at Lenovo's keyboards), and improved the screen graininess, especially at the high resolution the system offers. I'll keep my eyes open for the R 13.5 instead. Ultimately, it was the fun ""bootable drive not found"" error that sent the machine back.

"I wasn't sure whether I'd like this carry-on suitcase but I took a chance, given Amazon's nice return policy. The carry-on turned out to be fantastic. Very well made, and a very good design. I took it on a series of international flights with me and it always fit in the overhead compartment and under some seats (if there was not an obstruction in the way - like a power box under the seat in front of you). It's true what the other reviews say - the lock is kind of silly - someone could just get in from the front side. But since when has a suitcase lock ever kept anyone out of a suitcase? They'd just steal your whole bag, right? I also wasn't sure about the red color, but honestly I really like it.

"Television networks seem hell bent on replacing good shows with, shall we say, not so good shows. A lot of great shows have bit the dust unnecessarily.

I'm surprised that Halle Berry took this role. And if she wasn't the main character, this show would fall apart. If Season 2 doesn't come, I really wouldn't care at all.

"excellent set of headphones. affordable but not cheap. I bought these to take on the plane with me to listen to movies. I bought this version with the 3.5 mm jack and not the USB plug, then I bought a separate USB plug that I can plug these 3.5 mm jacks into. The reason I did this is sometimes USB plugs stick out too far or are too firm and could break the USB plug itself. Anyway, the sound is crystal clear, both for incoming audio and for transmitting my voice via the mic. My only pet peeve with this device is that the mic does not retransmit the sound back to the headphones when you are having a phone call. Therefore, you hear your voice ""muffled"" because it is over your ears. Not a big deal, but it would be nice. These are also very comfortable. I paid about $25 for these. I also have a $250 pair of Sennheisers. The Sennheisers are very nice, yes and they do retransmit your spoken voice back into the headset.

"can you believe it is so hard to find cheap bean bag refill? this is absolutely adequate, although be careful when opening it. the little balls have an electric charge and will float around the room as you try to pour them out of the bagUPDATE: I bought 2 of these and just spent an entire afternoon cleaning up the crazy little balls all over my driveway (I will try to upload a video of the mess). Not only is this an environmental mess, 1/2 the product floats away (or cannot be removed from the bag due to the static electricity) so it's a poor solution.

" 0:59 MinsThis fork lift came in a very nice displayed box, and in it came a fork lift, a plastic pallet, a oil drum, rechargable battery pack, and a remote control.  The fork lift is made of high quality material, all the details this toy is very well precise.This fork lift packs with power and fun, it takes a bit of practice to control it.  Especially, when you have to use the fork lift to get underneath the pallet and lift it up.  I know my son will go crazy when he see this toy (It will be his Christmas present), because me and my husband had so much fun testing it out.The remote control will take sometimes to get use too and this is also a minus on this toy because on the remote control, there is a side to side button yet it's just there, it doesn't work.  (Not a defected item, just how it's made) On both sides, only the up and down buttons work, and you have to use both of them (from both sides) to control the fork lift.All in all, this fork lift has real nice well detailed design, fun to play with and itis very powerful as well.

" 0:42 MinsThis solar charger with LED light is great for any home in case of emergency and also great for hiking and camping. The LED light is super bright, and they last for a long time.The solar takes forever to charge in the sun though, but its only for emergency so it acceptable for me.There are two outputs, 2.1 and 1.0 for regular and faster charging speed. The solar charger came with a so short chagrging cable. It is not too heavy so carrying it around is not a problem. However it doesnt have a place for me to put a hook to hang it which make it a bit inconvenient. Another minus point about it is the on/off button of the light is super sensitive, it will turn on with every little bump which is very annoying and i have not figure out how to stop that.I got this charger at a discounted price for prodict testing purpose and this is my honest and unbiased review","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38OZA6FGMU17T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0101LCZ3C#wasThisHelpful","R38OZA6FGMU17T","ADXYKQVR9ZTRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADXYKQVR9ZTRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son loves bath times like most kids, he would stays in the bathtub as long as you let him and every time you tell him it's time to get out, he would say ""One more minutes"" lol.  Anyways, the toys he has in there were given to him two years ago and I have been meaning to buy him new ones.  When I came across these toys, they just so cute so I decided to get them for him.As you can see in the pictures, these came in three cars, one plane, one helicopter, one train, two boats, one cano, and one submarine.  Now, as I opened the box, I only allowed him to get three at a time, but he kept begging so I gave in and gave him all ten of them.  We told him that he can play with the toys during bath time, but he couldn't care less about which toys for bath or not, he just carry them around all the times.His favorite is the submarine, he loves submarine because he saw it from the show ""Dinosaur Train"", and this is the first submarine toy he own and it squeaks.  The submarine is the only one the squeaks in this set so not too worry parents,  I know, as a mom, I try to avoid toys that makes too much noise.These toys' quality are high, they are made of high quality rubber and the painting are well detailed and the colors are vibrant and well designed.The packaging looks very professional and look fancy.My son loves them and he had so much fun playing with them during bath time, and non bath time and even sleep time.

" 1:02 MinsI've always been wanting a drone for my son, I think it would be fun for him and the pet chasing it around.  However, with a 2 years old, I don't want to buy an expensive one because I know it will get destroyed real fast.  So while looking for an affordable one, I was lucky enough to tumble on this Top Race Mini Drone.This is a great starter drone for first time owner to practice on and lots of fun to play with, it's very unique because you can have it rolls around, running around the floor, or fly up high and do tricks.  However, the only trick I know right now is to fly it up high and crash.The good thing about this mini drone is it's very durable.  When I opened the box, and saw how small it was my thought at that moment was it wouldn't last long.  All the parts of the drone feel so flimsy and fragile, I didn't dare hold it too hard, but after playing with it, crashing it many many times, it still works great.The battery last a while too, we can play with it for good 10 minutes before we have to charge it again.The only thing I don't like about it is the wheels fall off too easily which make it hard to do fast turns on the floor.  To switch the wheels and the protective case out, you have to be very careful, take your time and do it in a good lighting area.My son loves it, the cat tries to catch it, and the dog just ignores it, but we all had fun playing with it.  I am trying to master my skills in controlling it so we can do some awesome tricks to it.I received this Mini-Drone for free of charge for product testing purpose and this is my honest review and experience with this drone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P70KXDHTQGBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSFM5O0#wasThisHelpful","R3P70KXDHTQGBL","ADXYKQVR9ZTRN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ADXYKQVR9ZTRN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"About the same time I retired I discovered the In Death series by J. D. Robb (Nora Roberts). Eventually I went overboard in my enthusiasm and collected a copy of every In Death novel and novella. So I own all these weird paranormal romance novella collections with a Robb novella and some novellas by the other authors. Out of all of these collections, the novella I loved the best and remember the best is the one by Patricia Gaffney in this collection. The old man who calls the psychic hotline is adorable. His son is grumpy and protective. The woman answering the psychic hot line has her life in a mess and is lonely and kind and sweet. Her aunt is spunky. It is a funny light hearted story with a happy ending. When I get tired of Robb and decided to sell all her books to the Recycled Bookstore, I am keeping this one just for the Gaffney story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CGVCVR9E3Q98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052REQ42#wasThisHelpful","R2CGVCVR9E3Q98","A3JOEIC2MFT1Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JOEIC2MFT1Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Since the organization that issued this booklet is one whose members are always recruiting on campuses that makes sense for them, but not for ordinary Christians. Personally, I think the Christians sects are overabundantly supplied with preachers and would be preachers.

"I have a lot of clutter in my house, paper clutter. Mail, catalogs, newspapers, magazines, greeting cards, and thousands of books. I went to kindle to reduce the number of incoming physical books; my bookshelves are full and there is no more space for more bookshelves. And I have gone to kindle magazine subscriptions. This is my most expensive subscription. It is worth it for me. And I have just found out the New Yorker posts other articles on their web site daily, things that are even more interesting than the articles in the kindle issue, that I can easily access from my kindle issue by clicking on the New Yorker dot com link inside the kindle issue without having to logon the web site. It has everything in the issue and much more! I feel like saying ""duh""  for not realizing this months ago.As far as complaints about print size, no sympathy from me. My father had type 2 diabetic retinopathy. Yet he managed to read fine print until he died using a high powered magnifying glass. It looks like, despite a good Hb A1c value, I too may develop retinopathy. I intend to follow my father's behavior and take it well and use a high powered magnifying glass, if it happens, for reading and other sight based hobbies. (I always thought the artist Titian's work was more interesting when his sight was failing than his younger works.) Just keep writing the magazine, not Amazon, about your gripes until the magazine responds in a positive way.

"I liked this one very much. Bess is at an aid station near the front lines.  An orderly reports something strange to her. She notices something odd. Before she can report either to her supervisor, she falls deathly ill with the Spanish influenza. It is a long time before she gets better. It is a long time before she remembers what the orderly told and showed her and the other odd thing she had noticed. And she is stuck in Britain due to having been so ill, so it is very hard for her to investigate a terrible killer that no one suspects. With Simon's help, and her own sheer persistence, justice is found for the killer's victims. Extremely enjoyable!

If you have any concerns about the severity of your burn or the size of your burn, you should go to urgent care instead.

Replace when all of the fluid in the burn pad has been absorbed by skin (at least once a day). It feels like the burn is soaking in cool water and does not hurt.

"This appears to be a direct knockoff of the Canon 2.0x III Extender which costs 2.5x as much. I tested this against the Kenko 2x Pro 300 teleconverter (which is one of the best) and by comparison this has better corner sharpness and much reduced chromatic aberrations. In fact it basically eliminates the CA near the edge of the frame that you get with most teleconverters.I can't say for sure that this is as good as the genuine Canon version but it is darn good. If I ever get my hands on the Canon I'll update my review but I see no reason to--this TC is that good.Just like the Canon 2.0x III Extender, this lens is only compatible with the longer Canon L lenses (135mm and up). You can't use it with the 100mm 2.8 Macro L for instance. That's because of the protruding optic that will not allow you to mount this on anything but the longer L lenses.Keep an eye on this company, they've got a number of canon compatible lighting accessories, and even a straight knockoff of the Canon 50mm F/1.8 nifty-fifty.Note: On some lower-end camera bodies this will only auto-focus with f/2.8 or better lenses but on the Canon 5D Mark III it does focus on f/4 lenses but not always reliably.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B1W138KMVABF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OT0VCP4#wasThisHelpful","R1B1W138KMVABF","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The technology of this device is called Cranial Electrical Stimulation, or CES and is referred to in these books: MegaBrain Power by Michael Hutchison; SuperLearning 2000 by Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder; and Hooked? NET: The new approach to drug cure by Meg Patterson.The Unit:There are two electrodes that clip to the ears and deliver an electrical impulse of multiple frequencies which are supposed to be beneficial for the brain. There are six settings for the frequency which is Pulse-Width Selectable (550uS [modes 1-3] and 220uS [modes 4-6). It can be set for continuous output (modes 1 and 4), One second on/one second off (modes 2 and 5) and 7.83 Hz Schumann (Earth Frequency) modulated (modes 3 and 6). Unfortunately the manufacturer provides no information as to the effects of each setting so the user is left on her own to experiment. Some of the supposed benefits are: Improved mood, better sleep, improved memory, creativity, learning, and intelligence. Some people supposedly report lucid dreaming and old memories resurfacing.The Experience:The device is easy enough to use and the mild electrical impulse is felt on the earlobes where the electrodes are attached. I usually turn it up to where the tingling can be felt quite a bit and then turn it down slightly. The unit can be easily slipped into a pocket so you can move about during the session. It has a timer so it goes into sleep mode after 20 minutes. Two twenty minute sessions are suggested per day over a period of 30 days. I guess it is recommended to vary the settings from time to time but again the manufacturer provides little to no guidance.The Results:The device did not seem to induce any immediate change in mood, consciousness, or awareness. Subjectively there seems to be a slight relaxation response during use but this could be the placebo effect. I used the device nightly for several weeks and the only real thing I noticed was a single resurfaced memory. No long-term benefits were apparent. Perhaps I was expecting too much from this device but I would have to say that I am disappointed that there was not a more obvious mood lifting effect. I really wanted to be excited over this technology but I'm sorry to say I really can't recommend this over simpler techniques such as yoga, qigong, meditation, or basic aerobic exercise to lift the mood. I would like to have more information about what the different modes of this device are for. Too bad, but there has really been nothing to write home about.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDVI0PY4HK4QT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NB88C8#wasThisHelpful","RDVI0PY4HK4QT","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've worked with and written about many many lenses including Zeiss, Canon, Tamron and Sigma, but I have to say that no lens released in recent memory excites me as much as this one. That's because I've never encountered an f/1.4 lens that begs to be shot wide open, all the time. Until now shooting at f/1.4 has always been a compromise in image quality. At this focal length the only lens that has come anywhere near to this one in edge-to-edge clarity and color rendition is the Zeiss 50mm f/2.0 Makro Planar lens, and that is a lens that costs $300 more, only goes to f/2, and doesn't have auto focus. Even the Zeiss 55mm f/1.4 Otus Distagon T* Lens, which costs about $3000 more than this lens and is out of reach of most photographers including myself, does not offer auto-focus, and in this day and age, auto-focus is nearly a must-have option in a modern high-cost lens.I have the Canon f/1.4 lens, and while that's a good lens, lighter and more compact, the image quality wide open leaves a lot to be desired. There is a spot of decent sharpness in the center, but as you move out to the outer edges of the frame, there's a lot of blurriness and the overall color rendition is kind of flat. It's a fine lens when stopped down smaller than f/2.8, but the whole reason to own a fast lens is to be able to use it wide open with confidence.This Sigma beauty finally changes all that. In my first outing I shot over 100 images at a party gathering with only incandescent available light, every one of them at f/1.4, and the shots are all gorgeous. Not only is the whole image sharp across the frame (when objects are in the plane of focus), but the out-of-focus areas are also rendered in a quite pleasing way. The colors are rich with a lot of depth, and the whole impression is one of lovely portraiture. (50mm is a good focal length for group portraiture, for head shots 135mm is best.) As good as this lens is wide open, it's even better just one stop down at f/2. But unlike every other 50mm f/1.4 SLR lens ever made, you don't HAVE to stop it down to achieve remarkable image quality.The build on this lens is remarkable. It is extremely solid while at the same time quite elegant in design. It exudes luxury.In real-world use, the auto focus is pretty responsive. In low light, I never had a problem with it hunting or failing to find focus--as long as I didn't point it at a blank wall! My copy does not back-focus or front-focus. It just works.All in all, I can't recommend this lens enough. It's a masterpiece, both technically and subjectively from viewing the images it produces. It's certainly not an all-in-one solution to all your photography needs, but for existing light situations, this is by far the best lens I have ever used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EMDMOVOEA81W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPL7CK6#wasThisHelpful","R1EMDMOVOEA81W","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've shot with Nikon, Canon, Panasonic, and now Sony SLRs and Mirrorless camera.. My favorite camera is and will remain the Canon 5D Mark III. I've owned and used the famed Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8G, and a number of Canon ultra wide angle lenses. But this lens is hands down the best ultra wide angle zoom I've ever used. The clarity, color, and sharpness are beyond any offers from Nikon or Canon.I got a Sony A99 just so that I could shoot with these incredible Zeiss autofocus lenses. There are only a handful of them. The Sony/Zeiss 135mm f/1.8 Carl Zeiss Sonnar T was the first one I shot with. It's hands down the best portrait lens I've ever used.This lens doesn't go as wide as the Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8G, but it goes to 35mm on the long end. And it's more compact than that Nikon beast. For me the 25-35mm range is so much more useful than the 14-15mm I'm not getting on the wide end. This is a matter of style, taste, and choice, but for me personally, 16mm is plenty wide enough for just about any landscape shot.  I don't like the perspective distortion you get at wider angles, unless you can display the image on a large wall--then they look really cool, but the perspective distortion at normal print sizes or on the computer screen just isn't very pleasing.The corners are pretty sharp wide open and you don't get the smearing that you get with most UWA lenses. Very sharp as you get to the long end.The only shame is that this lens isn't made in Canon or Nikon mounts, or in the new Sony E-mount. The A-mount is being surpassed by the E-mount, and you have to use an expensive adapter to use this lens on an E-mount camera. I'm not sold on the E-mount system, as the native zoom lenses are mostly F4 or smaller aperture. I like having the F2.8.These are just first impressions. I'll update the review as I have more time with this gem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18A2UPI1WKWK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FORHOW#wasThisHelpful","R18A2UPI1WKWK3","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought for use as a combination mash/lauter tun for brewing beer. It's even more insulated than the standard industrial version.The nice thing about it is you don't have to drill out or alter the hole for the spigot, so if I want I can put back the Igloo spigot and convert it back for use with cold beverages.Five gallons won't be enough if you want to brew a really big beer (over 1.060 OG) but it's large enough for me as I can just scale back the recipe to 3 or 4 gallons if I want to do that.

"I was forced to replace my old Panasonic KX-P7100 because there are no Windows 7 drivers for it. Planned obsolescence. I did a ton of research before setting on this model (M401dn). The D stands for Duplexing and the N stands for Networking. There is a DW version which is for Wireless.If cost was not a factor, I would have opted for the DW (wireless) version. But there are so many deals on this model and the price difference just to get wireless was over $200. You have to ask yourself if you really need ""wireless"": after all, you can just as easily network this model with an Ethernet cable to your router, or you can use a USB cable and simply share the printer with the other computers over your wireless network. Either way you get the same functionality of the wireless model, the ability to print over a WiFi network; the only difference is a single cable.I was sad to give up my still functioning Panasonic but I have to admit this is a nice upgrade from that old printer. The main difference is the speed--there is zero warmup time, and the pages literally fly out of the machine. There is little to no cool-down period either, unless you print a big job, then a fan kicks in for a bit. Other than that, this printer is virtually silent.I got an amazing open box deal (may still be available from the ""Other Sellers"" link). This can sometimes mean signs of use and/or missing components but mine came looking like new in the HP box with a power cable, and yes, a USB printer cable. There was no setup disk but I was able to download the drivers and printer software from HP in a matter of minutes. Installation was ridiculously fast and user-friendly, they held my hand through the short process.In no time I was printing, not only from my main computer but also from the other computers on my WiFi network (after reading a short tutorial online about how to do printer sharing in Windows 7). Luckily it was NOT the hair-pulling experience I was afraid it was going to be!Another thing I like about this model is the paper handling. I print a lot of shipping labels and the 50-sheet multipurpose tray is perfect for that and way better than the old single page feed slot of my Panasonic, where I had to sit there feeding labels in one at a time. I now get things done quicker.The output--it's top notch. The font clarity is typeset quality. That is one of the main reasons I went with HP. Yes you can pick up a wireless model from Brother or Oki for around the same or lower price but the print quality may not be as superb. This is more solidly built as well, a real workhorse that should last for years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ34LF9MMD8D5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ED7R1G#wasThisHelpful","RZ34LF9MMD8D5","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thing clears a wide path through snows of 2-4"" or less. There are several issues, however. First of all it fills up quickly and gets too heavy to push. Secondly, much of the snow just gets pushed off the sides and you still have to go back and clear it with multiple passes. If you haven't had much snow already, then you can wheel the load onto your lawn and dump it. However, if you've already had considerable snow then there is no way to wheel it over an embankment. You can sort of tip it and fling the snow using your feet but it's not ideal.This scoop fills in the gaps when there's not enough snow to bother with a snow-thrower. In light snow, several passes and you're done. It's practically useless in deep snow as there is no way to lift and throw the snow. All you can do is tip it off to the side. And you may end up getting a shovel out anyway to lift some of the snow up onto the embankment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNPRB6LFZOWDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000VUTTQ#wasThisHelpful","RNPRB6LFZOWDX","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This guide purports to tell you how to brew an authentic Altbier (""Old Beer""). The vast majority of beers brewed in Germany are Lagers. Altbier is one of the few German ales that still exists, but is only brewed in a small area in and around Dusseldorf. The style is pretty rare. I don't think you can get authentic German Altbier in the United States, so you have to brew it. I am a home brewer and have brewed this beer.The book gives an interesting history of Altbier, description of the style, ingredients, equipment and methods of brewing. Altbier is an ale that is mashed using a 3 to as much as 5 step temperature mash, fermented at moderately low temperature (60-62F), and conditioned at lagering temperatures.With most homebrewing books you can skip right to the recipes. Unfortunately, the recipes here are not fully developed. Instead of complete recipes the author calls them ""guidelines"". They are basically just ingredients and specifications. You must refer back to the text for specifics on mash schedule, boil time, hops addition timing, fermentation procedure, and conditioning instructions, as these are not included in the recipes. The author could have made it lot easier for the reader by simply including these in each recipe as most home brewing books do.There are some inconsistencies in the book. For instance, under mashing the author states that ""Total mash times for alt vary from a low of 150 to a high of 170 minutes."" However, when he details the mash procedure, the mash times total no higher than 100 minutes, and the specific procedure he recommends for the home brewer is only 60 minutes total.The biggest flaw is that most of the recipes include ingredients that would NOT be included in an authentic Altbier. In an effort to make things easier for the American home brewer, the author formulated the recipes using ingredients he thought would be easily accessible, rather than purely authentic. As a result, the recipes are a re-creation or simulation of an Altbier, but are not 100% true to the style. In particular, the majority of the recipes contain American crystal malt, primarily for color. However there is NO crystal malt used in an authentic Altbier.The author revealed in an email that the color in the darker Dusseldorf Altbiers comes not from crystal but from the addition of a malt-essence coloring agent called SINAMAR, an extract made by the Weyermann Malting Company of Bamberg. It was invented in 1903. SINAMAR is made from dehusked Weyermann Carafa malt. Because the grain base of this product is dehusked, there is no bitterness associated with this liquid, just dark concentrated color.When the author wrote the manuscript for the Alt book in 1997/8, SINAMAR was not available in North America, so he never mentioned it. He fudged and resorted to crystal malt for color in the book. To avoid roasty notes, he kept the color value to no more than 60 Lovibond. The results are simulations of Altbier but if you are a purist you should know that the addition of crystal malt is inaccurate. Now, SINAMAR is available in the United States, where it is imported and distributed by Crosby & Baker. Unfortunately the book never mentions it so we have to do our own formulating. As a guideline, 4 oz. will add 16 SRM units to 5 gallons. SINAMAR is used to add color only, it does not effect flavor or add roasted notes. If you are not a stickler for authenticity, go ahead and use the crystal. I used Weyermann Caramunich and Carafa malts to darken my altbier instead of American crystal malt, because these are German products and I believe truer to style. Another alternative might be to use a tiny amount of debittered black malt for color, or just leave out the crystal altogether.The one completely authentic recipe in the book is the ""Enderlein's Alt"".  This is actually a clone of Schumacher Alt, still brewed in the oldest altbier brewpub in Dusseldorf (and thus probably the world). It uses only one type of grain, a two-row Pils malt kilned to a pale Munich color rating of 6.5. It uses only German Hallertau hops. Any darkness in the color comes strictly from the Malliard Reaction that occurs in the long boiling time (up to 120 minutes). The formulation was supplied by Mr. Herbert Enderlein, the brewmaster at Brauerei Ferdinand Schumacher so this is the real deal.Altbier is nearly a lost art and is mostly off the radar of today's hop-heavy craft beer seekers. Pick this book up if you want to explore some beer making history and try your hand at brewing a very traditional style with noble hops and a classic Old World taste.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSOMRGDV09MY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0937381624#wasThisHelpful","RSOMRGDV09MY0","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a thorough compendium of herbal ingredients that can and have been used in place of or in addition to hops. The author is particularly prejudiced against using hops, as he explains at length, claiming that government mandating of the use of sedating hops over other more energetic bittering agents was an early ""drug law"". While I appreciate what he is trying to accomplish in that regard, the reality is that centuries of use have proven hops to be the best and most flavorful all-around bittering agent for beer.Another reason the author is adverse to using hops is his claim that they have estrogen-mimicking compounds that he claims may cause impotence in men. I don't believe this claim has been proven. Regardless, most commercial American beers contain very little hops, and I have seen no scientific evidence that hops are either an anaphrodisiac (dulling the sex drive) or cause impotence in men.Now on to the content of the book: A lot of ground is covered in terms of flavoring and bittering agents that can be used instead of hops. There are tons of recipes that can be used as a springboard to start your own investigation of gruit and other non-hopped ales. The recipes themselves are often VERY basic, using nothing more than brown sugar or molasses as the carbohydrate source. This will not produce a very high quality beer, however. I would recommend that you have a solid brewing foundation and a comfort level with building your own recipes before embarking on this path.Some of the background information, while interesting, is a bit sketchy. There are repeated accounts of folk tales and origin myths about where plants came from, usually involving some allegorical fairy tale from indigenous mythology, none of which held my interest for long. Don't get me wrong, I have respect for the ways and teachings of indigenous peoples, and I think it is important to preserve their cultures and traditions, but I just don't think that many brewers are going to want to wade through page after page of origin mythology to get to the simple recipes that follow. The message here is that that every single plant, seed, foodstuff, or fermentation vat ever used was ""sacred"" to some tribe or another. I get it, if your life depends on corn, then corn is ""sacred"". If you don't know about yeast, then the spontaneous fermentation process seems wondrous and ""from the gods"". But we understand these things now, so I could have done without all the repetitive ""sacredness"" of virtually every ingredient.The descriptions of the mind-altering properties of the various herbs are also quite unfocused. My main problem is that the author simply attributes nonspecific ""narcotic properties"" to a great number of herbs. Some of these herbs may have some mild psychoactive effects, but the author makes no effort to distinguish between them or describe what the psychoactive properties actually are. He also makes no reference to studies or even anecdotal reports of their psychoactive effects or names the active compound in most cases. How about some ""trip reports""?To simply ascribe the vague term ""narcotic effects"" is utterly meaningless in this context. First of all, the author claims that most of these herbs are stimulating as opposed to the supposed ""sedating"" effects of hops. But ""narcotic"" means ""sleep inducing"" and is usually a term used to describe opiates or other addictive pain relievers. But none of these herbs resemble opiates in any way, and ""stimulating"" and ""narcotic"" are a contradiction in terms. So the reader is left with very few clues as to how these herbs actually effect the mind, if they indeed have any psychoactive properties at all. From the few accounts I have read from brewers who have made gruit and other non-hopped beers, any mind-altering effects from the herbs were either extremely subtle or unnoticeable.Then there are the many accounts of the alleged healing effects of the various herbs. These often read like a laundry list of conditions that the herbs were traditional used to treat or cure. Again, there are no references to any studies that validate any of the claims of the healing effects of these herbs on particular diseases, and some of these claims seem quite dubious. There are also no dosages given, and if you are serious about treating an ailment with herbs, this information is essential. I am in favor of using alternative medicine such as vitamins, herbs, massage therapy, acupuncture etc. in preference to or in conjunction with western medicine. But I also have a science background and there is no reason we should settle for folk tales as evidence of the efficacy of these herbs when we have modern science at our disposal to verify that they actually work.Some of the other negative reviews have focused on the inclusion of potentially poisonous herbs such as henbane and jimson weed in a couple recipes. While these plants should be treated with utmost respect, I actually appreciated the fact that he included these powerful ""witches brews"" in the book for completeness. Don't try these at home unless you are an experienced plant psychonaut; for me it is sufficient just to read about them.Ultimately the book was an easy and enjoyable read, although I had to skip through much of the origin myth stories. I plan on brewing my first ales flavored with yarrow, sweet gale, mugwort, heather, other herbs discussed. This will be a starting point for further investigation and for that I am grateful. I just wish that the author hadn't been so heavy-handed and had more accurately described the psychoactive properties of these herbs in any other terms besides ""narcotic properties"".UPDATE APRIL 2013: I brewed my first batch of Gruit, the main ""sacred"" brew described in this book, and the results were somewhat disappointing. The flavor leaves a lot to be desired, and now I understand why hops rose to be the primary flavoring component of beer and have held that position for the past 6-7 centuries. Gruit tastes very earthy and primaeval, it does not have the refined taste qualities of beer. Unfortunately Gruit is a bit ""yucky"" and isn't going to win a lot of converts. As for ""stimulating"" or ""inebriating"" properties from the herbs, don't expect anything to write home about. The main psychoactive ingredient remains the alcohol, and any specific mind-altering properties contributed by the herbs is subtle, difficult to discern and not worth putting up with the somewhat nasty flavor.Now that I have actually brewed Gruit and tasted the results, I have had to downgrade my review of this book from 3 to 2 stars. Anyone want some yarrow?","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTW0VIEU1V54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0937381667#wasThisHelpful","RTW0VIEU1V54","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Prince... they all got their inspiration from the Source, Jackie Wilson. With a multi-octave operatic vocal range that he mastered with amazing command, plus one of the most emotional deliveries ever, Jackie Wilson has few peers in the pop vocal world. Unfortunately his talent was often masked with sub-par material, syrupy string arrangements and lily white vocal choruses. Even so, when he sang a song like ""Danny Boy"", there was never a dry eye in the house.Jackie's albums meandered from doo-wop to early R&B to jazz standards to operatic arias to funk to Northern Soul... and everything in between... including Al Jolsen! But even when he was given the most sappy pablum, Jackie always rose above the material, and that soaring Voice always rang true.Luckily on these two offerings the arrangements have a bit more grit and soul than the usual stuff that was thrown at him. Other than ""Baby Workout"" there are no recognizable hits here, and many of the tunes are derivative of some of his earlier hits, such as ""Say You Will"", which anyone will immediately recognize as a direct knock-off of ""Lonely Teardrops"". But there are hidden gems in this collection too, like ""You Only Live Once"", ""Big Boss Line"", ""Deep Down Love"", and a number of others, including one of my favorite overlooked Jackie tunes, ""Take One Step (And I'll Take Two)"".For years the only way to get these albums was to dig through dusty record bins or bid on eBay for old, worn, scratchy copies. Sadly, these Edsel paired CD reissues are long out of print, but at least you can still find some for sale.Tragically, while performing the song ""Lonely Teardrops"" in a Dick Clark oldies review show in 1976, Jackie Wilson suffered a major heart attack and fall on stage. With the saddest of irony, it was while singing the line ""my heart is crying, crying"", that he clutched his chest and hit his head, incurring permanent brain damage that left him in a semi-vegetative coma for eight long years, until he finally succumbed in 1984.Jackie Wilson was and always will be truly a singer's singer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SV09OUM3NQRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000K49O#wasThisHelpful","R3SV09OUM3NQRR","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While the product is effective, and essentially the same as the Preparation H product it is NOT ""flushable"". These cloth-like wipes do not disintegrate in your sewer pipes or in the municipal sewage system. After some years of use, they clogged my sewer main, causing a backup that required multiple passes of a main line snake to remove, which took many hours of labor. The wipes were entangled on the snake and had to be unwound and cut off, a tedious, disgusting job. The wipes get snagged on roots or other obstructions in the line, and remain there for years if not dealt with.Even if the wipes make it past your sewer line, municipal sewer systems are having problems with these clogging up their sewage treatment pumps. There are a number of articles about this on the web, and several municipalities have sent out ""No wipes in the pipes"" flyers to residents to urge them to stop flushing the products.It's interesting that the Preparation H brand is still advertised as ""flushable"" but for this generic Walgreens version, they quietly removed the word ""flushable"" from the packaging after 2010.

"My title is not hyperbole. This is optically the best SLR zoom lens ever made to date, by any manufacturer. The sharpness, resolving power, and color rendition of this lens is equal to or even BETTER than most prime lenses that fall within this focal range of 70-200mm. Not only that, but the ergonomics of this lens are par none. Having both internal focus and internal zoom means that the lens never extends, nor does the front element ever rotate. It's S-M-O-O-T-H. This lens performs especially well at the long end of 200mm, which is where you will probably end up using it most of the time if you're shooting wildlife or sports from a distance. The latest Image Stabilization is also phenomenal, giving you about 4 extra stops of hand-holding ability, with little noise. Yes all of the accolades that have been bestowed on this lens are well deserved. If you can afford it and you need f/2.8, then absolutely get it.That said, before you jump in to this beast you should seriously consider its little brother, the Canon EF 70-200mm f/4 L IS USM Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras.The f/4 version isn't as highly touted as this lens, but it's (nearly) every bit as good optically and way better ergonomically. The f/4 version is not only about half the weight, it's about half the size and more importantly, about half the price too. Lugging around the f/2.8 all day is a chore, and draws attention; the f/4 version is a breeze and a joy to use by comparison. In daylight and shooting at the lens' optimum f-stops between f/5.6 - f/8, you will not notice any difference in optical quality between the two lenses. At f/4 the f/4 version will exhibit more vignetting however. Apart from the one stop, that's the main difference optically.If you absolutely need f/2.8, then this is the lens to get. It's great for portraits wide open. If you're shooting in good light and want to carry the lens all day, consider the f/4 version instead. If you're shooting small subjects like flowers and especially insects, then neither of these lenses will get you close enough. Get yourself a good macro lens like either of the Canon 100mm macros, or my current favorite, the excellent Tamron AFF004C700 SP 90MM F/2.8 DI MACRO 1:1 VC Macro Lens for Canon EF Cameras.Happy shooting!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNN9N5AAY8ARC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0033PRWSW#wasThisHelpful","RNN9N5AAY8ARC","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yes, this is a top-end flash, but Canon sure makes it difficult to use on all but their standard macro lens. I was coming from an Opteka RL-600 E-TTL II Macro Twin Ring Lite Flash, and the transition was frustrating. First of all, the Opteka starts out to fit any 77mm filter size and provides adapters for smaller lenses. With step-down adapters, the Opteka will fit virtually any lens. This Canon starts out at only a 58mm filter size, which means that larger lenses will be blocked by the ring, and that's a really poor design choice. This rig could double as a fill flash on many lenses, not just macro, if only the design allowed for it.Knowing that going in, I assumed that this would still fit any lens with a 58mm filter size. Not so. It only fits the original, non-L, non-IS 100mm macro lens. (In order to fit the ""L"" macro lens you are asked to buy a $40 adapter which is little more than a step-up ring which should only cost about $5.) I had assumed it would fit the new Tamron 90mmm Macro VC lens, because that lens has the same 58mm filter size as the original Canon 100mm macro. But no, the clamps on this ring are designed ONLY to fit the Canon. I had to buy a different $15 adapter which then allows this to fit any lens with a 58mm filter.Once I had that annoyance straightened out, it's down to the performance of the unit itself. There are two main modes, an ETTL mode which sets the brightness of the flash automatically, and a manual mode which allows you to set the brightness. The ETTL mode is easier to start with because you can adjust the flash compensation in your camera. Still, getting the right balance of flash and background light is difficult. You will need to experiment, and should be comfortable using the M (for Manual) mode on your camera.The main problem with macro flash is that the light drop-off is very dramatic and at the default settings you will get a well-lit subject with a very dark or even completely black background. This may be what you want for some photos but you will quickly tire of this look as it is not natural looking at all. This combines with the fact that the light from the flashes is too harsh and what you end up with is a very sharp but very artificial looking photograph.There are two ways to improve upon this and achieve more pleasing, natural-looking photos. The first is to use a diffuser to soften the light. I got some custom-built ones from the UK on the auction site. Secondly, you have to find a way to light your background. There are several ways to do this. You can remove one of the flashes and manually aim it at the background. This is difficult to do with only two hands. You can utilize sunlight, a slave flash or a light on a stand to light the background. You can use a slower shutter speed to capture more background light. You can turn up the ISO and turn down the flash compensation. You can also add some fill light in post. Or you can use a combination of these. There are all techniques that you will need to explore on your own to achieve the look that you're after.This is a well-built but overpriced unit that is capable of very good lighting of macro subjects, but only if you are willing to take the time to do some customization, manual exposure adjustments, and background lighting. I don't like the fact that Canon forces you to very limited choices of lenses, but now that the Opteka RL-600 is no longer available this is essentially the only twin light true flash rig available for Canon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OXHWE9C5HPOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006I548#wasThisHelpful","R1OXHWE9C5HPOJ","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is probably the most reliable full frame digital camera Nikon has produced to date. No flaky left side AF problems like the D800 and no oil/dirt on the sensor problems like the D600. It doesn't do video like either of those cameras, only has 12 megapixels, and doesn't have as much dynamic range, but apparently remains the camera of choice for many stills-only dedicated pros who don't want any issues and just want to shoot away. I have used it and found it to be a solid performer.But this camera is selling new for $700 more than the D800. That seems crazy, and I don't get it. Why in the world would anyone opt to pay that kind of money for last generation technology when the D800 and D600 are so much more advanced. Buy one used if you're stuck on the D700 or just go for the D800 or D600 and hope that the technical issues have been resolved. The D600 is probably the sweet spot. Thirty six megapixels is overkill and will choke all but the most powerful of computers when trying to process the large files. The 12mp of the D700 is already more than enough to print up to poster size prints with the same amount of discernible detail as the 36mp D800.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KWQP6P5O564D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BTCSI6#wasThisHelpful","R2KWQP6P5O564D","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Albert Hoffman is of course the famous Swiss scientist who synthesized LSD in 1938 and discovered its intense psychedelic effects in 1943 after accidentally absorbing a tiny bit of the powerful substance in the lab and went on to take the famous bike ride which would go down in history as the first acid trip. Dr. Hoffman passed away at the advanced age of 102 in 2008.This ""book"" is subtitled ""The Final Thoughts and Reflections of Albert Hoffman"" but that phrase is woefully misleading. It's not even a book; it consists entirely of four short manuscripts of lectures from 1979, 1987, 1989 and 1997, plus a few pages of forward and afterward material by others -- that's it. Only about 100 pages and large type at that. This content can hardly in any way be construed as ""final thoughts and reflections"" on this great man's life, since this material dates from 29 to 11 years prior to his death, and there is nothing at all that is revelatory. The lectures cover 1) planning vs. chance discovery in pharmacological research, 2) how scientific insight reveals truths about nature and reality, 3) a meditation on the search for happiness, and 4) the use of psychedelics in patients transitioning to death.Unfortunately there is almost nothing here that has not already been touched upon in the highly superior LSD My Problem Child: Reflections on Sacred Drugs, Mysticism and Science which is an actual, fully developed book by Hoffman wherein he discusses at length the discovery of LSD, the consciousness-changing effect it had on the world and its aftermath, both positive and negative. I am sorely disappointed in the brevity and blatant false advertising used to capitalize on Hoffman's passing. I feel cheated and am utterly disappointed. The best thing about this ""book"" is the cover art. The publishers are really reaching here to dig up something worthwhile penned by Hoffman that hasn't been seen before. Were he alive today I very much doubt he would have allowed the publication of these four dated lectures under the guise of a new book with his authorship on the cover.Shameful!!","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SMCM40HB6FI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620550091#wasThisHelpful","R2SMCM40HB6FI0","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this unit because the diverter my rain barrel came with is cheap with a tiny hose. I choose this model because of the filter, and the larger hose. Installation was fairly easy if you're handy. I'm somewhat disappointed with the performance though,  because a high percentage of the water is lost, particularly in light rain, when you want to capture as much of the flow as possible. The problem is that the water clings to the sides of the unit and much of it ends up dribbling along the edges and right down the gutter rather than through the slots of the filter. And when it rains really hard the unit is overwhelmed and a lot of water just overflows into the gutterDuring a medium to heavy rain where there is consistent flow more is captured. I got maybe about 15 - 20 gallons during a moderate rain storm (0.3"") over an afternoon/evening. But my barrel is 85 gallons and it should be filling faster. I like that you can look inside and see the action and easily clean the screen, but the capture is rather haphazard -- there is a lot of splashing around in there that misses the intended mark. I wish I could modify this so that more of the rain is contained towards the back... like a flap in the front or a small water dam to prevent leakage along the edges.  If I have any success in that area I will update my review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS4UBCJM3S30N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00387FP5M#wasThisHelpful","RS4UBCJM3S30N","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You often see many allegations made about this or that lens being the ""sharpest lens made"", but this is the one lens that actually lives up to that claim. Certainly at f/2 it exceeds the resolution of the Canon 135mm f/2 and matches or exceeds that of the $6,000 Canon 200mm f/2 IS. It has a solid precision not found in any other consumer or professional grade lens, and like most of the other Zeiss ZE lenses, it's in a class by itself. The Mercedes-Benz of lenses.You can use this lens without hesitation wide open at f/2 and get images with excellent clarity in the center and very good into the far corners. There is quite a bit of light fall-off at that aperture though, but it's about the same as most 100mm lenses at f/2.8 and when you stop this one down to f/2.8 the vignetting is mostly gone, and completely gone at f/4. Understanding the limitations of this lens, that it only delivers macro to 1:2 and is a manual focus lens, there is very little to complain about. If I want to nit-pick, there is a small amount of red fringing at the wider apertures near the corners, but I was able to completely correct this in ACR by using a ""defringe purple"" of 7.This lens has that icy cool, hard edged Zeiss image quality, which exudes technical perfection in contrast to the warmer tones of Canon lenses.Although all the superlatives that can be heaped on this lens apply, it will most likely not be the first choice for dedicated macro shooters. There is a large field of macro lenses to choose from at or near this 100mm focal length from Canon, Sigma, Tamron, and Tokina that deliver true 1:1 macro magnification and autofocus. You might start with the non-L version of the Canon 100/2.8 macro which is well built, reasonably priced, and shoots superb macro images. Or you might move up to the L version, the Cadillac of macro lenses, which adds image stabilization, weather sealing, and slightly better image quality; although IS is somewhat ineffective at macro magnification it is still very useful at all other distances.If the Zeiss is the Mercedes-Benz and the Canon L is the Caddy, then the new Tamron AFF004C700 SP 90MM F/2.8 DI MACRO 1:1 VC Macro Lens for Canon EF Cameras could be the Lexus. It's actually my current favorite and you can read my review of it to get an in-depth comparison of all these lenses.Back to the Zeiss: this lens is not for everyone. It's heavy, extends quite a bit when focusing close, and the lack of autofocus plus the premium price are going to scare away most lookers. You need to slow down and take more time with this lens. Only you can decide if it's worth it, but I've laid out your options.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q4EI5ZMHWMFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YP314Q#wasThisHelpful","R2Q4EI5ZMHWMFR","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the Nikon mount version of this lens, primarily for product photography in a tight space. It works really well for that, as it focuses seamlessly from infinity down to 1:1 macro magnification with no breaks, or gaps in the field of view, that you might get using a macro ring. And it doesn't make you switch to a special ""macro mode"" as some zoom ""macro"" lenses do. This lens simply allows you the freedom to shoot at literally any distance you want. It uses a somewhat old fashioned design where the lens gets longer as you focus, and it nearly doubles in length when focused down to 1:1 macro. This isn't necessary a problem but most newer macro lenses such as my current favorite, the Tamron AF 90mm f/2.8 Di SP AF/MF 1:1 Macro Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, offer the preferred internal focus design. It also has a funky screw-on hood which is totally old school, which is kind of why I like it! It has a focus limiter which will keep the lens between 18 inches and infinity; this is quite useful to prevent the lens from hunting in the extremely long throw between 18 inches and ""macro"". AF is accurate but not as fast or quiet as newer designs.This is a good focal length for product photography of medium size objects (around the classic ""breadbox"" size). I have a room that doubles as a product storage ""warehouse"" and product photography studio, and this lens allows me to photograph most products in that tight space without the frustration of running up against the minimum focus distance of standard lenses (which can be up to five feet with some zooms!).I am using this with a ""full frame"" sensor D600 camera so it gives a classic 70mm field of view; on a Nikon crop sensor it would deliver an equivalent focal length of 105mm, which is also very useful for products, flowers, and even portraits. And WOW, wide open this lens is amazingly sharp, from center frame all the way into the corners. It must be well corrected for a flat, zero field curvature focus because when I snapped a photo of a wall chart it remained sharp from corner to corner. There is a bit of vignetting in the corners at f/2.8, but this disappears already at f/4. Sharpness is excellent from f/2.8 to f/8 and remains very good to f/16.I'm really impressed with the optics, and the only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that at 1:1 ""true macro"" magnification, the lens front is only three inches from the subject. This makes shooting skittish insects virtually impossible, and even for stationary objects it poses a very difficult lighting problem: at only three inches away, the lens casts a shadow on the subject unless you have diffuse lighting from several angles. A ring flash may work but you would probably have to reduce its output at such a close distance.There are much better choices for dedicated macro work. I wasn't all that impressed with the Sigma 105mm f/2.8 macro, but I really like the Sigma 150mm f/2.8 Macro OS or the aforementioned Tamron 90mm f/2.8 VC Macro. Therefore this is a somewhat limited use lens and if you already have 70mm on a fast zoom this may be redundant for you, unless you need to get up close and personal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31CE5RQCH2VLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GPKQHQ#wasThisHelpful","R31CE5RQCH2VLX","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a discontinued lens but can still be found new for a VERY good price, and used for even less. The reason I purchased it was because it is one of the few 70-300mm lenses that offers a close focusing distance. In macro mode it can magnify to 1:2, which is really good for any zoom lens. The image quality is decent and meets or exceeds that of the consumer-grade 70-300mm lenses from Nikon and Canon, with only better optical quality found in the Canon L version, which sells for five times the price.I purchased this (Nikon mount version) thinking I could use it for product photography in my cramped photo studio/storage room because of the short minimum focus distance. Most 70-300mm lenses have a minimum focus distance of 1.5 meters or 59 inches (about 5 feet), but this lens will focus as close as 37.4 inches in macro mode. However, and here is the caveat: the macro mode is only available in the range from 180mm to 300mm. So, you cannot do any close range work between 70mm and 179mm. As a consequence of this it is not very useful for what I intended, because product photography is normally done in the range of about 70mm to 120mm. I wasn't aware of this limitation when I bought it, and as I found out, even 37.4 inches sometimes is not close enough for my needs--so I picked up the Sigma 70mm F/2.8 EX DG Macro Lens found here: Sigma 70mm F/2.8 EX DG Macro Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasWhat this lens is really good for is macro photography at a distance. At 300mm and 1:2 magnification, you get a very large working distance of over three feet. There are very few 1:2 macro lenses that give you that kind of working distance--the only other one I know about is the very similar Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 DG Macro lens, which judging by review sites is not as good optically. The other thing this lens excels at is sharpness at the ""short"" end--amazingly, at 70mm, it is as sharp if not sharper than the Canon L, and only slightly less so through 200mm. It is at 300mm that the Canon L kicks this lens's butt.This lens has no image stabilization; the current lens that Tamron replaced it with has image stabilization, but they dropped the macro function and made no improvements to the optics, so I don't find that new lens very compelling. I would rather save up for a Canon L or a fast Nikon lens.Technical details: This lens performs extremely well at 70mm, giving excellent sharpness across the entire frame from f/5.6 to f/11 and low chromatic aberration. As expected, the image quality softens as you zoom to the telephoto end, but still yields ""good"" sharpness from f/8 to f/16 at 300mm. Chromatic aberration, light falloff, and pincushion distortion are also worse at the long end, but shouldn't cause too many problems and are correctable with most image editing software.In conclusion, this is an interesting lens that offers a large, lightweight walkabout telephoto range plus good macro capabilities with a very large macro working range. The real selling point is the price, which is less than half of what the new VC version without macro costs. This lens will cover wildlife from the very small insects at your feet to large animals in the distance. It's almost worth owning just to have as a backup in case you want to go somewhere where you don't want to bring your more expensive gear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FZH154GBQJPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012UUP02#wasThisHelpful","R1FZH154GBQJPQ","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have had a chance to test and work with all of these except the Tokina.Among the lenses I've tested, the Zeiss ranks highest in terms of image quality, but is a rather specialized, expensive f/2 manual focus lens that does not have 1:1 macro capabilities, auto focus or image stabilization. That rules it out for a lot of folks. Among the autofocus 1:1 macro lenses, the Canon f/2.8L IS takes the top spot for image quality, with the new Tamron 90mm VC coming in a very close second and the non-L, non-IS Canon 100mm and non-VC Tamron 90mm not at all far behind. In fact in the real world you're not going to see much difference in IQ between any of these four lenses, they're all that good.The Sigma 105, on the other hand, while a good performer by most standards, has a hard time competing with any of the aforementioned primo lenses. It's just not as sharp and contrasty, the autofocus isn't as fast and hunts in low light, and it's too heavy. Why settle for a compromise when there are all those other great macros to choose from? Actually I really like and much prefer Sigma's 150mm macro, which is even heavier, but the image quality is superb, and that's really the main criteria I have for keeping a lens.My favorite pick among all of these: The new Tamron 90mm VC released in early 2013. It has everything I want in a macro lens: super sharp, snappy focus, light weight, reasonably compact, and has impressive, nearly silent image stabilization. I never thought I'd say this, but I now prefer the Tamron 90mm VC over the Canon 100mm L.Sorry, Sigma, you didn't make the cut this time. I've been holding off on writing this review until I sold the copy I had. It's gone and I won't be purchasing it again.

"This is a decent introduction to fermentation, and covers the basics, however the recipes are too general and vague. For instance, for the recipe for Sauerrben (fermented turnips), the author states:""My fellow communards have rarely been as enthusiastic about any of my ferments as they were the night I first served sauerrben. They went on about it as if it were a rich chocolate dessert.""Great, so what is the exact recipe for this particular delicacy? In step 3:""As with sauerkraut, add any other vegetables, herbs, or spices you like. Or don't, and enjoy the strong flavor of the turnips unadulterated.""So, I guess we don't get the details on the specific recipe that his friends went on and on about. Is it so good that he's keeping it a secret all to himself? I guess we'll never know.Some of the other recipes are more specific, but others, like ""Spontaneous Cider"" are even cruder and could well lead to nasty results. I have a degree in microbiology, and while I have no objection to the use of wild organisms as a starter culture in some fermentations, I believe that if you are going to lead the novice fermenter down this path the least you should do is provide more precise instructions than this book offers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SLH9WBP5FWZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1931498237#wasThisHelpful","R1SLH9WBP5FWZ0","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is it. The One. This is the magical ""just right"" wide angle lens that every serious 35mm landscape photographer *must* have in his or her kit. It's not so crazy wide that it reduces everything way down in the far horizon, capturing mostly massive sky and foreground, but wide enough that it surpasses the typical 24mm wide angle lens by quite a bit. But the real beauty with this lens lies in the gorgeous color rendition, edge to edge clarity, and lack of chromatic aberration or distortion. OK, there is some very slight distortion but it's not relevant unless you're shooting strict architectural shots and it's easily corrected in software.There aren't enough superlatives to describe how this masterful Zeiss glass renders landscape images; you just have to use it to appreciate what it can do. There is no other lens in the world of DSLRs or Micro 4/3rds systems that can touch it. Of course the build is the famous Zeiss quality, dense and solid as a rock, with a well-dampened focusing ring that just oozes luxury. The manual focus is barely an issue at this focal length, and once you determine the hyperfocal distance, you can practically set it and forget it. (For instance, at f/8 the hyperfocal distance is 6 feet and everything 4 ft. to infinity will be in focus.)Here are a few helpful tips and specs:Wide open at f/2.8, there is significant light fall-off; if shooting wide open I would overexpose by 1/3 - 2/3 stop and then correct in post. However, f/4 is good and by f/5 there is no longer any vignetting. If shooting outdoors in good light there is no reason not to shoot at the lens' ""sweet spot"" of f/5.6 to f/8 where it's the sharpest even into the corners, and utilize either the hyperfocal distance or the beep/light focus confirm. Focus is not as crucial for a lens this wide so the focus confirmation is more useful than on a longer lens, being ""good enough"" for most shots, but in critical situations you can always do a quick check with Live View to see if you're spot on.The minimum focusing distance of 9"" is closer than any lens this wide and is practically a macro in that regard; the maximum reproduction ratio is 1:5 which is really quite amazing for a lens this wide and there is nothing else like it. At this minimum focusing distance, you actually get beautiful bokeh with this lens (check out the pic of the daisies that I uploaded in the image section).This is a lens designed for full-frame cameras and using one is essential to get the full impact of what it is capable of. (On an APS-C camera it will give you a field of view similar to a 35mm lens on full frame.) The included petal hood is designed in such a way as to prevent shading; use of rounded aftermarket hoods will create a circular shadow around the edges of the frame. The hood must be attached properly or shading will occur; to do this simply align the white dot on the hood with the tiny black dot on the upper side of the lens, and turn to the left 30 degrees until it locks into place. It takes normal filters and the filter size is 82mm.If you think you would like to try this lens out, you may want to rent it before taking the plunge--but beware, once you have tried it, you won't want to give it up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BUQJX6NL17ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UBPWAK#wasThisHelpful","R1BUQJX6NL17ZJ","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first DSLR was the T2i and I briefly had a 7D, which is still Canon's top of the line APS-C sensor camera as of March 2013. All three share the same 18mp sensor, but I prefer this camera to both of those, due to its handling, and primarily the fully reticulated LCD screen. This allows shooting from multiple angles, down low, above your head, around corners, self-portraits, and self videos. The AF isn't as advanced as the 7D and the viewfinder is a bit smaller, but larger than the T2i which seems like looking through a tunnel by comparison. The camera body is polycarbonate instead of the magnesium alloy of it's predecessor the 50D. That doesn't bother me, it's still quite a substantial and strong body. The only feature I really wish they would have retained from the 50D is the lens micro focus adjustment.The T3i and T4i also have reticulated LCD screens and the T4i offers some features that this 60D doesn't, such as supporting the continuous focus while shooting video that is available in conjunction with two new Canon STM lenses, the Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM Lens and the Canon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM. If that feature is important to you, you should skip the 60D and go look at that camera.Others have given detailed reviews of all the features and performance of this great camera so I won't repeat that here. You can't go wrong with this camera; however, the 60D is getting a little long in the tooth. Even though it's a five star camera in every way and I've never had a single problem with it, it's been around for 3 years now, which is longer than any of the previous xxD cameras lifespan before they got an upgrade. In this same period, the top Rebel T2i got upgraded twice. Only the 7D has been around longer -- 4 years!There are rumors that the successor to the 60D -- the 70D, is going to be announced soon. (Spring of 2013.) Canon is reportedly planning a big jump in terms of specs from the 60D to the 70D, with the camera pushing toward more pro-level features. Of course, it will most likely come out with a more pro-level price too. But look for the price of the 60D to drop, and more 60D cameras to come on to the used market from people upgrading; that's always a good time to pick one up in good shape used at a very nice price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRZBJCXP7CISA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040JHVCC#wasThisHelpful","RRZBJCXP7CISA","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the ideal product photography lens for small to medium sized objects on a full-frame camera. I guess I don't REALLY need the precision focusing abilities that this lens provides for posting product shots on the online auction site (you know the one), but I find that the quality of the image makes a big impression and brings in higher sales if it looks professional--plus I just enjoy playing with what this lens can do. This is not for a one-off product shot where you snap a quick photo and throw it up on the web. You take your time with this lens and get the composition just right. I don't use it for anything gimmicky like miniature or other effects and I rarely even use the shift function, as these days perspective correction can be done just as easily in PhotoShop. In fact, the way I use the lens, the viewer would never even realize that a tilt was used. That's because I just use it to maximize the focus on the surface of products; what the viewer sees is a product that might be set on an angle yet the whole visible face of it is in focus.For precision accuracy, this is best used with a tripod and live view, although I have managed to take a few shots hand-held with the lens tilted. It doesn't take long to get the hang of it. The other pluses besides the tilt and shift functions are that 1) The lens has no light fall-off (vignetting) wide open (unshifted), 2) It focuses nice and close (not as close as a macro, but suitable for small objects), and 3)It's one of the sharpest lenses Canon makes (again unshifted) and remains sharp when tilted. This may even be the sharpest of all the Canon TS-E lenses.I use this on a full-frame camera; on APS-C it's going to emulate a 144mm lens which is too long to be useful for product photography, particularly in my cramped home studio. The 45mm TS-E would be better suited for APS-C sensor cameras, although it isn't as sharp as this lens. The only drawback of this lens is that it is not very convenient to use in a less controlled environment such as walking about in nature; I would probably reach for an autofocus macro lens in those situations before this lens, even though the tilt and shift might be desirable. It's not very practical to stop and set up each shot with a tripod when you're on a trip with companions in tow. I won't deduct any points for that though because this lens does what it's designed to do very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OM3WV0482SLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009XVDP#wasThisHelpful","R2OM3WV0482SLR","A30C8WHQ2CYFO4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30C8WHQ2CYFO4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this printer solely for one purpose: to print shipping labels directly on oversize envelopes that are nine inches wide. That's just one half inch too wide to go through any standard 8.5x11 printer. My old wide format printer was an Epson Stylus Color XL, a very good printer that sat unused until the ink heads dried up. No amount of flushing out with cleaning fluid would revive themI'm happy to say this printer has a much better design. Not only is this the smallest and shortest of the current crop of wide format printers, it also has a removable print head that can be easily cleaned or replaced if necessary without trashing the whole printer.For what I got it for it's great. It prints on over sized envelopes just fine without jamming. I chose it because others stated it handles card stock well, and that seems to be true. For printing in black only, I would advise changing the preferences to Black Ink Only, otherwise it prints in black with a cyan shadow behind the lettering that doesn't look professional.I almost got the Brother MFCJ6510DW which also has an 11x17 scanner, but this printer is sleeker. I have never been a fan of the all-in-one solutions and I rarely use my letter size scanner as it is. This is a business printer that connects via either USB or Ethernet. It is certainly not the best choice for high-end archival photographs. There are multi-ink printers for that and that's not why I got it. For my purposes this is perfect.

"Sometimes the greatest dramas are played on a very small stage. Sometimes the greatest triumph in a life is simply recognizing what you have and how precious it is.Santino Hassells gritty romance of two longtime blue-collar friends is a revelation within the m/m genre. This is not the New York of gym bunnies and closeted lawyers, although that world hovers shimmering in the background. This is love on the mean streets of Queens. Michael Rodriguez is Puerto Rican and Nunzio Medici is Italian. Theyve been gay best friends since middle school, and both have climbed out of the dead-end world of their families far enough to become successful high school teachers in a Brooklyn magnet school. They both love what they do and are proud of what theyve achieved. But that hasnt changed who they are.A booze-fueled threesome with a WASPy blond boy is the startling (and extremely hot) opening scene for this novel. It is the readers primary clue as to what will happen in the rest of the book, and the key trigger for both Mike and Nunzio that will unleash everything that they do subsequently.Hassell creates a world of secondary characters with as much detail as he needs to provide strong narrative counterpoints to Mike and Nunzio. Foremost is Mikes younger brother, Raymond, who seems to desperately need his brother even as the two young men push each other away. David Butler, the aforementioned blond, provides yet another foil, and becomes a kind of emotional sounding board for both Mike and Nunzio. Although he is ridiculed as exactly the sort of privileged white boy who is the antithesis of life on Sutphin Boulevard, it is pretty clear from the start that David is more solid, more important than any stereotype.The lesser players in this drama  largely Mikes family, but including students and other folks who he encounters as he makes his journey, physical and psychological, across Queens  are not much more than vivid sketches; but they do their jobs. Ultimately, this is Mike Rodriguezs story, his voyage to hell and back. Unwilling to accept whats in front of his face, untrained by the circumstances of his life to handle the hard facts of his life, he has to take the hard way home.This is not an easy book to read; and neither Mike nor Nunzio are easy men to like. And yet we do like them, a lot. Hassell has managed to give them profound humanity, so that right away, even when theyre soaked with alcohol, we can see the goodness of their hearts, the essential gentleness of their natures. This is what keeps us rooting for them even as we wince at the ugliness in which they get caught.There are people who complain, quite rightly, that the m/m genre is too sweet and too romantic, mired in its Barbara Cartland tropes and its audiences expectations. Santino Hassell offers readers an alternative universe. It might be a rougher experience than were used to, but it presents insights into human nature that, in the end, are their own reward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AI1P4EZCSS0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HZYUEM#wasThisHelpful","R1AI1P4EZCSS0C","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"J.P. Bowie offers up a fresh take on the vampire genre, and an interesting murder mystery. I liked his character Sean Martin a good deal, and sympathized with the unhappy position in which he finds himself  betrayed by a former colleague in a way that shames and nearly breaks him. Lonely and down on his luck, Sean needs a break.Set in Los Angeles a generation in the future, Sean is approached by a powerful vampire named Rafael Barrantes. While Barrantes, all aloof politesse and brooding good looks, never becomes much more than an aristocratic straight man (as it were), his secretary and longtime friend Arturo Menendez sweeps into the picture like a 1940s diva and steals the scene. The two-hundred year old Catalan vampire becomes Seans instant lover and sometime sidekick. I liked the way Bowie contrasts the relationship between Arturo and Rafael with Arturos impulsive romance with Sean. The modern take on vampiric powers and weakness (sunlight bad, but they can fly, drink wine and read minds) is entertaining, but I yearned for a little more about the vampire place in society. Clearly in this future world, vampires have replaced gay folk as the number one target of bigots and fundamentalists. Bowie gives us some of this, but I would have loved to have more. Strangely, there is virtually no cool new technology in 2034 (when Ill be 81!), which was a minor let-down. If youre going to the trouble to set your story in the future, there really ought to be a few good gadgets.I enjoyed the book thoroughly, but I was never charmed by the writing, and was actually a little put off by all the sex, which was, for me, redundant and clumsily described. Of course Arturo and Seans passion for each other is important, as is Seans awakening to the possibilities of a real romance with this charming undead lothario from centuries ago. But Bowies sexual descriptions slip into bodice-ripper clichs, and while the sex is described as emotionally intense, it never actually felt emotionally intense as I read it.Three stars is a good rating from me. I really liked the vampire as reimagined by J.P. Bowie, and appreciated both the plot and the characters. Sean and Arturo deserve more page time, and perhaps well see a sequel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HU6UKF0M9ROI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZD0QXNU#wasThisHelpful","R3HU6UKF0M9ROI","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steampunk has a strong affinity with Dickens. Surely the setting of this novel, in a fictional but oh-so-British city called Herrow, just oozes Dickens from every literary pore. But in the steampunk world there is wonderful technology (think H.G. Wells, from the end of the 19th century); and in Langley Hydes vision there is magic, and love between men.So, whats not to like?Young Lord Cornelius Franklin arrives at Highfell, bereft of his parents, who are dead, and his sister, who has gone to live with his rich step-uncle, Lord Franklin. With everything gone but his title, Neil takes a position at the charity school founded by Lord Franklin, all wide-eyed at his luck at being able to teach malleable young minds. But, what he finds is nothing like the elegant, rich schools he attended farther up in the aether. Literally and symbolically, Highfell is beneath them.Ever since I opened the first Harry Potter novel in my late thirties, Ive been hooked on the idea of a world where magic is part of reality. Hydes world is analogous to our own, but magic is literally in the ether, and it is the ether (spelled anglophonically as aether) that powers the technology that makes Highfell Hall possible. Highfell is a school, boatlike in form, that floats on the aether high above the city of Herrow on the river Wyrd. There is magic at Highfell, as there is at every aetherium academy up in the sky.But Highfell Hall is not Hogwarts; it is a dark, nasty, cruel place snatched from the pages of Oliver Twist or David Copperfield. It is the anti-Hogwarts.Hydes narrative is rich in carefully imagined detail, giving us a full-on experience of what this crypto-Victorian world is like. But, more importantly I think, she makes the characters live on the page. Neil Franklin could have been a prig and a snob; but instead his heart opens to the desperate boys trapped at Highfell and he becomes their mentor and their protector. His initial response to the appearance of Leo  Leofa Blackwateris every bit as snobbish and class-driven as one might expect. But Neil soon recognizes where Leofa fits into Highfell, and becomes his ally and his friend.As is also the case with Dickens, every character, great and small, is painted in full color, and given as much detail as they need to be part of the great picture created by the author. The plot is complicated and full of action, but Hyde manages to produce a cinematic clarity that keeps things moving and prevents the surprises and off-page machinations from confusing us.Everyone whos read romances involving magic knows what a grimoire is, but even if this is your first such novel, youll understand soon enough. Highfell Grimoires is a captivating, romantic and fully engaging novel, and a masterpiece of the steampunk genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XS3WA15DEH5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KF0LDAG#wasThisHelpful","R1XS3WA15DEH5D","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read everything Harper Fox has written, and from the very first she has been a must-read for me. Her weakest books are better than much of the most popular ""straight"" fiction. Fox is the proof that the genre of gay romance need not be marginalized, that the level of writing in books of this genre can equal and surpass any mainstream best-seller author in the language.Marty Bell and Devlin Surtees are as different as two boys could be. Their incidental path-crossing in a small-town English state (i.e. public in the US) school is related as a prologue, and depicted with intense, painful clarity. We first see Devlin, beautiful spoiled son of a rich Royal Airforce commander, through the eyes of Marty, a plump, bespectacled boy who dislikes sports and has a passion for pretty things and a deep knowledge of plants and flowers. It's the sort of painfully inappropriate adolescent crush with which many gay men can identify.The story then jumps ahead ten years, and the two men meet again. This time Marty is a kindergarten teacher in the same school he attended as a child, and Devlin is the lead pilot in an elite RAF squadron of daredevil stunt flyers. Their chance meeting sparks a passionate encounter, during the course of which a secret about Devlin that only Marty knows reemerges.For some reason, this book touched me personally in ways I can't quite understand. Perhaps it is the fact that it is all about visibility, about the conflict between self-perception and the way the world sees you; an emotional issue with particular resonance for gay men. Marty, slim and fit and attractive, is still the same sensitive boy he was as a fat teenager, and he's still aware that people see the external Marty, not the man inside. Even Devlin seems to be drawn to the outward, as if the boy of the past is gone.  Devlin, on the other hand, is equally driven by outward appearances. This becomes increasingly evident as he and Marty get to know each other. Devlin, who seems so perfect externally, has his own profound flaws. Both men have to deal with their inner/outer conflict, and this emotional center is what drives the fairly simple, yet somehow intensely touching narrative.Harper Fox has managed to wrestle the genre of which she is a master into something like submission. She makes her own rules without casting aside the expectations of her readers (including myself). The important thing about Fox's writing is that she doesn't give in to conventions. She presents emotional ambiguities and moral dilemmas that are oftimes uncomfortable, and she does it in the name of authenticity and realism. That may be why her books, and this one in particular, touch me so readily. They seem to be about real people, not about fantasies. People like me who read romance fiction have certain expectations. Harper Fox meets and exceeds them. She gives us beautifully written literature and psychological potency.

These books do something that is hugely important to me: they offer murder mysteries with interesting characters and superior writing, and feature a longtime gay couple as the centerpiece of the stories. There are other couples and other relationships swirling about in the atmosphere around Nick and Stephan, but these two men are at the core of the story.The Edith Wharton Murders is the second of eight Nick Hoffman books, and takes place in the fictionalized Michigan university town where Nick is a writing professor and Stephan is the writer in residence. There are sly little joking references to Miss Marple and Jessica Fletcher in the story, but there is also a strong overlay of the English writer David Lodge, whose best known novels revolve around the internecine politics of university life in the UK.Surely there is a conscious reflection of Raphaels own life in academe here, but his portrayal of the absurdity and tragic pettiness of the world of Edith Wharton scholars (an author whose work I personally love, to a point) is delicious. As Nick desperately tries to control the Wharton conference he has been forced to organize, and as he continues to manage the hurt he feels from Stephans emotional betrayal in the previous (first) book, we feel alternating waves of sympathy, disbelief and comic giddiness as the entire procedure begins to spin off its axis.And, as I said, at the hub of this swirl of personalities and college life, are these two men, in their mid-thirties, settled, happy in their life together in spite of the inevitable pain and hurt that longtime relationships often embrace. There is no overt sex in this book, and there doesnt need to be. There is nothing in this book to make the straight world queasy-except, of course, the sharp focus on the gay men themselves. This intense visibility, Nick and Stephans motivating force at the core of this novel, is probably enough to ensure that a large part of the mystery-reading audience wont touch it. For all the advances in politics in the world  right up to universal recognition of same-gender marriage this year  our visibility still makes the other 95% squirm.So, for all their charm and their readability, Lev Raphaels Nick Hoffman books are important to me for this reason. How lucky I am that theyre so good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ4Z5BVGUCXLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0059XF2NI#wasThisHelpful","RJ4Z5BVGUCXLO","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Diamonds, the second YA romance with Maps Wilson sort of completes something. Yes, it does, but I warn you, this goofy, smile-a-minute teen romance is suitable for middle-schoolers. And thats fine. As I read both this and the first book, Maps, I kept having flashbacks to eighth grade and the whole world of like-like and irrational feelings. (Except, at that age, which for me was back in the late 1960s, I had no clue about the significance of what I was feeling.)So we have Matthew Maps Wilson, teen genius, who is still a little boy at heart, but at sixteen has finally discovered feelings that confuse him. And theres his lifelong sidekick Benji, who clearly loves Maps but also understands that hes not remotely normal. And finally, theres Lane Rhodes, the big lunk of a baseball player who is startled, but not intimidated, by his unexpected feelings for a boy when before its all been about girls.If you remember your teen years, it was all about misunderstandings, jumping to conclusions, simmering emotions, and general stupidity caused by stirring hormones. Well, Nash Summers hits that nail on the head; but she does it with real humor and sympathy, right down to Maps irritated parents who nonetheless support and love him in his adolescent angst.What is really romantic about this book is that is assumes a world that ought to be: a world where homophobia and bullying are mild and easily surmounted; a world where jocks in love are brave enough to admit that they might be queer for another boy, and where parents dont freak out about their children being gay. Its an idealized world, but not an impossible one.So I dont know if Nash Summers plans to carry on with Lane and Maps; but I sort of hope so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5P9ZU6ARUQ2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016B3WFZM#wasThisHelpful","R5P9ZU6ARUQ2I","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved reading this YA novella. Maps Wilson is a quirky, charming character, an eccentric sixteen-year-old whose ever-whirring brain gets him into trouble and keeps him from being popular. In spite of this, he and his best friend Benji seem to be happily settled in their lives.But Benji, who has always lived next door, is moving a few blocks away, and the new family is stirring up trouble in Maps routine. Stacie seems to be a female Dennis the Menace, and her older brother Lane, well he just stirs up something in Maps that Maps isnt quite sure about.The presence of parents in this story, as warm supportive (if exasperated) players in Maps daily drama, is most welcome. The clever, funny writing also makes the story particularly fun to read.I confess I was a little let down by the ending. It seemed sotentative. And then I pondered my own teenaged years, and realized that everything is tentative when youre sixteen. How can you have a happy ending when your life has barely begun? How can you really know who you are when youve only just begun to discover yourself?And, of course, this is book 1 in a series, of which the second book just appeared. I guess Ill have to keep reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSOJOQFMC81Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RS96EYM#wasThisHelpful","RSOJOQFMC81Y3","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Strong writing and compelling characters make this book a great read. The fact that Vance uses the gay for you trope that (until now) I thought only women m/m writers fell for lost it a star from me.Ive read quite a few sports-themed m/m books, which sort of intrigues me, because I dont like sports and have always disliked jocks, frat boys, any of those obvious (and, I suppose, desirable) versions of manhood. Maybe its the gay thing  the idea of one of those testosterone-filled beasts actually yearning for another guy  that lowers my walls against jocks and let them into my head.In Brad Vances case, the main characters of Roger Ehrens and Brian Rauch are followed over time, and develop before us as richly textured, fully 3-D young men. There is the requisite adoration of their size and their beauty and their substantial endowments; but it goes beyond that. We come to know their hearts and souls, what drives them, what causes them pain.Part of what makes their portraits so vivid is the back-up player of Jacob Ehrens, Rogers college-professor father. Jacob is the sort of gentle, loving, intuitive father that anyone would be lucky to have. His influence on his sons life is incalculable. Brians father has a similar influence, but in a negative way. Part of what makes Brians character so interesting is his journey to find someone who will make him feel he is worthy of happiness.Roger is a football player, and the description how he becomes one is adorable (and I know that doesnt make sense, but thats how it struck me). Brian is a baseball player, and his development as a star hitter is handled with equal care. For a book full of sports, Vance handles the descriptions very well, making them terse and journalistic, so that we can follow the games without drowning in details we dont care about (which, for me, is a lot).Somewhere out there is something called the Klein Sexuality Grid. It is a far more subtle and complex way to measure sexual orientation than the good old Kinsey Scale (on which I am a total six). I kept thinking of the Klein Grid as I read this book, trying to manage my negative emotions around Vances gay for you plot device. It almost worked, although I kept hearing cries of bi-erasure in the back of my mind. Gay writers need to write about bisexuality better.By the end of Given the Circumstances I was genuinely moved to tears. There are so many good people in this book, and their support of Roger and Brian in the face of the ugly rigors of high level team sports was one of the most powerful narrative threads.  Brian and Rogers relationship is the bright center of this book. Whatever my qualms, Vance makes them an unforgettable duo, and with them builds a romance worthy of our devotion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WDNJPIRENEIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GH33TRA#wasThisHelpful","R1WDNJPIRENEIU","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is JL. Merrow at her subtle, British best. The subject of World War I and its aftermath has always haunted me. Not from the heroic side, but from the outcast side: the conscientious objectors who were so vilely treated. People who dared to say no to an idiotic, jingoistic war that destroyed a generation.Well. This gently, elegantly written love story takes us back to the year right after the war and the devastating Spanish flu epidemic. Roger Coddington, more or less rejected by his family as a coward for refusing to fight in the war, starts a new career in London, and at the same time sets out to unmask the man suspected of betraying his late brother and causing his death.But Matthew Connaught seems an unlikely traitor, and Roger finds himself caught in a web of lies and might do more harm than good.Merrow knows how to recreate a period with such tact and lightness of touch that you forget yourre reading a contemporary book. Even with the introduction of explicit sexuality that would never have appeared a century ago, the story feels authentic and the emotional responses of the various characters never once ring false.The author doesnt just tell us, she shows us who Matthew Connaught really is. She draws us along, through Rogers eyes, as suspicion is replaced with affection, and the inevitable emotional upheaval looms ever larger.I was moved to tears by the tenderness here, the desperate desire to find happiness in a world that seems to reserve happiness only for those who follow the rules.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ILLBV376C2HE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YX4QGV6#wasThisHelpful","R2ILLBV376C2HE","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, How to be a Normal Person is the first asexual m/m romance Ive ever read. I read it because I love this authors work, and knew that this book means a lot to him.I have to say, TJ Klune really sells asexuality. Gustavo Tiberius is one of the cutest, most endearing socially dysfunctional people Ive ever read; and Casey Richards is the most adorable, charming asexual hipster Ive ever heard of.And did I mention the albino ferret named Harry S. Truman?How could you resist a combination like that?Klunatics everywhere had been awaiting with bated breath the release of this book, and it was surely worth the wait for us. It is full of laugh-out-loud humor, oddball characters (in ADDITION to the two protagonists), and deep, heart-filling emotional truth.Wake and bake, and I helped. You cant possibly know how that absurd line resonates with some terrible old joke I remember from college. You had to be there. Which means, in this case, you have to read the book. Every page is filled with such clever bits, including all sorts of terrible hipster trash-talking relating to facial hair and Instagramming that I actually understood. But it goes beyond humor; it goes to the core of what love is, what friendship is, and what community is.This book is not just a landmark in TJ Klunes career as a beloved author; its a landmark in m/m romance. And about time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ESJEU8RDIMK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VOHR0K#wasThisHelpful","R3ESJEU8RDIMK6","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A charming, heartwarming bit of fluff from JL Merrow, Its All Geek to Me is full of her typical humor and British specificity. Jez is a lab technician from north London, and when he goes to a downtown comic book store to buy the latest issue of something for his hospitalized best friend, he meets Rhys.Thats really all it is. It could be an episode of a sitcom on TV. But Merrow turns Jezs straight chum into a sort of a Greek chorus, dispensing wisdom from his hospital bed as he flirts with the nurse. And Jez is presented as a loving, big-hearted man whose anxiety over his friends near-death experience hides his own low self-esteem. Rhys, well hes tall, dark and handsome  and cool. But under all that cool hes a gentle, considerate caring man. Merrows little story is a thoughtful character study and a glance into small-town gay life within the sprawling Metropolis of London. No one does it more deftly than she.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L581795QS8I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBYWYOW#wasThisHelpful","R1L581795QS8I6","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was palpitating in anticipation of Edmonds latest book. Once I got my hands on it I plunged right in, and managed to read all of it over a two-day periodone of them a strange half-working day that took me into NYC on the train and all over the city in a taxi and on the subway. It was the anniversary of 9/11, and the setting for King John is a year after 9/11, which is very much on Vin Vanblys mind as he walks the dusty avenues of Burning Man, 2002.Before I started writing this, I used the miracle of Google and looked up pictures of Burning Man, 2002. Mannings description is faithful, excellent, in fact; but Im a visual person and I wanted pictures of some of the things he describes. Ive got friends who have been Burning Man aficionados for years. It never sounded like my thing  but it is clear to me how it is their thing. Its also evident why Edmond Manning set his latest in the Lost and Found Kings series at Burning Man. It tells us a great deal about Vin Vanbly and, quite honestly, is the only place this particular episode in the Vin Vanbly epic could possibly take place.Dressed as a Bedouin, Vin strolls through the untrammeled hedonism of Burning Man, reveling in its gift economy (no cash exchanged) and atmosphere of radical acceptance (Burning Man, like the world at large, is mostly straight people, but gay people are welcomed, unlike the world at large, even now). He is on the hunt for a potential king; but what he discovers throws him off track. Faithful Manning readers know that Vin is always fumbling forward  forever making mistakes that force him to rethink his plans and create new machinations to succeed in finding his king.But this book takes it a step further. Vin is off track for most of the plot; we see him so completely disoriented that we understand this is a very different story than the others. Once again, because we see everything through Vins eyes, we are dragged into his bewilderment just as we share in his joy. There is nothing more emotionally distressing than a control freak whos completely lost control. King John becomes as much about Vins kingship as about the subject of his attention. It is a lot of fun  if you find emotional rollercoasters fun.You have to be a certain kind of person to embrace Mannings world of lost and found kings. You have to be somewhat silly; but you also have to have the kind of emotional makeup that allows you to tap into deep personal emotions as you read. As a reader, you have to participate in the book personally. You have to be willing to cry on the NYC subway.Confession: Burning Man is the kind of purgatory I imagine Ill end up in if Im punished for sins in my lifetime. All my life Ive been about control, carefully groomed outward appearance, scripted public behavior. There isnt much appeal to me in a place where all my calculations are thrown out the window. And the lack of access to showers and plumbing. *shudder* This is why the notion of Woodstock never appealed to me, either. But somehow, I know that if I was kidnaped and taken to Burning Man, it would do me good; just like reading Edmond Mannings books does me good. Through Vins adventure I can vicariously shed all my armor and let loose all my fears. There is always something cathartic about reading these Lost and Found Kings books. This is Mannings genius  and it derives from the great heart this writer clearly has.So why only four stars? Manning has chosen to end this book with a sort of emotional cliff-hanger unlike the endings of his previous books in the series. Intellectually I see why; indeed the ending made me anxious to read the next volume. But the calculated choice to end his book on a note of psychological and emotional suffering undermined the exaltation that preceded it. I didnt feel better at the end of this book.  I dont think Edmond had any choice. He did what he had to do. But sometimes authors have to take a few hits when they do what they have to do.That doesnt mean I love him any less.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z3GXDXYHPVSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OI7MZY#wasThisHelpful","R1Z3GXDXYHPVSV","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This wonderful anthology of stories with paranormal themes embraces the finest writers in this genre and offers substantial, beautifully written tales of romance and magic.Im not a big anthology fan, mostly because I like long works  but these are no mere snippets. Each story is a fully developed narrative, rich with all the things we readers care about. The bonus, of course, is that they all feel connected to each other by their shared paranormal themes and characters.Rhys Fords fast-paced and compelling Dim Sum Asylum shows us a gritty but recognizable future San Francisco, in which Roku MacCormick, a mix-race (meaning part human, part fae, part Japanese, part Irish) detective works a strange cursed-object case with a new partner, Trent Leonard. Rokus back story is dark and as complex as the city he calls home.Ginn Hales Swift and the Black Dog shows us a world that is more like a post-apocalyptic Dune, grotesque and beautiful by turns, in which we meet a young wizard named Jack Swift, who was once the leader of a band of revolutionary teenagers.  Swift is forced to face some harsh realities in the world he and his friends helped create. Hale, in her typical fashion, creates visions of exquisite beauty and desperate violence.KJ Charles A Queer Trade takes us to her world of the Magpie Lord series, where an unlucky apprentice, Crispin Tredarloe, must try to retrieve some misplaced papers in the shop of London wastepaper merchant Ned Hall. The authors uncanny ability to create an authentic Victorian world in which magic is part of the landscape is slyly acknowledged by the opening line: Marleigh was dead, to begin with. Her homage to Dickens made me laugh, just as her tale of bone and blood feels both true to period in tone and engagingly modern in sentiment.Magically Delicious presents a contemporary Washington, DC, in which federal bureaucracy attempts to regulate all manner of imaginary creatures from goblins to leprechauns. Keith Curry, restauranteur turned magical food infraction specialist for the government, gets caught up in a series of mysterious hexings that involves his boyfriend, half-goblin Gunther Heartman. There are some truly hilarious moments with Currys in-laws, and a plot that feels like a mashup of a sitcom and an episode of Mission: Impossible.Jordan Castillo Prices Psycop hero Victor Bayne and his FBI boyfriend Jacob take us on a psychological tour of Baynes first ghostly encounter in Everyones Afraid of Clowns. What I found particularly appealing about this story is that, at its heart, its really about Victors desire to make things better for the ghosts in his life.In The Thirteenth Hex, Im pretty sure that Jordan L. Hawk intentionally evoked Caleb Carrs The Alienist by using that term in the same paragraph in which she introduces Theodore Roosevelt as NYs police commissioner in the late 19th century. The magical subdivision of Roosevelts police department, made up of witches, their shifter familiars, and non-magical paper pushers known as hexmen, are faced with what seems to be serial killer using over-the-counter patent hexes. Dominic Kopecky dreams of being magical, but has settled for being a hexman, until he meets Rook, a crow shifter without a witch to call his own.Riley Murrough is an over-educated barista loser until hes confronted by a swarm of demons in an alley and rescued by a leather-clad stud named Khalon who is under the unhappy impression that Riley is his prince intended. Most of Charlie Cochets tongue-in-cheek romance, The Soldati Prince, takes place in Khalons world, which, we are told, is somewhere in Upstate New York.Lou Harper, the queen of gay noir fiction, takes the reader on another magic murder hunt in One Hex Too Many. A world-weary detective, Mike Mulligan (of the Extramundane Crimes Division) is assigned a new partner in detective Hugh Fox, and once again they have to track down a murderer by magic. This is the one story in the book that seemed to be the beginning of a potential series.Andrea Speeds Josh of the Damned vs. the Bathroom of Doom is actually part of a series: a spoof with paranormal teeth, making me think of Rick Riordons Percy Jackson novels mixed with Kevin Smiths cult film The Clerk. Somehow the title Convenience Store of the Damned kept running through my mind.Astrid Amara gets the last-but-not-least position with The Trouble with Hexes. Tim Keller, a private detective who threw his tattooed boyfriend Vincent out for messing around with magic, finds himself in a deadly predicament, and has to turn to Vincent to save his own life. This is a very personal story, as much about the two men as it is about the race to find the root of the hex.Every reader will find his or her favorites among this group of ten winners. For anyone who follows paranormal fiction, this is a must-read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC29ZKBO9WGQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0124HQFYQ#wasThisHelpful","RC29ZKBO9WGQ0","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A clever little romance novella set in an unlikely heatwave in northern Oregon. Brad is a local boy, relocated back to small-city Astoria from big bad Portland. James is a small-town-near-London boy temporarily relocated to Portland for his computer programming job, but weekending in adorable little Astoria.Brads a player who keeps a map on his wall so he can tick off the home state/country of guys he hooks up with. James is a nester, more introverted than shy, who has little experience on the romantic front. Brad is looking for sex without complications; James is looking for home.You know where this is going.Brad is sort of a dick. James is sort of a whiner. But the heat and the location and whatever it is that makes love happen also helps them unfold into new people. That unfolding image is a nice one, and recurs at strategic points through the narrative.The intense, summer-long heatwave is a palpable presence in the book. The temperature hovers at 100 degrees (F) through the entire story, and I confess I didnt think Oregon ever had that kind of heat; and I also wondered if Livings has really experienced 100-degree heat. I have, and I cant imagine anything happening, much less a romance. I get the metaphor, though: the heat sort of unbinds both characters from their expected responses. It derails their emotional trains, so to speak, opening them up to something new.I guess. Heat just exhausts me.Dont get me wrong. I liked this, and I like Livings literate English. It is cute to see him slip and use British words when its NOT James whos talking. Brits sit about the house in their underwear; Americans sit around the house in their underwear. Its hard to write in an American context as a Brit and not miss a few things.I do wonder at the accents that both Brad and his female roommate Rory have. It sounds awfully Deep South country for Oregon. But then again, Ive never been to Oregon (Washington State, yes and I have cousins in Portland). I have to say, no educated person in the US uses the word aint unless theyre being ironic. I shudder to think that Livings believes we all talk that way.What is nice here, and in all Livings' work, is a young male voice looking at modern gay romance from a slightly different perspective than we're used to. What we see are two very plausible lives as lived by two perfectly probable young gay men. That one is English and the other American is a plot device, not a crucial detail. The two characters could have been reversed without damaging the story; the nerdy American code-writer and the smooth English cad. What makes Livings story work is the authenticity of the young men, and his ability to coax character out of archetypes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R16VK277AG9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125J39K6#wasThisHelpful","R3R16VK277AG9B","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the third of a series set in a steampunk world (apparently England, but sounding like America) Wes and Kit have been invited back to Skeffield Manor, where (last we saw them) Louie had settled down with Robert under the indulgent  if slightly puzzled  eye of Mr. Skeffield.The Skeffields are throwing a party to show off the newly-discovered treasures amassed by Mr. Skeffields newly-outed grandfather in the newly decorated Sea Room restored by Jonquil Deeks.No, Im not kidding. Thats his name.In spite of their rather lower-middle-class roots, Wes and Kit are considered fondly by Messrs. Skeffield. Skeffield senior is fairly open-minded about fairies; his closeted son thinks hes fooling his daddy, but nobody is fooled. Not even a little.Then, after an awkward soiree to which all the local swells have been invited, the whole point of the evening is dashed to the ground when visiting magician-security guy Silus Smith discovered something or someone has dismantled his carefully-woven security spells around the treasure.  Sigh. This is just the way my parties end up.We have a few issues that muddy the tranquil waters of steampunk gay romance. Wes takes a dislike to Louie because hes such a stereotype. Even though Kit is sort of a frail little thing himself. I guess hes a butch frail little thing. More awkwardly, Robert appears for a moment to disrespect Louie for being so weepy at the drop of a hairpin. Louie is so wounded by this flicker of negativity, that he assumes their relationship is over. (Great line: Louis was the sort of man for whom the world ended easily, and often. However, this is said by Silus Smith.)Add into this the subplot of the magician Silus Smith being assigned a partner against his express wishes by the Magic Ministry, and then discovering that his new partner is none other than Gareth Silverman  the boy he loved and left at university.For all the silly schmaltz that fills the pages of this book; there is a lot of tender thoughtfulness that delves into the way gay men hurt each other with internalized homophobia (not that those modern words are ever spoken); and the ways in which male couples need to accommodate for each other in order to survive. There is also a lot more about magic in this book  the way it works, the way individuals who have magic use it (there are Muggles here, too, but theyre not ignorant of the magic world). The description of magic and its workings is often lovely and poetic; and the relationships between the various couples demonstrates a desire to emphasize that love is a two way street that needs constant maintenance.My one unforgivable objection: Silas is not spelled Silus. There is no tradition of using that spelling in English. And dont use the steampunk world excuse.I think were done with Skeffield Manor  but the door seemed open for more fun in Hollis Shilohs steampunk sort-of-British world. Yay.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZEOZHVPGPW48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RAS3MJQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ZEOZHVPGPW48","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not really a sequel, Louis and Robert picks up where Wes and Kit left off. Mr. Skeffington, now that Kit has set all his grandfathers clocks running properly, has decided to start living in his ancestral country house, and to search for a treasure he believes was hidden on the grounds by his beloved grandfather. He hires the flamboyant decorator Louis Candless  known as Louie to his friends  to freshen up the dark and outmoded rooms. Skeffingtons handsome military son Robert is there to watch over things  his father, the treasure hunt, and, it seems, Louie.While still the quiet, thoughtful, romantic novella weve seen in its precursor, Robert and Louie is set at a slightly higher pitch. Louie, for all that hes a pretty out-there gay man (and has suffered for it), is not without his own prejudices. Also, having been seduced and cast aside more than once, he is highly suspicious of the straight-acting Robert as just one more closeted user who sees him as a willing slut just because hes gay.These are not particularly deep books, but theyre comfortable and sincere, and the author does seem to have a way with cute dogs as secondary characters.

"Hollis Shiloh, in this series allied with the world presented in the novella Gear Heart, offers us gentle romances with quirky details and interesting people. There is a little magic, very little sex, and a quiet context that feels English but sounds American (not unlike Jordan Hawks Whyborne and Griffin novels, which are set in a fictional American city but feel very British somehow). Were in a historic period sometime after World War I, a time that seems far away but modern, too.  Steampunk 1920s?It is a time when gay folk are fairly well accepted, but men who have mechanical parts  who have been mechanicalized  are mistrusted and even demonized by the world at large. Mechanicalized men have few rights, cannot hold official positions, and are presumed to be dangerous and criminally inclined.Doesnt that sound familiar?One of these men, Wesley Newton, was saved from death and turned into a super-soldier, only to be cast aside when the war was over. Starving and nearly homeless, he struggles to shake off a stray dog who is following him, when he discovers a frail young man whos been beaten in a dark alley.The young man is Kit Fowler, a clockmaker and repair man, whose fragile heart has kept him sequestered most of his life. Kit hires Wes to be his bodyguard, while he repairs a clock for a local millionaire that seems to be the cause of the assault against him.The alternating POVs in this book let us inside Wes and Kits heads. Shilohs writing is comfortable and warm, and we loll our way through the book wondering how it will all come out in the end.Not a heart-pounding read, but a pleasant one. For those who seek romance in its purest form in a slightly oddball world, Shiloh delivers the goods.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8U0BK80RFSKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MFVY2RY#wasThisHelpful","R8U0BK80RFSKH","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need to catch up on Mark Zubros books. A Simple Suburban Murder is from what must have been his first series of books, published under his full name by St. Martins Press (one of the few gay-friendly mainstream presses in the 1980s). It is one of the Tom & Scott series: Tom is a high school teacher in a suburb of Chicago, and Scott is a famous baseball player. Tom is sort of out in the way school teachers had to be in the late 1980s, and Scott is deep in the closet, as big-league baseball players still are (!).Somehow, they make their eight-year relationship work. Even if it gets awkward at times. In these books the triumph is not being out and proud, the triumph is surviving as a couple any way you can, and recognizing that your love is just as good, possibly better, that what exists in the straight world around you.A Simple Suburban Murder was first published in 1989. M/M fiction didnt even exist. What we had is gay men writing novels, in this case a murder mysteryin the great tradition of Joseph Hansens Dave Brandstetter mysteries, which were still very much on my reading list then.  There is an edge to these early gay novels, which reminds todays reader of the very different reality that we lived in a quarter century ago.There is virtually no sex in this book. It is not romantic, although Tom and Scott love each other. There is a brutal murder, a byzantine plot involving teenage prostitution and illegal gambling, and the depiction of some really horrible normal families. Straight people dont come off looking very good. Nor do school administrators (was Mark a school teacher???).Although I didnt love this book, I enjoyed it, and Im reviewing it in the light of its historical place at the forefront of American gay popular fiction. The story arc of this murder mystery is only the apparent purpose; the real purpose is to focus a light on a real, live, surviving gay couple and the realities of the closet as it existed (and still exists, I suspect) for many gay men in the wake of the AIDS epidemics first deadly decade. These are the books that gay men of my generation read for funbut also to affirm that we existed and we were good people and solid citizens. Gay people were still largely invisible in mainstream literature (honestly, its not much different today, although we pretend otherwise), and Mark Richard Zubro was one of those writers who helped us feel visible in a world that didnt want to acknowledge our presence.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UCX96CZGWS2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0068ZT8Q8#wasThisHelpful","R3UCX96CZGWS2N","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This loosely linked series of romances set in Miami are not Neils greatest works. Their plots are not intended to be dramatic and the writing is workmanlike and (blessedly) simplebut I confess that theyre fun, and they all demonstrate Neils personal fascination with character. These seem to be personality studies, which is no surprise, given the importance of character in his other work.Larry Leavis is a six foot six computer geek, but cuter than he thinks he is.  He has two brothers and two sisters and a middle-class family of no great complexity or sophistication. Julian Argento is handsome prep-school son of a self-made Mexican millionaire. Larrys right out of college and working for a web-app firm full of odd characters. He meets Julian through one of his roommates, and is asked to help develop a website on a freelance basis.Romance ensues, and quite adorably. But Neil doesnt make things cleanly romantic. Larry gets involved with another man, because hes young and horny and not really self-confident enough not to be flattered by anyone who asks. Julian sends very mixed messages, because, well, people do, you know.There is a refreshing realness to Larrys character, and hes the one we really learn about in depth. The other characters, including Julian, provide the background against which we understand Larrys gradual self-empowermentin a very quiet way we watch him grow a pair and take charge of his own life. An overarching motif I particularly liked was Larrys gradual coming out to his co-workers, boss and family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VLNOQTZJ5ORE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BGZ9FS#wasThisHelpful","R1VLNOQTZJ5ORE","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sunset Lake is a place of beauty and joy, reclaimed from a place of devastation and ugliness. You can only reach it down a long, narrow dirt road, pocked with craters and ruts that threaten to break up the undercarriage of all but the sturdiest vehicles. The Rev. Brian Lucas has chosen Sunset Lake as the site for his new Methodist Youth Camp, the land wrested from the state government and the funds to build it from the tight-fisted Methodist officials who control his career. He wants a place where he can bring his congregations young people closer to God; a place separated from the prying eyes and well-intentioned interference of the folks of Nine Mile.It sounds like a set-up for a horror movie, doesnt it? Isolated camp. Long hazard-filled road through the woods. But no, from the very start, the narrator lets us know that the danger is not at Sunset Lake, but in the town itself. For the first time in many years, a murder has been committed, and it wont be the only one. Sunset Lake becomes the haven, the safe place.Imagine the town of Mayberry with a serial killer. Imagine all the comical characters suddenly fearful and suspicious. Add into that mix a closeted gay pastor whose brother is the sheriff. Can you feel the tension?  Inman draws us in with sympathy and a smile and then hooks us with fear. As we learn about the folks of Nine Mile, we share in everyones growing dread over what might happen next.The Rev. Brian Lucas is a good man. Hes a local boy, come back from seminary to lead the little flock he grew up in. By his side is his lifelong friend Sam, whose aunt is both Brians nemesis and the only keeper of their secret. Brian and Sam are more than friends, and have been since they were teenagers. The truth of the matter is that his role as minister to his flock depends upon keeping his relationship secret, in a town where everyone knows his business and has known both him and Sam since birth.Like his earlier novel, A Hard Winter Rain, this book shows John Inmans darker side, and how good he is at it. He hooks us with his ability to sustain a growing sense of claustrophobia in the great outdoors, a sense of creeping paranoia in the context of a tight-knight small town in Americas heartland.The reader, like Sam, is frustrated by Brians indecision regarding his relationship. His calling to ministry is genuine; his love of Nine Mile is real. But his love for Sam is, too. Only one of these can survive in small-town (and small-minded) America. Along with the fear that the murders engender, anxiety for his future fills Brians thought. The camp at Sunset Lake becomes his excuse to avoid dealing with either one, his personal metaphor for a place away from his worries that embodies his desire to be a good man and do the right thing.I spent the entire book looking for clues, and never figured it out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D0A6ZAXJL9JW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010OQQHAG#wasThisHelpful","R1D0A6ZAXJL9JW","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For anyone of my generation of gay men in America, children of Stonewall who came out in the 1970s, reading a memoir by another survivor of this era is inevitably tough.Brad Goochs new book, recounting his stormy life with filmmaker Howard Brookner, was every bit as harrowing as I expected it to be. Reading gay memoirs of the 1970s and 80s is hard, because we all lived through the same nightmare wherever we were.What made this eerier for me is that I was at Exeter with Howard Brookner, the semi-subject of this tragic romance. He was a year older, and we didn't know each other, but I remember him clearly. He was one of the long-haired ""bad boys"" who smoked and didn't socialize with preppy boys such as I, who spent our time sublimating our sexuality into loud clothes and high grades.So Gooch's memoir, set between 1978 and 1989, is sort of a parallel life to the one my husband and I lived eighteen miles to the west in suburban New Jersey. We were never cool, and never involved in the art and film scene as Brad and Howard were; but we knew people who were. We were on the edge of that world of beautiful men and hot clubs and sexual freedom. From our leafy suburban hilltop we could see the lights of Manhattan.Reading this wonderful, heart-breaking book is like watching a car crash in slow motion. I wanted the ending to be different, but I knew it wouldn't be. We saw it happen too many times in our own world. AIDS paid no attention to issues of bridge and tunnel.What makes Smash Cut so different from Paul Monettes Borrowed Time: an AIDS Memoir, or Larry Kramers fictionalized memoir The Normal Heart (a play and film), is that it is infused with love, not anger. Possibly the difference is that Gooch survived, learning that he was HIV negative at precisely the same time I did in 1989, and thus he can bring a spiritual generosity to his story, distanced now by over two decades from the immediacy of the sadness and suffering of Howards end.The book is filled with wry honesty and genuine humor. As a couple, Howard Brookner and Brad Gooch were a disaster (or, as our daughter would say, a hot mess); and yet the love between them comes through as strong and real as any Ive ever experienced on the pages of a book. Aided and abetted by Brads brief career as a model and Howards ongoing work on William Burroughs biopic, the young men are caught up in an endless series of addictions and compulsive infidelities. The siren song of the 1970s was a very strong one. It was not conducive to neat pairings or cautious behavior. The conscious desire on the part of both Brad and Howard to turn their backs on the bland suburban world of their parents simply added fuel to the fire.And yet, there is a kind of kids-in-a-candy-store innocence about their headlong plunge into the bars and baths of Manhattan. Oddly, I thought of Dorothy and her companions arriving in the Emerald City in the film version of The Wizard of Oz, as they indulge in all the urban wonders of that magical place before facing the terror of the wizard himself. The lure of New York and its very specific brand of gay liberation was, perhaps, exactly why my boyfriend and I decided to move to the suburbs back in 1980.Gooch is now 63, married to another man and the father of a child. He teaches at a university in New Jersey but still lives in Manhattan. That his life should end up so oddly parallel to my own simply underscores the dark whimsy of the world gay men all over the USA lived through together in the 1980s and infuses this big-hearted biographical narrative with a bittersweet poignancy that makes it particularly powerful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13LRZJCTQ3LF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGTQTZ4#wasThisHelpful","R13LRZJCTQ3LF1","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive really enjoyed this series, Have Body, Will Guard, featuring the life and love of Aiden Greene and Liam McCullough. These guys are more romantic than the hero(es) of his iconic Mahu series, set in Honolulu. Central to every one of these books is not the body-guarding mission which Liam and Aiden take on, but their evolving relationship. Of course the action is always interesting and theres always a puzzle to be worked out; but the meat of the series is focused on the men as a couple. Now, in book seven, six years into their time together, and both (?) in their early forties, Liam and Aiden are at another sort of crossroads.Thats right, their sex life is beginning that long slow decline we all dread.We all saw that coming, didnt we?Meanwhile, a long-retired American porn star, Freddie Venus (n Ventura), has holed up near Nice, and thinks hes being stalked. He hires our boys to solve his problem, which appears to be an overweight gay romance fantasy writer named Newton Camilleri. Newt is not romantic. He is, in fact, anti-romantic, and personifies every nightmare that our youth-and-beauty-obsessed culture could offer.There is, as a result, an odd sort of farcical undertone in this book that I dont recall from previous books in the series. This is exacerbated by lengthy samples of Newts truly (and intentionally) horrible romance writing, focused on a gay unicorn shifter named Fledglis and his gay-angel love interest, Ulric.I suspect that Plakcy has a purpose in Newts writing just the sort of treacly rubbish that people (aka: outsiders) assume ALL M/M fiction to be (which would include both Neils writing and my own, BTW). The contrast between Newts fictional heroes and the other two male bond-pairs in the book is intended to provoke wry smiles. But it is, I think, also meant to make it clear that Newts awful gooey fiction serves a very important purpose. It keeps Newt from simply giving up and killing himself. It gives him a purpose and, as a fat, lonely, fifty-year-old man in a cruel gay world, makes him feel loved for the first time in his life.Did Fifty Shades of Gray make you feel loved? Hmm?I have to point out that Plakcy is very solicitous of his readers sensitivities: he makes sure that we understand just how hot and muscled both Liam and Aiden still are, in spite of encroaching middle age. God forbid these self-made 007 avatars should have love handles or less than chiseled abs.You know, just the way we all were at forty. Or ever.Of course, I forget the large non-gay non-male readership of M/M fiction, who are not really interested in the reality of gay couples, but only in the fantasy, where no one is really old and everybody maintains zero body fat regardless of their age. (And yes, thats how I got into M/M fiction as well.)If Plakcys need to assure his readers of his heroes hotness annoys me a bit, I confess that I appreciate the fact that both Freddie and Newt are fifty, offering hope for love in a less than gym-perfect world. Neil clearly has his own issues with the genre of which he has become a master, and has addressed those issues by adding quirky new ingredients to this story. While it is a little disconcerting for those of us used to Aiden and Liams adventures, it is also comforting for those of us who know what it is to be a gay man from long personal experience.Truth is, Aiden and Liam will get older. They will gain weight and their sex drives will lessen. Its what happens. Maybe its time someone in the M/M world faced that fact and tried to figure out how to make something good out of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R374VUMN5KABZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VH4U6WA#wasThisHelpful","R374VUMN5KABZH","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The second of the Trowbridge Blues series, we are once again dropped into this charming, fictional little city somewhere in what I assume is the UKs heartland. With Beecrofts elegant prose, we are also dragged into a world few of us know: the community of historical re-enactors, who recreate the things and activities of long-gone cultures. Its wonderfully geeky, and I suspect more educational that I realized as I read it.Our heroes are unconventional, in that we deal not just with men carrying emotional baggage, but men marginalized for reasons other than being gay. Martin Dengtrying to lead a band of Viking battle re-enactorsis half British and half Sudanese. Reinventing himself as a historically plausible black Viking is a proud achievement, but not one his father nor his employer appreciate. As a result, Martin is unhappily closeted.Billy Wright, on the other hand, is all-English and of gold old Trowbridge stock. Out and proud, his problem is clinical depression, which he alleviates by throwing himself into the motley embrace of a morris-dancing troupe. But Billys black dog seems to be triggered by sensory overload, which suggests a kind of autism spectrum aspect to his depression.Theres a rather harsh meet-cute when Billys dance troupe and Martins battle clan get double-booked at a country fair, leading to a near-disastrous altercation. Both Martin and Billy step up to the plate and avert disaster. Thus the spark is lit, and our boys begin a halting courtship hampered by their respective emotional hurdles.Lots of sharply sketched supporting characters appear to fill in the background, but the focus is really always on Billy and Martin. They reveal themselves to be deeply drawn and profoundly good guys with flaws that get in the way of their happiness. The historical background that illuminates their unconventional hobbies is both fascinating and adds to our understanding of how these two men suit each other. Both of them are drawn to authenticity and historical accuracy--something they cannot achieve in their personal lives due to very modern-day issues.We all know where we want things to go, and watching Beecroft steer the narrative there is like appreciating a well-painted landscape. Every stroke of her pen adds to the picture, making both Billy and Martin ours.We have just a very brief glimpse of a character from the first Trowbridge BluesFintan Hulme, the charismatic gay owner of a bookstore in which Martin and Billy seek refuge during one of Billys attacks. I wistfully found myself hoping that at some point in this series these varied gay men will all find each other and become part of a larger Trowbridge-centered community.Keep it up, Alex.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39YSP2YKE40NY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPEW1O8#wasThisHelpful","R39YSP2YKE40NY","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gabe Vadas and Harvey Feng are back. In Lou Harpers particularly interesting take on the world-with-vampires premise, we have an old-country vampire slayer (Gabe) and a very modern American half-Chinese vampire (Harvey). What makes it so totally engaging is that these young men are simply another gay couple trying to feel their way forward.With some really weird baggage.Given the limited call for vampire slayers in modern America (something Gabe didnt quite understand in the first book in this series), hes been pretty lucky to land a semi-permanent gig working with Victor Augustine, the boss of the vampire demimonde in greater Chicago. Augustine himself is one of those marvelous background characters who make Harpers Sanguine novels so richly interesting. He seems to be something of a Don Corleone character, for whom Gabe is something of an enforcereliminating rogue vampires. But Augustine, for all his carefully sheathed power, is no crime boss. He is in charge of civic orderan order that would be destroyed if bad vamps start to do bad things to the dominant human population.The more we learn about Augustine, the more interesting and complex he becomes. At one point he gives voice to the old Benjamin Franklin bromide: Never leave till tomorrow what you can do today. Then he follows that up with the comment, A rather tedious fellow, mind you, but a great mind. Underscoring his great age and long existence in America, and suggesting moreover that he actually knew (and liked) Benjamin Franklin, Augustine makes both the reader and Gabe sit back and ponder exactly who he is.This kind of eerie banter accompanies all of the various vampires Gabe and Harvey meet in the course of this action-adventure story, moving from Chicago to New York to Budapest as they track down a truly evil vampire who seems to have started out as a Nazi scientist.Throughout the action narrative is the ongoing dance between Gabe and Harvey. Much of this is typical guy stuffanxiety about their future, male inability to voice emotions, and so on. Gabe is not a normal humanhaving been born with his slayers ability to sense and locate vampires with increasing precision. Harvey, on his side, is no normal vampire, having been forcibly and accidentally turned as a young nurse in a Chicago hospice facility. His emotional connection to Gabe is echoed by a deeper, psychic connection, which itself engenders all sorts of fears.  As all couples do, Harvey and Gabe continue to learn about each other in the course of the narrative, and the reader begins to more fully understand who they are to each other as they themselves do.I find the Sanguine series to be fascinating and find myself liking all of the characters as our insight into their personalities and motivations expands.Gabe Vadas began this series feeling betrayed and disoriented, unsure of who he was and what vampires really were. As clarity emerges from confusion, both Gabe and the reader are offered a glimpse of future possibility, and in this way the author hooks us. The book ends tidily enough, but it leaves us anticipating what is yet to come for our unlikely duo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NYFXI5F8O37A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5LA4UM#wasThisHelpful","R3NYFXI5F8O37A","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While not precisely a series, Neil Plakcys Miami novels (as I think of them) are, to me, sort of Plakcy light. If they dont have the heft of his two long series, the Mahu books and the Have Body, Will Guard books, they are still skilled exercises in character and plot-making.Gavin Kaczmarek is not a character I warmed to very quickly. Too handsome and too spoiled, he represents the sort of gym-bunny twink I always resented during my own (arrogant Ivy-League) twink years. Now, ordinary-gay-boy sour grapes aside, Gavin is, quite intentionally, superficial and vain in his approach to the world. Everyone is evaluated according to how they rank next to his exceptional good looks, and he seriously believes that as a part-time model and barista at a South Beach coffee house that he is somebody special. Gavin is an M/M genre archetype, and not a particularly admirable one.One of his customs, as he flirts with everyone while performing feats of coffee-making, is to give clever nicknames to all the regular customers whose names he never bothers to learn. One of these, Music Dude, turns out to be a slightly older music producer (i.e. someone with a real job and some professional chops), named Miles Goodwin.A random flirtation, because Gavin will have sex with just about anyone if hes attractive enough, opens an unexpected door and sends both Gavin and his new friend Miles on a cross-country adventure into Americas dairy land.One could say this is a story about a guy who has never had to try very hard in life learning what love is. But he doesnt really have to try very hard to get love this time either. The fact that he has to try at allthe fact that Miles doesnt just swoon instantly over himis enough to trigger a series of events that will ultimately lead to a new, better Gavin.What makes this book differentindeed, better than its protagonistis the cast of characters in Gavins background back in small-town Wisconsin. We not only meet Gavins parents and his favorite cousins (Erica and Archie); we meet his grandmother Frances and her two sisters, who were part of an Andrews-sisters-like singing trio back in the olden days. Plakcy takes us deep into the Kaczmarek clan, and shows us the world that produced our beautiful, shallow gym bunny. We see a boy truly loved by those around him (except by his off-screen sister, Gretchen, who remains something of a puzzle right to the end) and we also see a young man who has more in his heart that weve been led to expect. These characters help us see both why Gavin is who he is; and why he could be better than that.Plakcys plot moves along smoothly enough. There are no huge traumas, and the inevitable conflict that arises toward the end of the book was not completely compelling for meit is in fact as superficial in some ways as Gavin himself. But Plakcy makes it work, because at the core of all of Plakcys writing is the assumption that lovereal loveis what really matters. This is the ultimate lesson that all the people around Gavin teach him.The purpose of M/M fiction is to explore the infinitely varied paths to the same romantic goal. The success of any M/M novel is the authors skill in depicting those paths and the characters who take them. Plakcy is a master at this genre, and is to be admired for his loyalty to it in a literary world that doesnt care at all about gay people and their lives.Gavin Kaczmarek may not be an ideal romantic hero; but he is proof that anyone can be worthy if they choose the right path.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRIZR1I1DPF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMWBN68#wasThisHelpful","R1XRIZR1I1DPF8","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I confess that what seems to charm me most about J.L. Merrows books is their intensely British character. She really drags us into the middle-class (?) argot that both Tom Paretski and Phil Morrison speak, which seems to define them as characters and the world they inhabit. Surely this is only because Im an American, and it just feels exotic to me.So our little gay plumber with spidey senses and his former-bully-now-boyfriend are on the case again. This time it is about helping out their slightly scary lesbian pub owner chum, Harry.Even as Tom and Phil have to sort out the mystery surrounding barmaid Mariannes messy life, they also have to sort out the fact that theyre blokes and, well, really bad at verbalizing feelings; which gets in the way of their evolving relationship. So much of this seems to be rooted in the great British tradition of stunted emotions, and it laps over into Toms ongoing coping strategy with his parents and his parentage.Every bit of it is played out with a wry, self-deprecating humor that masks real feelings and tenderness. Merrow surrounds Tom with a host of off-key characters, from his uptight older sister Cherry to his flamboyant best friend Gary. As inept as they might sometimes be, these people care about Tom, and ultimately guide him in the right direction. There is a great deal of very British awkwardness, and that just make it all the more poignant for me.As always, I read other reviews as I write my own, and was surprised to read some of the negative ones for this. Here we clearly have a case of people disliking exactly the things about this book (and series) that I like so much. Hard to please everyone, you know?Merrow continues to be among my favorite reads, because she takes her stories beyond the narrow parameters of m/m genre and makes them into studies in human nature. If the world werent generally so disinterested in the lives of gay folk, these books would make an amazing Britcom TV series.The ending promises us another chapter in the tiny saga of Tom and Phil. Im anticipating it already.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIR9ZFPJRR2EJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDJV1B0#wasThisHelpful","RIR9ZFPJRR2EJ","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are no specific elements in Dirk Hunters charming After School Activities that are different from those in any other YA/LGBT novel. But Hunter (this cannot be his real name) manages to take every classic ingredient and twist it slightly, surprising the reader and transforming the tried and true into something both poignant and engaging.Disclosure: I bought this book entirely because of the redhead on the cover, who represents the main character, Dylan OConnor. I have a profound thing for redheads and this cover is simply beautiful.However, I gave this book five stars because of the exceptionally smart, funny writing and the sparkling characterizations that fill the book with life. It was a joy to read, making me laugh out loud and also making me tear up with emotion.Dylan OConnor and Adam Anderson have been enemies since elementary school, especially since fifth grade, when Adam made Dylan cry nearly every day.As high school loomed, Dylan came out to his parents and decided the only way to defend himself from the constant homophobic onslaught of Adam and his posse was to fight backwith words. Adam and Dylans back-and-forth over the years has become legend, and has gotten them sent to the principals office countless times.Then, in junior year, Dylan realizes that his long-term enmity with Adam might in fact have been masking something else.What Hunter does brilliantly is to sidestep our expectations. Imagine a school where your best friends can intuit your every mood and read you like a book. Imagine a school where the most beautiful and popular kids (Charlotte and James) are also the nicest and most compassionate people in school. Imagine a world where the protagonists parents are funny, loving and entirely cool.Imagine a world where your life-long best friend suddenly decides hes comfortable with the idea of getting physical with you, even though hes mostly straight.Uh oh.This is, strictly speaking, not young adult. Or, literally young adult and not intended for the middle-school age audience that young adult actually means. There is real, explicit sex in this bookand I hasten to add that it is used fiercely by the author to illustrate both the joyous horniness of teenagers, and the stark difference between sex-for-pleasure and sex-for-love.This is also the first instance I have read of the phenomenon of a mostly straight guy; that is a young man who is really into girls, but being horny, self-confident in his sexuality, and profoundly fond of his gay best friend, is interested in exploring what gay sex might offer him.I barely winced at all. I think I bought into it because of Hunters beautifully rendered characters, and the way he uses Malachis unexpected sexual curiosity to help Dylan realize the difference between emotion and hormones.At the core of the books success is Dylan himself. He is a teenager, no question. He is self-centered and short-sighted; but he is also kind and caring. He hates lying and he doesnt want to hurt people. He is a role model without being a goody-goody. He is also hilarious (to use a word that the author employs a lot) and embraces the strange role of GBFF (gay best friend forever) with flair and wit.He is, in short, the way I wish Id been as a teenager.And then theres the red hair. Sigh.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KGTV0H6096PP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY4L1H4#wasThisHelpful","R3KGTV0H6096PP","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This magpie adjacent novel of magic and avian metaphors is quite wonderful, just as all three of the Magpie Lord books and their related short stories are.The chief joy of all these books is KJ Charles gift for elegant, literate, period appropriate language. The writing is beautiful and offers the reader vivid imagery and a sense of place that is neither pedantically period nor anachronistic. Her characters leap off the page, and grab you by the heartstrings.Benedict Spenser is on the hunt for Jonah Pastern, the jackdaw of the title, a sneaking, thieving selfish bird. Betrayed and abandoned by Pastern, all we know at first is that Bens very angry and seeks revenge.Pastern, as we know from A Flight of Magpies, is a magical practitioner, andeven more rarea windwalker. Playing a secondary character in that hair-raising tale, he appears to be amoral at best, and at worst an accomplice to murder. Moral ambiguity is at the uncomfortable heart of this carefully crafted tale.But neither Ben nor Jonah know everything. As the frenetic plot unfolds, we begin to learn how these two young men got into the mess theyre in. The question that looms over the entire book is: is this a mess with a way out, or have Ben and Jonah run themselves into a dead end?KJ Charles makes us care about the answer to that question, and it keeps us on the edge of our seat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XLVK7ZEFL95V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHL2US0#wasThisHelpful","R1XLVK7ZEFL95V","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With each succeeding book in the Boystown series, Marshall Thorntons story of Nick Nowak in the 1980s just gets better.Thorntons noir writing style is grounded and sure. He takes us through the now-familiar streets of Chicago as it was 30 years ago, letting us follow Nicks mind as it moves between the two puzzling jobs hes been handed to the ongoing grief and guilt he feels over his lovers death and his killing of a serial killer.Boystown 7 is really about the emergence of hope in the heart of a new Nick Nowak. We find him at the start couch-surfing in his friend Brians apartment, sometimes sleeping with Brian, but also helping him take care of Terry, a precocious and prickly teenager thrown away by his parents for being gay. In the course of the story, Nick realizes that the world is moving on, and that he needs to figure out how to do that himself.A beautifully handled subtext in the book is the gradually awakening of something in Nick that, if not exactly a sense gay awareness, then a sense of self as a gay man without shame for being a gay man. Various characters who play roles in the story, from socialite Sugar Pilson to Brians new, annoying boyfriend Franklin, begin to tweak Nicks consciousness, slowly making him understand his own place in the world. Nowak has plenty that he thinks he ought to be ashamed of. As the plot progresses, Nick begins to see what the reader has known all along: that he is, more than he knows, a good and kind and generous man.As his relationships with old friends shift, his relationship with Harkers mother also continues to evolve. At Easter dinner she hands him a beer, and he wonders to himself: Id done something right and Mrs. Harker was thanking me.Tied to his evolving relationship with Harkers mother is another beautifully nuanced plot detail: Mrs. Harker forces Nick to get rid of the neon-green Chevy Nova that mob boss Jimmy English gave him, and gives him the peach-colored Lincoln Versailles that his late lover Harker owned. The Versailles was an ugly car, and it drove like a waterbed. The car smells of Harkers cologne and cigarettes, and while it upsets him, it is also a symbol of Mrs. Harkers thawing.AIDS and sex also have their roles to play; indeed the whole series has been cast against the backdrop of the emergence of AIDS in the 1980s and its devastating consequences. I lived through this myself, being about Nick Nowaks age, and so did the author. Nicks plight echoes uncomfortably that of every one of us who survived.Interestingly, while Nick talks quite a bit in the book about the sex he used to have, there are only two incidents of sex in this book.  Each serves a distinct and important purpose in Nicks evolution. Theyre too important to spoil by describing here.What did Oscar Wilde say about sex? Everything is about sex, except sex, which is about power.Boystown 7: Bloodlines left me emotionally sated and teary-eyed. Something big happened in this book, and it had nothing to do with murder. What ultimately happened is that I came to care deeply about Nick and his future. I so look forward to book 8 in the series, which is underway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BJV0HIYAR6SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCZK428#wasThisHelpful","R1BJV0HIYAR6SZ","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good grief. How does one begin to talk about the ninth of the Cambridge dons series? Jonty Stewart and Orlando Coppersmith are such old friends now.I cannot find my review of the last book in this series, All Lessons Learned on Amazon.  Could I possibly have not written a review? It was years ago, perhaps I wasnt obsessively writing reviews for every book I read; perhaps I simply emailed Charlie Cochrane, as was my habit for every author whose work I liked. All those emails are lost on an old computer, alas.I never expected there to be a ninth book. Book 8 brings our dons through the war. That seemed enough. Im not sure what compelled Charlie to put pen to paper for a ninth bookfan pressure, perhaps? Her own unwillingness to let these young men go? But Im glad she did.Lessons for Survivors is not the intense experience of the 8th bookwhich was published four years ago and felt like the grand emotional finale for our dons. Book 9 might not appeal as the earlier series did, because it is quiet, relatively untroubled. This book is about getting on with life. In it we are allowed the privilege of watching Jonty and Orlando settle into what will undoubtedly be a long happy life together. They build their careers, solidify their relationship, cope with the world around them; and for fun, take on a bit of detective work to spice up the everyday pleasures and frustrations of academia.In Jonty and Orlando we have E.M. Forster meets Agatha Christie. We have the upshot of Maurice as he imagined it but never quite was for Forster himself (read Wendy Moffatts A Great Unrecorded History: a New Life of E.M. Forsterhugely important and fascinating book focused on Forsters life as a gay man).The murder mystery in this book is low-key, small-town. Its not fair to say that it is secondary, since it is the central plot arc in the book; but it is in fact (at least to my mind) secondary to the careful study of Jonty and Orlandos relationship as it has survived the nightmare of the war and begins to adjust to long-term coping strategies.We see a damaged and diminished Jontystill himself, but mourning the terrible losses of the war and the flu epidemic of the postwar years. And we see a stronger, braver, and more fully-realized Orlando. Orlando now takes care of Jonty as much as Jonty took care of him in the earlier books. The men are really partners now, in every meaning of the word.In its own quiet way, the mystery is also about relationships, but failed ones. Unequal relationships marred by deceit and distrust. Through all of this Jonty and Orlando tread softly, independently and together. Constantly checking on each other and reassuring themselves that the other is OK, doing fine.For me, as a gay man of a certain age, this book is a comfort. It is a reminder that E.M. Forsters wistful fantasy about Maurice and Scudder was a reality for those men lucky enough and brave enough to deal with the prejudices and dangers of being gay in the British empire. Our dons are both well aware of Oscar Wildes fate (as was Forster, very keenly) and when the threat of exposure is waved before them, it does not send them shivering into darkness, but forces them to turn to the small coterie of people who know for assistance and support. While this plotline is never played up too much, it is more important than any other. The fact that the threat to their security never halts their pursuit of the murder mystery indicates how strong they are, as individuals and as a couple.Family, both blood and chosen, plays a major role in this book. Jontys sister Lavinia takes on a new role in this detective story; as do other Cambridge friends for whom the dons relationship is a given and not a secret. In a parallel track, we see technologyin the form of the telephone and the automobilebegin to play a role in the dons detective work; the modern world aiding and abetting our Miss-Marple-as-gay-couple in their pursuit of the truth and justice.Through this intimate network we begin to see that there could be other novels possible in the future, with a different direction and a different emphasis. Has Charlie Cochrane just opened a new door for her characters and her fans?Throughout her books, Cochrane earns my admiration for her careful use of language. There are no f-bombs here. These young men are Edwardians in the early 20th century, they are not modern characters transported back in time. This is their reality, and they reflect it in every way. The atmosphere of the period is on point. Cochranes fantasy is made plausible and authentic.I cant help but wonder if E.M. Forster would have liked Jonty and Orlando. My fear is that he wouldnt have liked them; because in Cochranes novels they have attained something he only dreamed about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNRX7QWHUBEO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626491585#wasThisHelpful","RNRX7QWHUBEO8","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dying to PlayBy Mark ZubroFour starsIn the vein of two of my favorites, Marshall Thornton and Neil Plakcy, Mark Zubro brings us Mike King, a cool gay private-eye who solves interesting mysteries.This book is more about the mystery to be solved than the private eyes private lifealthough that serves as a savory background note to the story. What matters is not that Mike King is not a romantic kind of guy, but that he wants to be, with a notorious lack of success. By the end of the book, you want him to be, too. While never letting up on his cool, Mike manages to make it clear that hes a good guy. Hes good with dogs and babies and defends nerds and anyone else oppressed or put down. Ya gotta love him. I sure did.Mike has a sort of Charlies Angels posse who are all gay and all as cool as he is. Theres Jerry, a tough James Bondian stud with an off-screen boyfriend he adores. Then theres Georgia DJungle, the worlds most awesome drag queen who can do anything and be anyone (including Mike Kings lawyer). Finally, theres the ever-patient and uber-efficient Duncan, who has a boyfriend named Andy and takes care of his bosss basset hound, Caesar, when the boss is on the road.On the road this time means Butterfield, Wisconsin, where small-town life means age-old feuds and present-day factions that lead to murder. Hired by a locally-born billionaire who is trying to run a minor-league baseball franchise in his hometown, Mike King is caught up in the Peyton Place stew of rivalries and resentment that rule Butterfield.Zubro gives us a plot worthy of Miss Marple, and a hero for whom being gay is just another angle he uses to figure out what the hell is going on.I hope there will be more Mike King books coming soon, because Mr. Zubro is onto something on par with Plakcys Kimo Kanapaaka and Thorntons Nick Nowak.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RTBOP78WTSX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S0B0Y4S#wasThisHelpful","R3RTBOP78WTSX1","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grime Doesnt Pay: Eddie (The Brothers Grime, #2)By Z.A. MaxfieldFive starsI really enjoyed the first of Z.A. Maxfields Brothers Grime books (Grime and Punishment: Jack). I liked this one even more, and gave it five stars simply because of the way the experience of reading it made me feel.Maxfield invests the standard boy-meets-boy outline with fascinating insights and tremendous character building. Her men have baggage, and she unpacks that baggage for the reader with tenderness and compassion.This second bookwhich is perfectly stand-alone in its plotfocuses on Eddie Vasquez (who, rather divinely, has the nickname Cha-Cha). One of the partners in the Brothers Grime (Because, as their tag line goes, Life Isnt A Fairy Tale).Eddie has a crush on his niece Lucys teacher, Andrew Daly. Although the inevitable get-together is foreordained, the emotional and practical consequences of these mens attraction to each other are complicated because of the secrets theyre keeping.Using a crime and trauma clean-up business as the plot driver for a romance novel is, frankly, a peculiar idea. And yet Maxfield creates a genuinely interesting story in which the often unpleasant realities of life (often the end of life) become metaphors for the ways in which we trap ourselves in our own personal flaws and thereby prevent ourselves from doing what we really need to attain happiness.Eddie Vasquez is a wonderful guy, but not unbelievable nor cloying. Andrew seems to be the perfect, smart, handsome guy. But, as every m/m romance teaches us, perfect is boring. Dyslexia and hoardingnow thats interesting. Maxfield gets us to fall in love with this couple, and then drags us into their respective messes to keep us rooting for them. Her excellent, well-crafted writing and dialogue make every page a pleasure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R51CQCGUB5EWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXKWCWA#wasThisHelpful","R51CQCGUB5EWH","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Down and DirtyBy Rhys FordFour starsRhys Fords Cole McGinnis series is great fun. The writing is brisk and really pulpyover-written in a very calculated way that I am sure makes Ms. Ford smirk as she writes.Imagine Jane Austen as a horny gay man.Although part of the series, Down and Dirty is really quite different from the other books except in its setting and characters.  It is in fact a back-story book that appears to be taking place while the action of the other books (the last of the series, most probably) is happening at the same time.Here we see Bobby Dawson, Cole McGinniss 40-something friend and collaborator in mayhem, falling in love with Coles newly-discovered fully-Japanese half-brother, Ichiro Tokugawa. Forbidden fruit (so to speak). Bobbys bad pastwhich Bobby has never fully explained to anyone, (not even to Cole, his best friend) finally comes back to bite him in the ass. Everyone tell Ichi that Bobbys a bad boyfriendbut no one ever asks Bobby what happened. Hes guilty enough about his own behavior not to fight what people say about him.Until Ichiro changes the game.I resisted the pulpy quality of this, for some reason,  until I was well into the book; and both Bobbys and Ichiros true personalities got developed on the pages.And, I have to confess, for a sixty-year-old who has no tattoos, the scene in the tattoo parlor at the end of the book made me weep.Whoda thought?","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD7SCOAYTQ7WR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RI9ZE8Y#wasThisHelpful","RD7SCOAYTQ7WR","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What I did register is that the Barlinney Hotel seems to be what the old Great Northern Railway Hotel was in Edinburgh, where I stayed with my dad in 1970 when I was fifteen.The comi-tragic premise of this rich little tale is that Cosmo is an agoraphobic hero, condemned to stay trapped in the hotel he loves and where he works.

"Think of EnglandBy KJ CharlesFour starsAn isolated mansion in a man-made forest. A group of Brits, male and female, of every type one would expect in the years before the Great War: the industrialist, his son and his much younger second wife; the pretty heiress and her humorless companion; the dull married couples with wandering eyes; the bluff and bigoted Oxbridge man; the epicene poet; and the wounded soldier.Archie Curtis is on a mission, but even hes not quite sure what it is. His career in the army and his steady world of companionship with his fellow officers was abruptly ended by a shipment of faulty guns during the Boer War. He thinks it was sabotage, and suspects that the secret lies hidden somewhere in Sir Hubert Armstrongs country house.The setup is very Agatha Christie (And Then There Were None); but the twist that separates this story from its forebears is Daniel DaSilva, low-born Portuguese Jew from the wrong side of London. DaSilvas effeminate posing and razor-sharp wit make him an entertaining but unlikely ingredient in a country-house party.Archie Curtis, physically and emotionally wounded, is repelled by DaSilvas smug perverseness. DaSilva represents everything that Archie was raised to abhor.Until he discovers that DaSilva is on a mission, too.KJ Charles draws you into this unlikely setting peopled with characters who, at first glance, might have come from an episode of Downton Abbey. The fortnight-long stay at the Armstrongs estate becomes an awakening for the damaged ex-soldier, forcing him to question everything he knows and most of what he feels.I am always suspicious of period pieces, and I resisted this book at first; but once again Charles story-telling and carefully layered character reveals broke me down and captivated me. Its a marvelous narrative with much more than an exciting plot going for it. Charles deals with the realities of Edwardian England in a believable way, and lets her readers see beyond the prim facades of good manners and great wealth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIHJBOFPQVTDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IG1ODT4#wasThisHelpful","RIHJBOFPQVTDC","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Best Corpse for the JobBy Charlie CochraneFour starsIn the great tradition of Miss Marple, Charlie Cochrane has given us a charming 21st-century update on murder in an English village. With actual gay people.Adam Matthews wants nothing more than to be done with the arduous interview process for a new headteacher (no headmaster in this modern gender-neutral world) at St. Crispins. Like the village of Lindenshaw wherein it lies, however, St. Crispins is rather stuck in the past, and finding a suitable man or woman to take it into the future is both a challenge and, frankly, boring.Until one of the candidates for headteacher turns up dead.Enter homicide inspector Robin Bright from the nearby town of Stanebridge. His handsome face turns Adams cozy little semi-closeted world upside down. Used to dodging the school secretarys well-meaning questions about a girlfriend and school governor Oliver Narraways homophobic rants about the modern world, Adam cant escape Robins keen eye. Soon Adam and Robin are doing a complicated dance, because Adam is a suspect and Robins career is at stake if he crosses an ethical line with the first man whos attracted him for a long time.What makes this very English novel so pleasing is the delicate path it treads; both Robin and Adam are, technically, out and neither risks loss of his job just for being gay (it IS the 21st century). Young and lonely and very much drawn to each other, each of them must behave in a way that is appropriate for his professional position in the community and in the midst of a murder investigation. How will Robin find the murderer without losing a rare chance at romance?Cochranes crisp, literate British English and her deft depiction of the Marplesque world of village life in a modernized Englandcomplete with cell phones and Indian takeawaycast a pleasant spell. This is a book about good manners and controlled emotions, recalling Cochranes iconic Cambridge Dons series set in the early 20th century. She surrounds us with classic British types, giving them a new context, as well as offering us the engaging spectacle of two handsome men trying to find love without spilling their tea.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMVP13G1EFV87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLN2C8G#wasThisHelpful","RMVP13G1EFV87","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And Then That HappenedBy Liam LivingsFour starsThis isn't your typical romance. ""And Then That Happened"" is a beautifully rendered portrait of the death of a long-term relationship and the long, slow birth of a new one. Aside from some irritating structural issues, I found it moving and authentic in tone and in detail. It felt very real, more like a memoir than a novel.That sense of memoir is not new to this book for Liam Livings. He is also the author of an ongoing series of books, ""Best Friend Perfect,"" that focus on a young man coming out and making the transition from youth to adulthood. While far more lighthearted in tone, there is heartbreak in those books as well. There are plenty of parallels between this book and those, not the least of which is Dominic's friend Matt, who is clearly Jo from the ""Best Friend"" novels. Obviously Livings has drawn from personal experience, and that enriches his work with believability.""And Then That Happened"" was Livings' first novel, but it could almost be the fast-forward sequel to the ""Best Friend"" books. It concerns a male nurse, Dominic, in his late twenties, who finds himself ten years into a relationship and realizes that he's just going through the motions.""The pressure to put on a shiny happy face and enjoy yourself became larger than anything else in the room.""And then by chance he meets another male nurse, Gabe, and suddenly the futility of his relationship becomes all too apparent.A sad story in many ways, ""And Then That Happened"" is not at all melodramatic. There are no bad guys, least of all Dominic's partner, Luke. The story is thoughtful and honest in its attempt to analyze what makes ""happiness"" and the ways we--gay men, but really everyone--continue to accommodate in little ways until we find ourselves stranded and unable to move forward.The narrative is not just about Dominic's relationship with Luke or his friendship with Gabe. It is about his whole history with Luke--from college to surviving the horrors of AIDS, to dealing with parents and difficult friends and the constant threat of depression. Livings tackles the full, complicated truth of a young man's life and flinches at nothing.I finished reading this book, rather compulsively, on my own 39th anniversary with a husband, who, like Gabe, I met in university. There is very little in this rather younger British man's life that didn't resonate in some way with my own American version of that life. It made me ponder the fact that the same ingredients don't always lead to the same results. As much as we might wish it to be so, people are not predictable; we cannot fully control what happens in our lives or what our reactions will be to those events.Livings' use of flashbacks was sometimes confusing, and there are moments of unintended discontinuity that were puzzling, but the large landscape he paints of Dominic's journey from false happiness to true happiness is quietly harrowing and, it seems to me, terribly true.I suspect this book will have a little trouble getting traction in the M/M romance world, because it bravely avoids all of the formulae; it is the sort of book I'd love to see catch on in the mainstream press (with some strict editorial input). Anyone who thinks gay men can't teach the world about marriage ought to read this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W1DMC68BD7Z9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWSCB0W#wasThisHelpful","R2W1DMC68BD7Z9","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review of Secrets and CharmsBy Lou HarperFour starsI had to go back and read my review of the book that preceded this, Secrets and Ink, to remind myself that Id met some of these characters before. Jem and Nick are secondary players in this story, but similar themes echo between the two narratives.Dancing on the fringe of Hollywood, twenty-two-year-old Olly Blackwood is just trying to help his friend Sandy, a rising starlet. He didnt count on having to deal with her straight homophobic brother, Richard.Basically, Harper had me at fiery redhead, which describes Richard. I am never entirely comfortable with stories that edge toward gay for you plot twists, but I give the author credit for handling this in a way that made it credible and even unavoidable, given Richs past.There is a wee bit of voodoo woven into this tale, as there was in its predecessor, and its just enough exotic flavor to add interest without steering the plot into paranormal territory. Essentially, the hint of magic suggests that Olly needs to start thinking carefully about his own actionsincluding how he deals with Richardto make steps forward in his life.Harper is a good writer. Her smooth narrative and quick character development draw you into the story without unnecessary detail. Dont think too hard about the plot, because it has screwball aspects that dont stand up to logic. But Lou Harper serves up a good solid romance with people one cares about in settings we can believe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QALS7AJI9U5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQOTMAM#wasThisHelpful","R1QALS7AJI9U5L","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Best Friends Perfect (Book 2)By Liam Livings4 starsThe second (but not the last) in Liam Livings whimsical, probably autobiographically-based series of the life and times of Kieran and his friends did not disappoint.My fondness for Kieran Donovan grew as he and his best friend Jo head off to Australia with Kierans entire family to visit relatives in Sydney before the boys embark on their year-long walkabout in Oz.This is not high literature, nor would I want it to be. What makes Livings narrative of a teenagers transition from boy to young man so appealing is the unpretentious straightforwardness of its style. It reads like a journal, but with a self-conscious thoughtfulness that allows us into Kierans head and heart.The same cast of characters carries us alongKierans slightly confused but chipper family, his longtime friends Grace and Hannah, and his new-ish best gay friend Jo. There is much of the shaggy-dog-story in this book. The story rambles along chronologically, taking us through the year in Australia and the beginnings of University life in London. If it feels somewhat shapeless, this meandering is actually quite good, because it allows us to keep track of the events that, against the big picture of Growing Up, start to focus Kierans understanding of his evolving adulthood and our understanding of Kieran.I appreciate very much the depiction of the Donovan clan. Kieran is embarrassed by his parents and younger brother, and yet at the same time is profoundly proud of their acceptance of him and willingness to embrace his new lifestyle (which is always presented in quotation marks, because it is such a cringe-worthy word).There is little self-pity in Kieran, because he is too good a sort to indulge in that. He cares about other people as much as he cares about himself, and his willingness to forgive and accommodateeven when it is not necessarily in his best interestsis laudable.Because the book is set in 1998 and 1999, it also depicts the moment when cell phones and internet email started to transform personal communicationand as I can hardly remember that far back, it was fascinating to see it so nicely documented.  Someone needs to keep track of these things, and technology does play a crucial role in the events of Kierans emerging wisdom.Even though Im older than Kierans parents, I identified strongly with him, simply because there are certain universal truths to coming out that have not been eradicated by changing times. Growing up is a hard enough process; growing up gay is not much less fraught emotionally now than it was for me 40 years ago.I really look forward to Liam Livings third installment of Kierans life. I know what I want to happen to himand I can wait to see if the author will let it be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30NNS1K0WZMXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHTMEGO#wasThisHelpful","R30NNS1K0WZMXN","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love is a StrangerBy John WiltshireFour starsOne thing is clear: when you read reviews by amateurs (which of course includes yours truly) you have to understand where they are coming fromwhat baggage they bring to the review.Professional reviewers (mainstream reviewers) also have baggage, but everyone knows who they are and the biases they bring to their reviews.So, as an almost-sixty-year-old gay man with a 39-year relationship; someone who came out in the mid-1970s in the first great wave after Stonewall; I have a distinct perspective.Thus, having bought Love is a Stranger through the recommendation of a Goodreads friend, I initially wondered why anyone would think Id enjoy this book.Right away, John Wiltshires dark, gripping action/romance novel pushed several negative buttons for me. Those would be1. A young gay man in the 21st century marrying a woman for reasons of power/status/wealth.2. Another, younger gay man having an affair with said married man3. These two men having unprotected sex4. The younger man sleeping with other men while 2 and 3And yetBen Ryder and Nikolas Mikkelson are not exactly what they seem. Their relationships, both working and personal, are not quite what they initially appear to be either. Wiltshire has created what for me was a repellant set up, only to undermine my kneejerk reaction by gradually revealing fragments of these two mens lives and inner selves that mitigate the situation in which they find themselves.By the midpoint of the book, even as I anxiously anticipated the next off-putting things that one of these men was going to do, I had become decidedly sympathetic to both Ben and Nikolas, and had largely forgiven them for their transgressions of my worldview. Nikolas is the more complex of the two men, as Ben begins to understand, and my compassion for him grew tremendously as his layers were peeled away to the harrowing truth beneath them.There is a certain retro (i.e. 1970s-80s) attitude in the narrative of Love is a Stranger that accounts for most of my discomfort. It is not unlike Daniel Craigs portrayal of the newest James Bond in Skyfall, a movie I enjoyed and yet detested at the same time. Ben is sort of a young gay James Bondand so is Nikolas, for that matter. It is hard for me to believe that Ben, even given his history and professional background, would be so amenable to Nikolass machinations, all the while reminding us of his erstwhile bisexuality as if to prove hes a real man somehow. I had to ask why the author needed to build a heterosexual moment into Bens past. In 2014, is it entirely impossible to conceive of a tough, highly-skilled military man who is completely and comfortably gay? Whom was this detail in Bens character designed to appease?All my bitching aside, Wiltshire has written a truly compelling novel, a page-turner that kept my interest and my heart-rate up until the oddly lyrical quasi-ending (which leads us into the next book in the series in a somewhat limp cliffhanger). This excellent story will never be made into a film unless either Ben or Nikolas is transformed into a woman. Too bad. Either of these men is as interesting as James Bond ever was to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13K5ISYNHOCJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDQZI3U#wasThisHelpful","R13K5ISYNHOCJE","A2FZ85EIAJWYBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FZ85EIAJWYBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This model has few reviews but is cheaper than the 40324 and that one has tons of rave reviews. The audio ins/outs are exactly the same on both. It's just the video ins/outs that differ. I just needed the audio switching so went for this less costly model and am thrilled with its reliability, quality and digital optical 5.1 surround sound output.I have a Panasonic SA-HT900 DVD changer home theater (HTIB) and love its audio features, but wanted to upgrade to an upconverting DVD HTIB. Well they don't make the new upconverting home theaters with all the sound features this one has, so I opted to keep it as a receiver and buy a separate Oppo DV981-HD upconverting DVD player and get this selector to switch the one optical digital audio input I have on the receiver between my cable and new upconverting DVD player, and it's flawless.Setup was a breeze. The remote is so convenient and the size of a credit card. I incorporated into my learning remote too.Don't let any photos of this unit's back with the strange looking audio plugs scare you. It definitely uses standard digital optical toslink cable and handles 5.1 surround. Those are just the toslink plug protectors sitting in the audio plugs. I pulled them out and am using standard optical cable.If you don't need to switch component video, save some money and get this model instead of the 40324.I read so many bad reviews about the passive digital audio switches out there, and most have to be switched manually. This switch is so worth the cost and electricity. It's solid and convenient.Update 8/6/10:This switch is still going strong. Now I have all three digital audio inputs in use- HD cable box, dvd player and HTPC all in lovely surround sound! Just wish it was smaller or had a cabled infrared sensor so I could tuck the box away in back. I recently switched my 3 HDMI video inputs into this tiny playing card box sized switch that automatically switches too! Now that switch is cool (and cheap to boot)!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11S2D33WCY9RZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000234I6C#wasThisHelpful","R11S2D33WCY9RZ","A10UV0T9R1U3RH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10UV0T9R1U3RH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this in May 2007 for 1700 delivered. At the time it was the best and most reasonably priced 1080p HDTVs.Pros: price is better than any other brand offering the same features, picture quality even in non-hd is very good and quite configurable, fabulous HDTV picture, really easy to set up and learn to use all the neat features on the remote, beautiful looking unit, speaker placement at bottom keeps the unit width down so can fit a larger LCD in smaller spaces.Cons: the sound leveling option simply does not work which is very frustrating when every channel runs at a different volume. The speakers really are bad- they vibrate with high bass settings so must keep the bass down. You had better have a surround sound system if you get this tv. 8rms isn't really fast enough for me in 480i- noticeable artifacts. In HD the artifacts are barely noticeable and in game mode, which speeds up the rms but is only available for dvds and games, is much better and wish it was used full time for tv too. It doesn't have a seeing eye to automatically adjust picture brightness based on the room brightness so you have to adjust it yourself using the energy saver button on the remote which has 4 levels. I kinda wish I'd held out for a model that has a QAM tuner and cablecard slot so I'd have more options for HDTV because I really don't want a clunky set top box QAM tuner and yet another remote at all-how 1970s! I'd like to get a cable dvr stb, which would negate the need for a QAM tuner in the tv, however, they are currently so huge one wouldn't even fit on the cabinet shelf with my other components so I'm waiting 'till more sleek models become available. Lastly, the remote, however easy, has the buttons really poorly placed and the tactical design is horrible- can't use this one without actually looking at it-ever! I much prefer the buttons in the circle to be the main channel and volume buttons with the prev-channel and fav channels buttons just above it and the number pad directly above them. The least they could have done was make the volume and channel buttons true rockers- all the buttons feel the same. Who designs these things? Do they ever use them?This was my first Samsung electronic purchase (I'm a Panasonic-aholic) because in my opinion, no other HDTV LCDs compared in both quality and price to Samsung's. Well my main board started to fail 3 months after I got it- the picture started intermittently changing to vert. and horiz. lines of picture pixels and the rest black. But I called Samsung and they sent a great repairman to my home and he replaced the main board in 10 minutes. It was still under original warranty, but I'm also glad I got the extended warranty for this thing. Seems to me LCDs are far less reliable in the long run than the old CRTs. But the repairman said it was the first time he'd repaired this model, and that he owns Samsung LCDs himself and they are quite reliable tvs. It's fine now!Some pointers- I don't know why so many people like to put the color temperature on warm. I find that cool 1 and cool 2 are far more realistic. Anyway, there are 4 configurable picture modes that you can set any way you want and switch between them easily on the remote. The movie mode, however doesn't allow you to enable the DNL so keep the contrast high on that one. DNL overlays solid black pixels over the darkest areas of the screen to blacken the blacks more. I find it adds too much movement though, so rarely use it. The tv remembers which picture size you last used in each input-tv, vcr, dvd, aux etc. No it doesn't auto-size to fit. I wouldn't want it to do that anyway. I like the control. It offers all the usual options- 4:3 actual scale, zoom 1 which stretches 4:3 width to fit, zoom 2 which maintains aspect ratio and cuts off the top and bottom of 4:3 pictures to fill the screen, 16:9 for widescreen pictures. You manually name analog channels with their call letters in the channel manager and digital channel names feed in from the source. PIP only works with a 2nd external tuner through specific inputs and not from a vcr tuner on composite input. I played with the pc input but my laptop doesn't go to a high enough resolution and cannot zoom the pc picture enough so was a bit disappointed with the little floating picture on the screen. Will have to upgrade my laptop video card next!Update:After 2 years, the plastic framework inside the swivel pedestal broke. Unfortunately the company I purchased the extended warranty from dissapeared off the face of the earth, so I pulled it apart and glued it back together with crazy glue and re-inforced the honycomb interiors with mighty puddy. That stuff is really amazing. That pedestal is in better shape now than it was as designed! But that was a project!Also I got a HTPC (home theater PC) and connected it via HDMI and SDIF to this TV and was getting overscan on picture (overhangs edges all around so can't get to start menu etc.), and the stupid NVidia video card drivers are all buggy in the rezize picture area. Newer TVs have a setting to remove overscan from PCs and this one didn't. So checked the Samsung support site and sure enough a firmware update was available for this model and we installed it and now it has a ""Just Scan"" option as one of the picture sizes that removes the overscan for the HTPC picture- beauty!I use a passive very inexpensive HDMI switch to input 3 different video sources of HD video into one HDMI input. It's just easier that way because the switch automatically switches sources based on what is on and you can pick a video source directly rather than toggling through the sources on the TV. I find the picture sometimes gets a colored line matix over it when I first turn on the TV. I think it is a little sensitive to the switch but if I turn it off, wait a half-minute and then back on, it fixes itself. Also, when playing some blu-rays from the HTPC I do need to plug the power adapter in for the HDMI switch to give the signal more oomph, otherwise the picture gets these white flashes in it continually. HDMI can do that if the signal is not strong enough. Fortunately this switch can be used active or passive.I also learned that if you feed 5.1 surround audio into this TV through HDMI with the video, it causes the source component to downscale the digital audio to stereo even when you are sending the audio to the receiver through the optical out on the components. So, if you have a receiver, set your components to only send video through the HDMI and no audio over HDMI.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N7S9VLSZVL9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GDEZLQ#wasThisHelpful","R2N7S9VLSZVL9M","A10UV0T9R1U3RH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10UV0T9R1U3RH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used a fancy lever corskrew at home for years because I thought they provided the best leverage and ease-of-use, but the screw on my expensive opener keeps unscrewing itself off when opening very tight corks.I travel a lot and carry a simple waiter's corkscrew with me because they're small and fairly easy to use too because they also have good leverage. Well one day I couldn't find my travel opener so shopped for a replacement. The thing is, you can't carry an opener on a plane if it has a knife foil cutter, so I looked long and hard for one with an alternative. (My old one had lost its knife so was easy to travel with, and I just cut the foil with the screw tip.)The Good Grips 31681 has a wonderful and safe 2-wheel foil cutter that passes airport security, and actually works beautifully!  Just run the cutters around the bottle and the foil is off. (Update 4/21/11: I see they have changed the model here and it now has a traditional knife. That's not the one I reviewed)The next great thing about this opener is the ergonomic rubber casing that is SO comfortable when removing the cork.But the very BEST thing about this opener is how effortlessly the corks come out of the bottles! For instance, I couldn't get one of those new imitation corks out with my lever opener because the screw wouldn't grab the cork and would just unscrew itself from the opener instead- drove me crazy! I tried this opener on it expecting to really fight the cork when pulling it out- instead it slid out like butter! I was amazed.Now It's my primary home openener and I'm buying another one to travel with, and one for everyone in my family!BUY IT!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX90GIOFLHQEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004OCKN#wasThisHelpful","RX90GIOFLHQEF","A10UV0T9R1U3RH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10UV0T9R1U3RH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only chew this gum and this flavor! It is virtually impossible to buy the cinnamon flavor in my local stores- no one carries it! So thank you Amazon.com!It has a nice loose texture and great flavor that lasts and lasts.It's not on your teeth long enough to whiten them, but if you're a smoker or heavy coffee drinker it keeps your teeth from browning. So if you've invested in a whitening or do not wish to have to do that ever, or again, this will definitely help in that effort!The packaging is also good for carrying it around with you without the gum getting stuck to it's packaging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KRVODBA4Q18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000068XME#wasThisHelpful","R2KRVODBA4Q18","A10UV0T9R1U3RH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10UV0T9R1U3RH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Protecting a $200 phone is quite a formidable task and a lot of cell phone case companies do not seem to understand protection. They strive for style, design, and aesthetics. To me, this is all nonsense. Otterbox understands the principle of protection better than any other company making these types of products. Fuction is what I am looking for and and this company produces fuctioning cell phone cases. These 4S generation cases share an improved design, mainly with the camera area. I think people were complaining about shadowed pictures and video due to the tight camera cut out. They widened it to ensure the new 8MP camera with not be hindered by a design flaw.First, the defender technically provides more protection than the commuter and also comes with a handy holster with a clip. However, the defender is bulky and the port covers do not stay as well as the model for the 3GS. Also, I am not a fan of the defender because of the screen protector it comes with. Eventually, particles of dust or grit will work their way into your case and be sandwiched between the screen and the hard plastic film. Then, friction from your finger will scratch the screen up pretty bad (this happened to me). To make matters worse, I put a Zagg shield on it and it basically fused with the screen protector on the defender. I needed to pry the phone off the case and, while doing so, lifted the glass of the phone, creating permanant air pockets in my screen. Not a good scenario at all. The anti-glar films sold at the apple store, however, work fine because they have a smoother, less sticky surface. I would not reccomend this case at all, though, without these screen protectors because without a screen protector, air bubbles will form and distort your view and scratches on the screen will occur. But, if you work construction or another potentially hazardous job, this case with the anti-glare screen protectors may be a better choice then the Commuter series of cases.The Commuter, on the other hand, offers a balance between versitility and protection. With this case, I can use my Zagg shield and is not peeled up by the case like many do. Also, I love the soft shell on the inside and the hard shell outside. The soft inner allows the port and button covers to be attached to the case and function propperly. This also helps absorb shock. The hard shell allows the phone to slide in and out of pockets very easily, even out of tighter jeans. In addition, it has a much thinner profile than the defender but still provides adequate protection. The ports are still protected from water and it can take a tumble. I've dropped my 4S about 4 times with this case on it, on hard surfaces from pretty significant hieghts (5 feet or so on some) and the case barely even shows it let alon the phone wrapped up inside. Also, by flipping the phone face down, the exposed inner rubber case prevents it from slipping if you needed it to stay put, for instance, in a car. For the average person, the commuter is the superior choice.However, both cases with the lighter colored silicon soft shells, like white and grey, get dirty easily. They even get stained from dye in jeans. Not a huge deal to me, but might be to some. Overall, these are the two best cases on the market for the iPhone and believe me, I have researched and read up on them all.

"Protecting a $200 phone is quite a formidable task and a lot of cell phone case companies do not seem to understand protection. They strive for style, design, and aesthetics. To me, this is all nonsense. Otterbox understands the principle of protection better than any other company making these types of products. Fuction is what I am looking for and and this company produces fuctioning cell phone cases. These 4S generation cases share an improved design, mainly with the camera area. I think people were complaining about shadowed pictures and video due to the tight camera cut out. They widened it to ensure the new 8MP camera with not be hindered by a design flaw.First, the defender technically provides more protection than the commuter and also comes with a handy holster with a clip. However, the defender is bulky and the port covers do not stay as well as the model for the 3GS. Also, I am not a fan of the defender because of the screen protector it comes with. Eventually, particles of dust or grit will work their way into your case and be sandwiched between the screen and the hard plastic film. Then, friction from your finger will scratch the screen up pretty bad (this happened to me). To make matters worse, I put a Zagg shield on it and it basically fused with the screen protector on the defender. I needed to pry the phone off the case and, while doing so, lifted the glass of the phone, creating permanant air pockets in my screen. Not a good scenario at all. The anti-glar films sold at the apple store, however, work fine because they have a smoother, less sticky surface. I would not reccomend this case at all, though, without these screen protectors because without a screen protector, air bubbles will form and distort your view and scratches on the screen will occur. But, if you work construction or another potentially hazardous job, this case with the anti-glare screen protectors may be a better choice then the Commuter series of cases.The Commuter, on the other hand, offers a balance between versitility and protection. With this case, I can use my Zagg shield and is not peeled up by the case like many do. Also, I love the soft shell on the inside and the hard shell outside. The soft inner allows the port and button covers to be attached to the case and function propperly. This also helps absorb shock. The hard shell allows the phone to slide in and out of pockets very easily, even out of tighter jeans. In addition, it has a much thinner profile than the defender but still provides adequate protection. The ports are still protected from water and it can take a tumble.

The hard shell allows the phone to slide in and out of pockets very easily, even out of tighter jeans.

"Protecting a $200 phone is quite a formidable task and a lot of cell phone case companies do not seem to understand protection. They strive for style, design, and aesthetics. To me, this is all nonsense. Otterbox understands the principle of protection better than any other company making these types of products. Fuction is what I am looking for and and this company produces fuctioning cell phone cases. These 4S generation cases share an improved design, mainly with the camera area. I think people were complaining about shadowed pictures and video due to the tight camera cut out. They widened it to ensure the new 8MP camera with not be hindered by a design flaw.First, the defender technically provides more protection than the commuter and also comes with a handy holster with a clip. However, the defender is bulky and the port covers do not stay as well as the model for the 3GS. Also, I am not a fan of the defender because of the screen protector it comes with. Eventually, particles of dust or grit will work their way into your case and be sandwiched between the screen and the hard plastic film. Then, friction from your finger will scratch the screen up pretty bad (this happened to me). To make matters worse, I put a Zagg shield on it and it basically fused with the screen protector on the defender. I needed to pry the phone off the case and, while doing so, lifted the glass of the phone, creating permanant air pockets in my screen. Not a good scenario at all. The anti-glar films sold at the apple store, however, work fine because they have a smoother, less sticky surface. I would not reccomend this case at all, though, without these screen protectors because without a screen protector, air bubbles will form and distort your view and scratches on the screen will occur.

"REVIEWThe three joint nutrients work together to improve joint health.  I have a lot of pain in my hip and leg joints.  It already seems that the vitamin is working.The glucosamine sulfate is bound to potassium chloride to improve stability and has a ratio of 5:4 along with the chondroitin sulfate.

"REVIEWHow many of us have been hurt while in love?  This is a good story of opening oneself up after being hurt.  Since the death of his wife, Leif has withdrawn and become a total loner.  He puts himself into his work to avoid the pain.  himself in work instead.  A town history mural is to be painted in Heartlandia by Marta.  After being with a man for five years, they broke up because he wasn't interested in being a daddy.  She plans to concentrate on her baby and her art.  Nothing to do with any guy.I felt so bad for Leif that he has all this pain being such a good man.  I imagine there are a lot of readers out there that feel that pain of loosing someone they love through death. Leif is paying for the town's mural and the artist is ggoing to live in his home.  He didn't have any idea she was going to be stunningly beautiful and he found himself attracted to her.Once he finds out about her pregnancy, the protective side of him comes out.She was attracted to Leif but just couldn't fall in love and go through what she went through before.  It just hurts too much.  She finally saw past the loner and saw the loving, caring man inside that hurt exterior.  Leif gradually realizes he like Marta's company in his home.  Does Leif want Marta like he wanted his wife?  Could Leif let go of the hurt and the loneliness?  Could the two of them let go of the past and find a future together?  The author gave the reader a lot of emotions to fit in and go through with the characters.  A lot of it feels so real since so many of us have gone through or are going through what Leif and Marta have.The ending was sort of a surprise and I really enjoyed it.  It was about the pirate trunks and how they effected the town.  Everyone deals with things in a different way.I was given a complimentary copy of Falling-for the Mom-To-Be from the author, Lynne Marshall for my view of the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSQ4T6OFR351L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=037365894X#wasThisHelpful","RSQ4T6OFR351L","A2XOT42O1AJ4GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOT42O1AJ4GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"REVIEWThe retractable Dog Leash is 16 ft in length.  For dogs up to 40-50 pounds.  When you use this product  you can't put the cable clamp near your head or face  In order to avoid the cable of bracket being damage, do not tug the leash while attached to your pet.  To prevent cuts burns or even other problems, do not let the rope or webbing wrap around your body or fingers.  Do not try to disassemble this product.  It has a pre-wound spring that may cause injury when opening.The handle is ergonomically designed and fits fine since I have a small hand.  My dog learned very fast to walk right beside me on his own.  To put the leash in a lock position is really easy, just press down on the black button and press towards the handle to keep it locked.  The sound it made when it retracted was rather loud and my dog was a little spooked from it.  All in all this one of the best retractable dog leashes I have seen.  I've had several that after a couple walks with the dog they wouldn't retract any more.  This one seems to be durable and quality made.

The photo on Amazon shows the color to be true and it is pretty up close.  Most of the costume wigs are real shiny but this wig had a matte finish.  There was a problem with the front of the wig.  There were no adjustable straps, so it kept slipping down.  I would like it better if the hair was a little thicker at the crown.  It is rather thin.  My niece loves it.

"reviewA dangerous gunman is holding Dr. Mark Baker and Nurse Kelly Atkinson.  Everyone in the emergency room could possibly die.  By nightfall, three men are dead.  Mark had tried to save the police officer who died but he failed.  The other two dead men were members of the Zeta drug cartel.  Killing is not over despite the standoff is,  Drug Cartels hold grudges and don't forget.  When one of their members die, revenge is in the waiting.  Through all of this, Mark is under suspicion as a killer and yet he is still a potential victim.  He looks to his high school sweetheart, Gwen Woodruff but she is trying to hide her own feelings for the doctor.  The author gives the reader three questions to find answers to.  So as you turn those pages, try to find the answers.  1. Who is the shooter? 2.  Who will the next victim be?  3.  Can Mark prove himself innocent before the gun is in his face.?  The book is very well written and gives some interaction as to how drug cartels respond when death faces their group.  Will there be romance for Gwen and Mark?  That is if Mark survives and the real gunman is found.  I would recommend this book to everyone.  It's a good murder mystery for anyone who loves that type of genre. You won't get bored because the suspense will keep you on the edge of your chair until the end.  When you get to the end, you'll want more.I was given a complimentary copy of FATAL TRAUMA from the author Richard L.

"REVIEWI didn't have the faintest idea what MCT oil is.  I did a little research and MCT stands for medium chain triglycerides.  Medium chain fatty acids have a tremendous health benefit and are in coconut oil and goat's milk.  Coconut oil is natural while MCT is produced.  The oil is made into ketones, that are used as fuel for your brain.  It also helps burn fat,  control your cholesterol levels and helps with immunity and absorption of nutrients.It is odorless and tasteless and unlike coconut oil, it remains a liquid.  The very main reason for MCT oil is weight loss and gaining of energy.  It is a supplement.  You can add like a tablespoon to your coffee, smoothie, you can use the oil added with vinegar as a salad dressing.

They are a source of vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein and antioxidants.  They're not milk chocolate flavor but almost a bitter dark chocolate flavor.They are unsweetened and all natural.  I was just a bit disappointed because I do like my milk chocolate, like Hershey bars. It's good to try something different so I just decided to snack on a few.

"REVIEW If you enjoy an interesting Christmas story, this book would be great for you and your children.  This book isn't your normal children's book with a hard cover and 30 pages.  It is paperback and 198 wonderful pages.  A Chapter book, no less. I found it rather cute that the story was told from the sweater  herself, her name Sophie.  It's rather strange but I found myself relating  and getting to know the sweater in all kinds of ways.  Sophie writes down her daily events since so much happened in December.  She is separated from her family, gets to be a model and is looked at a lot.  Even though Sophie goes through a lot of disappointments, she struggles and learns to  get through it all with the  help of her  ""family"".  She finds ways to stay happy.  The author wrote a heart warming novel that is meant for little ones, tweens, YA and those not so young at heart.  There are a lot of lessons to learn from this novel.  There are a lot of emotions in this book too that everyone can relate to. If you're having a bad day and are down, if you are worried about something then this book should be on your shelf so you can go pick it up and do a little reading.  You will feel better.You can't help but love Sophie.

"REVIEW This book is the third in the series of six.  The author's series Journey of the Heart has been releasing each month since March.  The books are short and easy to read.  When you finish the book, you can't wait to get to the next book.  If you are short on time, these books are great.  Doesn't take long to read and still get your work done. One of the characters that made me wonder was Ben Croftner.  It seems like he gets away with anything he does, evil and wrong.  He never gets deserved punishment.  Rand has a relationship with Sarah and I would get so upset with Rand.  The author wrote this story as though it were real life.

The item is made of TPU material and will keep your Apple Watch from being scratched and nicked.It's not too thick that it will interfer with buttons nor so thin it would tear.  Since it is chrystal clear it doesn't interfer with reading the watch.  It fits nicely and the buttons on the side can be accessed easily. So far I have found that this is a nice little cover for the Apple Watch.

"REVIEW The author gave the reader so much in the fast paced, complicated read.  Chameleon was a true joy to read.  A little longer than what I normally like.  There was so much, woven webs, twists and turns, love, supernatural, good against evil and MORE!  WOW!  That's a lot to keep a reader stuck to the chair.  Never a dull moment.  To start with, it was Danielle/Dani's birthday and Russ, her best friend pulled off a prank.  This cause all the weirdness to come out.  The reader finds out the Russ isn't who he seems to be and neither is Dani.  This is where life becomes a thrill ride.  The story is quite complex and yet the author never lets you get lost.  You never have to re-read a few pages to get back on track.  The author added a love triangle to put in a little pizazz.  The author wrote a story where you get caught up with the character's lives.  It's almost like you are there with them.  Everything the author added to this interesting read made a perfect paced story.  I  would recommend this book to anyone.  It's a well written story with lots to keep your interest and your eyes on your book.I was given a complimentary copy of CHAMELEON from the author, Kelly Oram for my view of the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA57OP6V6D5WK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJVQ6AU#wasThisHelpful","RA57OP6V6D5WK","A2XOT42O1AJ4GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOT42O1AJ4GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"REVIEW Although this book is not the solution, it can help quite a bit to give direction to the newly assigned manager.  The ideas are very straightforward of which  maybe not totally understood, can be learned.  To totally understand the ideas, they must be applied.  There is never a simple no substitute for experience.  This book is only a starter, a primer, it covers the basics, purpose and goals to the final details.  This book can help a lot to reduce the anxiety of facing a promotion. The book is like a jump start and has some very good starting ideas.  By no means is this book a total solution. As said before.  There is no substitute for experience.  Use the book as an aide for ideas to apply for that new promotion that may be coming up.

"REVIEW Any little one is always trying to reach things that they are too little to reach, light switches, shelves and counter tops.  When they can't reach them, they try using their toys to stand on.  Usually this ends in a crying little one.  They could fall and get hurt.  Usually what they try to stand on is very unstable.  I feel that the iHomeSet mini small folding stepping stool can be a safe way for the little ones to carry around (there is a handle that folds down) and use when they can't reach something.  It is a good, safe way for children to reach the sink to wash and brush their teeth.  This stool is even strong enough for adults.  A nice part of the stool is that it's design folds which makes it easy to store wherever such as closets, under the bed, in the care or just in a corner.  The built in handles makes it easy for little ones to carry around and the non skid top keeps them from slipping off the stool.  Small but handy.

"REVIEW When I read the title I immediately thought of Alice in Wonderland.  I thought this is going to be a good fantasy read.  It is alike in some ways.  There is a big secret that is hidden by the boys and girls that live in separate orphanages. This is a huge secret.  Then Kitty comes into the picture and she's pretty smart.  She got to be friends with some of the girls and learns how the secret came to them and why they held on to it.  This is definitely a different read. The author wrote at a fast pace and those pages are turning as fast as the reader can.  The author is definitely a good writer and very talented.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, especially a twist on fantasy.  This will be put on my shelf to be read again.Looking forward to her next book.

"REVIEWThe author, John Spencer Yantiss wrote a wonderful, old fashioned detective murder mystery. Two life changing events, only to be done away with, were an all natural childbirth over two decades ago, the other three were murders and one was an attempted slaying.  The book is intriguing and  interesting. The beginning is  Eleanor Harkness visiting detectiveSherrod Reynard Colsne and his confidant, Montague Boyd 'Monty' Weston.  They lived in the New York City, ""Granite Palace"".  They meet to discuss finding her father's killer.The book spans many years and continents over just 4 days.  Monty writes from his point of view.  During the story other murders take place and the true mystery is who the true killer is.  The author allows the reader to be there as there are detailed sights and sounds of New York, Europe and India.  The author apparently did a lot of research and travel to give the reader his believable story withcharacters you feel you know.If you are a murder/mystery lover, I would recommend this to anyone who loves fine story lines that end up wrapped up in a consistent manner.

The author gave the characters such personalities and they fit in the story as though original and real.  The book isn't just words but a visual picture of the story which is very different than most authors. The book kept me interested all the way through the pages until the end. The author gave the reader plenty of woven webs, twists and turns and a lot of events that kept the book exciting.  I would recommend this book to any reader.

"REVIEW This book, Macabre 2 is two very short stories centered around detective Sherrod Reynard (which means fox in French) Colsne and his side kick Monty Weston. Mr. Yantiss uses these names as they make the reader recall Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. The first story is about a strange weerwolf  (Dutch spelling)and the second story is about a mysterious series of human and animal deaths.  These are set in today's world.  Living in a large Manhattan brownstone, Colsne and Weston seem to be bachelors, wealthy and have associations with the New York society's upper crust. All the characters are as if they were living in 1880.  Neither mystery is the same.  The Weerwolf is obviously a supernatural story while the other is more of a standard mystery. The book was an OK read but I don't think I would read it again.  I think the reason why is that they were too short for the reader to really get their thoughts into it.I was given a complimentary copy of MACABRE 2 from the author, John Spencer Yantiss for my view of the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19IL5ZDHMN6TA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481088378#wasThisHelpful","R19IL5ZDHMN6TA","A2XOT42O1AJ4GD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOT42O1AJ4GD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"REVIEWThis story was written after the novel MURDER BY BEQUEST whichh was Book 1 but happened before the first book. Setting 2003, Florida.  Colsne received a message from his friend Sir Guy Hugo de May, Marquis of Maubrey. Sir guy and his associates became a little leary when they came down with gastroenteritis.  This happened while working on a top secret communications and tracking system. That same day Colsne and Monty, his side kick were to leave.  In Florida Monty was drugged, saved by a doctor and a murder took place.  This book is written in first person by Monty who resided in the ""granite Palace"" in New York City. This characters are top class such as butlers and all the servants that upper class citizens have.  The author did a good job of writing this short mystery.  The reader will find himself asking if they knew who the perpetrator is,As the end nears we still don't know who drugged Monty.  We know who brought him the coffee, but was it him or the murderer?  The books don't need to be read in order.  The author wrote a wonderful mystery that leaves the reader wondering and trying to figure out who the murderer is and who drugged Monty.

"I have been using this moisturizing Plasma Cream from MediDerm for about a week now along with the Caviar Serum. I love how how silky smooth this creme leaves my skin super silky smooth after use.This creme comes in a wide mouth 1.7oz goegeous jar. The jar is classy and elegant and looks amazing sitting along my vanity. When you open it, it is literally filled to the brim, which is something I love seeing as other similar products do not completely fill their jars. The cream  is very thick, but not heavy if that makes any since. A tiny bit goes a long ways so don't waste this by using too much. When I apply it it spreads easily and evenly on to my skin and absorbs quickly. I love that there is not a heavy greasy feeling or sticky residue left behind. My skin is left looking and felling supple and well hydrated through out the day.The only thing I do not like about this cream is the fragrance. Fragrance annoys me in general, but often irritates my skin and eyes as well. Luckily I have not had any irritation from the fragrance, but would love to see them eliminate it to keep it more natural.Promotional product pricing received for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ULYZ0LLNV963/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMK98D0#wasThisHelpful","R3ULYZ0LLNV963","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm going to be 35 in a couple of months, So I have become slightly addicted to making sure I take extra special care of my face. When I had the opportunity to try MediDerms Extrait de Caviar Luxury Cellular Firming Concentrate I jumped in. I was super excited to try a product that contains caviar, as to me it says luxury, class, top of the line.What I like about this face serum is that it is an actual serum, not gel or cream. Just a tiny bit goes a long way which will make this 1oz bottle last for a really long time. The serum is light and silky but effective, not heavy and greasy like others I have used in the past. It absorbs quickly and does not irritate my skin.I gave this serum 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons. Once applied and absorbed it felt like I had a slightly sticky residue left before applying the Hydra Cream I received to use along with the caviar serum. The stickiness does go away after using the cream, but if used with out the cream I wouldn't be happy with that feeling. Also it has fragrance. I don't typically care for fragrance in my face products as it can be at times irritating to skin and eyes.I do like this Cavier serum when used with the Plasma Hydra cream and it seems to be working well in keeping my skin looking youthful and glowing. Also, it only takes about half a pump of product to cover the entire face so it's going to last a long time.Promotional product pricing received for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27IN27YQHSRII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMK9EOS#wasThisHelpful","R27IN27YQHSRII","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These roasting forks are a huge upgrade from the flimsy sticks we used when I was a kid for sure! This 10pack of roasting forks is perfect for my family and then some. We often have neighbor kids over for BBQs and it has always been a challenge to find enough sticks for everybody. Now, we can roast 20 hotdogs, marshmallows or what ever else they come up with all at once . No more having to impatiently wait and take turns to make that ooey gooey smore.These roasting fork are a nice length of 3feet making it safer compared to a stick for children to roast their own. What I like most is since its metal the fork will not go up in flames until a dry stick would. It has a nice contoured plastic handle making it easy for anybody to grip. These roasting forks clean up super easy when done and have a loop at the end of the handle so you can hang them up out of the way.

"I am no stranger when it comes to adult toys. I've owned many different shapes, sizes , ect. What I really like about the King Kong from Adams Gift is the shape size, variety of speed and pulses and material. Most toys I've had only met one or two of these.The King Kong is the ideal size. Most people assume bigger is better but for me that simply isn't true. I personally prefer ""average"" length and girth. The King Kong definitely meet a the average size standards and make s it perfect fit.The wave design is a first for me. But I have come to really like it. With the tip curving up, it makes it ideal for g-spot stimulation. Also the other waves through the shaft makes it a more comfortable and enjoyable fit  hitting all the ideal spots.I really like the silicone covering on this toy. Whether you use lubricant or not, it stays soft and smooth and never gets sticky making it easy to glide over your delicate areas.The power/selection button is located toward the base making it easy to access. Changing vibrations is as simple as a quick touch of the button. There are 7 variations to choose from making it easy to find one that suits you mood. I've come to have a love hate relationship with the button. I like that it is conveniently located and quick to go through the various modes. At the same time, it can be quite frustrating when in the heat of the moment you accidentally tap that button causing you to frantically cycle through to that pleasure speed.This toy requires 2AAA batteries which are not included with the purchase. Make sure to have some on hand for its arrival and for back up as you'll for sure need them.As you have read this toy has many many benefits and only one con. Its definitely worth adding to you collection.

"This has been great for my sensitive acne prone skin. I am literally thrilled with this face wash from perfect body harmony.This cleanser is thinner than I had anticipated. With that said just a pea sized amount cleanses my face completely with mixed with water. It lathers nicely and makes washing simple. It has a very natural herbal scent to it which reaffirms the natural organic statements. On thing I did notice is you really want to rinse well. One night after cleansing I was in a hurry and did not rinse well. It does leave skin dry and tight if not rinsed well.Since using this product the only breakouts I have suffered is due to monthly hormonal changes. If it could rid of those as well this would be the perfect cleanser for all!So to sum it up this cleanser works well and helps clear and prevent acne, only takes a small drop to effectively cleanse making it last a very long time, and is natural and gentle for sensitive skin.

"I take foot care very seriously. I think it has something to do with one of my childhood babysitters big nasty dried up crusty feet with thick long over grown toe nails wedged into the 80s rainbow flip flops while strutting around in her moo moo. That image is forever burned into my head and tops the list of most disturbing memories.A good foot cream is an essential item in any foot care routine. That's why I was excited to try this Dead Sea Mineral Foot Cream from LeliaSea. This foot cream tops the list of luxury foot creams. This Dead Sea Mineral foot care is very thick and creamy as a good foot cream should be. It is white in color and has a soft light scent that is not overwhelming at all.The foot cream goes a long way. Though its thick, just a pea sized amount moisturizes an entire foot. It glides on in to a silky smooth finish and absorbs quickly. Since it only takes just a pea size for each foot, this 1.7oz tube will last for a very long time even with daily use.

"I love these food containers! Recently in an effort to save money for a down payment on a new home I have been cutting out all unnecessary expenses such as eating out  5 times a week for lunch. These 2 compartment food storage containers are perfect for for storing last nights left overs for todays lunch.These containers are both dishwasher and microwave safe. This is important because most of my meals require heating before consuming. So far I have heated everything from soup to spaghetti to chili in these containers and not once have I experienced the staining and melting bubbling plastic issue I have with other containers.  This is a good quality as food containers are expensive if you are constantly having to replace them.My favorite thing about these containers is the lid. Sounds silly but there is a reason for it. I don't carry a lunch box or bag. Instead I just through it in my extra large purse and go as I always have other things I'm toting in my hands, arms and mouth as well (I have 3 kids I drive to school every morning just picture it). These lids stay on securely and do not allow liquid to leak. The first time I threw one in my purse with soup not even thinking about it until I got to work to put it in the fridge, immediate panic kicked in. I carry my iPad, Samsung Note 4, camera and tons of other expensive stuff in my purse at all times. I was sooooo relieved to see not a single drop escaped from that container and my hundreds of dollars in electronics and makeup were completely safe.The lids also allow for stacking of the containers in the fridge with out the worry they will slide off and spill.

"I love a spa treatment, but I can't afford to go to a spa. Mainly because the closest one is 2 hours away and well that drive home would defeat the purpose anyway. I had the opportunity to try the Muddy Face mud mask and after reviewing the listed ingredients, I though I would give it a try. I love natural organic skin care products and this definitely fit the bill.The Muddy Face mud mask from Perfect Body Harmony comes premixed so you don't have to do the messy work. Just open the jar and apply. This Mask is super thick. I personally use a a fan brush to apply most mud masks to get even application over my whole face. When this arrived all of my fan brushes apparently ran away so I had to resort to traditional finger tip method. I was surprised when I applied this mask how easily it spread across my face. A little bit goes a long way and you can even a a few drops of water if needed to suit your personal preferences. It did not take long for the mask to dry. The directions say to leave on for 10-15 minutes then wash off.As the mask sat I could feel the mask tighten as it dried. I love that feeling as it makes me feel like its actually working. This mask is suppose to remove all the nasty dirt and grime build up and exfoliate the skin as well. When I rinsed of the mask I could actually see the difference. My face was more radiant and had a nice glow to it. The mask did not dry out my skin as others have been known to do which for me is important at the ripe age of 34 as we all know hydrated skin looks younger than dried up skin. I also like that I could not smell any perfumey scents from this mask. In fact it did not have any kind of smell to it.In the end I have to conclude that this Muddy Face mud mask from Perfect Body Harmony is well worth the money. It leaves skin clean, exfoliated, bright and hydrated.I received promotional pricing for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VKNW4ZGDYTUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5JZDI6#wasThisHelpful","R3VKNW4ZGDYTUT","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This layered necklace from Glamour Jewelry is even more gorgeous in person than the pictures.One of my favorite features of this necklace is that it is adjustable up to four inches in length. The closure clasp is solid and easy to operate as well which is ideal for me as I have severe nerve damage in my right hand.This necklace has 3 layers which lay perfectly with out tangling. Each strand is a little bit different in design but complement each other beautifully. This necklace is great for pairing with that little black dress or you favorite fall sweater and jeans.The quality is high. This necklace is very strong and sturdy. I actually got mine caught on a recliner handle at work and surprisingly the necklace held together rather than busting apart.Overall I would say this necklace is high quality and absolutely gorgeous.

"Having dry skin due to my hypothyroidism is a constant battle. No matter how much I hydrate from the inside with water I constantly have dry flaky skin.This dead Sea Mineral Body Lotion for Lelia Sea is amazingly hydrating when first applied leaving my skin hydrated. The lotion is not very thick like a cream but a slightly thinner more fluid like. Despite the thinner formula, a little bit does go a long way and hydrates my skin for about 8 hours then I have to reapply again. It spreads evenly with out effort and absorbs quickly with out leaving the greasy sticky residue behind.This lotion has a slight floral scent to it thay does linger a bit. Many people like that but I personally prefer unscented lotions as most scents tend to give me migraines.This lotion comes in a 1.7 oz squeezable tube making dispensing simple. It is also the perfect size for carrying in your purse and travel. I do feel that the price for this product is a bit much for the amount you are getting. And since it doesn't keep me moisturized from morning until bed it wouldn't be practical for me.Promotional product provided for inspection and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZYP7JCX6QHNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLCVE5E#wasThisHelpful","R2ZYP7JCX6QHNN","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These ankle boots are absolutely adorable! By far one my favorite pair in my current collection of footwear. I specifically got he Kahki color to go with a fall dress I have, but these will go with just about any outfit. I love that these are dressy enough to wear with a dress or skirt yet still casual enough to wear with jeans and a cute top.The fit on these is spot on. My shoe size ranges from an 8 up to a 9 depending on the shoe but an average of 8.5, which is what I ordered. I do have a slightly wider foot than average so it they are a bit tight on the pinky toe, but hopefully should be fine once I get them broke in a bit more.one thing I really like is the side zipper. The zipper helps to ensure a good fit so the boots don't flop and slide when you walk. I've had other boots that were pull on and we're too loose around the ankle causing nasty, painful blisters, these do not do that.Another feature I like is the decorative yet functional side buckle. It helps dress up the boot with out going overboard and will also aid to a tighter fit if needed.The sole on the boot is slip resistant which is important to me. Having 3 herniated disks in my lower back I can't risk another fall. The heel is nice and wide, with out being too wide adding stability as well. The height of the heel is perfect for me as I am only 5'2"" tall. I can actually look my husband in the eye for a change.The over all Construction of the boots is spot on. The material is nice not cheap, and the stitching looks to be perfect.Over all I am very happy with these boots. They fit right, they can be dressy or casual and they are well made.Promotional product pricing received in exchange for inspection and honest unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q1I69GW7SWPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0124FVHE6#wasThisHelpful","R2Q1I69GW7SWPN","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally a beard balm my husband actually likes. I have purchased several other brands for him in the past only for him to decide he didn't like it due to its greasy feeling. This Leven Rose Beard Balm is made from all natural ingredients which is something I love. I've been slowly replacing all of our traditional skin, hair and body items with all natural products in a transition to a healthier lifestyle. This is the perfect fit.My husband loves how this balm feels. It's not greasy or heavy like the ones he's tried before. It leaves his normally thick coarse wild beard and mustache soft and manageable. Which is a plus for me as the stiff hairs are no longer poking me when he goes to give me a kiss. He says his skin feels more hydrated and is no longer itchy and dry compared to before he started using the balm. He really likes the over all design of the packaging. It's a convenient tin which makes it easy to get just the right amount of the balm. The sleek design is manly and easy to transport when traveling.Overall my husband is actually please with this beard balm.

"This has to be the most gorgeous corset in my current collection. I love the black lace over the pink. Unfortunately I will not get to enjoy this and will have to gift it to a family member. After reading others reviews they all stated that this ran quite small so I ordered a couple sizes up. I typically wear a size Large to x-large in most items, so I ordered a xxxl for this corset based of others reviews and found that for me, my normal size would have been sufficient for proper fitting. Not only that, the tops and bottoms of the corset have some elastic to allow for some give if needed.Now onto the corset quality and construction. After inspecting the corset I observed very nice, quality stitching through out the entire corset. The seams and stitching are straight and there is not any loose, stray or messy strings floating around. The hook and eye closures appear to be sewn in place well. Since I can't test it by wearing it I decided to go about it in an unconventional way. After hooking all closures along the loosest setting I stood on one side of the corset and pull the other side up to see just how well this will hold together. This poor thing was put under alot of stress and it still held together. Very impressive! This corset will definitely be able to hold more than it should so if you do happen to get 3 sizes smaller than you should have, no fear the corset won't unexpectedly burst open.One thing I do want to point out is the description states it's steel boned. While there are some plastic bones it's certainly not steel.  Possible typo bust still great product.Over all I find this corset to be of great quality and my dear friend is going to be one lucky gal when I give his to her.Promotional product pricing provided for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TCRFS69ALD4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010LBDP4K#wasThisHelpful","R1TCRFS69ALD4P","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh my gosh I LOVE this Apple watch stand. As a gadget geek, naturally I have a smart watch. Now, while my smart watch is not an apple brand, it is a smart watch none the less that requires charging.

"I I've been using this hyaluronic acid serum for about a week twice a day. Now, I don't use it to reverse again as I have been using similar serums for quite some time and I am only 34.

There is not any stick icky residue as other serums I have used leave behind. My skin feels more refreshed and my complexion is brighter as well.

It's almost the size of my laptop screen which is pretty awesome in my opinion.The quality of the PVC pro mouse pad from Sentey is far above other mouse pads I have used.

"This Sentey 2800mah power bank is awesome. Being that I often carry an Ipad, my Samsung galaxy Note3 phone and a small tablet all at the same time, I often find my self needing a quick charge for one of the three items while away from home. The Sentey 2800mah power bank packs quite a bit of power for its tiny size. This is about the size of a lipstick and is triangular shaped with rounded corners. It's super light weight too compared to the other power banks I have used that were similar in size. The Senty 2800 power bank comes nicely packaged in a tiny box, along with a power cord that works with most devices and a convenient carry case. The carry case is an added bonus to me as my previous banks did not have one so I was always searching for the bank, or the cord in the black hole known as my purse. With the carry case its all right there together and fits perfectly in the small front pouch on my purse. This power bank from sentey is super easy to use, just use the enclosed power cord to charge (usb end goes into adaptor the other end plugs into the bank for charging) the bank. Then, (this is the most important part to ensure you get proper use out it) make sure to keep your power bank with you. When your phone, camera, tablet ect starts screaming at you to charge your as it's hanging onto one bar of battery life, just plug in the usb end into the bank and connect your dying devise to bring it back from the dead. The best part about this bank, is that it DOES NOT get hot while using it. Thats important. I once had a bank that was so hot it burned my hand. This power bank from Sentey is a great value for the price and I highly recommend it to all my over loaded gadget friends for that emergency life support your dying device may need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GO28BEFZ08CD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHWX2ZW#wasThisHelpful","R3GO28BEFZ08CD","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely LOVE this banana colored High Low Tunic Top with Split in the back I received from Brightly. It not only makes an adorable top to wear to my sales job, but its also just as cute with jeans on lazy Sunday as well. This top works well with palazzo pants, jeans and capris as well offering a large variety of looks. The top is true to it's size. I ordered an XL like I do most tops to fit my larger girls. I typically wear a Large to XL depending on fabric. Cotton like fabrics such as this top I usually get a L, but I wanted to ensure the high low feature didn't leave the front too short. This top was a bit big on me, which means I could have ordered my typical size L instead.The top is made of rayon and spandex making it a soft, breathable top that flows nicely with out clinging to those extra curves you prefer to hide. The scoop neck makes it easy to put on with out stretching and allows for a large variety of jewelry options to be paired with it as well. Also the scoop neck is not too wide unlike many others I have worn that often leave a bra strap showing. The sleeves come just to the elbows which is the perfect length for spring in my personal opinion.One of my favorite features of this tunic top from Brightly Essentials is the high low design of the top. I am a short gal at only 5ft 2 inches and the high low design helps make my legs appear longer. The front comes just below the hip line while the back and side nicely drape to the upper thigh level.I have to say the split back is my favorite feature overall. The top portion of the back over laps thin slightly splits allowing just enough of the junk in your trunk to appear. this design feature gives this top a sexy, yet modest appeal to it. It reveals just enough to get the imagination going I also like the split back because it allows for great air flow. This is important for me as I am very warm natured and finding clothes that are this breathable while still being modest is next to impossible.After washing and drying my Brightly Essentials High Low Tunic Top with split back I was please to know that all of the high quality stitching stayed intact, the color did not fade, and the size remained the same. One thing you do want to keep in mind is that if you happen to leave your top in the dryer over night, you will either want to turn the dryer on for a few minutes, or get out the iron as the fabric does crease and hold wrinkles. Fortunately they wrinkles come out very easily and quickly unlike other fabrics.Over all this top is high quality, well made top that will last. Best of all it is so versatile it can be worn in a professional environment dressed up with jewelry and heels or a more casual relaxed look with jeans, capris or shorts and sandalsPromotional pricing recieved for the purpose of inspection and honest unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CA9WN8C7KZ50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VF2QXEE#wasThisHelpful","R2CA9WN8C7KZ50","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this bathmat! It is too stinkin cute in my bathroom. My twin daughters love it so much they often snatch it and take it to their room as a regular floor matt. The top of the mat has a spongey texture to it when you stand on it which allows you to not slip when stepping out of the shower. I'm not sure what the material is that it is made of, but it has a plastic like feel to it, but absorbs the water keeping it off the floor. The rubber backing on it keeps the mat in place even on my slippery tile flooring. The mat has not had any funky mildew smells form like many other cotton bath mats do.

"My husband loves the extra energy this gives him when he adds one scoop of powder to his 12 oz bottle of water before his work out.  By nature, sinc he was a kid my husband has always lacked energy to do much of anything out side of going to work. He constantly consumes those 5 hr energy drinks and tweekers up to 5 a day with really no results. Since he started taking this in its place he has noticed a real change in the way he feels. The added energy motivates him to get up off the sofa and actually use that gym membership I have been paying for the past year. He really likes the fruit punch flavor and said that this does not have that vitamin taste like the other stuff he had been taking. He said it reminds him of a liquid sweat tart. Another thing he noticed is that when he worked out to him it felt like his muscles got more of a work out. I'm not sure how that works, but that is what he said. He also noticed a slight tingle after drinking this when he did not work out as if the muscles were working harder than normal. The added energy lasts about 6 hours for him when not going to the gym, and about 4 hours after the gym.

"I recieved this product in exchange for an honest unbiased review. Sadly this bubble blower quality is not good at all. Right out of the packaging the  bubble solution that was included was leaking. Despite the leaky bubble solution, we decided to have some fun with the bubble blower. We screwed on the container of solution to the front where the suction tube was and noticed that the solution bottle, even though screwed in all the way would leak solution everywhere. Next thing we noticed was when my daughter tried to pull the trigger the ""mouth"" that opens to make the bubble would not open. Not even a little. I decided to manually try and open the mouth with my hands and that made something pop, allowing the trigger to work. Once we got this accomplished, I put in brand new batteries so we could turn on the fan so we could get the super big bubbles this product claims to make. Another disappointment. After several minutes of holding the mouth open allowing the fan to blow, there were not any bubbles blown. The little fan just doesn't low hard enough to create bubbles.

"I was actually really impressed with this foaming leather cleaner! I have a pair of black and white wing tip DOC Marten low cut shoes and they are always filthy from work. Being that the are hard to find (it took me 4 years to find them in my size 8 womens), my absolute favorite shoes, and very expensive I didn't want to use anything on them that could cause them to crack being that they are leather. This foaming cleaner removed  a years worth of dirt and grime so easily. Best of all it brought back the natural shine making them look brand new with the exception of the crease. The leather also feels soft and hydrated which is important for leather products as they are like human skin and need moisture. The scent was pleasant and clean. There was not any left over dull residue left on my shoes either. I also took this to work to try on a genuine top grain leather sofa we have and was completely impressed at the ability to clean and not leather residue as well. I personally now recommend this product to my customers who purchase leather furniture from me. Not only do you get a very large bottle for the price you pay, but since it just takes a little to go a long way this is going to last for quite some time too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33SP7D8YMTQK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWB25J4#wasThisHelpful","R33SP7D8YMTQK0","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a great way to strengthen your vah-jay-jay. I have always been one to do my Kegel exercises ever since the horrid stories my child birth class nurse told us 14 yrs ago while I was pregnant with my son. Needless to say, I am well toned down below because of my exercise routine. These Kegal beads can add even more strength down under than just Kegal exercises. One trick I learned is to attach some weights to the looped end and just hold it as long as you can. Don't make the mistake I did and try 5lbs the first time. That darn weight, beads and all will come crashing down to your toes. Instead start with about a half a pound. Doesn't sound like much but it's harder than you'd think even with a man clamp like mine. I am sure there are an endless amount of uses for these beads, but if you're looking to tighten that baby up this is the way to go.These beads have a total of 2 beads attached to a string. At the end of the beads the sting is looped for easy removal, or for adding, what ever for extra weight or pleasure. The beads feel like a plastic material. Only issue I have to complain about is the seam where the beads are put together seems to scratch a bit when removing as if not fully together. That concerns me as that could lead to bacteria and funk growth if you do not properly clean your items. Other than that they are great.Promotional pricing recieved for the purpose of inspection and review","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EHLYM5WODKBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZ9FNE4#wasThisHelpful","R2EHLYM5WODKBH","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This minor hat is too much fun! When it arrived yesterday while I was at work, my husband of all people thought he should sport it. I like the fact that this hat has an adjustable plastic clip on the inside. It makes it fit the fat heads like my husband or the smaller head of a child. My twinikies love the working light feature. They have fought over who gets to were the hat while the other ""digs for gold"" in their ""mine"" a.k.a. blanket fort. The light has an one/off button on the back so when the children aren't ""mining gold"" their batteries don't die.The light does require 2 AA batteries that are not included. I am needing to order more of these so my little minions will no longer fight over the one we have.I live in the middle of tornado alley. So having these play hats around will also come in handy should we get hit with a tornado. The working light feature will help us see in the event we loose power. Plus the little bit of extra protection on the noggin is always a plus. I know these aren't real safety hats, but in the middle of a nasty storm you grab what you can and lets face it children always have toys easily accessible and something is better than nothing.Promotional introductory pricing received for the purpose of inspection and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17B7RTFW2YUAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUJPGWK#wasThisHelpful","R17B7RTFW2YUAR","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Good bye stale ruffles! My kids (even the 35 yr old I'm married to) are ALWAYS forgetting to put a clip on chips. Leaving them open to only be stale by morning. But since getting this hand dandy kitchen gadget my beloved ruffles stay fresh and crispy for my enjoyment. It's so easy to use too. Just trim the bag, then slide the sealer across.. thats it. Youre done. some how it seals the bag shut. Looks like it melts the bag but the sealer never gets hot. I like that idea as I have kids so this is safe for even them. I also like that the back has a magnet. Makes it perfect to store on the fridge for quick easy find. Best of all this actually comes with the 2 batteries needed for it to work. I love that!  Good quality works well. Only thing is you want to make sure to trim the excess bag off or you'll have gaps and folds in the seal.Promotional product received for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PWW7ILZ426V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHK7M9M#wasThisHelpful","R3PWW7ILZ426V8","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using these for about a month now. I was real excited about these brushes and I have to have squeaky clean teeth. MY OCD says so. The idea behind these are great hut the results are about the same as any low end tooth brush. I was expecting cleaner teeth over all but in reality I had dirtier teeth. Keep in mind, I have a bit of OCD. So the slightest bit of gunk on my teeth is like siren and flashing lights on there. I went back to my cologate  brush and feel at peace now.Another thing I didn't like about these brushes is that food particles get stuck at the bottom between bristles. Even after rinsing this tooth brush with my high pressure spray nozzle, the junk wouldn't come out from between the bristles.. in had to separate the bristles than physically remove the stuff. This concerns me. Issues like this is a breeding ground for nasty funk to grow.

"Do you have kids? Then you NEED these batteries! These batteries are amazing for several reasons. The most important, and obvious is that they are rechargeable. Any parent knows how expensive batteries are and how often you need to replace the annoying noise making toys batteries. I have 3 kids and we constantly go through batteries almost as quickly as we do toilet paper (please nobody invent reusable toilet paper, thats just nasty). These batteries have already saved me some money. They charge quickly, and they actually last quite some time. I have the SunLabz 16 port charger as well and it works perfectly (thank goodness since its the same brand) with these batteries. I have read that these can be charged 1000 times with no issues. While we haven't even come close to having to charge then that many times, I look forward to the hundreds of dollars that I will now get to keep thanks to these rechargeable (and sanity saving) batteries. in fact from what i can tell so far is that these last longer, charge quicker than the energizer brand we have used in the past.

"This swim suit is GORGEOUS! It's some much brighter and has more color than the picture indicates. Unfortunately for me the top was too small for me due to the large amount of padding so I had to give this away. I would say this would fit a C or B cup rather well, but any bigger than that not likely. But the quality is amazing after examining it. This swim suit has great stitching all the way around it. That is a must on a good quality swim suit as you don't want the stitching coming undone any time soon for sure. I love the over all design. It's stylish, yet functional and will most definitely keep ""the girls"" up. The adjustable removable strap is a nice touch too. It makes custom fitting a bit easier as no two bodies are alike. Also, you don't have to worry about any strings coming undone either thanks to the removable strap either. This top can be worn as a halter style or stapless if you are like me and do not like odd tan lines. Over all this is a really nice suit. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the top is much smaller than expected. Typically I can wear a large top with my DD cup size, but this one due to that amount of push up padding I can not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NK2JQ5WNZCJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCHSJJU#wasThisHelpful","R3NK2JQ5WNZCJJ","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This charger works amazingly. I have used other chargers in my car in the past and this is the only one that I know of that actually detects how much of a charge your phone can receive with out causing damage. I like the fact that it will shut off if it tries to pull to much power or starts to over heat. I've had some in the past that made my phone so hot I could hardly handle it. This hasn't been an issue with this charger. This charger has a nice blue indicator light to let you know that it is working. Thats a plus as it can be disappointing to pick up your phone thinking it has been charged only to see you have less battery power than when you plugged it in. I like that it is sleek and and out of the way too. Nothing is quite like a big bulky charging port sticking out when you have a stick shift vehicle.

"I want to start off by stating I have NEVER had a diffuser before so this is a first for me. But I am sooo happy I decided to get it when I had the chance. Since I don't have any thing to compare it to I'll list the features I like.First off I love the size of this diffuser. Its the size of a large candle and it fits perfectly on our mantle. Even when it isn't on it looks beautiful sitting up there. Next comes all the options you have with this diffuser. The timer options are perfect for us as we are always on the go. I often forget o turn things off so not having to worry about that thanks to the automatic shut off makes it a little less stressful to use. I also like all the color changing light options. Its so relaxing just to sit in a dim room while it is on with some Lavender Essential Oil in it while it cycles through the colors.This Diffuser is super quiet. I don't even realize that it's one if I don't turn the light option on. I am not sure if that is normal for something like this but that is definitely a plus in my book. Also the scent seems to last a long time. I ran this yesterday from the time I left for work until I returned home and I was shocked that the Lavender scent was still present and that the machine still had liquid in it and still going strong.The first time I tried to turn this on I didn't hold the on button as I should have (because for some reason I didn't realize I needed too) So my only advise when it comes to this diffuser is to make sure you hold the button until you hear the beep.I have really enjoyed this diffuser. I would recommend it based of my experience so far and plan to purchase more for my self as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RMI0NIA2X6KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7YEXLM#wasThisHelpful","R1RMI0NIA2X6KM","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These reusable pouches are pretty awesome. I originally decided to review them and then give them away as a baby gift for a friend of mine. But after getting these I realized these are great for kids of most ages. Why? These reusable food pouches are a great idea for smoothies on the go, yogurt, apple sauce, pretty much anything that is messy when you're in a rush. Best of all you can pre-make food and freeze them too.These food pouches from Easy Anywhere are made from thick plastic like material that is durable and flexible. The material is BPA,PVC and Phthalate free. These pouches come in a large 7oz size that is both freezer and dish washer safe. The wide mouth opening makes them easy to fill, and the double zipper closure ensures no messes from accidental spills. Also, the screw on cap over the feeding opening locks on making it more secure as well. These pouches are bright blue in color and have a see through window on the back with measurements so you can see how much food is in the pouch. Cleaning these was supper easy. All I used was a cleaning brush and hot soapy water. No food stuck to the pouch but if you like more convenience you can throw them in the dishwasher as well.Over all these pouches are pretty amazing. They aren't just for toddlers in my opinion, but for any child up to age 10 for on the go snacks and smoothies too. These are sold in a 4 pack at an amazing price of  $13.99 and come with a 100% 90day money back guarantee.Promotional product provided free in exchange for inspection and an honest unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35G28YFV1DB34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5DU1X8#wasThisHelpful","R35G28YFV1DB34","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this product at a special introductory rate for an honest unbiased review and decided to give it a try. I have had high cholesterol since I was in third grade due to bad genes despite an active healthy lifestyle. I also have Hypothyroidism which causes fatigue and frequent migraine headaches After researching CoQ10 benefits I figured this would give this a try. CoQ10 often used for:*Helping treat high blood pressure and heart disease*Enhancing immune system function*Providing an energy boost for people dealing with fatigue*Reducing high cholesterol levels in the blood*Stabilizing blood sugar levels of people with diabetes*Assisting in the treatment of cancer or the protection of organs from toxic chemotherapy drugs*Treating gum disease*Slowing down dementia progression*Preventing or treating migraine headaches .Since I started taking these, I have noticed that I am not as fatigued as usual. This is an amazing felling if you suffer from frequent fatigue as I do. Also, my migraines have reduced in frequency as well. I am really looking forward to the long term benefits of this product.I can not say how, if at all, it has changed my cholesterol as I haven't had any blood work done since I began taking these. But, with the results I have had already, I'm very optimistic.These capsules are easy to swallow and are not too big. There is no funky pill smell like many supplements have which for me makes it easier to take. I really love the fact that you get 9 months use out of one bottle. That makes this an AMAZING value. Over all I have had good results so far in a few areas that I suffer. So for me, I WOULD recommend this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C2MTK0ZZNI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T7KHCM8#wasThisHelpful","R1C2MTK0ZZNI5","A11TAKCIF6QWT8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11TAKCIF6QWT8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having lived through my own brand of second chance romance, I find when I read this type of story line I tend to be harder on characters then other books. I find myself a little judgmental and with a lot less mercy. Normally my harshness is always aimed towards the hero. Why? Because it seems like he always moved on, skirt to skirt, girl to girl.. Non relationship to non relationship before he sees the one he left behind. Then I see the heroine has usually had either nobody at all or very few.. No real moving on being done at all.So yea I was a little nervous when Kristen went this route again. But she took all my preconceived and biased notions and shook them up and sprinkled them over my head and said take that! While technically that's what happened her with Logan ""High"" Judd and Millie Cross. . This time I couldn't place them blame anywhere but at Millies feet. You'd never find a more loving or cherishing hero then the 20 something Logan. He absolutely adored this down to earth girl. Three years of adoration thrown in his face. Her reasons.. Her struggle... Not shared.. She just sent him away and it destroyed him. Two decades go by and then we see her sacrifice. Twenty years late.. The wall comes down. To be honest I was pissed the hell off that Logan didn't get the chance to even fight her demons back then. But I was quickly sucked into one hell of a vortex. The gloves came off and things went a little haywire.This was one hell of a rocky, cruel and nasty.. But strangely erotic dance to get to the beauty in Walk through Fire. Because fire had to be what burned away the guilt and the rage between these too. After the smoke cleared there was an absolutely amazing hero standing and waiting to love and adore Millie exactly and actually more profoundly then ever before. Logan didn't hold grudges, he didn't punish anymore, no he LOVED hard, raw, without reservation. Millie's scars stood no chance against the simple yet immensely healing love of Logan Judd.I find myself highlighting so much when I read this ladies work. This time I simply couldn't stop long enough to do that very often. I still found quite a few favorite parts of course but I found for one, Kristen Ashley is by far still the reigning queen of dialogue, a character talks and you better pay attention because every word uttered is something that can stop your heart or steal your breath. I was dizzy with those physical manifestations of wonder throughout this crazy ride. I was breathless and shaken and never wanted it to stop.I felt every emotion from swooning and all of the biker bada$$ flowery. I felt anger and frustration over the bratty antics of Zadie and absolutely in overload of sweetness for cuddly little kitties. But must of all I felt a healing warmth all the way through my soul, being witness to a couples journey, struggle and rise from the ashes while they  lay the past to rest and enjoy what today brought them.To take what was forged in their fire, and brush it off, make it shine and  cherish it together ..always.Thats a real love story. Because love is forgiving and patient and kind and sacrifices. Both lived it and earned it. 10 million stars for the Queen!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RK8Y28B3ACRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3E76II#wasThisHelpful","R1RK8Y28B3ACRH","A2N58DQ4IL5SHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N58DQ4IL5SHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have wanted Michael and Nikki's book since they first showed up in previous installments. I was so captivated by this story that I devoured it. I love that Lani keeps her characters loyal to each other even when they aren't together.  So just to clear up any misconceptions about what Miller said regarding Michael and other girls..it NEVER happened! This is not a spoiler. This is a fact that this author wouldn't go there! Lani doesn't write drama like that. Why? Because her stories stand on their own without contrived drama. That's why she's in my top 5 favorite authors ever!Lani ..just to let you know..Nikki owned Michael's heart even when they weren't together. Let's just say Michael was ""branded' in a way ..forever. Michael was by far so amazing that I am really thinking he's probably my favorite hero of Lani ever. From the reason he quit being a Dr to how he stepped up to the plate when Nikki rocked his world, he was like a cement wall that would not be moved. He radiated strength and courage even when battling his mental issues. Nikki was the perfect fit for Michael because she knew what his lifestyle would entail having a brother living the same way. I was surprised by the Joslin transformation and simply baffled and amazed that Lani wrapped up their story like that. Totally a unique twist.Every time I end a book by this author I sit and close my eyes, savoring the peace and beauty she leaves in my heart. Being from Louisiana and my family being military and police officers just makes her books so personal to me. Even the fact that I'm in the medical field just has me finding so many similarities to my life and I can't get enough of her stories. Such humor but also such passion each story lives in my heart and breathes on its own. Love isn't strong enough of a word to how I feel beginning and ending each amazing tale she tells.

"This story was truly the sweetest and most romantic journey. I enjoyed the progression of two little 8 year old ninja turtle loving beings finding an instant connection that created a life of Beautiful moments.I swooned, laughed, cried and sighed. Tessa just has a way of pulling you into her stories and captivating you with so many emotions.  The humor is at the perfect level and the angst is just right. No upsetting jealousy drama and unnecessary plot devices will be found in this heartwarming story. That isn't to say that their journey didn't have pain and sorrow . These two had the triumph after the pain and the sun shining after the sorrow because everything they went through they did it together ...even when only one of them was carrying the other. I just have so many warm feelings right now. Jeremy and Sierra had the kind of love that so many hope for. So happy with how Tessa brought us full circle and even showed hints of the next generation.

"Very sexy story with a big secret that took a tad too long to come out.. And caused some unnecessary angst for the heroine when if they had talked I guess we wouldn't have had a story. Very hot though.Both dated after high school separation.But the hero has been celibate for 3 years prior to them being reunited.

"I saw Framed was coming by C. P Smith and even without knowing the blurb I was salivating. This lady knows what I love in my heroes and she just writes them exactly like I want. Kade saw the innocent Harley in high school as the perfect unattainable girl he would never deserve. From afar he wanted her so deeply. Little did he knew she was crazy about him too. Lost chances and missed opportunities had years fly by and a failed marriage for Harley was in her rear view mirror while the battlefield a war for the Seal Kade. When next they meet its at Renault prison and Harley is aiming to possibly get closer to Kade and with everything in her heart she believes he's innocent.From this point on this story is a wonderful seduction of the senses with so much mystery and suspense along with passionate encounters.Kade didn't waste time letting Harley know how long he'd wanted her. I loved their back and forth banter. Things were constantly jumping and making me guess. There were some gross and creepy bad guy points of view that had me nauseated. But I was relieved those parts didn't last too long. I adored the Brute Squad and Harley's Dad just stole my heart. I was in romantic suspense heaven throughout this awesome read. I simply can't wait for more each time I see The End after reading anything from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R8EQDPVGZW3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HNX9QO#wasThisHelpful","R3R8EQDPVGZW3L","A2N58DQ4IL5SHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N58DQ4IL5SHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm seriously in a very sappy yet happy place when I find authors and books who give me true heroes. Heroes who adore and cherish their women. From the moment these two were brought together on the page I literally felt their connection vibrating. The words were brimming with emotion and heat. Whether it was the sarcasm and sexually charged banter or the swooning sexy comments from Payne.. I was in my own version of perfection amongst the pages. Having discussed the finer points of what makes a hero.. A real hero.. with this beautiful kind author via email, I found a kindred spirit in this sweet lady. Stacy agrees that the leading men in love stories should know what they want and not waver. Payne was everything I love. Yea he did have a pretty sexed up past but he totally changed the moment Becks fell in his arms. I absolutely love epilogue with marriage and babies and if I could recommend any book to any of my safety buddies I would definitely say Rachel if you haven't already stumbled upon this on then jump in.Totally safe all the way. Some small humorous references to a past hook up he had but nothing that caused any drama.. No other women at all. He was gone for Becks from day one. Beautiful amazing hero in every way. I am diving into book two now. Stacy.. There's a huge pressure out there to write all of these damaged A-hole heroes.. The ones who hurt the heroine over and over but miraculously change at the end. Romance doesn't have to hurt and heroes do not have to sleep around or lie just so they can change.. Why not be a good guy from the start? So please lady keep writing heroes who show what the meaning of romance and love stories really are. You'll find that there are so many women who really don't need all that angst that's just not romantic at all. So summing up Ms Gail, please don't lose that special love inside that breathes life into your men. We really need real heroes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39BXXE6YJZ5X7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OD939XE#wasThisHelpful","R39BXXE6YJZ5X7","A2N58DQ4IL5SHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N58DQ4IL5SHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I began reading Romance I was probably maybe 12..then it was V C Andrews and was definitely beyond my age.  Years later I read historical romance and devoured them.  I left historical in the dust years ago but after this fantastic gem I think it's awakened my love again.  With all of my triggers now a days I think this genre will be just perfect to read in between all the angsty  Contemporary books.First of all my safety triggers are not necessarily more lax than others but let's say they are more direct.  Like what's in the past for me is the past.  I only care about the present story.  At first due to an incorrect marking and subsequent review by another safety buddy, I thought this was a celibate hero.  That wasn't the case but.. Here is where my safe issues are different.These two children were babies and shared one very chaste kiss when she was only 14 years old.  Then suddenly she leaves and the hero a child himself thinks he'll never see her again.  So yea he has one night stands.. While never really moving on in the emotional sense.  In this Era of course the heroine remained a virgin.  When Luke finds out she's coming back to town, he immediately stops seeing the saloon girls.  He wants Esme and he wastes no time marrying her.  It had so much humor and even the perfect amount of angst.  The foster boys stole my heart right along with how amazing Luke was to raise all those lost boys.  I adored everything about this book.As far the safety.. Nothing about his past is in your face.  Its mentioned that he had those girls.. But he actually says after the fact that he regrets it and he'd have never touched anyone if he knew she'd ever come back.  He also knew he'd  never love or marry another.  I really just absolutely loved every moment.  Devoured it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34UMT2TZKOTTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVB5P92#wasThisHelpful","R34UMT2TZKOTTX","A2N58DQ4IL5SHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N58DQ4IL5SHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was the most unique MC book I've read. For one, all of the negative things I don't like about the mainstream MC reads was absent. No club whores, no other women at all. Just a guy who made some bad choices that gets a second chance at life. The person he wasn't expecting was Tes who is none other than his probation officer. Things aren't all romantic in this fast moving read though. It's mostly suspense and a lot of nail biting moments. Then one sexy as sweet HEA epilogue wrapped it up perfectly. If you like romantic suspense that's not all about the sex but more about mystery and redemption then this one is for you. Kindle unlimited available too.

"Miller Genuine Spurlock was a hero in the truest definition. From the moment he took Mercy into his sheltering arms after her tragic attack, I was head over heels for this huge larger than life man. Mercy was beyond brave and really grabbed life by the balls. She was funny and kind. What was beautiful was that they became such close friends. Lani of course gave us the craziness of silly friends and family. Letting us visit with past favorites while teasing us with future possible stories to come. This was a unique love story that treasured life. I admire this author for her beliefs and her strength in not caving to the public pressure of writing what others want.. But writing what's in her heart. I for one feel safe while reading Lani's stories because every time I visit her whacky and crazy but beautiful sexy world I know I'll feel at home and like I can just relax and enjoy down to earth love stories where faith, family and freedom to love and protect those special to us is celebrated.Keep dreaming Lani, I'll be right there ready to dive in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFNAYYNVTRWIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XYS7NCI#wasThisHelpful","RFNAYYNVTRWIM","A2N58DQ4IL5SHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N58DQ4IL5SHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm so totally in love with the amazing characters that this gifted author creates in every single story. Foster had some history that included wallbanging sex that almost ended up as negligent homicide by fornication. Yea, pretty big man slut, that is what Foster was before his accident. I was happy to read that when the wall came down though the man slut hung up his bed hopping card. Then the terrifying accident came and Foster changed in more ways than one. This brave and amazing guy didn't let this keep him down.. He used it to make him stronger. That's not saying he wasn't worried that a woman might see him as less. But thankfully the woman that caught his eye and his heart was a spitfire that saw he was a man of Steel even before his leg was put on each day. Blake was probably the most vulnerable heroine Lani has written to date in my opinion. She felt like she had been abandoned after her cheating ex and the divorce that decided assets and friends. Even to the point of her mom picking sides.This left her with a feeling of not being good enough. But Foster quickly showed her she was desirable and lovable. He wasn't perfect but even when he made the most stupid choices.. (certain neighbor he left to sit with Blake) he made up for it and sometimes a simple I'm sorry goes a long way. He replaced all those bad memories with good ones and brought amazing people into her life to be called her new family.Of course the crazy family brought Lani's signature humor to the story and before I knew it I was totally lost in the story. One of my favorite characters in this story was not a person..but he didn't know that.Boom goes the dynamite! Boris sang.Every time they had sex this bird cracked me up!! Mystery and action always plays a huge part and Lani balances this with the sexy and sweet love story with blazing scenes of passion between Foster and Blake. I will say I cried like a baby a few times. With the best ending and epilogue ever I'll remember this story for a long time. I am so happy this author writes like the energizer bunny because I just can't wait for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA29X9PTSU8HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZP5MX6#wasThisHelpful","RA29X9PTSU8HY","A2N58DQ4IL5SHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N58DQ4IL5SHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My heart is so full right now that it's nearly overflowing. When a series that has given me so much beauty comes to and end its bittersweet.Kristen did perfect justice to Merry and Cher. The way she brought these two together was absolutely brilliant. It was a delicate balance with Merry's past. Cher was not only a kick ass heroine, she was full on strong woman. At times that strength pushed her walls too high but thanks to inside and outside influences those walls stood no chance against what fate had in store for these two.When Kristen creates a hero, she takes every part of what's good and solid in the world and adds in bad ass and attitude along with honor and loyalty. Garrett Merry Merrick was all of the above with some really smart-assed elements thrown in. He needed that edge and that sarcasm to deal with all that was Cher. Merry was such a real man, one who wasn't afraid to take care of his woman and by extension everything and everyone who mattered to her. I simply kept wanting to shout YES so many times because this man really was perfect even when he wasn't. The heat in this book was above and beyond the hottest ever. There were blazing love scenes that left me feeling deeply and every single one had such profound emotional depth. Scenes that had me read them more than once. More than erotic, more than passionate. Sheer beauty that takes your breath away. Then I could go on and on about the cast of fabulous characters that Kristen sprinkled throughout . From the painful yet healing conversations between Dave and Merry that had me in tears and gosh I just felt like my heart would burst. The sweetest moments between Merry and Rocky ..ahh the swooning that Merry caused. Such a loving brother and friend. Then Cher building friendships with the ladies of the Burg. So many laugh out loud moments. Even the funny moments between Merry and Mike. Mike grinned at the windshield. Domestic bliss already? Dont know, but youll be the second to know when I do.Mike chuckled.  From laughing together and even when Mike pissed Merry off simply was authentic Kristen Ashley.  The one thing I love about the relationships that this brilliant author creates is that they seem just real like friendships are realistic in the fact these guys might argue but in the end of the day they have each others back. Just like family. So every single character that showed their face in this epic read had my full attention. There was a star though and he wasn't a bad ass yet but was on his way to being one in full force. Yes, Ethan stole the show. That little man was amazing and brave. More names from so many books in the series that  just added that Kristen Ashley fantastic edge. Love . passion, suspense and family this series will always be held dear to my heart. Seeing favorites and revisiting stories had me in tears that were bittersweet. Of course even though I wanted it to go on and on..the end had to come. There is no one out there that can do magic in a epilogue like this superbly talented author. So many insights of the futures of our favorites and maybe hopefully .. Crossing fingers and toes ..insights in to future story lines. No matter what Kristen .. Girl you are just full up with author badass brilliance. Write on lady..we can't wait for what you have in store for us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5YIMXQ1VYIBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692467459#wasThisHelpful","R5YIMXQ1VYIBP","A2N58DQ4IL5SHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N58DQ4IL5SHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Kindle unlimited *I loved this virgin hero so much. I thought his innocent but sweet devotion was amazing. This was a debut for this author and I see really good things for her.The love scenes were scorching. I do wish there had been less mention of the heroines past during certain scenes. It took away from what was going on. Her dominant attitude wasn't my cuppa either. I like more aggressive heroes. But he was so adorable. I also wish that the heroine hadn't acted like she did the morning after. Thankful she didn't take long to realize her error. I'd have liked to have had more information about the ""falling"" and what was going to happen to Garon. Usually paranormal romance has more world building and there's a foundation for how that fantasy world is there. I will definitely read more in the future from this author. I hope she adds more history and characters to her next story.Safety info:Hero was virgin since he was an angel.But he had to see her numerous lovers over the years. Heroine was pretty active too. She knew he was there watching but thought she was going crazy. I didn't like that she knew and still did those things and thought of the hero.I wouldn't call this a totally safe book.. But once he falls and they meet neither are with others. They do talk about her past and some of those times bothered me.If you read this do it for the hero.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GAPP27RBN6NW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XZZXHHU#wasThisHelpful","R1GAPP27RBN6NW","A2N58DQ4IL5SHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N58DQ4IL5SHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first 50% bugged me with the triangle vibe. Then I liked Jason so I kept reading. T love shifter books but one part went past my comfort zone. I did like the writing and it flowed well. I just liked this one..didn't love it.I need to add the the majority of the safe readers like reading the heroine with other men so they had this marked as safe.There are some of us who don't want to read our heroines or heroes with other people. This is not a safe book. The heroine kisses another man several times , dances with him till she us turned on. She did do these things due to thinking that the hero didn't want her but to me ..it still made me nauseated to read it and so this book really isn't safe at all. It wasn't cheating ..but it even felt like cheating to her. The hero part is safe so those readers who like the women who do those things but not the men will be happy.

"I wanted James story for so long. I am so full of just happiness and more right now. Lani just takes me on a journey each time and I always find that I""m in a very good place when I close the book. I loved every character and adore Lani for always giving us perfect heroes who adore their woman and stay faithful. James was sometimes a little dense but he's a man ..and he was a truly all man.

"From the very moment Jack held Winter's hand moments after meeting her, I was in love with this book. Lani has the extraordinary ability to create love stories I can believe in. Characters that are loyal from the first meeting to the HEA. She proves in every single book that unnecessary drama and angst between the lead couples isn't needed to pad a story. There won't be cheating or whoring heroes and that is something I absolutely love her for. Jack was the most steadfast hero I have read in so long. To stay celibate and honor his vows even after death .. Proves how this author honors the vows of love. I adore her secondary characters as much as the leads and there is always dialogue that has me laughing out loud to moments of such deep emotion that the tears flowed freely. I will say this couple had the most tragic road of any I've read of Lani and I can't imagine how it must have felt to be in her mind and heart as this book was written. Sadness , healing and then beauty and joy were captured perfectly along side an epic couples love story that I didn't want to end. I'm so absolutely head over heels in book love with all this author writes. Diving into the next one soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CLFQRUBA778C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCHJ326#wasThisHelpful","R1CLFQRUBA778C","A2N58DQ4IL5SHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N58DQ4IL5SHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK so I think I realize now why I absolutely love and adore Lani Lynn Vale's writing style. It's because it just seems so down to earth. From laugh out loud funny moments to sobbing emotional ups and downs. The fact is this author just gives me authentic stories with just enough fictional suspense that it sucks me in and keeps me there. Max and Payton couldn't have fit more perfectly together. I just really fell hard for this couple. Lani doesn't steep her stories in jealousy or other women drama. It's not necessary to make a love story work and this author knows it. Her heroes are loyal and they aren't afraid of falling and aren't afraid of family. I'm so hooked on this author I might need therapy. As of right now Lani holds the number one spot on my Safe author list. Suspense, sexy times and crazy family with authentic love stories. I simply just love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UDO7CBV9UC3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDT3T4K#wasThisHelpful","R3UDO7CBV9UC3V","A2N58DQ4IL5SHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N58DQ4IL5SHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are rather unique, somewhere between a seaweed snack and a rice cracker. They have a salty flavor as to be expected with a noticeable sweetness. As an occasional treat they are pretty yummy, as a healthy snack they are high in sodium and sugar.Pros> Unique Texture.> Crispy like a cracker, but airy like a Munchos chip.> Beautiful two-tone presentation.> Satisfies the sweet and salty craving.Cons> High in sodium (8%DV)> High in sugar (Not Reported as DV, but masked as a seasoning)> Not a healthy snack alternative","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TUU7U1XLFU5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBGKJV6#wasThisHelpful","R1TUU7U1XLFU5B","A26EQ8U96JA92T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26EQ8U96JA92T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are also some gorgeous pictures in this beautiful hard cover journal.Many of the lists are very traditional (Favorite places, happiest moments in life, etc.) but they still inspire some creativity if you put some thought into it.  The only downside, if you write a lot like me, you can get limited, amount 2 pages per a list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34XB4XDNYLVMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632170345#wasThisHelpful","R34XB4XDNYLVMZ","A26EQ8U96JA92T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26EQ8U96JA92T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Remember Mia is a engaging psychological thriller.  The story will keep you hooked through until the end. it's hard to put down. My feelings for the narrating character, Estelle, changed over the course of the novel which was interesting but fits in with the story line. It's almost as you are watching with her - her story unravel, like a spectator, so you have the same feelings as a judgmental outsider as does Estelle her self.  What keeps this from being a Gone Girl is the lack of character development for all of the other characters.

"When I first saw this camera and its relatively inexpensive price, I thought to myself that this was probably a bit on the cheap side and very well not worth the price. But because of Amazon's wonderful return policy, I thought I would buy it for one of my three retail business locations. I'd set it up, try it for a week and see how it went. Well, setup was as easy as everyone has said it would be. The quality of the picture is shocking. If you want to read the fine print, set it for HD and you really do get HD. And Pan and Tilt is not 100% smooth, but, hey, this beauty is less than $100. I wouldn't even have expected Pan and Zoom at that price range. I can monitor the camera on my Android phone and on my iMac computer. Settings are extensive and it is very flexible. In addition, with the addition of a 32gb MicroSD Card, I can have the camera save the video. At my current resolution (you have 4 choices of resolution), the FujiKam tech told me that I should get at least 48 hours of recording. So, should something bad happen, like a break-in, I can save the recording and give to the police.The real test in a product like this has as much to do with customer service. I have called twice, and the customer service is spot on. On the second call, they were not opened yet, and I went thru to the answering service. Wasn't sure I'd hear from anyone, yet 2 hours later, they called and answered all my questions.The only thing that needs improvement is the manual, and on my call today, the tech informed me that a new manual was coming out soon and asked me to email him at support@fujikam.us and request to have a new manual emailed to me upon release. Again, they responded quickly, letting me know that I was on the list.I mentioned that I had three retail stores. In my first store, I had a professional system installed, and I haven't had phone access to it in over a year... what a waste of several thousand dollars. In my second store, I installed a Lorex system, and sometimes I can access it, sometimes I can't. It's hit or miss. So today, I ordered two more units and two more 32gb MicroSD Cards. So now, as long as the internet is up, I have access.Bottom line is that this is a wonderful video monitoring camera. Don't let the price fool you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1275UCQPAQLJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAJ9U8K#wasThisHelpful","R1275UCQPAQLJ6","A1C79GZWPXKXW7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C79GZWPXKXW7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a small business owner, I have been using Torchstar MR-16 LED Bulbs for about two and a half years. When one of the two PAR20 bulbs burned out at home, I thought, what a good chance to check out the Torchstar PAR20 LED bulb. What a wonderful difference. It is fully dimmable, is only 8 watts vs the 50 watt bulb I previously had, and is rated to last 22.8 years. Even if it only lasts half that long, the payback on it in terms of lower electrical costs will be enormous.The bulb, ordered here on Amazon (where else would I order it!!), arrived on time. I was a bit surprised at the packaging, as the bulb was in its selling box in a small padded envelope. But it arrived safely, so no complaints.As you can see from the pictures, the light is much brighter and a bit more focused. But all in all, it puts out a beautiful light and I am extremely happy with it. I will keep the light on for several days and if I have any change of heart, I will update.

"This is a replacement for a Zagg product that was HUGE and heavy. And that was a replacement for another Zagg cover that was poorly designed. I wanted a slim case that fit well and had side buttons that provided positive feel. This case does all of that. I would have given it 5 stars, but as some other reviewers have mentioned, the plastic case, although dimpled like the S5, is very slick. When I pick up the phone, I feel like it is going to slip out my hand. Probably never will, but that's the feeling I get. The headphone opening has been widened in order to accept just about any headphone jack you want to throw at it. The charging port is also large and easy to access. And as I mentioned in the beginning, I wanted buttons that had a distinctly positive feel. This case succeeds in doing that. In fact, it succeeds in all aspects.

"Several folks have commented about possibly needing a repeater for cars older than 2012 in order to use the HomeLink buttons on your car. And one person mentioned that it was only a $7 shipping fee. I just called Chamberlain today about my cars not working, and that is correct.... a $7 shipping fee, plus $27 for the repeater.

"I have problem with LG Tone HBS-750 Bluetooth headset. There is no problem pairing or connecting. The problem is; when talking on Samsung Galaxy S5 via LG Tone Bluetooth headset at some random point in the conversation the microphone stops, but the earbuds are still working. I can hear, but I can't be heard. I can take the phone off headset selection, and then put it back on headset selection, and that makes it work, again, for a short while, then it happens, again. I lost the mic 5x in a 30 minute conversation. It is an intermittent problem. A Verizon tech did a factory reset on my phone when I took the first one back. I have also done a soft reset, and LG tech had me do a reboot on the headset. The problem persists. I have been in touch with LG and Verizon. The general consensus is there is a glitch in the headset software, but LG says it is not their problem. If it were not for this problem I would be absolutely thrilled with the LG Tone HBS-750 Blue tooth headset.Further research on Google shows that I am not the only one having this issue. But there also seems to be a solution, albeit not a great solution, but one none the less. This issue of the mic going to mute can be stopped by turning off the wifi on the phone. Unfortunately, I use wifi at home, and this is be a huge inconvenience, but it works. One solution that seems to work is to turn off WIFI when using the phone. It is a real inconvenience, but if  you want to continue this headset like me,  you start remembering to turn wifi off.The most frustrating part of this is that I have contacted LG both via phone and chat, and both times they claim complete ignorance of the problem. I have even directed them to the forums where the issue is being debated/complained about. They, LG, simply do the ostrich dance, sticking their heads in the sand and saying it doesn't exist. A couple of customers actually put comments on the LG forum and LG took them down stating ""your review did not meet our guidelines for posting on our site."" I guess that means that LG only accepts positive reviews.Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful headset. The best I have ever owned. WHEN IT WORKS!!! But it is very frustrating to be talking on the phone and have your mic go mute all of a sudden. Or having to turn off wifi so that you can talk without being cut off.If you do buy the LG TONE HBS750, just be aware of the issue and the fact that LG is not going to acknowledge that there is an issue.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HD8NO1EFXA82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCKS1C8#wasThisHelpful","R3HD8NO1EFXA82","A1C79GZWPXKXW7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C79GZWPXKXW7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice unit, but not as nice as I was hoping that it would be. I use four of them for moving a glass kiln in the garage, and leveling it prior to firing. I thought it would be as easy on turning the red gear knob. That works until you get the feet grounded and have to start lifting weight. Then you have to resort to the included wrench. Also, I expected the feet to be a nice hard rubber type. Instead, they are soft, thus much of the leveling is to simply overcome the give in the rubber. Although they are advertised to support a total of 1320 pounds, I have found that to be a bit of a stretch. My kiln is only a couple hundred pounds and it is a chore trying to level them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12EORIOT7L0XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039ZIPL4#wasThisHelpful","R12EORIOT7L0XV","A1C79GZWPXKXW7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C79GZWPXKXW7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was very leary of buying this product but did so anyway. Then I talked to a car buff buddy of mine, and he gave me some hints, but said to forge ahead. The instructions tell you to be careful to tape around your headlight covers. But what my friend told me was that the last step, the polishing compound is very hard on paint. Even if it just gets slung on the paint during the polishing phase. It was recommended to me to cover the car out 2 to 3 feet with paper so that the polishing compound doesn't come into contact with your car paint. So, off I went, doing all the steps. I agree with the instructions, a couple extra passes over the lens cover is worth the time and trouble. Now my 2002 Lexus SC430 headlights look like the day I bought the car.

He spent well over 45 minutes with me trouble shooting and finally decided to send me new lighting parts, as one of the switches was faulty. Everything worked great for about three months.

Then, the light bulbs melted the plastic cover when they dropped down a bit and ended up touching the plastic. $25 later, I insert a new plastic cover. I made some modifications to the light assembly to hold it up out of the way of the plastic cover, but the heat of the light bulbs is still making it crack.

"I was introduced to Lee Child and Jack Reacher via a sale on Amazon. I am now hooked on the Jack Reacher series and will begin reading them, one by one. Starting now with the second in his series. In this case, ""giving"" the book away for $1.99 will make Amazon plenty from me, as I will now have to buy the remaining 30+ books at full retail. Nice job, Amazon, great marketing. As to the book itself, it started off a bit slow, as the author spent well needed time to introduce his character to us. I enjoyed all the twists and turns that the book took on its way to the end. Lee Child was able to throw in suspense, romance, detective work, and good old fashion action, making this a very good book to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IDEGTKQ4OS4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OZ0NXA#wasThisHelpful","R2IDEGTKQ4OS4G","A1C79GZWPXKXW7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C79GZWPXKXW7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"On replacing my mower battery for the second time, the employee at the auto parts store said lead acid batteries would last much longer if I would install this Battery Tender, so I bought one. I don't know if it extends battery life as it has been installed less than a year. However, it is nice to hear the engine spin so well after several months of the mower sitting unused.As I have a car that is seldom used, I decided to order a second Battery Tender Junior. The Tender has adequate power to bring to bring this larger battery back to full charge after the car is driven, it just takes longer than with the mower battery. Don't know if it has enough capacity to bring the car battery to full charge if it is really discharged?I will update this review after I've had enough experience with the Battery Tender Junior to determine if it really extends battery life.

"We retired our 2"" memory foam pad after 6 years and installed this 3"" one. It's hard to remember how the 2"" foam pad originally felt to judge just how much it may have changed, but this 3"" made a immediate improvement in comfort for both my wife and myself. Neither of us have had joint pain since we installed it over a month ago.To install this pad I stripped the bed and opened the package on the bed. I preserved the plastic sheet and the plastic bag  the pad came in, just in case i needed to reuse them. I allowed the pad to expand on the bed so that I did not have to lift it. It fit the queen bed exactly right out of the package, not much expansion was required. It had a slight odor similar to some household cleaning products, not too objectionable. The odor disappeared after the pad sat all day on the unmade bed.  We made the bed that evening have enjoyed the additional comfort ever since.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24CRS39LOFOP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AR5X92#wasThisHelpful","R24CRS39LOFOP9","A2I6KBFBFIORH7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I6KBFBFIORH7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a bare bones, basic phone except for a memory of 3 emergency and 9 personal phone numbers. There is no display, no unanswered call lists,  no caller ID, etc. I bought three of these Trimline Corded phones to replace phones that had these features.  I did this because the previous phones ate batteries, but mainly because conversations were not as clear as conversations on these phones are, These may be basic phones without features but they are very good at what phones are supposed to be good at, clarity and low noise, and the price is quite reasonable.There is a small device in the carriage of this phone that can be rotated to provide a hook to retain the hand piece when the carriage is wall mounted.

"I like David McCullough's books,  they are generally easy to read, they flow nicely and they tell an interesting story. This one is no exception. It concentrates on the social rather than the technical aspects in the development of the first heavier than air flying machine. It delves deeply into the relationships of the two brothers, Orville and Wilbur,  their sister and the father of the Wright family, Other immediate members of the family are barely mentioned.As many books have been written about the Wright brothers, Mr McCullough perhaps wanted to tell the lesser known aspects of the story. His love of France, Paris in particular is well covered as Wilbur spent a lot of time, did a lot of flying there and was well received by the people.Personally, it has been some time since I read in depth about the first flights and would have preferred more technical detail. For example, what did they learn with the wind tunnel that they designed and built? Evidently, it was crucial to the airplane's development but there is no information given.  The aerodynamic data that was accepted at the time is stated to have been incorrect. How the brothers corrected the data and what they concluded is not specified. Very little about the design of the kites they first flew or the man carrying, self propelled machine they developed and continued to refine is  described.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VLAVQOFUX4AK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1RWP6#wasThisHelpful","R2VLAVQOFUX4AK","A2I6KBFBFIORH7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I6KBFBFIORH7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From what I know of him, I like Henry Paulson. He has a laid back demeanor, seems a willing listener and is not overbearing in any way. However. as an author, I'm not so sure. His fascination with China is a bit puzzling, and the book is a bit boring.The book is primarily about Mr. Paulson's experiences with high ranking individuals in China and is divided more or less into three sections. The first relates to business experiences while he was at Goldman Sachs. The second, his involvement in China's economic development while he was secretary of the U.S. Treasury and the third and longest section, that is continuing, is about his relationship with China's leaders as the head of the Paulson Institute. The third section in particular, reads as if he is writing to the responsible Chinese officials rather than the general reader, as if he is expecting they will read the book. He is selling his services as they convert from a manufacturing to a consuming economy. He also offers help in the economical improvement of their environment.His premise is that communist or not, it is better to help the Chinese rather than be antagonistic of even agnostic toward them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17QCFCWAYNITM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO7FMDC#wasThisHelpful","R17QCFCWAYNITM","A2I6KBFBFIORH7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I6KBFBFIORH7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I got tired of moving the weights back and forth, so later when I aerated the back yard, I used large rocks. In each case, I held them in place with bungee cords which worked very well.

"This three-piece measuring set is very well done. After using plastic ones for several years,  it is a real pleasure to use a measuring cup with very readable markings. I often avoided the 2 cup plastic one because the markings were so hard to read. The markings of all three sizes of these cups are very readable from inside or outside the cup,These cups are slightly larger than the required volume. As a result, I am often able to mix within the cup rather than having to pour the mixture into a larger vessel, a significant convenience.The handles are comfortable and useful with hot or cold liquids.

O. filtered water but an additional filter is a plus. The bottle latches positively on the base preventing it from falling off. Microban is built into the base.

"This sound bar has a single analog input only, therefore, it is plug-and play only with TVs equipped with a headphone jack or an analog audio output. It's probably not cost effective to convert TVs with digital output only to function with this sound bar.It is designed to be used with 40"" TV's, its width matches, and it can sit unobtrusively underneath. We use it with a 32"" TV mounted in a 42"" wide cabinet. The sound bar fits nicely on top of the cabinet. Stereo separation is improved over a 32"" sound bar.Audio is definitely improved over the TV's built-in speakers. No specifications are given, but the frequency band seems reasonably wide with low distortion. I have not measured it to date, but I seriously doubt if it effectively reproduces frequencies below about 100 Hz. (Bass frequencies are not its forte!)There are some features that are a bit unusual for a sound bar in this price range. It uses a standard Sony code so that it may be programmed with other controllers such as the DirecTV controller. However, if the power is not turned off at the controller, the unit senses when no signal is present and after a few minutes turns itself off (it turns itself on in a few seconds after receiving a signal from the TV) so that no programming is actually required. All things considered, this is a pretty good unit at a very good price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22DA6LPDUQP3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007I36VZA#wasThisHelpful","R22DA6LPDUQP3H","A2I6KBFBFIORH7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I6KBFBFIORH7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far I am fairly impressed with this little gadget. It really does work once you get it set up. Getting set up was a bit of an issue. The Jawbone device didn't want to pair with my phone at first. Finally they mated up and all was well. I would like to see some better instructions included with this. Not everyone is a 20 something tech whiz and you can't get any instruction until you get paired. I would also like some actual insights included on how tight this has to be on your wrist, is it waterproof etc. I finally went to the sight to find out about the waterproof thing.I found this very hard to put on. In fact I can't do it myself. Once you have it on, you surely want to leave it on. It is very stylish. It seems to count steps very well and it is easy to check your progress. This really beats wearing a pedometer and trying to keep track of it all day or have it not register or fall off.The sleep tracker is pretty nifty although I am somewhat skeptical that it is really right. It registers light sleep if you are a restless sleeper, which I am.All in all, I think for the money it is a good device for tracking your movements and helping to get those 10,000 steps that we all need.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MO9190OQN372/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HOIFZ2#wasThisHelpful","R1MO9190OQN372","A1A9PD00UVHHVI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9PD00UVHHVI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A very stylish design is the first thing you notice about this chair. The second thing is that it is very sturdy and well made. Easy to assemble. Nicely padded cushion. It matches very well in my new kitchen and we just might buy another to have two. It is kind of large and we don't have much overhang on our counter.What I am not too fond of is that the seat is big from front to back. I have short legs and if I set against the back I can't reach the rest at the bottom. This makes it very difficult to swivel because the swivel seat on this is stiff.The back is also I think, tilted too far back at a kind of leaning angle. At first I thought it was assembled wrong, but it is designed that way with a bit of backward lean.  Not great if you have teens or husbands that insist on leaning way back in their chairs.

"I am always looking for alternative cooking platforms. We do a lot of entertaining and run a bed and breakfast sometimes. This grill has some good points and some bad.Pros:Easy to clean by hand washing. The finish is very non stick.The splatter guard, while difficult to install does work fairly well.Heats pretty evenly, with a few cold spots at the edges.Cons:Has a large counter foot print, but the cooking space is really only enough for 2 or 3 servings. I made a breakfast on it to try it out. Got 8 short strips of bacon on the grill side and 4 small eggs on the griddle part.No real guidelines on regulating the temperature. You just have to stand by and fiddle with it as needed.No clear instructions on installing the splatter guard, or for that matter even what that piece is used for. Be sure to pay great attention to unpacking this to get all the coverings and cardboard out of it before you heat it up.All in all, this is functional. It will see very sporadic use in our household of 2 and I'm not sure the storage space is going to be worth it. In my opinion this would be great for a dorm room or a small apartment with no other cooking space. I suppose if you eat a daily diet of chicken breasts it would be useful, but we tend to more sophisticated fare here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FBVLXB72TU9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IBVTR2#wasThisHelpful","R2FBVLXB72TU9N","A1A9PD00UVHHVI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9PD00UVHHVI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Nice, heavy base. Multiple positions and unlike my Ott light it actually stays in the position you put it in. There is an Allen wrench included if you need to tighten the joints.

"We installed this TV this morning in our den to replace a flat screen that had died. Installation went fairly well, although it wasn't as straightforward as it could have been. I think a lot of manufacturers assume a level of electronic experience that not everyone has. Best advice I can give on that front is to look at a TV you already have and try to follow along with the enclosed instructions.We have satellite where we are, and for some reason the TV wants to do a 30 minute scan for signals. It wouldn't let us override that process, so be prepared.The picture has very vibrant color and clarity. We are watching the Golf Channel at the moment and when they show the ball you can see the blades of grass individually around it.Nice sleek frame and body and it easily attached to the wall bracket we had.The actual listing for this item needs some work as it is very low on specifics.

We are on one level, but this would have been very useful in our old house where we had stairs.Pros: Built to last  Extra long cord makes it very easy to get around from room to room.  I love that the vacuum goes with you. No more dragging the machine and bouncing it off walls and furniture.  Extra long extension pole made it easy to get cobwebs in the corners of my high ceilings.  Lightweight enough to wear without getting too heavy. The harness is very adjustable. This seems like an odd thing at first. Wearing a vac on your back, but the mobility of the whole thing is hard to beat.  Mesh bag for accessories that can clip to the harness if you desire, so that everything is right at hand.  The accessories are top quality, commercial grade. I love the floor tool. It has heavy felt ends that stick out from the edges of the metal piece that attaches to the hose. This is just fabulous for cleaning along baseboards and cabinets. No more rub marks or scratches from the ends.  Easily accessible filters.  Cons:  Not many. I have very small hands and the wand is a little thick. It would be nice to have something to hold on to.  My only concern in the construction of this is that the hose just inserts into the top of the vac and into the wand. I can anticipate that over time the connections could get loose causing some separation of the parts. A clip or a screw on connection would be better.All in all, I would take one of these over a Dyson any day of the week.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QLXQ9DMNB5HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NPU2N6#wasThisHelpful","R3QLXQ9DMNB5HV","A1A9PD00UVHHVI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9PD00UVHHVI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First let me state for the record that I am not a computer geek. So I won't be reviewing much about Windows 10. I have barely learned to use Windows 8. The one thing I did figure out with 10 is that the start up screen is back and this makes powering off a lot easier.There is almost no informational literature with this item. The consumer is expected to learn everything online on the fly. For some of us older folks that is daunting. I try to stay current, but there is barely enough information with this to even tell you where the power button is.The laptop itself is wonderful. It is light. Only about 1 inch wide at the hinge. This is my third laptop that I've had. One Acer, a Dell and this. I can say that this has the best keyboard of any of my previous laptops. Something about the touch makes you want to type on it. The backlit keys are nice, but they go out with inactivity. This also seems to go to a rest mode quickly, which I'm sure is a setting that could be changed if you are more current than I am. I couldn't figure out how to wake it up without pushing the power button.I really like the touch screen capability. It solves the problem of trying to navigate with the touchpad or a mouse. The screen is vibrant and the battery seems to go for quite a while before charging. Being able to flip the screen to different positions makes this a very fun tablet.Start up was simple once the power button was found. All in all this is a good laptop/tablet for most any use. It is going to take me awhile to figure out all the bells and whistles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NYOC28CRQMRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SBB27U#wasThisHelpful","R3NYOC28CRQMRJ","A1A9PD00UVHHVI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A9PD00UVHHVI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these earrings fine. Since the link to the actual product listing is broken I can't speak to the price point of these.  As with most costume jewelry, they look great in the photo. In person they are a bit dead looking. Not a lot of sparkle. The pave seems to have little dead spots in it that don't reflect the light. Otherwise, they are well made, with a stylish shape.

"The first edition of this book that I have has the appearance of  a coffee table  book filled with photos. Though there are many photos are a historically relevant and used in appropriate context of the accompanying text. The text itself is far ranging and I would consider a crash course into this period of time in Russia. This is not light reading and worthy of the description of a work in the category of history.Though the material requires much more in depth work a an introduction it covers the period from the imperial rein of the Romanov family at the beginning of the twentieth centaury, through the affects of World War I  and the ensuing turmoil. Russian saw a 1905 revolution, followed by World War I, which gave the opportunity for the armed insurrection in 1917 that was followed by a civil war. Even refers to another separate revolution which is actually part of the civil war.The interactions of all involved parties within Russian and the foreign powers that intervened are covered in these periods of military and political conflict. It is amazing how well these events are analyzed in great detail. The end of the book is a quick summary of all the economic and political turmoil that resulted in the aftermath of the Bolshevik success.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R352RQ5VQ3QCWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00071EJB8#wasThisHelpful","R352RQ5VQ3QCWL","A1B05INWIDZ74O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B05INWIDZ74O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am use to working on GM (Chevy, Pontiac, GMC) engines and as far as Ford went in my heyday the big block was the classic Boss engine. I now run a Ford 5.4L SOHC. This book covers some good basics for someone who wishes to build or especially rebuild a Ford Modular engine. The book begins with a short history of the modern Ford engine, the tools needed to perform the project starting and some suggested suppliers for parts and tools. The author rightly starts with disassembly. And takes you step by step through the process of rebuilding with some advice that can enhance performance or save you funds.The main examples of this book, and its focus, is on the 1996 4.6L SOHC Romeo engine from a Mustang GT. Each step in the process is explained and combined with many photographs that are pertinent to the subject being discussed. This is a book you would want out on your workbench along with Fords manual. If you are considering a Ford 4.6L modular rebuild I would definitely read this book first so you can understand the scope and complexity of the project and make an informed decision. The picture, charts and illustrations are clear and useful as is the well written text. An excellent addition to your automotive library. I took a 1/2 star off because the title does reflect the overall subject matter but is focused on only one specific engine build and in general only SOHC engines.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XR6JW4A9MCEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613252285#wasThisHelpful","R2XR6JW4A9MCEJ","A1B05INWIDZ74O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B05INWIDZ74O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was looking forward to the arrival of the Belkin AC1200 router as I had a I have a Linksys WRT54G that I have used for over a decade; and it still works. The AC1200 was a fast and easy setup right out of the box. It comes with simple to follow instructions and was up and running literally in minutes. The antennas are inside of the vertical standing covering so you can not position them, Though this has not affected my performance and the case seems more fragile then the router it is replacing.With the Belkin AC1200 I have an improvement in signal strength throughout my domicile and less lag. I am running multiple computers on this network. This router has features that the home user will even want to use. From parental controls, to overall system filtering and the one I liked, a guest access option. The Guest Access option allows you to have a  second yet slower Wi-Fi network with its own password that you can give to other to use to access the internet. Thus leaving your network more secure.Please remember that I am not a computer guy and my last router is over a decade old. So I do not know how this would stand up compared to the  more expensive ac routers that are out there. But then again they are at a much higher price then this unit and would be out of my price range. For my home network I find this to be an improvement.

"Considered buying this vs the Park Tool PCS-9 and PCS-10. Here are my thoughts.Feedback Sports Pro Ultralight:- 170$ approx, 10.6 lbs, made in taiwan- quick release tabs on extension tubes and folds up easily- feels solid and sturdy, tubes are thicker and bigger than the picture suggest- solid clamp mechanism, i believe still plastic connector, but feels very solidPark Tool PCS-9:- 140$ approx, 23 lbs, made in china- no quick release on extension tubes- heavier, harder to use, harder to setup and take downPark Tool PCS-10:- 180$ approx, 25 lbs, made in china- quick release on extension tubes- heavier- large plastic clamp armIn summary, for the price, it is lighter and better than the similarly priced park tool PCS-10. I'm sure if you spend even more money you can get a high quality stand, but this works for my occasional hobbyist type jobs. I would still recommend the Park Tool HBH-2 Handle Bar Holder. This is key to work with the front wheel easily.I will update as I use this over time. I imagine it will hold up for many years though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNOC8E3TRAL1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F2XGNK#wasThisHelpful","RNOC8E3TRAL1O","AHCL2WVP0FIY9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHCL2WVP0FIY9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Order 1 size larger than typical for your kid. My daughter is 7 years old and wears 6-7 sizes pretty easily as she is below 50% on the growth curve and skinny. i had to get her the 8 as the 7 was too tight.otherwise it is a great and durable swimsuit and she loves it for swimming. still going strong after 6 months.one note, a reviewer mentioned that it stretched really fast. i haven't noticed the same but I strongly recommend either air drying or using a low heat setting to dry (mixed with other towels).

"excellent balance bike for an upgrade to the Strider. my son outgrew the strider at 5 years old and this was the perfect transition while I wait for him to be ready for gear shift bikes.

"this came out around the same time as tinkerbell neverbeast. Both movies try to tug on your heartstrings and show the main character struggle with such life challenges. However unlike neverbeast this movie was sincere and warm. the scary moments were well played out and rationale such that though my kids were scared, they didn't have nightmares all night (which unfortunately neverbeast did do).There are truly funny moments that we still laugh about when we think back on this movie.The scenes near the ending brought tears to my eyes and show a strong and good human spirit. It inspires you to want to do good and to cherish those close to you. It gave me lots of opportunities to talk to my kids about adult-type issues and situations.I love this movie.

"First I very highly recommend these bottles. I used to use the thermos funtainer bottles for my kids at school, but i've switched over to these instead because they are so much easier to clean. Plus the funtainer bottles' silicon tip straws would degrade over time from chewing and dishwashing.STRENGTHS:- cap easy to take apart in 3 pieces for easy washing- a click lock on the lid to prevent accidental spills (love this!)- lid can lock in open position so it doesn't hit you in face- made in thailand (ok just useful for some to know...)- dishwasher safe (i use the top shelf to be safe)- very slender and tall design (about 9in x 2.5in with cap on)- colors are awesome and shiny- brother thermal labels stick well to it- keeps things both hot and cold decently (my coffee at work is still hot after an 8 hour shift, and my kids milk is still very cold after 7 hrs at school with 3 ice cubes inside to start)WEAKNESSES:- narrow opening so makes pouring into it tricky sometimes- I read a review saying the cap can crack if you drop it...- pricey (30$ on average)- color selection isn't broadVS FUNTAINER THERMOS:- funtainer has a straw with a silicone tip. the tip degrades over time and dishwashing and after it cracks too much the top no longer seals and spills occur even with the top closed.- funtainer also uses a glue to attach the plastic base, this glue will leak and ooze over time in the hot dishwasher. zojirushi uses a stainless steel base.- no lock, i've had spills in my kids' bag and this is totally not cool- a pain to clean the straw part. i even have a camelbak straw cleaner but it's a pain to clean every day.- doesn't seem to keep hot/cold sealed as long as zojirushi- some funtainers have a flip-up carrying loop. this is sort of nice but not essential for meSM-KHE48 vs SM-SA48:I noticed 2 different version and I purchased both because i wanted certain colors.

"I have loved the other tinkerbell movies, cherishing the fact that most (until the pirate fairy one) didn't have a true bad/evil guy. Just some relationship/friendship conflicts that ultimately got sorted out in the end. the life challenges were real and the positive messages clear and meaningful.This movie starts with a warm and gentle beast. Then the director attempts to truly scare the target audience of young kids with irrationally frightful scenes with truly angry and scary beast expressions that don't have much explanation. in one case of tinkerbell getting hurt, it is simply a bad camera angle for the audience. The beast grows devil like horns and wings, again it seems in just a wild irrational gesture to scare the audience even more. Finally the beast redeems himself with some kind actions. the ending has sad moments of death and loss.My young kids (7 and under) were devastated by this and had nightmares the same night. I was hopelessly lost in finding rational explanations as to why the beast looked angry and did seemingly hurtful things. i looked to tinkerbell always to prompt useful discussion about life lessons. this time i was just hugging my kids while they huddled in fear.John Lasseter, I respected you for what you did for Miyazaki's treasures.

"I'm willing to keep it for now but I have my doubts. It probably is better than no case...- this adds a decent amt of weight to the ipad- 2 layer, inside layer is plastic snap-together case, outer is slippery rubber-like- all ports easily accessible (button and volume control are thru the rubber coating but work well)- kick stand is nearly impossible to pull off, thus this feature becomes useless- front plastic covers just to the visible screen edge- does come with stylus pen which doesn't work that great- color does look cool- very good price compared to otterboxOverall, I want to like the case, but 2 things make me concerned. it adds a decent amt of weight which would potentially make the ipad more prone to dropping... also you would think the cushion layer would be on the inside and hard casing on the outside. Most 2-layer cell phone cases are such. The screen is the crack risk when dropped and having hard plastic directly against it wouldn't seem to make much sense. Admittedly otterbox makes a defender case that also has a hard first layer against the screen.Only time will tell. My son breaks enough things that I will definitely be ""testing"" this one out many times.UPDATE 7/2014:---------------I bought 2 of these for 2 ipads both screens cracked after <6mo of use. this is unlikely a coincidence. both cracked on the edges where this plastic inner layer covers. I believe as above that the hard plastic inner layer is DEFINITELY not a good idea. I recommend avoiding all cases of this type. should be TPU/silicon/rubber inner layer first.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O5AAIQBVJPUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8RV1SI#wasThisHelpful","R1O5AAIQBVJPUS","AHCL2WVP0FIY9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHCL2WVP0FIY9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is an anime about a young boy who enters the world of Go by accident. Also a fun insiders view into the world of Go in Japanese culture.

"This yo yo actually would be pretty awesome... if not for a purposely built in design that will shred the string.GOOD:- spins fast and easily- string is regular yo yo quality, solid- good weight- slight butterfly style design to make it more forgiving then the bell shaped ones- it can be twisted open to change the string which is awesome for a yo yo- the center spindle looks like a ball bearing type mechanism which probably explains the sound below and who it can spin so well and smoothlyBAD:- makes a noticeable metallic churning sound as it spins, i don't mind but i see other reviewers don't like it. it isn't high pitched, just noticeable. again like i said not a bad thing for me...- each half has spike like plastic triangles protruding into the middle just a few mm away from the spindle. as it spins i'm certain these spikes are rubbing against the string on each side. thus the string lifespan goes way down. why the heck would anyone design it like this? i can understand smooth bumps if it were to help keep the yo yo centered as it spins, but these are sharp and spiky. it makes no sense at all except as a built in feature to purposely reduce string life. For now i've put scotch tape over each spike to blunt them a bit. i might switch to white electrical tape if this doesn't work.OVERALL:Again if they would simply change the spikes (remove them or make them smooth bumps) this yo yo would be awesome as long as you don't mind the noise. So an awesome yo yo made awful by one design flaw.

In other areas we've placed 1 of them on near our master bathroom toilet so our 5 year old can use the bathroom at night without fumbling for switches. In our pantry they allow for better view while searching for that can of soup you knew you had 2 days ago.The motion sensing feature works nicely and has a decent range allowing you to stagger placement where one light will provide enough coverage to allow you to set off another light along the way.Overall a very nice addition to any home where you need extra light or want to use them as safety lights.

"When it comes to my screen protectors I always prefer tempered glass. Using a touchscreen with a plastic film to protect the screen removes that smooth, sold feel one gets when scrolling and tapping and creates unnecessary and unpleasant drag. Tempered glass, once applied, is the next best thing to a completely naked screen - but, how many of us want to take such a risk? Not many I would say.In reality, the investment of any electronic warrants the purchase of a tempered glass protector on your screen. Should you suffer that unfortunate collision with your keys or maybe that horrific mating of pavement and your lovely device falling face first, tempered glass screen protectors really do aid in protecting from scratched and some of those less harsh blunt force shocks to mid-screen.The Pandaren works really well on my Vita and the fit is quite precise only allowing for a small margin of error when applying. The best way I've found to apply is to use 2 pieces of tape to hold the protector on the Vita once you've managed to find that sweet alignment. Use the tape to create a temporary hinge allowing you to swing it away, clean that screen one more time, remove the film and swing into place. Press the tempered glass in the middle and watch it adhere like magic. Your Vita is now happy and less prone to the malicious nature of life.I must add that, to date, I've gone through two of the screen protectors. One met an unfortunate end when my Vita was in my messenger bag and grazed against my archery release which scratched it pretty deep. The second kept my screen safe when a desk lamp tipped over hitting my screen. In both cases the tempered glass was sacrificed leaving my screen in perfect, flawless condition!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GSWAU2PQCPYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJFLY94#wasThisHelpful","R1GSWAU2PQCPYY","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Trophy Take Spring Steel 2 Pro was my first choice when setting up a new target bow. The consistency of a fixed blade, lizard tongue style rest is known among the archery community and when one takes a moment to evaluate the setup of serious archers to the pros you can see that a fixed blade is the go-to arrow rest.The Trophy Taker Spring Steel 2 Pro incorporates mirco-adjustment capabilities via a set of micro-adjust knobs that are held by set screws. Simply loosen the set screw and you can easily and confidently make the necessary adjustments without having to fully remove any screws or worry that your adjustments will be so tedious that you settle on anything but spot-on.The range of micro-adjustment is a bit awkward at times when one is moving between the set ranges; the availability of micro-adjustment is limited to the movement of the set screw within a small area. Once you've reached the maximum range for the set screws current hole you must remove it entirely and set it into the next range hole. This process isn't entirely difficult or tedious but you do have to then back down the micro-adjustment to cover the lower end of the range you were trying to achieve.Overall, a great buy. I've found that my grouping is beautiful and the ability to truly fine tune with the use of some measurement tools such as a goniometer for the blade angle and a micrometer for the center-shot really work well together.The consistency of the arrow flight can be seen immediately once the rest has been tuned and I even found it rather forgiving when realizing that my center shot had been skewed when traveling with my bow and sending off a few arrows with only minor issues in impact point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVUP4JG1FKF1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DQRVBO#wasThisHelpful","RVUP4JG1FKF1V","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Simply amazing.I've returned to archery after many years and I traversed from wrist strap releases to thumb and finally hinge style back tension. I couldn't be happier with my choice to change. I honestly never thought I was ""punching"" my thumb release which I enjoyed and found gave me a more consistent and sold anchor. The very first shot with the Backspin showed me just how much unnecessary back pull and shoulder flexion and abduction I was applying with my follow through after release. It was a significant amount; enough to make me realize I needed a hinge style release instead to make me focus on form, timing and really applying a gentle pressure through the valley to the wall against my anchor point instead of trying to pull with all my might.The release does take some time to get used to and you need to focus on your hand positioning as to not suffer a misfire while drawing your bow back. The mechanism is simple and easy to understand once you actually see the release. A small adjustment to the moon makes for a good amount of change to the release sensitivity in my experience and I would suggest making incremental adjustments over the course of adapting to the release rather that simply setting it ""hot"" and thinking it will be safe.After shooting about 100 arrows with the release I will say that I won't go back to wrist or thumb style releases at this point and will be selling them off to purchase a back up Backspin as I always like to have two. I may try the 4 finger or other variations.I will also add that the bearing finger hole really does reduce drag and makes for a smooth action when rotating to set off the hinge and hook. A great design!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17XA5YSD84SJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRY2AIW#wasThisHelpful","R17XA5YSD84SJ1","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this release after finding that my grouping wasn't what it could be. After some research I opted for a thumb release and I really wanted something that reduced  torque against the d-loop. The Boss X 4 finger is comfortable to use, the option to customize the trigger travel and sensitivity really makes a big difference in use and consistency.On the very first use I really did notice a big difference in my grouping which has improved each day. My anchor point is more consistent and my form has improved which you will hear from many people once they transition from a wrist based release to a hand release such as the Boss X.I've used both the 3 and 4 finger version of the Boss X and I have yet to choose a favorite really but I think it comes down to personal preference as does a great many things in archery. I will say though the benefit of the 4 finger is that it can be used with 3-4 fingers so the versatility is a plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXX6J4A0TKT15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGRNMDU#wasThisHelpful","RXX6J4A0TKT15","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A quality quiver that sits just right and I've fit up to 16 arrows in it. The extra pockets come in handy and it has one large zippered pouch, a smaller zippered pouch, a pocket that is really nice to just drop a hand release in and up near the belt loop section there is a place to store pens and small objects. Not shown in the picture is a belt loop hook that can attach to your pants or pocket without having to use a belt. This addition works well but is not as stable as attaching to a belt.Overall the build quality to date is sturdy with a solid feel. Using the hook attached to a belt loop the quiver hangs a little lower and does sway but with a single, narrow point of attachment this is to be expected. The large zippered pocket and the large pouch in the front both fit my 4 finger release well without having to squeeze it in or struggle to remove it. My arrows sit well in the tubes which have a triangular rather than circular opening which stops them from rolling around and eventually falling out; this shows some forethought in design over my daughters Bohning hip quiver which arrows eventually roll out from all the movement. You won't have this as much with this quiver because honestly the arrows barely move and as you remove them they shift towards the apex of the tube which locks them in place a bit.As of right now, I'm quite pleased with this field quiver. I've never liked the feel of a hip quiver because I feel like the arrows are a distraction and in my way when I walk. A field quiver solves this by placing the arrows behind you and it just feels more natural for me. I expect this quiver to last a while due to the build quality. Should things change, I'll update.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y5P7AJ7Z0QM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JTPT5G#wasThisHelpful","R1Y5P7AJ7Z0QM7","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This bow was a disappointment really. After opening it I was initially pleased; the bow is well designed and balanced with a great feel and finish. The draw is smooth as you'd expect from a single cam system with a solid back wall.Unfortunately, like the other customer stated, my bow too began to wear with only 9 shots.

The dials are convenient and accessible and the handling is amazing and intuitive.I had previously sold my XPro1 and X100s, somewhat bittersweet with my decision. I love the X-Trans sensors, the retro design and handling but...I couldn't live with the AF speed which, quite frankly, utterly annoyed me to no end. Not only do I use my gear for pro work but I do keep them handy for those candid moments where I want to capture my 4 year old doing something goofy. Don't get me wrong, when I did capture an image the quality was second to none. But, the focus used to hunt so much and lock on 50% of the time that I had to part with my Fuji's.I promised myself that ""If they fix the AF issue, I'll sell my other gear and be a Fuji lover once again."" Not only have they fixed the AF issues but added WiFi which I love for fast uploads and use of a smartphone as a remote shutter.A weekend with the X-T1 and I was sold. Fuji, unlike any other manufacturer, listened to their customer base. They dealt with and improved the AF issues and included more useful features.My only gripe...the ISO dial is a burdensome, round, hellish thing. But one can live with this and learn to deal with the minor quirk. I wish they lock on the ISO dial had the ability to be unlocked for more freedom but it really is a small issue.The XT-1 has me happy and I am drooling over the X100T which I preordered in the hopes that they AF is as fast, if not faster, than my XT-1.You can't go wrong with this camera. Fuji continues to update and my suggestion..pick up the black XT-1 now and upgrade the firmware in December when they electronic shutter and Classic Chrome features of the new Graphite edition are available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OYYAA2TYGC99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYAL84G#wasThisHelpful","R1OYYAA2TYGC99","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up at a local store since it seemed like a good option over a pistol grip for my camera. As a mini tripod that costs $25 I'm not all that sure what people expect it to do. It holds a camera steady as a tripod and offers a stable hold as a grip. Its a no frills, easy to use tripod. Costing $25 you should realize that it is made out of plastic and isn't a carbon fiber mini tripod with an included hydrostatic ball head with a clutch design...lets be real people.Some state the ballhead isn't smooth and is ""sticky."" If you look at the design the metal is textured to assist with increased grip and decreased creeping with your camera attached. One look at it and anyone would see this was done for a reason.The button is not simple to push but upon taking it apart the mechanism is designed this way to allow for the maximum hold in consideration of the materials and obviously the price point.This holds my OMD EM5, GX7 with a Panasonic 35-100 without issue. My 7D with a nifty fifty shows minimal creep but it does hold well.Overall this mini tripod does what it claims to do and for the price its actually a good deal!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROWRUG21LM76H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLXV5JU#wasThisHelpful","ROWRUG21LM76H","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this for an upcoming trip and prior to leaving I opted to put the battery pack through some testing to ensure I wouldn't be stuck without power for my tablets and phones.Charging takes some time but considering the capacity of the unit I'm not surprised. Initially it comes partially charged and I was able to charge my Galaxy Note 3 about 2.5 times before I needed to charge the battery itself. One of the advantages of this battery over my Energizer brand ones is that this unit charges with the same cables you use for most of the devices; namely a micro USB male cable. Charging took about 8 hours and the indicator light shows 4 blue LEDs to reflect a full charge.On a single charge I was able to charge my Note 3 twice and my three Note 8 tablets each once with some residual charge still available to top my phone off later on in the day.The added LED flashlight is a nice touch and although gimicky I did actually use it once when searching through my messenger bag for my keys when I returned late at night from my trip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4KBF3I466214/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICECLJY#wasThisHelpful","R4KBF3I466214","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Note 8 was the tablet that I found to be the most used and yet the only issue I had was that I prefer to keep it in a simple sleeve in my messenger bag. Doing so had me worried about my screen breaking despite using a screen protector film.I have used tempered glass on my other devices and I've always found that on Samsung devices they interfere with the proximity sensor which causes problems with the use of many of the tablets feature such as Smart Stay. Many tempered glass products, being fully transparent glass, tend to simplify the manufacturing process by making a sheet of glass that has no cutouts and only conforms to the overall shape of the tablet. The TechPro is a bit different in that it has a cutout that allows the front sensor to be unobscured allowing your sensor to work at full capacity.Installation is quite easy and from experience I have learned that not only should you clean your screen but you should also use low-tack blue painter's tape or masking tape to remove any residual dust from the screen that you may not notice. By using the tape you can ensure that the screen protector will go on flawlessly without any imperfections beneath.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OZIT7QZMXRNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EULPX34#wasThisHelpful","R1OZIT7QZMXRNZ","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the things I notice as my use of tablets increases is that I prefer to keep them in a sleeve and not in a bulky case that takes away from the design and tactile feel of holding the device. Since my tablets aren't used to the extent of my phone I don't mind keeping them bare whereas my phone is contained in whatever affords me the most protection.I purchased this case, obviously, for my Note 8 which is carried with me in my messenger bag, neatly tucked away and safe. I chose the simple sleeve because I wanted to protect the device from scratching that may occur against my camera or lenses I always carry. The sleeve does what it should but I must note that it does not have a solid insert on the screen side and is indeed a simple, soft, flexible sleeve. It is because of this that I purchased a tempered glass screen protector for my Note 8 to bolster the screen protection.If you want a simple case that lets your tablet roam naked and don't need the protection of an Otterbox or such then this is a decent case for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36XULP4F7S15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDF2O4O#wasThisHelpful","R36XULP4F7S15","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this for my wife as a gift since she is a huge fan of the Instax series by Fuji and I myself have always loved Fuji's color representation in film.The printer is small, light and pretty portable making it something I would consider bringing to a party or event where it would be fun to share the pictures with others. Setup is straight forward; you insert the film which can only be done one way, insert the batteries and turn it on. On your smartphone you install the app and it walks you through the process of connecting to the printer.On my first try I was able to complete the process in about 6 minutes from batteries, film to printing with my Note 3, my note 8 tablet and my Nexus 7 tablet. Unfortunately on my wife's phone we had some issues that took a while to figure out and she has the same phone (Note 3). After some investigation she discovered that her settings for WiFi connectivity were not the same as mine so we made some changes and the printer worked well afterwards.Overall the printer is gimicky but you don't buy such a device for prints to hang on the wall. The Instax series by Fuji brings the fun of Polaroid to the film and color quality you find with Fuji and the Instax Share printer allows you to basically turn any picture on your smartphone or tablet into an instant print which is fun.And just a suggestion to anyone interested in it,...purchase extra batteries. Plus, no film is included with the printer so that is a necessity if you want it up and running upon receiving it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R377VNDHPZS17K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HV4Z0SA#wasThisHelpful","R377VNDHPZS17K","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since giving up my iPad to help decrease the number of OS I use I found that my preference to keep my tablet ""naked"" more and more appealing. I find that holding the Nexus 7 without anything obtrusive makes for a better experience. In my search for a simple sleeve with closure that would protect my Nexus 7 (2013 Model) I came across the Corduroy Sleeve and find it to be very simple yet useful.The material used maintains a decent amount of rigidity, the closure is secure and I love the fact that thought went into how the tablet would charge when in the case...hence the cutout at the bottom.If you are looking for a simple sleeve for your Nexus 7, this case is a win.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21FHM50GSSDHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GT48Z44#wasThisHelpful","R21FHM50GSSDHH","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So basically in my transition from stay-at-home Dad back to working professional I found that I couldn't entirely give up my Daddy diaper bag which allowed me to carry around everything I needed to carry for my toddler plus a few things for myself. I transitioned to a regular messenger bag and picked up Guess one as well as a David King messenger. Both are great bags and do the job but neither really fit what I was looking for in terms of size, style, durability and use. The Tumi T-Tech is my go-to messenger bag and allows me to carry my things such as a Fuji X100s camera, battery, cell phone, small first aid kit for my toddler, snacks, a change of clothes for my toddler, cell phone back up battery and a bluetooth dongle. I can usually fit more and the bag doesn't feel bloated. The strap is very comfortable and fits my rather broad shoulders very well. I never leave home without it and just recently bought a second one so that I have a backup should my first suffer some sort of injury. The warranty offered by Tumi is excellent as well...basically in the first year if you damage the bag in any way at all it gets fixed or replaced. Who can complain about that?

Plenty of space available now in my phone and I can keep movies and music local.

"We purchased two of these for our SG4's hoping to have an item that removed us from the dull glide we felt when using our phones as well as the unpleasant rainbow effect petroleum based plastic screen protectors all seem to have. In the beginning we loved them. They do disable the gesture/eye sensor on the Samsung line of phones but the protection and smooth use led me to feel that these were a fair trade. The MIME glass felt as though you were using your phone with a naked screen. Our fingers slid across the screen in a nearly erotic fashion. I told and showed everyone our MIME glass...but then one day my wife removed her phone from her purse that had been sitting on her desk only to find the screen protector had shattered. We felt that maybe her case had caused a fracture so we simply removed it using a piece of tape only to find that the screen protector had actually gouged the plastic rim of the SG4. Very upsetting to say the least.But we let it go. I kept mine on the phone not giving the incident a second thought...until just the other day when I removed my phone from my pocket to find that the portion beneath the button on the face of the phone had cracked sending fracture lines throughout the screen protector and scratching the button on the face of the phone in the process.So while the glass has added benefits of a clearer view and a more pleasant tactile experience when using your phone you may find that the MIME glass can damage your device should it break leaving you not only down what you paid for the screen protector but with a phone that is of less value due to damage. I lament my purchase honestly. We re-sell our devices each year and to date have never had damaged devices and now we have two. Sad. Disappointing. Annoying.....but a learning experience nonetheless.Stick with plastic screen protectors.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B9RAOZ8J79QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUNZW0C#wasThisHelpful","R1B9RAOZ8J79QR","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this since I am on a year long epic of having a single, detailed tattoo completed on my leg. The first 2 sessions I took my time to shave my leg and slaved away at a process I, as a guy, am unfamiliar with while my wife stood by and giggled in the doorway. Now, 3 sessions later, I've decided I simply can't take the time to shave my leg which with all my fumbling can take 15 minutes or so. Plus with my tattoo now in the works I can risk cutting into it due to a slip. enter the Bodygroom Plus; a simple solution to my problem. Because it is shaped like a regular razor it is intuitive and the cutting head can be moved in both directions which means you expend less time and effort to get the job done.

"I recently traded in my Samsung Galaxy S3 and with it my lovely case that I had grown so accustomed to over the last year.After purchasing my Galaxy S4 I had hoped to use the same brand of case but was surprised to find that they won't be available until mid June if not later.I searched over the selection available on Amazon several times; I must have read every review at this point and was beginning to feel that my precious phone was going to be left unprotected in all its wonderful and yet terribly shiny-natured slickness. Quite honestly, the SG4 is just begging to fly from one's hands with the finish that Samsung has chosen. This phone is not to be carried without a case in my opinion.Just when I was about to give up the search I came across the Obliq case, read some reviews and placed my order. I checked my mailbox daily hoping that it would be here instantly and eventually when it did arrive I tore into the package right at the mailbox.The case is excellent! Build, feel in hand and aesthetics are amazing. I love the matte finish which feels better when handling the phone than some of the cheaper alternatives that are shiny and just as slick and unwieldy as the phone itself. I feel that my phone really is protected in the case.Some mention that the buttons are a bit hard to operate and I too had the same problem but with some use, some adjusting and finally several applications the case did sit well against the buttons and I suspect that in a fashion similar to my UAG case the Obliq is going to function very well as it is used more and more on a daily basis. In comparison to several other cases I have tried the buttons are actually more responsive when in the Obliq rather than in some other brands that make the functions feel stiff and unpredictable. But again, be patient, break in the case and give it a day or so before you give up on it. You will be pleased.UPDATE::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::OBLIQ  VS  UAG::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::So as of July 6, 2013 I have my phone securely placed in my new UAG case.  UAG went out of their way to address some of the minor issues such as the buttons being quite stiff. Now, in comparison to my Obliq case the UAG is far superior. The fit is excellent the UAG feel strong and durable while giving you incredibly easy to use buttons without having to press too hard. In fact the case snapped in place and the buttons worked immediately which I cannot say for the Obliq case.I opted to try the UAG because the Obliq case just never really broke in well. The buttons were still stiff after use and the case just felt smooth and slick without any grip at all so when you try to use such a case the pressure you apply when adjusting the volume can cause the case to slip from your hands. Not a good combination.The UAG case however just fits right, requires no adjustment and is easier to hold without fear of losing grip. The Obliq is nice but the the UAG just simply does it better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JF3PCUYDD1LR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OHSGLE#wasThisHelpful","R1JF3PCUYDD1LR","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must preface this by saying that I am a pro photographer. My taste and needs have changed over the years and no longer am I carrying around a clunky DSLR. I have opted instead to arm myself with the incredibly capable OMD-EM5 for the majority of my work, a Leica M9 for those days where I feel like being more of an artist than a photographer and now as my everyday camera I have opted for a fixed lens and have purchased the X20. Over the years I have shot several film Fuji's but never a digital and I am pleasantly surprised by the quality. When researching my OMD I did consider the xPro1 but let it slide since I really needed an AF that was more responsive for work needs.The x20 does not disappoint in terms of AF speed. Most of the time it is quite fast and when it does not work as quickly as Fuji claims it is still quite acceptable in terms of speed and I have not missed a shot. I am not one for DXO marks or running through a spec sheet but prefer to work on camera selection based on what I can see and feel. You know you have a wonderful piece of equipment in your hands when it just feels right and the images impress you upon viewing them before any post processing work has been done. I felt that way about my M9 and my OMD files and now with the x20. The lack of an AA filter really does well to increase sharpness and the firmware does wonders in terms of reducing noise and moire. I honestly say that I was incredibly surprised with the image quality of the x20 and in comparison to my OMD and M9 files I can't say that this was not a wonderful purchase. The zoom range is sufficient for most encounters, the constant aperture of f2.8 is a wonderful feature and the camera honestly feels like a nice solid piece of equipment rather than a cheap piece of plastic.The x20 will be the camera I keep in my messenger bag so that I have a digital with me at all times. I feel that in addition to the film camera's I keep either in the car or my bag this will keep me quite happy for some time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K5U58OWX0K8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AV3XH9W#wasThisHelpful","R2K5U58OWX0K8H","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've read all of the other reviews and its interesting that those who don't care for this guide book fail to mention that it does indeed cover more ground then the manual. It is, as one would expect, an ""expanded"" manual...which is pretty obvious considering the name of the book. So I fail to comprehend the reviews that are less than flattering when the author/publisher made no great claims that this was a plethora of untold M9 knowledge.So yes, it is the same information you can find in the manual but ""expanded"" in regards to depth of information on a specific function with supportive guides, instructions and visual aids to help a newcomer to the M9 learn about the camera. I've shot Leica's before in digital and film and I found the guide useful.Plus it does contain information regarding subjects such as lens selection, post processing of images, available accessories and other info that is not going to be covered in a guide.If you're curious, pick it up. Leica users tend to be a fickle crowd who pride themselves in being inherently brilliant simply because they own a Leica rather than being capable photographers. We all start out learning somewhere and this particular guide is a good start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IBXVH7EYOYJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1907708065#wasThisHelpful","R3IBXVH7EYOYJR","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Probably the shortest review I've ever written simply because the lens is incredible and you have to feel it in hand and use it to realize the difference and also because the time I spend on the review I would rather put into playing with the lens!So, this is a Leica and you realize that the minute you hold the lens. The build quality is second to none! I opted for the silver since the vast knowledge of Leica info online affords one the experience of many and from what I have discerned the silver lens is brass, the black aluminum. Brass is a much more substantial metal and weathers use well while from my own experience in dealing with aluminum for various projects I have come to the conclusion that aluminum is not as robust or forgiving as brass. As for the color difference and use in street photography, I don't see anyone really noticing a difference considering the size of the lens and any camera it will fit onto.The IQ is impressive. So much better than any Canon or Nikon I have used in the past and the manual focus is smooth and responsive; a pleasure to use and only enhanced by the added focusing tab. Barely noticeable is a slight softness in the edges that you have to really zoom in to notice and essentially sharp at f1.4 which is the reason why one purchases a $4k lens in the first place.So in keeping this short...if you can afford the lens I suggest you buy it. Rumor and history has it that the prices go up nearly each year. The new M is on its way and lens supply is sure to dry up. Best to make the purchase now and have the lens rather than be on the waiting lists that will surely be popping up in the next few weeks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL3XH3H6105ZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000U9EXT0#wasThisHelpful","RL3XH3H6105ZS","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love reviews that destroy a product simply because people don't take the necessary precautions nor time to figure out something for themselves. Any phone that requires this adapter obviously should be used with a standard SIM card...and if you use anything else you are assuming some responsibility for your device and any subsequent failure.But, I digress and stand down from the soapbox.These work. They do what they are supposed to and don't take a enormous amount of time, effort nor thought to use properly.And...to remove them, take a moment, study your device and...wait for it...BE SMART.Here is the problem most people seem to be having: The contact pins in many phones were designed to accept a standard SIM. With this in mind the adapter (any adapter) cannot make up for the small gap that will exist between the SIM and the adapter itself. I don't care what you use or do, this is not something that can be helped.So here is the safe way to remove the device from most phones. Obviously I only have a limited number of phones I can test this on and you should take some time to study your particular device to see if this will work. I take no responsibility for any problems.Cut a small piece of plastic longer than a SIM but close to the same width. I used a piece of screen protector film with the peel away backing still in place. Such a film is flexible and thin enough to slide between the SIM and the contact pins. You need something this thin because you are going to use it to help assist your SIM with adapter into place and out of your phone if you are removing it.The idea is simple: use this film to push down the pins and to provide a safe insertion and removal. For my wife's blackberry and Galaxy Note I placed the thin piece of film into the SIM slot. Then I inserted the SIM and removed the film. This ensures that the SIM is seated properly in the phone. If you want to remove the SIM you simply insert the film BENEATH the SIM card, push all the way to make sure it is under the SIM completely and between the SIM and the contact pins. Gently remove your SIM while keeping the film in place. Do this right and your card won't rip the contact pins from your phone.Not brain surgery. Just a few moments of thought.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZWROAO30Z9EV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003THJQVU#wasThisHelpful","R1ZWROAO30Z9EV","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a pro photographer and have shot Canon since I went digital. Before that thought I shot an OMD film and truly loved not only the quality of the Olympus film camera but the quality of the build and beauty of the design. Since the onset of digital, cameras have been clunky, large and heavy to contain all the necessary buffers and electronics...or...they have been made into small, portabale packages that barely contain any usefulness nor adequate image quality to be of any use to me.Carrying around a DSLR is wonderful as you are prepared to shoot at a pro level. The major downfall is that there really is no truly portable DSLR. To be truly prepared with a DSLR you need your array of lenses, kits and bag; not a portable solution. If going out to shoot and do nothing else one can always pack up the gear and go. BUT many pros and amateurs and snap and shoot photographers want to be able to take good pictures at parties and other events without being burdened with the necessary bulk of a DSLR.I chose my pro DSLR's for their features, image quality and the weather seal features and over the years they were great for dayss when I prepared to carry them around with me or had a shoot. I began bringing my camera with me less and less and eventually my gear never left the house for any family event because I simply got tired of carrying it around. My wife however had a more protable, Canon G11 which is pretty close to a DSLR in terms of function and image quality....I was so envious of the portability of her camera but hated the point and shoot feel and look.I wanted LENSES!!!!!!!So I opted to pick up a PEN hoping a return to Olympus would be as satisfying in digital as it had been before in film. I chose an EPL-1and while I loved the image quality the AF was slow. The lack of an attached EVF killed me as being a pro I longed for a viewfinder. Shooting with a screen at times is ok but for composition, for stability and true use of ones skill I really enjoy a viewfinder. On nearly all MFT camer systems a viewfinder is either an optional accessory or nonexistant.So the EPL-1 went back; I wasn't sure if the camera was the issue or the design but I couldn't live with a camera that wasn't ready to take a picture when I was. I lost too many shots with the EPL-1.The OMD EM-5 solved my problems and more!Fast AF. EVF as part of the camera and not something I have to remember to attach. Image quality that rivals my Canon 5D Mark 2 and has the magnesium alloy body and weather seal of my Canon 7D. Awesome lens selection of quality, fast glass and the focal lengths that cover the necessary range...and of course enough prime lenses to keep me happy.So what did I do? I sold my pro gear. The OMD has actually replaced, quite easily I may add, my 2 pro camers and all of my lenses.There is a saying among photographers about how the best camera for you is the one that is actually with you. The portability of the OMD means I can take it on a shoot, hiking, out to parties and everyday I have it in my messenger bag with me. Being able to have a pro quality, weather sealed camera with me all the time means my skills improve daily. I shoot everyday now.The kit 12-50mm is also a versatile lens but I love my primes as they are fast and the image quality is beautiful. I keep my 45mm 1.8 on the camera and bring the kit lens for when I suspect rain or shooting around water so I have a totally weather sealed setup.And when Olympus claims to be the fastest MFT camera available they are by no means exaagerating. The OMD EM-5 is fast. if it wasn't I wouldn't have purchased it. The bokeh with the pirmes is as smooth and dreamy with a prime lens as on my Canons and in RAW format I couldn't believe that the quality was actually better.As I mentioned before the lens selection for MFT has been something that was lacking in the early days of MFT. The great thing about Olympus is that they are partnered with Panasonic on lens design. So not only are you able to use Oly lenses but Panasonic as well. The lens selection is excellent and I can't imaging anyone not being able to find the speed and focal length they need.Honestly, I won't go back to a DSLR at this point and I definitely will be in line when the next OMD comes out. My love for Olympus has been rekindled!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SX3K0V0YCW6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074WDDN8#wasThisHelpful","R1SX3K0V0YCW6P","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have no doubt that should my phone take a leap it is going to be protected by this case. It covers every part of the phone besides the screen and the fit is very good. Putting it on the phone isn't a huge issue and overall its a good case. My preference though is the Ballistic case which is thinner and lacks the bulk of this case. This case feels like my phone took a bath in a vat of marshmallows. But all in all I do think this is a nice case and if you want protection with a kickstand then its a definite good buy. If you don't need the case with the kickstand and want the same protection and less bulk then I would say go with the Ballistic case.So I'm editing this in the same day. I tried to take this case off and although easy to put on it is a major pain to remove from the phone. I had to use a credit card to slip between the pieces of the plastic housing and slowly apply pressure until it came off. Go with the Ballistic case. Just as effective and goes on just as easily as it goes on and feels just a bit more solid.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDEHGE3WIHT4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008APG7MW#wasThisHelpful","RDEHGE3WIHT4S","A29TSPI4U7YV9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29TSPI4U7YV9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You know those industrial brown tri-fold paper towels you find in the worst filling station restrooms? Well, they feel like unicorn down compared to these Genuine Joe paper towels.

You wouldn't think something this thin and weak could be as rough as they are, but the surface is quite uncomfortable rubbed over the skin.Once wet, they simply disintegrate.

"They Artaste 48490 Vertical Rabbit Lever Style Corkscrew is attractive, hefty and more difficult to figure out than necessary. I have owned several rabbit style openers over the years and all of them were designed differently than this one.The Idea of this type of opener is that the ""jaws"" of the opener clamp hard onto the neck of the bottle allowing the screw to insert and lever out the cork in one smooth operation. The problem with the Artaste opener is that unlike the other rabbit openers I've used there are no horizontal handles to provide leverage when clamping the opener to the neck of the bottle. This means that if your grip loosens even slightly, the screw will unwind from the cork instead of remaining seated as the cork is pulled out.A simple set of graphic instructions and a short description of the process would have gone a long way toward solving the problems, although the basic design makes the opener more difficult to use than necessary.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGE45TWC2XSM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQI3Q1I#wasThisHelpful","RGE45TWC2XSM4","AMRMK86X3PKXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMRMK86X3PKXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The T-fal IG400051 Ice-Cream Maker makes good homemade ice cream. That's the bottom line. With a couple of notable exceptions, the device is well designed and produces a product that hard-freezes well and has a small ice crystal size that makes it smooth and creamy.I have owned a couple of the Cuisinart brand ice cream makers over the years. This counter-top churner produces as good an end product, but takes a little more doing to get there. The Cuisinart design is better, The T-fal price is a little lower. In the end it's pretty much a wash for me.The basic idea is the same. You freeze the bowl for a few hours (overnight is best) then you assemble the machine, add your ice cream mix and begin the churning. Be sure not to over fill the container. As the ice cream freezes it will spill over the sides if it gets too full. You also need to make sure not to over churn the mix. The impellers on the churning paddle do not scrape the walls as efficiently as they could, so if you let the machine go past the point of soft-serve consistency, it will leave a thick layer of rock-hard product on the wall of the bowl.The design of the snap on cover could also use some work. The ""twist lock"" buttons that hold the cover in place are small and it takes some considerable work to get them to line up correctly and snap into place.All things considered this ice cream machine does the job for a good price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H2GGRNB7AG4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZMO2Y8#wasThisHelpful","R1H2GGRNB7AG4C","AMRMK86X3PKXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMRMK86X3PKXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using set top boxes for streaming video for years. The very first version of the Roku streaming box still sits on the TV stand in the livingroom and is still used on occasion. The technology has advanced considerably since those days. In the bedroom, I have the current generation of the Roku box. It is much faster, with higher resolution, better WiFi and , in general, a much better value.In most ways the Panasonic DMP-MST60 Smart Network Media Streaming Player harkens all the way back to the earliest days of video streaming and that's not good, not good at all. First, It is deadly slow. Frankly, I wouldn't have thought it possible to make a contemporary digital communication device that works this slowly. Whether it's the processor, software, the WiFi, or a combination of all three, this thing takes forever to accomplish anything.The Panasonic DMP-MST60 Smart Network Media Streaming Player has many compelling features, but they either don't work, or work so poorly that it's as though they didn't exist.Network drive mapping is a joke, it is convoluted and unnecessarily difficult and in the final analysis, just doesn't work right.The lack of composite outputs means you can stream Pandora, but only listen to the music over the TV speakers.The web browsing feature is equally frustrating.  It is slow, hard to navigate and lacks support for Flash.The remote is set up poorly, the device tends to drop the network connection and it just comes across as clunky and hard to use.I have always considered Panasonic as a good brand for electronics. The Panasonic DMP-MST60 Smart Network Media Streaming Player makes me take a step back from that assumption. With all the new and infinitely better streaming technology hitting the market right now, I would definitely give this unit a pass.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CVXV3SUJ7Q73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXXOBEK#wasThisHelpful","R3CVXV3SUJ7Q73","AMRMK86X3PKXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMRMK86X3PKXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really looking forward to trying these Royal Family Mini Soft Cake, Brown Sugar with Walnut. For those of you who have had similar treats before disregard the following, but for the rest of us, I'll try to describe the experience.The ""cakes"" are about the size of a small walnut (oddly enough). They come in a small cardboard box in a sealed plastic tray. As soon as I broke the plastic seal, the most wonderful smell arose from the package. It was brown sugar, caramel, walnuts and molasses all rolled into one. I picked one up between my fingers and popped it into my mouth. I tasted like......nothing. I chewed a little longer.....and still nothing. After a few more seconds there was the slightest hint of nut flavor, but that was it. It was not sweet at all. Seriously, how can something labeled as ""brown sugar"" be in no way, sweet? The flavor wasn't objectionable, merely totally absent. It's also astounding to me that anything with such a delightful and enticing aroma, could have basically no flavor at all.As far as texture goes, do not think of this as a ""cake"" in the western sense of the word. The closest analogy I can come up with is ""Turkish Delight"" or gummy candy.I am a sucker for brown sugar in all it's many forms and uses. I am equally fond of walnuts. This treat smells like both and tastes like neither.  .","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KR5IO63OEIP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFTD49U#wasThisHelpful","R1KR5IO63OEIP2","AMRMK86X3PKXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMRMK86X3PKXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While there's nothing wrong with the Hunt's Chili Kit, that's sparse reason to buy something. As far as I'm concerned, the 10 seconds of time saved by not having to actually reach for the separate ingredients as you walk through the grocery store don't add up as a reason to go in this direction.That says to me that it must be something special in order to justify the purchase. On top of that this ""kit"" is considerably more expensive than these ingredients would be in my local grocery. Add in the extra packaging to throw away and this needs to be one special chili to make it worth it.In a word it's not! Now don't get me wrong. There's nothing wrong with the chili this kit and instructions produce, but you could say that about chili made from the instructions on pretty much any seasoning envelope in the grocery store spice isle pared with canned tomatoes, beans and hamburger.

"I have used French Press coffee maker for many years. As far as I'm concerned they produce the best flavor of any method of brewing that I've found. The Francois et Mimi Single-Wall Stainless Steel French Coffee Press (34oz) is as good as any of them in producing a great cup of coffee and at this price it is a real coffee making bargain.All French press coffee makers suffer from the problem of bleeding heat after making the brew. Double walled makers retain heat a little longer, but in the end no press is intended to hold the coffee after brewing.There are two very simple ways to prevent the coffee from getting cold after brewing:1. Only brew as much coffee as you will drink at one time. When ready for another cup, just add more grounds and hot water.2. I simply brew a full pot and pour it directly into an insulated carafe to hold at temperature while I have my breakfast.The Francois et Mimi Single-Wall Stainless Steel French Coffee Press (34oz) works very well. The plunger grips the walls of the pot precisely doing a good job of separating the grounds from the liquid. It is as easy to clean as any press I've had and seems well made.

"This Sunbeam Quilted Polyester Heated Mattress Pad is great. It fits the contours of my double pillow top (top and bottom) mattress perfectly and stays on regardless of the amount of wallering I do on any given night. The pad evens out the surface dimples of the aging mattress perfectly and provides just a little extra cushioning.The control unit is placed just right for my purposes and the lighted controls are easy to find in the dark and easy to use. The pad heats evenly and the range of temperatures is perfect. From lust a tiny bit of warmth to a very steamy ""basting"".I find the heated pad comes in particularly handy on very cold nights when the chill seems to seep in from the outside walls. The warmth of the pad applies direct heat to my back (which doesn't hurt my lower back pain either) and is trapped by my covers producing a very pleasant ""cocooning"" effect. I'm generally pretty good about turning off the pad after waking, but it's good to know it will take care of it if I forget. This heated mattress pad is a welcome addition to my world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA4WYJ3X1E0WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FHW8P94#wasThisHelpful","RA4WYJ3X1E0WZ","AMRMK86X3PKXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMRMK86X3PKXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Coast FX412 Frame Lock Folding Knife 4-Inch Blade, is a perfectly serviceable folding knife, with a couple of compromises that keep it from earning four or five stars.First, it is far too large and heavy to make a good pocket knife. While the size and heft give it a ""solid"" feel, it also makes it a little on the clumsy side for carrying in a pants pocket and since it doesn't come with a belt clip or sheath, it's probably best as a bench or toolbox knife.Second, The locking mechanism is not totally reliable. At the point of the handle where your thumb naturally rests is a split where the two parts of the metal case meet. The rear portion of this metal ""leaf"" is bent slightly inward. When the blade is deployed it is meant to click into place behind the base of the blade, locking it in place. The first few times I opened the knife, it failed to lock at all. After a few more openings, it did start to lock and after I pushed the lower end of the case leaf inward a few times, it locked more reliably. While it seems to work alright now, The potential consequences on one's fingers of a lock failure, make me a little squeamish about using the knife in situations that put much ""stress"" on the blade lock, limiting the knife's usefulness.My knife had good fit and finish. The metal parts were all clean and free of burrs or crags. The wood was smooth and properly finished for a tool meant to lay against skin during use. The screws were properly countersunk and the knife had a proper ""starter edge"". This is not a high-end piece of German cutlery, but for the price and in the right situations, it will get the job done well enough to justify its very reasonably price-point. Within seconds of publishing this review the price increased from $7.00 to $22.00. $7.00.....you bet, $22.00.....forget it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HSVABDBDF2FU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHI6SW2#wasThisHelpful","R3HSVABDBDF2FU","AMRMK86X3PKXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMRMK86X3PKXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a ""chili head"". I do not enjoy heat for heat's sake. I do like spice (seasoning). This Arriba Red Salsa, Medium is a very bland condiment. Not only is there essentially no heat, there is very little seasoning at all. The overwhelming flavor is that of cooked tomato. The ingredients list jalapeno as the second ingredient, if that is the case, there must be a tiny amount, or extremely mild peppers. I cannot detect the onion or garlic at all. This is a very ""un-chunky""  salsa. it has a very smooth, pureed texture and flavor, with a few very small pieces of vegetable mixed in. I have eaten salsa since my childhood in southern California back in the early 60s. In my experience there are two basic categories of canned or jarred salsa.1. Cooked salsa. This sauce has a smooth, uniform texture (more like tomato sauce). In order to be good it must be very spicy, not necessarily hot, but heavily seasoned.....and heat doesn't hurt.2. Fresh salsas. This sauce has a chunky texture of tomato, onion and pepper pieces floating in a thin tomato ""broth"". In order to be good, these salsas must have a bright, fresh flavor with lots of high notes.....and heat doesn't hurt.This is definitely a ""cooked"" salsa, with very little seasoning or heat. There is nothing objectionable about it. It doesn't taste bad. It just doesn't have much to recommend it. If you're into the steamed hamburger and Colby cheese school of Mexican food, this is your salsa.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IDR4RPKA38E6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIVY3FW#wasThisHelpful","R1IDR4RPKA38E6","AMRMK86X3PKXD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMRMK86X3PKXD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I study three different martial arts. I enjoy the physical and mental exercise you get from them. Meditation can be great for focusing your mind, not just for martial arts, but in all parts of your life. I was happy to find this book, a well-written picture book to introduce meditation to children and teach parents and kids how to get started. Ms. Thomson wrote the book for children and the bold illustrations (some drawn, some real-life), quirky formatting and varied font give this book definite kid-appeal. The exercises are simple and well-explained but I think it would work best if a parent helped their children in getting started. There are fact boxes and extra information placed randomly through the book. I liked it because it taught you more than just how to do meditation. The book is more than a guide, it has a story. It follows a orphan named Mitchell who has to deal with some of his emotions. The reader learns to mediate along with Mitchell. It adds a nice dimension to the book. I recommend the book to parents and children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HRLJ1LNAKMX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615320643#wasThisHelpful","R3HRLJ1LNAKMX0","A1F2SEN1CNDLYB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F2SEN1CNDLYB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Finn needs to step up. But Can he?What I Thought- I kind of feel sorry for Finn. His dad insists on him becoming a Legend Hunter, even though Finn doesnt have any interest in being one. He wanted to be a veterinarian. Not necessarily good for a job that is passed down the family in the last town that still gets invaded by monsters (every so often). The story had a good plot, and some humor (basilisks are apparently raised to believe that their stare petrifies humans. In reality they are small fat lizard-things that stop and stare at humans trying to petrify them but they end up just getting caught). I liked the book. It had a good amount of twists and turns. I didnt see the major ones coming and I enjoy being surprised by plots. At 416 pages it is a middle grade book that readers will sink into.

"What I Thought- This was a chilling book. Its a take on the Robin Hood legends, but with more of a malicious tint. The book is definitely for young-adult readers, but I would say that its for 13 year-olds and older. There is a hint of horror, but not enough to be considered a horror novel. I like how it is a medieval setting, with no magic (there are potions and poisons, and Robin, who became blind, has a sixth sense that allows him to see), but there are gods, and a forest that is somewhat living, controlling how long you are in it. It has an intriguing cross between supernatural and legend. The story is good and solid, although sometimes Robin seemed a little too angry. There is some fighting, and murder, but nothing gory or graphic (although Robin at one point, wasnt in control of his mind, and killed in cold blood.).

But it isnt until Elis best friend Randy suddenly leaves town with no explanation, only leaving a cryptic note, that Eli starts to suspect things. He soon finds out, with the help of other classmates, that Serenity isnt a charted town. Everything in it is fake. Everything theyve been told is a lie. Even who they are.As a science experiment over nurture-versus-nature, they took DNA from the worlds captured criminal masterminds, and cloned them. They would then raise the children in an environment devoid of evil to see if they would be nice, respectful citizens, instead of evil geniuses. Did I mention that the idea of cloning was made illegal internationally?Its funny, that in sheltering people from the truth, when the wall breaks down, they turn into what you hoped they wouldnt.*What I Thought- This is an interesting book. Its very original. The concept is cool, but kind of creepy, too. I mean, kids being cloned from modern criminal masterminds to discover the answer to nurture vs. nature, is kind of awesome, but also disturbing. It really made me think about the whole story. Cloning is not something to be tampered with. The creepiness of the plot really sets the stage for the whole story. I couldnt put this book down or get it out of my head.

"What I thought  This was a well-written resource for anyone interested in baseball or history in general. It is organized and flows well which is  quite a feat considering the amount of information packed into the book. The text is easy to follow and is referenced well.

"Synopsis- Steven Lee had no idea what he was getting into when he stumbled upon a huge underground warehouse-thingy where some strange ceremony is taking place. He somehow gets involved in a hidden battle to stop a power-hungry man who is now one of the most powerful men on Earth. The powers of the Zodiac animals were released into the world to find their perfect host, and the Tiger has settled in Stevens body. Several of the receivers of the power are agents of the evil man  a man who holds the most powerful power  the Dragon. Steven needs to think fast, harness his new powers and stop the madmans plot.What I Thought- HOLY GUACAMOLE! This was a great book! I am a HUGE fan of Stan Lee so I was all over this book when it came out. I am happy to say, this book did not disappoint! Mr. Lee and Mr. Moore have crafted a riveting story packed with comic book action, fighting, mystery and super powers.  There is just the right amount of realism in the book to keep the reader thinking this really could be happening. Mr. Tongs red, black, and white illustrations pop-up throughout the book. They look cool, and get the story into your head more. They give the story even more depth. The characters are well-developed, and were fun to read about and get to know. There are three planned books in the series. The ending of this book is quite a cliff hanger, but there is enough wrapped up in the story that the reader is not disappointed.  A lot of kids and adults will read this just because Stan Lee wrote a middle grade book. For a kid-comic book fan like me, it was just what I would have wanted.*NOTE* I got a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REDFS96B2N6YO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423180852#wasThisHelpful","REDFS96B2N6YO","A1F2SEN1CNDLYB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F2SEN1CNDLYB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why I liked this book- This is a funny picture book that shows animals walking around in their underwear. Polar Bear has lost his underwear, and cant remember what it looks like, so he and his friend mouse (wearing red undies) set out to find it! They find lots of underwear, but they all belong to different animals! Seeing what the animals are doing, and the little bit of text about it (for example: Pigs underwear  Nom nom nom. Its Pigs underwear! (pig is eating)), will have young kids cracking up! The illustrations are slightly wacky, and will make kids laugh! This book team really makes it work!

"I am a huge fan of Ms. Grassos books. She writes fabulous adventures for young people that make you keep reading. The action was non-stop! Caramel is a great main character that one really wants to know more about. She interacts with her friends in a positive way, and is always curious! I like that the characters travel into space in this book. The story was a quick and easy read for me, but a fun read. Ms. Grasso s writing style keeps a smooth flow to the story. The plot is solid and keeps you interested in the story. This is the third book in the series, but it can be read as a stand alone.

"What I Thought- Wow  what a great opening book for a new series. This was a fun book that really keeps you reading. There is plenty of action to keep the reader interested and a great plot and terrific writing to get you into the story. Tommy, Benjamin, and Sebastian are great characters that you really cheer on. The setting of the new world (the magical world they get taken to right after they meet each other) is fantastically described and makes you wish that you were there! Mr. Gibneys writing is solid  he gives you enough background to have you understand the characters and plot without dragging the story down with too many details.  I like how everything falls into place as the story goes on. The characters make you smile and feel that the Brotherhood is in good hands. The writing and dialogue is realistic. Mr. Gibney is a great author who I cant wait to read more from.The website for the new series  The Brotherhood and the Shield  is worth checking out. There is information about the first book and the series.

"Why I liked this book- I know this may surprise you, as I [normally] am not the hugging type of guy, but I really liked this book. Mr. Mack has written and illustrated a funny, cute story about how a skunk doesnt like that a bear is liked more. I like Skunks top hat. :) The story is really nice, and would make a great read-aloud. The pictures are warm and fuzzy (there are a bunch of woodland creatures  why WOULDNT it be fuzzy? ;) ) and make you smile. To me, it feels like a fairy-tale a bit, mostly because Skunk has a top hat (I WANT that top hat!!!). Mr. Mack has written another great story.

"(reviewed by my little sister) The reason why I like Glitterbelle so much is because I like princesses and she is pretty and she has good best friends (Angel and Dazzlina). I also like her dog, Bob. :) I also REALLY like the illustrations in the book. They are like cut outs all put together. I really liked the storybook too especially because of the pictures.

"Synopsis- 13-year-old Alex Tice didnt know what to think when two government officials came to his house and one of them telepathically talked to him  communicated just by thinking! The other one seemed to brain-wash his parents. Apparently, Alex is a gifted individual  he has a genetic mutation (that usually skips a generation) that causes the mutated being to have superpowers. All superpowers are charted and numbered. Alex has a unique power  he can absorb others powers if he is in close proximity to the other superhero. Because of this, he gets taken to a government-run camp for other nearby powered beings. He makes new friends there and quickly learns to use his power.What I Thought- This was an amazing book! I love how it clearly explains how people get their powers and sets up the story perfectly. I like the cover a lot too, but I dont like how Alex looks more like 9, 13. Alex is a great main character who you come to care for. While the characters are 13+, the story is completely appropriate for younger readers and I think kids 8+ will totally get into the story. Ms. Smotherman has written a fun and adventurous story about a fantastic group of superpowered teens saving the world. There were some well-executed plot twists and turns. The book is a quick read, but a good one. It is perfect for reluctant readers that like superheroes! This is another example of a very well edited and thought out self-published book.*NOTE* I got a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXON09WWWMV8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501002031#wasThisHelpful","RXON09WWWMV8T","A1F2SEN1CNDLYB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F2SEN1CNDLYB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I Thought- This was a marvelous conclusion to the Genius Files. Mr. Gutman knows how to pull the reader into a story, and then completely throw you off your guard. Mr. Gutman has narrated the story in a funny way, he tells you right from the beginning that Coke will get thrown into a volcano (which actually happens in Chapter Twenty). Mr. Gutman injects a lot of humor into his stories. I really enjoy his writing style. It is helpful to read the other Genius Files books before reading this one, but not necessary, as Mr. Gutman pretty much brings the reader up to speed. Coke and Pepsi have changed a lot from the first book to this one, and it really shows  I like that their personalities developed over the series.  There are pictures throughout the book of real-life places that the characters went to  some of which Ive been to (but some not) which are a nice addition to the book.

"For those of you who do not know what VOLTRON is, it was a cartoon (a cartoon my parents grew up with and loved) about a team of 5 space defenders that rode around in mechanical lions but then the lions combined to make VOLTRON the awesome evil fighting robot. I actually have a VOLTRON toy. :)This book explains the awesomeness of VOLTRON well and would be pretty interesting for anyone interested in anime. This amazing collection of all things Voltron  TV shows, the beginning, toys, comics, etc. The book is in 2 parts  the first one about Voltrons behind the scenes creation, and the toys, and the second part about the TV Show history of Voltron (what goes on in the TV Show).

"Summary- Duke, a cute and friendly red beagle, tells the story of how he and his adopted human, Matt, help other animals by driving them all around the United States to be with their new families. Duke and Matt have been together since 2009. They rescue dogs from puppy mills, shelters and dogs that the owners cant take care of anymore. This story tells kids how Duke and Matt work with many other volunteers to transport dogs to safe places.What I Thought- This is a wonderful nonfiction story. It really makes you smile  partly because of the cute pictures of dogs in it, but also because of the happy story. It does mention puppy mills, but describes them in a kid-friendly way (the mommy dogs only have puppies, and they cant leave their crates)  some of the dogs are not cared for correctly etc. Mrs. Paglia wrote a great story that informs you in a simple way about dog rescue, told from the point of view of Duke the beagle. The story covers a part of animal rescue that a lot of kids (and maybe some adults) dont know about  how dogs are matched with adoptive or foster families, sometimes way across the country, and how the dogs get to their new families. There is a ton of resources in the back of the book that covers everything from what rescues are to definitions of terms to the geography of the United States! This is an uplifting, informative book that both adults and kids can enjoy.*NOTE* I got a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH29PHUX6KM8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500292605#wasThisHelpful","RH29PHUX6KM8N","A1F2SEN1CNDLYB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F2SEN1CNDLYB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Synopsis- Jax Aubrey is unique. He and his guardian Riley Pendare/Pendragon are Transitioners  people who are able to experience a special eighth day (nicknamed Grunsday) between Wednesday and Thursday, and have a family magic talent (Jaxs is inquisition, Riley has the voice of command, etc.). They are able to protect (and fight) the Kin  super-powerful magic people, all with different talents. Some Kin, like Evangeline, are good, while some Kin are evil and want the eighth day to be the only day.All was going well, until Jax (who was in hiding)s former best friend, Billy, was kidnapped because he knew Jax. Not only that, but he was kidnapped by Jaxs uncle. And Jaxs dad had told Jax that he had no other relatives, besides his mothers cousin, so what is going on? When Jax is forced to join his family, and the evil Transitioners that they serve, he cant believe it. They work for the enemy and they want Jax to join them. But, Jax is loyal to Riley and Evangeline.What I Thought- This was a very thrilling book. It explains a lot about Jax, and Transitioners in general. There is a lot of mystique added to the plot and the characters. Jax, especially in this book, is a character you can care for. His family is working for the enemy, and they want Riley and Evangeline in their clutches. The story draws you in, and gets you asking questions. The story is appropriate for all ages, and the publisher rates it for ages 8+. But there is a lot going on in the plot that may make it a bit hard for younger readers.

"Synopsis- Before, Jayden was an orphan who had lived on the streets. Now, he lives in an ultimate school/campus called The Sanctum, run by the kind elderly man, Avando. Jayden has lived there for about a year now. The school, while devoted to education, also helps fight terrorism with advanced technology. Jayden and his friends help with scouting out and fighting the terrorism, from a distance of course (using robot people and remote hacking, etc.). But things start going wacky around The Sanctum, and it looks like the technology that they have is glitching and the schools super computing AI, Scarlet is acting wonky. What if the technology is being used incorrectly? And who would do that?What I Liked- This was a fun, adventure-filled book  as good as the first one in the series! While you dont need to read the books in order, it would make a little more sense to do it. Jayden and his friends are wonderful characters, and everything that they do is realistic, and they are all strong characters. The terrorism fighting is an intriguing plot line. There is implied violence in the book, nothing gory (the kids fail to save a hijacked passenger plane from crashing into the ground, but save it from crashing into a crowded building, just into a field, and the newsfeed they watch afterwords implies that people died). Its nothing that a tween couldnt handle. The book also uses d*** (or d***mit) here and there  no other cussing. The story itself is a good one with a solid plot. The title of the book threw me. Scarlet is the super-computer running The Sanctum, with amazing Artificial Intelligence, and I thought she would be rebelling in this book, but thats not the case. This is a highly enjoyable action series and another example of a well-done self-published series.*NOTE* I got a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U33DV87NHAAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500305189#wasThisHelpful","R2U33DV87NHAAJ","A1F2SEN1CNDLYB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F2SEN1CNDLYB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The illustrations are quirky and fun to look at. I like how the white page is really paper for the crayons to draw on. That was pretty cool. This is a wonderful book, and I was happy to review it.

"Synopsis- Malcolm Little was 6 when his father fell onto the tracks and died. He was 12 when he was separated from his mother and siblings, and forced to live in a foster home. His family who always told him he could be anything he wants is gone. At 15, he left for Boston to find a new life, and he does. He gets going with the neighborhood kids, and becomes known as Red. He starts in on reefer. Then he catches a train to Harlem, and becomes known as Detroit Red (he was from Michigan). Now Malcolm is learning how to run the numbers as a hustler. He was doing pretty good, but soon enough, everything spins out of control.What I Though- Wow. Just wow. This was an amazing fictionalized novel. I really didnt know about Malcolm X before reading this book. This book covers his life from early childhood up to his early 20s. The writing is compelling. It really captures the feeling of the time period. I like how it shows the way the Malcolm saw things and how he handled them. While the book is definitely a young adult (cussing, and Malcolm drinks and does drugs (smokes marijuana), etc.), it is still a very well-done story, and is appropriate for a mature 13-14 year old, or just 15+ for reading level. I like the parts where it shows how Malcolm Little turned into Malcolm X. It was a very inspiring story about a person overcoming adversity. It was pretty cool that Ms. Shabazz is Malcolm Xs daughter, and she got information about the book by asking her fathers relatives and friends from the time before the X. Realizing the book is a work of fiction, it made me want to find out more about Mr. X and his life so I read some books suggested by my history and English teachers. While I found many of his adult teachings and views are controversial, I think any book like this one, that gets a kid to read more about the subject is great. The overall story in this book is one of a young man trying and failing over and over, but still pulling himself together in the end. Ms. Shabazz captures the story of a young Malcolm X in a riveting story.

"Synopsis- John Degraffenreidt and his Night Buddy, Crosley (of Night Buddies Amalgamated) are back from their last adventure! After getting almost-attacked by the escaped Iguana Gang member from book 2, John and Crosley are hungry. Hungry for some pineapple cheesecakes. But when they get to the pineapple cheesecake factory, they find Big Foot Mae (the owner and runner of the factory) lying on the floor looking up at her star-puzzle (it shows all of the stars and their current positions) on the ceiling. There is a strange white dot in the sky, and its moving from the Corkscrew Constellation to the Houndog Stars. The Night Buddies team need to investigate it, and pronto. After all, what if the mysterious dot is hostile? They go get into a borrowed racing blimp and go high  sky high!What I Thought- This is the third book in the Night Buddies series. John and Crosley are a great team and it shows that nice relationship in the book. The idea of the Night Buddies and the programs (A.K.A. adventures) they go on is cool and very kid-friendly. The black-and-white pencil-sketch illustrations spread throughout the book are a nice touch. The story line was good. I like how John and Crosley solve their problems. Like all the Night Buddies books, the different fonts of the typed words leap off of the page adding to the fun of the story. The plot moves along and will keep kids interested in the story. This story takes place directly after book 2, but at first I didnt realize that, until a bit later in the book. I didnt really care for how the story ended because it left a few too many loose ends hanging (I know a book should leave something for the next book, but I like to have a bit more ending than what was here).

"I have an elderly mother in her 80s that has complained about respiratory issues caused by her heat pump.  I stumbled across this product and decided to give it a try.I'm not a professional HVAC guy, but, can hold my own.  Before installing the UV Light, I spent 3 hours cleaning the evaporator coils with a bleach solution to eliminate any mold that may be present.  Then I mapped my installation strategy.  I see where some people have installed the UV light within the duct work.  I have no idea how air passing over a UV light that fast could possibly radiate airborne particles.  My strategy was to install the UV light on the supply side of the A Coil with the idea of preventing mold growth on the wet coils during the cooling season.There are certainly smarter people than me who can shed some light on the proper installation of the product.  When I called the customer support line, I was connected to an off-shore tech support that didn't seem to really understand how the product works and only provided several different ways of installing it.The product reviews are good and Amazon usually only ships & sells good products.  Time will tell if the product actually works in Mom's case and I hope someone can validate or invalidate my installation theory and skepticism of this UV light being able to radiate air that passes so fast across its path.For now 3 Stars until there's enough data to draw a judgment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BOKUW5RZV1WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DIYZE8S#wasThisHelpful","R1BOKUW5RZV1WZ","A1D57TSKTBBBJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D57TSKTBBBJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These work great if you are careful.  Have the following items ready for a solid outcome:1. Have clean hands.2. Have a clean toothpick handy to position the patch.3. Have a sharpie handy to mark the puncture area.4. Have alcohol ready to clean the area.StepsA. Identify the puncture by using air in the tube.B. Use a Sharpie to mark the puncture using a 2"" diameter circle.C. Sand the area within the circle using the enclosed sand paper.D. Clean the area with alcohol.E. Inflate the tube slightly so that it is about the size it will be when it is inflated inside the tire.

"I wouldn't throw out your wingnuts just yet, but, there are situations where these can be quite handy.  Case in point, I had a contractor that cut into a 2"" X 12"" base plate to install a dryer vent.  Long after he had gone, I realized a circuit was dead.  After suspecting & finding the cause (yes, he cut the circuit in the wall), I was able to use a set of these connectors to splice the circuit within the wall.  It was a challenge performing the ""surgery"" within the wall with one hand (meaning cutting back the sheathing).  However, without this connector, the alternative would have been to open up the wall and use conventional wire nuts.There are other situations when installing a new switch or fixture that uses stranded wire where these connectors won't work.  It appears to be based on the thickness of the strands; thinner strands just won't push in and in those cases, the trusty ole wire nuts continue to be your best friend.Regardless, the Wago connector is a good product to add to your electrical assortment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WLFQATYHYWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ILS14K#wasThisHelpful","R10WLFQATYHYWD","A1D57TSKTBBBJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D57TSKTBBBJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Does the job but two annoyances:1. Case Missing - just a PIA to have a wad of probes/wires just sitting there.2. Poor Probe Connectivity - a simple Continuity Test using only the Probes provides a disappointing experience.  Multimeters that I've had for 30 years produce a very clear audible sound when touching the probes against one another.  Not this unit.  You have to ""scrape"" the probes together to get a good enough connection to hear an audible sound indicating no resistance.Otherwise, it does the job and the wrist/forearm strap can be somewhat useful.

"1. The unit does not go into sleep mode when the clamshell is completely closed.  Therefore, the iPad and keyboard batteries continually drain while the clamshell is in the closed state.

This unit is charged using an old MINI-usb (not a far more common micro-usb) connector.3. This unit does NOT come with a power supply (only the MINI-usb cable).4.

"I've used many bluetooth headsets.  Although there are features about the M50 that are appealing, overall it is quirkie when paired to my Samsung Galaxy Note 3.Pros:- connects quickly- persons on the other end of the call say I sound clear- fairly comfortable once positionedCons:- sound quality (at least on my unit) is poor- sound volume is low compared to competitors- bluetooth range is very limited compared to competitors- Google Now integration when button is depressed is hit or miss and flawed- music quality is very poor- situating it on the ear takes some practice and not nearly as easy as Motorola's H730When compared to the Motorola H730, the M50 just doesn't cut it.  The two negatives re the H730 is that it uses the older BT 2.0 technology (so no music audio; not a big deal to me) and the H730 is quite fragile (don't drop it).  Otherwise, the H730 is a slam dunk winner over the M50.

"I love the unit.  Solid and lightweight.  The problem identified on new units that some have complained about is apparently associated to the O-ring within the regulator.  I suspect the reconditioned units have fixed this design.  For others having this problem, the solution is to purchase a 2-211 sized O-ring from your hardware store and replace the regulator O ring.According to someone who posted instructions for this:- remove upper plastic housing- unscrew the pressure relief valve (this will give you enough room to get a wrench around the pressure adjust unit)- unscrew the regulator adjust knob- remove the white disc with the crappy grooved O-ring- discard the grooved O-ring and replace with the 2-211 sized O-ring- reassemble and you should be back in business","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8MKEXTKJ68C8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPPVRR4#wasThisHelpful","R8MKEXTKJ68C8","A1D57TSKTBBBJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D57TSKTBBBJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, Home Depot carries this exact product under a different name for slightly less money.  It is referred to as a ""boiler valve"" and will fit many Laundry Room washing machine water supply fixtures.  For the price, convenience, and peace of mind to easily shut off the water supply to your washing machine while not in use, this is a no-brainer.The change out is easy, but, may be time-consuming depending on the clearance you have within the Laundry Room water supply housing.  You'll need a pair of channel locks to remove the valve and either a pipe wrench or a large pair of channel locks to secure the female base pipe.  It is critical that you not allow the female end of the base pipe to twist or you may damage the pipe within the wall.  Of course, before starting anything, be sure to shut off the main water supply to the house and allow a lower faucet to drain the lines before performing the change out.  Be sure to use Teflon tape on the pipe threads to create a good seal.  It may take an hour to do the job, but, if it prevents a flood, you'll have saved countless days dealing with that. It's a good insurance policy in addition to changing your washer hoses every 5 years.If you're not sure how to perform the change out, search YouTube for a how-to video (this is a good instructional: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2grrmHVDsCA ).

"I have had the Hoover Linx for over a year and like it very much.  For hardwood & engineered floors as we use it on, it is very good.  I bought the Bolt for Mom.  After trying it out, it seemed clumsy and I sent it back.  Here's why:- The Bolt's steering is too radical, there's no need to flex and turn to the degree it does; it seems somewhat unstable.- About 50% of the time, the unit falls over when parked in the upright position.  It appears the locking mechanism is defective.- The attachments seem like a nice touch.  But, the pieces don't fit well together, just not refined.- The attachments have no place to be docked. Putting them on the body would add weight, but, Bissel could have provided an organizer to keep them together.- The detachable dust buster is a great idea, but, the execution is clumsy.  You are forced to yank it and push it back into place.  Seems like an unnecessary struggle that engineers could have improved.- The 18v motor in this unit takes about 4 seconds to reach its maximum RPM.  That may not seem like much, but, I found it annoying to have to wait for the motor to get up to speed.- The battery is not removable.  Not a big deal unless you store you vac in a closet.  In that case, you'll need a 120v outlet in the closet to charge it.Final thoughts:I use a 18"" soft bristle push broom on the hardwood floor and use the Link to suck up the pile. That's what works best for me.  In that case, the Link is perfect.  It's fast, light, and easy to grab.  It has a removable battery that slides on the unit, unlike the Bissel which has a non-removeable battery.If Bissel can improve on the issues mentioned above, they may have a decent product.  Both the Bolt and Linx seem to have nearly the same suction power with a possible edge to the Bolt.  I was unfortunately fooled by the wonderful reviews that turned out to be done by people who received the product for free.  If I had received it for free, I would have rated it 5 Stars.Amazon's reviews have always been the most trusted in the industry.

"When you need it, the tool pays for itself.  It works well and here are two suggestions to make it even better:1. There is no need for the turn knob to be threaded onto the stem.  If you have a stubborn valve core, the knob simply becomes loose and useless in the operation of removing the old valve core.  If I didn't have a manual valve core removal tool to loosen the old core before using this tool, I would have been stuck.  At a minimum, locktite should be applied on the threads from the factory.2. The seating of the new valve core on this tool's stem is a bit shaky.  If there's a way to better secure the new valve core onto the stem when installing, that would be a plus.  Perhaps a rubberized catch within the stem to better grab the valve core pin.  During the removal process, it took about 5 tries before the stem was able to ""grab"" the old valve core pinhead and I was able to slide it out with the stem.  Although a bit shaky, installing the new stem worked on the first try.  It is possible that I received a defective tool since it was obvious the one I received had been used before.  If someone can take a close-up pic of the stem that grabs the valve core, that would be great.Notes:  In case anyone is wondering, the removal of the old valve core requires counter-clockwise turning as you would expect.  My application was on the low side of a 2005 Toyota Tacoma 6 Cyl and access was easy.All-in-all, an ingenious tool that does what is intended; replacing a valve core on the low side without the need to lose refrigerant.  The designer of this tool should be smiling ear-to-ear; nicely done.  This is a well made, mostly brass piece.  It's heavy as you would want and produces no leaks during use.  As others have reported, during the operation, there will be resistance on the stem as the refrigerant attempts to escape.  Stick with it and be patient.  It may take a few tries, but, the old valve core will come out.A 5-star tool when you need it that gets dinged a star for the minor improvements it can use.  If you have a leaking low side valve core, don't hesitate to get this tool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OLYAI5UG1L1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002G1UNUS#wasThisHelpful","R3OLYAI5UG1L1Q","A1D57TSKTBBBJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D57TSKTBBBJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the single mode switch as opposed to the dim-bright-strobe 3 mode version (that I have as well).  The silver Cree that I received has a faulty zoom in that it will not stay in the full zoom position once you let the barrel go (it backs off due to resistance).  Also, the zoom on all of these torch adjustable lights are a little funky in that it projects the image of a computer-like chip on the subject being illuminated.  It doesn't hurt anything, it just appears odd.That said, it does it's job, is fairly bright, and small enough to carry just about anywhere.  The fact that it uses a single AA battery is a plus.

"The hose, like most garden hoses, does it job and it looks fairly nice.  Unfortunately, mine does not recoil well on the hose hangout.  I had a 50 ft garden hose for 27 years that coiled very nicely before it finally developed a leak.  I wish I knew who manufactured it.I personally would rather have a hose that coils without curling than have a never-kink hose that is too stiff.  A balance for me is preferred.UPDATE: I was hoping the summer hot weather would relax the hose yielding a tamer, more compliant re-coiling profile.  Didn't happen.  I did find that allowing the hose to bake for about 30 min with full water pressure helps.

"I have used it once for hammer drilling eight 1/2"" holes in concrete blocks.  I obviously am not providing a review on its ability to endure daily use, but, the unit did it's job as expected.  Others who use it more frequently should be able to provide a better idea of it's long-term capabilities.I have most of PCs 18v tools and have been pleased with most.  The batteries have held up well and I hope they don't give up on the 18v line up and continue to make more products that work on this battery platform such as a leaf blower for light-duty garage sweeping.UPDATE (Dec 2013): I used the drill for making holes in ceramic tile and the unit worked beautifully. Porter Cable deserves a good deal of credit for this line of tools. They work well and are reasonably priced (except the batteries).

"I like the concept, it looks nice, but, the execution can use improving.The concept of having a lid that can stay closed when on the shelf is appealing and works well.  The unit comes with 3 different sifters; one is seated on the main body secured by the black screw-on retaining ring while the other two are conveniently stored in the cap.  I use it for flour so I use the sifter with the largest holes (as shown in the product picture).  The problem is that the sifter does not seat properly onto the main body and the black retaining ring does not screw down snuggly onto the sifter to hold it securely in place.  Subsequently, the sifter on mine is loose and sloppy.  Maybe I received a defective unit.  If not, this is certainly an area of improvement for this product.

"UPDATE: I reported the bluetooth issue below and after diagnosing the issue with Alpatronix Support, it turned out to be a defective unit and they are taking care of replacing it.  Alpatronix was also receptive to my suggestion of improving the touch panel as mentioned in the last para below.THIS TURNED OUT TO BE A DEFECTIVE UNIT THAT ALPATRONIX IS REPLACING: <<Orignal Post: While charging and the speaker switch is turned to the OFF position, the AX400's Bluetooth receiver is activated.  This means when your AX400 is charging, your phone will be paired and connected to the AX400 speaker even when the speaker is turned OFF.  Therefore, all phone sounds will be routed through the speaker and not your phone. A problem if, say, the speaker is charging downstairs and you're upstairs.  It also means you won't be able to pair your phone with a bluetooth headset unless you unplug your AX400 speaker (and the switch is in the OFF position).  This is a major logic flaw.  Given that no one else has reported this, it makes me wonder if I received a defective unit.>>With the exception of the Bluetooth issue when charging, the AX400 has excellent build quality and the sound is fine for a speaker of this size.  If your current phone uses a micro USB charging port, the AX400 cooperates nicely by using the same (although they mounted the port upside down for some reason).  I have a Samsung Note2 Android phone and the AX400 works nicely with it when that is the intention.The AX400 has a touch sensor on the top of the unit that controls the Volume and Next/Previous song selections.  The controls work well with Pandora and Google's Play Music apps, however, the backlight is quite dim and difficult to see.  I suggest providing raised or braille-like controls with brighter backlighting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WM4Y9U211BRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHSMHYU#wasThisHelpful","R1WM4Y9U211BRO","A1D57TSKTBBBJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D57TSKTBBBJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The overall build quality is excellent and the case is a nice plus.Although my unit was wrap-sealed, I deducted two stars because:(a) the head unit appeared used with grime on the Hi/Lo shutoff valves;(b) the head unit was marred (not a big deal, but, unexpected on a new product);(c) whoever was in charge of applying the ""H"" & ""L"" stickers to the Hi/Lo shutoff valves didn't bother to place them on the 12 o'clock position while the valves were closed, placed them on crooked, and placed them on grimy knobs (I doubt the ""H"" & ""L"" stickers will stay on very long).

"If you have recessed light bulbs that are difficult to reach because of height AND the bulbs screw in and out easily, this is a good product.  However, like many recessed lights, if the bulbs are difficult to remove from their sockets, this product will not have enough friction on the bulb to turn it.One idea is to coat the socket and bulb ""threads"" with a silicon spray.  This should make the bulbs easier to insert and remove making a product like this worthwhile. Just be sure not to spray silicon directly into the socket or on the bottom tip of the bulb; you don't want to impede the contact surface, and, direct spray into the socket could wind up with a mild electrical shock if your switch is accidentally in the ON position).Another idea to consider: I have my device mounted on a Shur-Line 06570L Easy Reach Extension Pole that allows rapid extension from 4-9 ft.

The H730 is better in every way including:- wearing comfort,- slipping on and off the ear,- call quality for me wearing the H730,- call quality for the person I am talking to (yes, I have compared both units with multiple people on the other end; the H730 was preferred each time), and- button controls (the vol buttons are better on the HX550 but the large command button most used is superior on the H730).I have had plenty of bluetooth headsets and the H730 as of March 2013 is still the best I have tried and I have tried units that cost nearly $200.So, if you're considering the HX550 (which is not bad), you may want to consider the H730 as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OLOTA9I055TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FPT380#wasThisHelpful","R1OLOTA9I055TW","A1D57TSKTBBBJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D57TSKTBBBJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's not the prettiest angle grinder available, but, it does the job when you need it.I had been a Hitachi cordless tool guy, but, Hitachi doesn't seem to have a master plan; meaning they don't have a line of tools that fit a particular battery (it seems hit or miss), and, they are expensive.  Porter Cable, on the other hand, has nicely created an 18v battery system that can be used on multiple tools (their website lists them all and Lowes carries most of their line).  I have nearly all of their cordless tools in this line and they are competent.  I would rate the overall quality of their entire tool line a 4 out of 5 and the value a 5+.  Excellent for the Harry Homeowner that doesn't want to break the bank for occasional use of these tools when needed.  I also suspect they'd hold their own to the pro that uses them daily as well.By the way, Porter Cable's customer service is very good.  I had a battery issue that seemingly wouldn't charge.  They replaced it with no questions asked.  For what it's worth, I later discovered the battery may not have been bad after all.  As it turns out, if you attempt to charge a COLD battery (as in left in cold garage during the winter months), the charger will indicate that the battery is defective.  Solution: let it sit inside until it reaches room temperature and then try charging.

"I was a software developer once upon a time in my career.  So, I was not intimidated by having to program a remote.  Well, after buying the R50. I was so frustrated that I threw it in the drawer and forgot about it.  Then, 6 months later, I saw some pretty good Amazon reviews on this remote and decided to give it another chance.  Glad I did.  Once you get the hang of it, the remote is actually pretty good.  The instructions that come with the remote are skimpy.  After mastering this remote through trial and error, here are some tips that I really think will help you get through:Primer- there are two levels of remote commands:1. Main level2. Sub level (or referenced as ""inside device"" by the remote instructions)Tips:1. Write down all of your devices on a piece of paper such as Samsung HDTV, Sony Blu-ray Player, Panasonic VCR, ...2. For each device in #1 above, search the URC database for the ""best"" code set.  The code sets are stored in the remote.  So, if you have a newer device, there may not be a code set perfect match.  Store the device code set on the ""last page"" of the devices.  So, when adding your Samsumg HDTV, code set ""0656"" may be the best match (only way to find out is to test the buttons which is the most frustrating part). Then label the device, in this case ""HDTV"" and again put it on the last page.3. After you test the device buttons, you may need to supplement the device buttons with LEARNED commands.  The R50 learning mode is very effective.  So, for example, if your 0656 code set for your HDTV does not include a mute command, add a MUTE command inside the HDTV device you set up above using your Samsung factory remote to learn from.4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 above for each device.5. Now, you're ready to do some damage.  Your friend on this device are the MACROS.  Now that you have taken the steps above, you can create macros for just about anything you'd like.  So, here's what my remote opening Page looks like:- Top Left ""Cable""- Top Right ""Air TV""- Mid Left ""Apple TV""- Mid Right ""BlueRay""- Bot Left ""NetFlix""- Bot Right ""Pandora""So, to program the Cable button, create a button labeled ""Cable"" and assign a macro to the button (on the Main level). Once the recording starts, HDTV codes > HDMI-2 code > DONE.To program the Air TV, in my case, HDTV codes > AirTV code > MAIN > DONE.Reading this cold will likely not make sense.  But, I think the tips above will help you if you take your time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFRVL8VCBKXGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KC08AE#wasThisHelpful","RFRVL8VCBKXGU","A1D57TSKTBBBJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D57TSKTBBBJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is yet another very good tool in Porter Cable's line of 18v cordless tools.  I had been an 18v Hitachi fan until they simply could not demonstrate that they cared about their customers by offering few accessories to their 18v line-up.  Porter Cable, on the other hand, listens.  I called to suggest an 18v leaf blower and they appeared quite eager and hungry to please.  They offer an impressive line-up of tools that appear to be very good.As for this jigsaw, I have only one complaint; the safety switch is a pain (it should have been made like the safety lock PC placed on their reciprocating saw).  I therefore removed the safety switch since I don't have kids to worry about (at least not right now).  If you decide to try removing the safety switch, here's how:  1. remove the blade  2. remove the sole plate by completely loosening the finger screw and slide the plate back & off.  3. remove all of the phillips screws on the casing.  Note, all screws are the same size & length except for one long screw closest to where the battery reads ""18v"".  4. carefully remove one side of the saw's casing. Pay attention to the blade mechanism and take a picture of it before proceeding.  If the blade mechanism falls out (easy for it to happen, you can refer back to the pic).  5. remove the safety switch.  6. align the case, fasten the screws, re-attach sole plate, and test.If you have a situation where minors or less experienced people have access to your jigsaw, it is recommend that you do NOT modify the tool.  Of course, modifying the tool will likely void the warranty as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ZFI3BO9OE7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EASJTC#wasThisHelpful","R34ZFI3BO9OE7I","A1D57TSKTBBBJN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D57TSKTBBBJN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although it says ""all Coleman 2 and 3 burner stoves"", it is NOT a great fit on the compact that I own. Yes, you can kind of jam it into place, but it won't be stable, and the wind-breaks don't fit.After looking at it for a while, I decided to make some minor modifications. I ground off about 1/8"" of each outside foot tab on the griddle, and it now fits down inside the frame of the stove as it should (little too wide before). I also used a nibbler to trim a notch into each windbreak panel, so they'll fit around the corners of the griddle and tuck into their retention slots.With those mods, the griddle works like a charm, and my first set of steaks came out great (thumbs-up from the wife and grandkids). As other reviewers have noted, the non-stick makes for easy clean up (even better with grill spray before cooking. After some experimentation, I found that about 3/4 heat on my little stove is the best for meats. This equates to about 10,000 BTU.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24S84BUI0XGPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009PUQ2S#wasThisHelpful","R24S84BUI0XGPS","A2QC1R1PB432QD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QC1R1PB432QD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Turner Diaries is a short novel of speculative fiction.  It's a military fantasy about a time when the U.S. government finally got too big for its britches and had to be called to heel by an Organization that, unlike the government itself, truly worked on behalf of the majority of its citizenswhite Americans.As fiction, the story is of high quality, which is astounding when you appreciate that Dr. William Pierce was not a frequent fantasy author.  He was a former physics professor who abandoned that career to become a real-life revolutionist.  The novel itself is short, but the story it tells is self-contained.It would, in fact, be difficult to imagine a sequel, unless it had to do with extraterrestrial aliens trying to take over the world with guile here, bribes there, stealthy assassinations, and, rarely, with overt force; i.e., the aliens in such a sequel would have to play the part that the Jews played in The Turner Diaries.The Turner Diaries has been blamed for inspiring Timothy McVeigh to bomb the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995.  It's a lie.  Although McVeigh had read The Turner Diaries and had recommended that others read it, his motivation for bombing the Federal Building was watching the U.S. government murder 83 Christian men, women and children inside their church compound near Waco, Texas, on 19 April 1993.  McVeigh testified at his trial that he had been convinced that the U.S. government was too authoritarian, that it was disregarding the Constitution, and that it was time somebody took it down a peg.  He wanted to show the government that there were still Americans who can and will fight against totalitarianism.  McVeigh didn't need to read The Turner Diaries to get the basic idea of bombing: he had been a soldier, a combat engineer, in the U.S. Armed Forces for several yearshe already knew about bombs and their uses.There are lots of examples of military fiction in the world.  In most of them, a building or a bridge gets blown up at some point in the story.  So why do people, such as the Anti-Defamation League, blame The Turner Diaries in particular for violence? Why don't they blame other authors for including similar scenes in their fiction stories?It's simple.  The criticism is a smear job intended to foster a widespread prejudice against the book and anyone associated with it.  The Turner Diaries portrays Jews as agents and sponsors of oppression.  The complainers, who are mostly Jews themselves, don't like being so portrayed.  Even the Jews who run Wall Street and Hollywoodmocking white men and women in movies, in TV sitcoms, and in advertisingwon't admit that maybe some turnabout is fair play.  Worse (to them), it shows determined and competent white people winning a race war against all comers.  They don't want whites to get the idea that they could actually win such a war, because one day white people might have plenty of reasons to fightwhen there are no more places for them to escape minority crime and alien culture.It is from such political motives that the ADL and similar organizations bad-mouth The Turner Diaries.  Every pretext they use when making this criticism is a deception of one kind or another.  In reality, it's a good story.  If you aren't white, then you can use a magic marker on your copy to cover up every instance of the word ""white"" and write in its place whatever other word you'd rather were there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRYCWCVSRKYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4IK61I#wasThisHelpful","R1XRYCWCVSRKYG","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Savitri Devi makes you think. I've always regarded the intensity and longevity of the anti-Nazi hate phenomenon as something suspicious. Most alleged or ostensible villains fade into ""history"" (textbook narratives) within a few decades. But the animus against Hitler and the Nazis has been kept alive and, if not fresh, at least vigorous. One would be right to wonder why that is so.It turns out that the Jews have been profiting from Holocaust propaganda, probably far more than they should have profited. It might also be the case that Hitler was the good guy in the Second World War, and that if England and America had been wisely and honestly led, they would have joined forces with Germany to put an end to Communism, rather than take sides with the USSR to put an end to National Socialism. That might have led to a global cultural renewal of humanity, instead of its taking a downward cultural trend toward degeneracy, as actually did happen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31C5SRIZQWKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UB8HV3U#wasThisHelpful","R31C5SRIZQWKH","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The good side of the Kindle Fire 6 HD is that it is well made, without the cheap feel of most cheap tablets. It radiates competence for doing what it was designed to do.The bad side is that it wasn't designed to do enough.Most buyers will find the basic 8gb storage inadequate, as the OS will eat up a lot of it. Knowing this, I paid extra for the 16gb version, and I'm still likely to be pressed before long. In other words, a memory extension slot for swappable 32gb microSD cards would have been a big help. That particular feature is USUALLY a big help, which makes it something of a mystery why Amazon didn't put one in the Fire.(One imagines that this was discussed among the directors in the boardroom, with them weighing customer satisfaction against their own, with predictable results.)At the moment, I'm using my Kindle Fire 6 HD as a combination music player and backup library. It will let me store and enjoy local tunes and ebooks that I downloaded with my PC and hopped over via USB card. However, it won't let me do the same thing with my videos until the Fire can make connection with the internet. And therein is a major problem.The fault might be with my router. Although my PC connection to the internet is clear, obviously, or you wouldn't be reading this, the router apparently doesn't hear my Kindle Fire. I'm not sure why that is, but it is annoying.So for now my Fire is an alternative ebook reader that can play music.I'd like a programmable calculator app, too, but I don't see one. It would be sort of like a simulated TI-89 or Casio fx-9860gii, with a calculator style BASIC syntax language, suitable for making all the usual code structures that college sophomores get taught in computer science classes. For-next loops, while-endwhile, repeat-until, subroutines, defined functions, global and local variables with alphanumeric names, callable external subroutines, quadruple precision and integer variable types, lists, matrices, and all the usual functions you get with high-end graphing calculators, with the whole screen being available for readout. Maybe the screen can be partitioned so that the NE third of it shows the code, the NW third shows the command line and the output, and the southern third shows the virtual keyboard user interface.A platform like the Kindle Fire could put all existing graphing calculators to shame, if the appropriate apps were written. Again, it is something of a mystery why this has not already been done.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JO79809J4ZYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KC6I06S#wasThisHelpful","R3JO79809J4ZYC","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought a Kobo Aura for $122 elsewhere. The price here on Amazon is too high.

The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (2013) is a four-star eReader. The Kobo Aura is a five-star one.Edit, 17 Jan 2014. A disadvantage of the Kobo Aura is the relatively low contrast of the etext. Apparently, in order to reduce the screen refresh rate, Kobo decided to make the Aura's e-ink print in dark grey. Whereas this is readable, it's a slight strain on the eyes. A really black text is preferable to text that is merely dark grey. You can improve things a bit by increasing the font weight, but in my opinion the Aura's tradeoff between text darkness and refresh rate wasn't worthwhile.Edit, 24 Jan 2014. Another disadvantage has been spotted! Despite its (allegedly) fast CPU, the Kobo Aura slows down quite a lot as you manage your collections if you have a lot of collections. I have 148 collections, and it can be a long wait between touch-triggered actions. Even the NOOK Simple Touch, with its slower processor, is faster than the Kobo Aura while managing collections, given same number of collections on each device.

Either the KOBO Aura or the epub book format that it uses does not render much of the Unicode character set. The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite with the mobi format does a much better job with math expressions that use weird symbols, exponents, subscripts, and such.

"I use my Kindle Paperwhite as my main e-reader. I also own a Kobo and an inexpensive tablet PC (AllDayMall), each with 32 Gb memory expansion microSD cards, as back-ups and as safe storage for my ebooks. But the Kindle PW is the one I use for actually reading ebooks, as it seems the friendliest to my hand. I have acquired four extra Kindle PW batteries from a medical supply website, which are in nested static protection bags (proof against nuclear EMP and remote activation hazards) along with my other e-readers.My main gripes about the Kindle PW is the smallness of the internal memory (only 1.3 GB usable) and the lack of a memory card expansion slot. A place to insert a 32 GB microSD card would just about double the item's value.Another possible improvement to the Kindle PW is the marketing of an optional, separately sold, external rechargeable battery pack with 20,000 mAh capacity. If the claims about the Kindle's energy efficiency are correct, such an external pack would run the device for over 400 hours continuously. (I dislike the way Amazon promotes the ""8-weeks of battery life"" idea based on 30-minutes use per day, with wi-fi off and light turned down low. It works out to only 28 hours of continuous runtime. It would be much more informative for Amazon to tell us this, instead, and let the customer figure out how many days he can make that much time stretch into.)Still, the Kindle Paperwhite is pretty good. I don't know why the obvious ways to make it even better weren't pursued, but I'm sure that it must have something to do with Amazon's profits.Edit, added 29 December 2013. Altered 24 January 2014. Despite my dissatisfaction with the fact that the 2nd-generation Kindle Paperwhite doesn't have a microSD memory expansion slot, I bought one anyway. Then I wished that I hadn't because I saw that the Kobo Aura has 4 gig of built-in disk space (3.3 gig usable), while the Kindle has only 2 gig of disk space (1.3 gig usable) AND has NO microSD card slot! Even the basic Barnes & Noble NOOK Simple Touch has a microSD card slot for holding up to 30000 more books. For what insane reason did Amazon decide to cut the Kindle Paperwhite off short in this way? With a microSD slot, Kindle PW would lead the pack, both in absolute terms and in cost-benefit terms. Without such a slot, Kindle Paperwhite is merely ""okay.""Edit, added 25 June 2014. A bit of extra praise is in order for the Kindle Paperwhite. I have discovered that it will render a fair proportion of Unicode characters, doing a much better job of it than the KOBO eReaders do. If you use an eReader for textbooks that contain math equations with lots of exponents, subscripts, and weird symbols, then you'll probably be able to read them easier with a Kindle PW than with a KOBO reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y7EKODGR0FP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWVXK5O#wasThisHelpful","R2Y7EKODGR0FP3","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pretty standard quality for the 500-(haha)""800"" mAh 9V li-ion battery type. You know most of these batteries are hollow inside and contain the electrolyte in plastic pouches? I took apart a ""780"" (actually more like 600) mAh LightLong battery and examined the innerds. The pouches are smaller than they need to be, so, just guessing, the manufacturers could easily make genuine over 1000 mAh 9V batteries, but they don't.

"The Pak-Lite isn't a thrower, not by any means. But it will give you enough light to get around your camp, and you can't beat it for compact size. With a single-use alkaline or a rechargeable 550-600 mAh li-ion battery, expect about 24-40 hours of light on the bright setting, and much more on the dimmer ""thief mode"" (just bright enough to let a thief see what he's stealing). If you want to make a reading lamp out of it, just tape a piece of white cardboard to one side, so the light going the other way will reflect back on your book.Pak-Lites are quite rugged and will stand up moderately well to prolonged immersion in water. I accidentally left one in the pocket of a pair of pants that I was leaving to soak in water/detergent. When I got it out (after two days), one of the LED's was stuck on ""dim"" mode until the circuit board dried out.

"A ""9-volt"" lithium-ion battery never really reaches nine volts across the poles. The most you can charge it to is about 8.47V, and most of them are full at 8.33V.Maximal Power's 550 mAh li-ion battery ran a Pak-Lite on bright mode for 24 hours, which is about the same runtime that I got from a LightLong 780 mAh and a ONAN 600 mAh battery. The weakling of the bunch that I tested was a Tenergy 500 mAh, which only lasted about 15 or 16 hours.By comprison, Li-ion rechargeable batteries are much better than NiMH ones. The runtime for a Tenergy Centura NiMH 9V battery was only 5 hours with my Pak-Lite set on bright.However, I have discovered an inconsistency in these Maximal Power batteries. I use them to run a Pak-Lite, a snap-on LED cap that works as a weak flashlight. The poles on some of the Maximal Power batteries are too short to snap on the cap securely, causing a poor connection.

"I recently tested four brands of ""9V"" lithium-ion batteries. These Tenergy 500mAh batteries were one brand. The others were LightLong 780mAh, Maximal Power 550mAh, and Onan 600mAh. The batteries were drained from about 8.40V to 5.25V by using a Pak-Lite cap set on ""bright mode."" The same Pak-Lite cap was used for all of the tests.The LightLong, Maximal Power, and Onan batteries all had endurances of about 24 hours. There wasn't much difference between them. LightLong might be puffing its capacity a bit, since you'd expect a 780mAh battery to outlast a 550mAh battery by quite a lot, and it didn't. All three of these brands give about the same performance.Not so the Tenergy 500mAh. Its performance was decidedly inferior, showing a runtime only 2/3 as long as any of the other brands: somewhere between 15 and 16 hours. Sure, they're cheaper.

"Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries of the ""9 volt"" size never actually charge to nine volts. The most you can charge them to is about 8.45 volts, and most of them are fully charged at 8.3V.I recently tested four brands of 9V batteries with my Pak-Lite, which is a cap that snaps on to a 9V battery and emits light from a pair of LEDs mounted on the top. The same Pak-Lite was used for all of the tests, and the bright setting was used continuously.Three of the brands, ONAN 600mAh, LightLong 780mAh, and Maximal Power 550mAh had nearly identical runtimes, at 24 hours each.

The poles on some are taller than the poles on others, so either there is a lack of standardization in the manufacturer, or someone else is counterfeiting. The taller poles are better because they can snap on to things that the shorter poles won't make a good connection with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGRUHV5PI2A8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091UW81E#wasThisHelpful","RGRUHV5PI2A8Z","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Both the Kindle Paperwhite and the Kobo Glo are excellent eReaders. I own both. Compared with the Kindle Paperwhite...Minor points of inferiority:* The Kobo Glo is slightly less responsive to screen touch.* The Kobo Glo's presentation occasionally makes less efficient use of the page.* Kobo Glo takes longer to boot than Kindle Paperwhite does.* Kobo's online store isn't as rich as Amazon is, and you must convert Kindle content to epub with a program such as Calibre (augmented with deDRM tools) before you can read it on the Kobo Glo.* For my devices, the ""fuzzy grey bottom"" lighting problem is a little more pronounced on the Kobo Glo than on the Kindle Paperwhite.MAJOR point of inferiority:* The battery on the Kobo Glo is ""embedded,"" meaning it isn't intended to be replaceable, unlike the battery on the Kindle Paperwhite, which can be replaced. I'm looking into the possibility of hacking in an improvised replacement, but at present I don't know whether this can be done. The original battery on the Kobo Glo has 1000 mAh capacity at a nominal 3.7 V and a service life of 3 to 5 years. (And THEN they want you to buy ANOTHER ENTIRE DEVICE! Not just a new battery!) It sounds like you could run--extending if necessary--the wires from the Kobo's original battery to an externally mounted 18650 Li-ion battery of the same voltage.Minor points of superiority:* You can turn the Kobo Glo's light completely off.* Kobo Glo uses the epub format, which can be edited with a program such as Sigil to correct typographical errors in a book or other document.* Kobo Glo is somewhat more flexible in the choosing of font size, line spacing, and margin size than is the Kindle Paperwhite.* On the Kobo Glo, you can also change the justification of the text: right (off), full, or left.* The Kobo Glo gives the remaining charge on the battery as a percentage, rather than merely a guestimate bar.* You can play chess on your Kobo Glo, the device being your opponent.MAJOR point of superiority:* You can expand the memory of the Kobo Glo by up to 32 Gb with a micro-SD card.It seems to me, now, that neither Kobo nor Kindle exists in perfected form. The Kindle really ought to have a memory expansion slot. The Kobo really ought to have a replaceable battery. Unless a reader exists that has both of these features, along with a reasonable array of other good e-reader features, then the buyer is advised not to buy either of them and, maybe, just stick with paperback books.I swear, I wish I'd never dumped into these electronic gadgets the $4000 or so that I've spent trying to get a capacious, functional, and reliable electronic library for myself. That's $700 for various electronic gadgets, all of which turned out to have unacceptable flaws or drawbacks, and the rest for the ebooks that, at some point in the future, I won't have any way to read.

"Kindle Paperwhite had the potential to be an excellent ebook reader. Even with the intentional limitations and defects, it's still fairly decent.First, there's no SD card slot for expanding the Kindle's internal memory, which limits the user, per storage space, to about 1000 books, unless he takes extreme measures to remedy this defect. For me, the remedy was to buy a Samsung Chromebook--which has its own issues, by the way--and a small SD card drive with a USB 2.0 connector. The Chromebook will mount the SD card drive and the Kindle, though not both at the same time, which lets me transfer Kindle ebooks to the SD card.While it's true that my desktop computer can do this, too, I was aiming for a book backup system that runs on batteries that can be recharged using a solar energy charging system that I've put together. In case civilization collapses, or something, and there's no electric power from the utility company.Anyway, by spending a hefty amount of money ($249), I got that done.Second, although the Kindle has enough internal storage for, perhaps, 1000 books, its file management system doesn't seem robust enough to handle that many items. I had set out on a major book buying spree, loading up my Kindle with all the books I'd already read in paperback and more books that were judged must-reads by fantasy fans. By the time I had maybe 600 books on my Kindle, it had some sort of nervous breakdown. I got a message on screen that said something like ""frame error"" and the Kindle rebooted.I did not have any trouble with uneven lighting. From low to high, my Kindle Paperwhite is very close to being evenly lit.My Kindle Paperwhite still lets me read ebooks, but it has become clear that this device won't serve as a portable library as I had hoped it would when I bought it. At least I can still swap books between the Kindle and an SD card by using my Chromebook.Edited (1 September 2013): The Chromebook didn't work out due to its own hardware/software flaws. I've bought a tablet that--I hope--won't be yet another marketing swindle. Also, my Kindle is back up to 574 books, and so far it's working okay with all of them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WBPPV273MA1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OZNZG0#wasThisHelpful","R1WBPPV273MA1X","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Raymond E. Feist's ""Magician: Master"" delivers a fast pace, action, tension, summary histories of Kelewan and Midkemia, and a very satisfying wrap-up at the end.  In all of these, it excels its prequel (Magician: Apprentice) by a wide margin, but the same characters that starred in the first book (Pug, Tomas, Arutha, Martin) also star in this one, and nearly all of the heroes end up marrying the girl, princess or elf queen of their choice.  They also have grown up and, in one way or another, come into some sort of hard-won maturity and power.The pace of the story is kept rapid, in part, by Feist's leaving out the boring details of days of travel by sea - except when something really exciting happens, like a battle with a warship or a passage through the Straits of Darkness.While ""Apprentice"" was a good book, ""Master"" is a better one and would have been truly great if a bit more Midkemian natural philosophy been woven into the story.  Like: ""Why are goblins nasty?  Are they born that way, or is it something they learn in Goblin School?""The main irritation of the story turns out to be a necessary part of the plot: when Macros tricks the elves and dwarves into betraying the peace conference with the Tsurani Emperor.The major unresolved plot element involves something known only as the Enemy, a vast and powerful entity capable of destroying an entire universe, from whom mankind fled in ages past to colonize other worlds through ancient rifts in space and time.  Macros instigated the betrayal at the peace conference as a means of closing the rift to Kelewan, in order to preclude the possibility of the Enemy using the rift to find Midkemia.Will the Enemy find Midkemia anyway?  Maybe a future book by Feist will answer that question.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2005","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H6L48ZYKHFQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553564935#wasThisHelpful","R1H6L48ZYKHFQH","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Spotlight review by Rich Chiavaroli, ""A Page Turner"", conveys much of what I would confirm.  Raymond E. Feist's book, Magician: Apprentice, is a competently written fantasy story that will hold your interest throughout.  While it is a good book, it is not an great one, and by that I mean there are no moments at which the reader is overwhelmed with passion in sympathy with any of the characters.This is not really a harsh criticism.  Most authors manage it only once in a while.  Piers Anthony, for example, did it only once that I know of: when Mach shouted ""Thee...Thee...Thee..."" to Fleta after she had jumped from the top of a cliff (at the end of Out Of Phaze).  Many stories don't have these superlatively poignant scenes, yet they are still good stories.Magician: Apprentice has three main characters - Pug, Tomas and Arutha.  Pug is the title character, the Magician's apprentice. Tomas is his friend.  After Pug is captured by the Tsurani (about 3/4 through the book), the viewpoint shifts briefly to Tomas, who has found a magical sword and a suit of magical armor that makes a sword-swinging hero out of him.  Later, though, the action leaves Tomas in Elvandar and joins Arutha as he returns to the keep at Crydee.  The rest of the book is about how Arutha assumes command of his father's (Duke Borric's) soldiers and fights off the Tsurani invaders by his heroic and inspirational leadership.Several other characters are very important, including Kulgan (the magician to whom Pug is apprenticed), Roland (a friend and rival of Pug's), and Carline (the princess who loves Pug and Roland...both).Martin Longbow and his fellow tracker Garret provide some comedy on the battlefield as they trick one group of enemies into chasing them into another group of enemies, as mutually opposed to each other as either of them is to the Crydee faction.Pug doesn't do much magic in this story.  After he saves the Princess by casting a spell, he's pretty much a spectator until he attacks the Tsurani by the rift and gets himself caught.The story is fast-paced, interesting, and well-told.  But it is obvious that Magician: Apprentice is a set up for the later books in the Riftwar Saga.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZEUWIQCLMGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553564943#wasThisHelpful","RHZEUWIQCLMGL","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of my review says it all.  If you're in junior high and have attention deficit disorder, then this book might be for you.If you can't ponder life in all its subtlety, if you will miss anything that is not made obvious, if you can't tell what a story character is thinking unless the narrator supplies his thoughts word-for-word, then you should probably read the Dragonlance Chronicles from start to finish.To be fair, the book has an excellent plot.  If you've read Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, you'll probably recognize it.  An archfiend of some description, while trying to conquer the world and bring it under the shadow of his/her evil, searches for some sort of artifact that can either magnify him if he obtains it, or destroy him if, instead, the heroes of the story get their hands on it and dispose of it properly.In order to carry out their purpose, the heroes have some sort of meeting and at some point there is a big war, which, ultimately, is a distraction from the true quest of finding the magic artifact and disposing of it properly.So, yeh, Dragonlance Chronicles uses basically the same plot as The Lord of the Rings.  But Tolkien did a vastly superior job with the storytelling, and LOTR is part of the finest and most definitive literature of the 20th century.  DL Chronicles is a hack job.  As hack jobs go, it's not too bad.  But the characters have a toy-soldier quality, and the story is told in such a way that you can imagine Margaret Weis pushing the Tanis toy-soldier here and saying ""Bang-bang, die you villain"" while Tracy Hickman pushes the Kitiara toy-soldier there and saying ""Not so fast, bring me the crown.""I've heard it said that Dragonlance Chronicles reads as it does because the authors were trying to follow Dungeons & Dragons gaming rules.  If so, then it would appear that there is limited crossover value between games and novels.Readers under age 13 will probably enjoy this series.  The story has a fast pace, lots of (inane) emotion, many (cheap) action thrills, and just enough sex to flatter teenagers into thinking that they're grooving with the grown-ups.  And it's because it DOES have THAT audience that I give this book three stars, rather than one.  But readers over 20 will find their eyes rolling much, and they will soon become impatient with the characters' introspective shallowness, their repetitively knee-jerk hyperemotionalism, with the way the narrative revelations too obviously come from a narrator, and with the frequent shifts in viewpoint.Older fantasy readers will want to avoid Dragonlance and choose Feist's Riftwar Saga, or Modesitt's Saga of Recluce, or George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire, or David Eddings' Belgariad.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FKLF1WPADIPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786915897#wasThisHelpful","R3FKLF1WPADIPS","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I could, I'd give a copy of this comic book fantasy to every police officer, sheriff's deputy, and constable in the world.  The story told is that of a Medieval morality play, in which what is right and what is ""officially proper"" are at odds with each other, as they often have been (and still are) in the real world. The ""hedge knight"" Duncan the Tall is a symbol for every good man who defies or fights an evil System for a noble cause.  The story offers a reminder that while laws are written by men, morals are not, and that the world is sick when one forbids what the other requires.Seeking fame as a knight, Dunk and his recently acquired young squire go to a tournament.  During the games, one of the king's grandsons, Aerion, takes offense at a puppet show being shown by a young woman puppeteer, so he ""arrests"" her and begins to beat her, breaking her fingers, while his guards hold off the crowd.  Duncan hears of the trouble, charges through the crowd, tosses the guards every which way, and falls on the princeling in a fury of fists and feet.Knights must protect the weak and defend the innocent, even if the oppressor is someone with rank.The princeling's guards finally subdue Dunk, and the Aerion has threatened to break out all of Duncan's teeth and then disembowel him, when suddenly Duncan's squire appears and orders Aerion's guards to back off.  And they do.  It turns out that the squire, whom Duncan had known as ""Egg,"" is in reality a prince himself, shamed so badly by his brother's degeneracy that he ran away from home to live among the peasants.Duncan is charged with treason and held in a prison cell, not allowed to participate in the tournament games.  Ancient laws give Sir Duncan the choice, either of having a hand and a foot cut off, or to face the prince in single combat.  Duncan chooses the combat.  The same ancient laws, however, give the princeling an option.  Instead of facing Duncan alone, he can insist that he (and his party) fight Dunk (and his) in a sort of collective duel in which seven knights face seven knights in a joust-like battle -- but with real weapons of war, not with tournament mock weapons.  The battle would continue until one side yields or until all the knights on one side are dead.The problem is that Duncan is a ""nobody,"" whereas the princeling can count on the help of several of his royal relatives and can command members of the king's guard to fight on his side.  When Duncan protests that he knows of no one who will take his part, he's told (by Aerion's father) that his failure to come up with six champions to fight beside him, in the single day before the battle is to begin, will prove his guilt - the idea being that the world is full of good men, and good men always fight for a just cause.It is an assumption that is largely false, and the pretense to the contrary is no doubt highly convenient to those in power.  But, nonetheless, Duncan does find six champions, despite the treacherous defection of one who was expected to volunteer.  The last of the champions was Aerion's uncle, Prince Baelor, heir to his father's throne.  Of all the royal characters, Baelor is the only one to concede that Duncan did right to punch Aerion in the face, and he is taking Duncan's side for the same reason that Duncan fought Aerion to save a puppetteer.The best moment of the book, though, is when Duncan enters the field early and is joyously mobbed by affectionate peasants.  Duncan - never the brightest knight in the realm - asks himself out loud why the peasants love him so well: ""What am I to them?""His answer is a reply from the armorer who made his shield: ""A knight who remembered his vows.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15YF6IFSF8V3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1932796061#wasThisHelpful","R15YF6IFSF8V3X","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Dragons of Winter Night, Weis and Hickman continue telling the tale of their heroic adventurers.  I won't detail the story here, since that's been done in other reviews.  I'll just tell you what most of the other reviewers don't.The stylistic flaws that the reader found in Dragons of Autumn Twilight will be noticed also in this book, which is its sequel.  The story has a ""not filled in"" feel.  The characters seem force-marched through their roles, as the authors sacrifice introspection to gain speed of pace.When a story is told well, a reader can anticipate the feelings of characters a few seconds before reading the narrative that confirms them.  But that's usually not true in this story, just as it wasn't true in its prequel.  Every glance is a jolt.  Every reaction, a surprise.  Well, okay, it isn't quite that bad: but it is almost that bad.The viewpoint jumps around erratically, as the narration informs us of the feelings of this character, and then of the feelings of that character, rather than revealing those feelings more subtly.  The reader thus gets an impression of the narrator's presence as an intruder in the story, which places a burden upon his suspension of disbelief.  You aren't able to ""live"" in the story because it remains too obvious that you are being ""told"" the story.In general, readers continually estimate the probable thoughts and choices of a storybook character with remembered reference to that character's past experiences.  In superbly written fantasies, present actions are rooted in, and are naturally developed from, those experiences.  Dragons of Winter Night, however, is not superbly written, though it's probably worth reading if you're in solitary confinement.  The authors have made it a habit to give their characters such knee-jerk reactions that the story seems a bit hokey.Despite all the narrative blather about codes of honor, dignity, or some such thing, which is evidently intended to mitigate the effect of those knee-jerk reactions, the characters have the maturity of easily provoked children.And there are discrepancies in the tale that the writers should have avoided.  For example, while Gilthanas and Silvara are smooching on a rock above a river, Silvara releases her hold on a blanket, which falls into the rapidly flowing water, presumably never to be seen again.  In the next chapter, the party sleeps in their blankets, with no mention that Silvara no longer has one.  Is Silvara carrying a suitcase full of blankets that the authors forgot to mention, or does Silvara have one of those magical, boomerang blankets that keep returning to their owners?Reading Dragons of Winter Night brings to mind the phrases ""cardboard mansion"" and ""genuine quartz.""  Still, this second novel in the Dragonlance Chronicles is slightly improved over the first.  The scenes remain rough-hewn, and the feel of the action and dialogue remains shallow, but not quite as much so as in the earlier book.  It's as if Weis and Hickman were (very slowly) adding levels to their Storytelling Skill.We all have to learn our skills at some point, and every author goes through a learning curve.  The Dragonlance Chronicles (or as much of them as I've so far read) aren't too bad, but they certainly do not deserve most of their billing.  They've been much over-touted.  The comparisons with Tolkien's fantasy are ridiculous and insulting to Tolkien's vastly superior craftsmanship.It's difficult to account for this mediocre series' quick rise to eminence in fantasy, and many of the five-star reviews appear to have come from reviewers who, if they aren't shills, may be more responsive to the ""bandwagon"" effect than to their own judgment, such as that might be.  The Dragonlance Chronicles appear to be aimed at the teenage or preteen audience. The shallowness, the inconsistencies and the viewpoint shifts probably won't bother the bubblegum crowd as much as they do older readers.  If you read and enjoyed this book as a youngster, you might find nostalgia carrying you through a second reading, much later.The most accurate customer reviews of Dragons of Winter Night, other than this one, are these:* great when I was 15 and immature. But now...Reviewer: Erik Vanasch ""Spartan Soul"" (Folsom, CA)* A seventh-graders dream; an adult's nightmare, March 8, 2000Reviewer: A reader* How old are you?, April 14, 1999Reviewer: A reader* Best of the series, April 24, 2003Reviewer: Joshua Drake (Agoura Hills, CA)* The Second Book, the First Chance to Commit, September 7, 2000Reviewer: David Rudel (Charlottesville, VA)Believe me, the 1-3 star reviews are far more reliable than the 4 and 5 star reviews, at least from a mature reader's perspective.If you'd like to read an author who does well what Weis & Hickman do poorly, read ""The Wheel of Time"" series by Robert Jordan.  Although Jordon is infamous for the way his WOT plot has gradually thickened in much the same manner that concrete hardens as it sets, he does an incomparably better job at characterization and character interaction than Weis & Hickman do.If you want to read a series that keeps the plot moving along, without the shallowness of the Dragonlance Chronicles, read ""The Saga of Recluce"" by L.E. Modesitt, Jr.  Modesitt occasionally commits diction blunders, usually a confusion of place-names, noticing which won't delight you as much as finding the eggs on an Easter Sunday, but his characters are deeply introspective, and their actions are well-grounded in their past.  Plus, it's clear in Modesitt's stories which character is the main character, which are the villains, and which secondary characters are of importance to each.  Weis & Hickman tried to execute a ""committee of main characters,"" and this does not seem to work as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GY4Q8PCRL9HT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786916095#wasThisHelpful","R1GY4Q8PCRL9HT","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, the good points.  The book is fast-paced, has lots of action, and tells an interesting story.  So what's to complain about?  In a word: style.  The pace is fast, but with the speed of the action comes a shallowness, a lack of introspective depth that leaves the mature reader dissatisfied in much the same way that The Hardy Boys series might.  What's great when you're eight isn't as fine when you're thirty-nine.Whether conveying consolation or conviviance, the dialog is often platitudinous.  The authors could have spent a little more time creating dialog that proved that the characters were capable of original and ponderous thinking.Certain details are omitted that should have been included to provide set-up for an important later event.  For example, early in the book Tanis discovers that the door to Tika's cottage is open, despite his conviction that it had been closed and bolted.  Why was Tanis sure of this?  The authors don't say.  The reader, flipping back through the pages, trying vainly to find out who had closed and bolted the door, or who SAID he was going to close and bolt the door, or who had been SUPPOSED to close and bolt the door, finds nothing to justify Tanis' mistaken belief.  The reader thus becomes annoyed for having wasted his time.Emotions oscillate from extreme to extreme, from brotherly love to hatred and back again, with no more provocation than a few careless words.  The main characters often have strong feelings, but they are usually not based on anything that might be reasonably expected to evoke them.  When changes of mood do have a plausible basis for evocation, such as when the heroes entered the ruins of Goldmoon's tribe, their effect on the characters has a cardboard quality.  You are told that the characters feel very badly indeed about the desolation around them, but somehow the reader is not fully convinced.  That might be because Tanis and Riverwind have the emotional complexity of Frank and Joe Hardy; i.e., none to speak of.The ""serious"" combat scenes are usually implausible and sometimes just plain goofy.  At best, the reader gains the impression that time moves rapidly here, in this paragraph, but much more slowly there, in that paragraph.  At one point, the draconians are skillful and efficient fighters who easily capture the heroes.  A few pages later, these ""intelligent"" fiends are deceived by a simple trick and set to running hither and yon, screaming in terror, confused and disorganized, and remaining so for long enough that Sturm and Flint could break apart a fake dragon, carry off its wooden head, extract Tas, and hold a lengthy conversation about what they should do next.  This is slapstick, not serious fantasy.(Correction: The lengthy conversation in that particular episode of combat occurred during Tas' rescue from the burning wicker dragon, and not afterward.  I'd misremembered.  However, in this story there are times when it seems that enemies might show up at one of the heroes' planning discussions, expecting to fight, but being told by Caramon, ""Go back to freaking out.  We aren't done talking yet.""  And the villain does indeed turn around and run away, and apparently none of the other heroes even noticed he was there.)Another conspicuous flaw is the too-rapid shifting of viewpoints, from Tanis, to Flint, to Sturm, back to Tanis, to Raistlin, to Goldmoon, back to Tanis again, to Tasselhof, to Caramon, again to Tanis...  It is possible to have more than one viewpoint character in a book, but the shifts should come less rapidly.  The viewpoint should stay with one character long enough for the reader to fix in his mind how that one character regards each of the others.  Weis & Hickman bounce the viewpoint around as if it were a basketball, with three or four shifts occurring on a single page.Despite these flaws, the story is a good one.  The stylistic awkwardness may be compared with a chair made from good, but unfinished, wood.  Had it been sanded and polished, the chair could have been a work of art; instead it's a merely rugged chair that puts splinters into unwary butts.  In the same way, Dragons of Autumn Twilight could have been a masterpiece, but it was left in a rough state of storytelling with annoying splinters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z2W7JMGAHBAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786915749#wasThisHelpful","R2Z2W7JMGAHBAA","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The biggest difference in Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, in contrast with other documentaries, is that it does not bother with the customary phony facade of objectivity. Most documentaries are politically motivated propaganda meant to lead their viewers to false or distorted impressions, by what they emphasize, by what they leave out, by speculation or rumor insinuated to be proven fact, etc. One common trick is to speak the truth as it were through a mouthful of garbage so that it seems to emerge with a stinking odor that causes most listeners to disbelieve it. Or to set up a villain (actually, an actor) who speaks the truth with his tongue obviously in cheek, so that the listener will get the impression that he is being lied to. The producers of ""historical"" documentaries know a thousand tricks of deception, and outright lying is only one of them. Michael Moore must be aware that the public falls for the slick tricks that are standard fare in other people's documentaries. He simply did not use them. You know right away that he doesn't like the president. Rather than condemn him for ""hating"" Bush, at least appreciate that he didn't hide his personal opinions, as many other, less honest propagandists, usually do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFYC3QUIU7W5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JNEG#wasThisHelpful","RFYC3QUIU7W5B","A3JLK6OO5D10KM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JLK6OO5D10KM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fantastic production of Parsifal if you can tolerate modern adaptations. I generally prefer a traditional, as intended, production but there are times when the modern adaptation works. In this case, it works beautifully.Remember, you're reading a skeptic. I almost dreaded seeing what is going to happen to Kaufmann in this opera. Sure enough, they get his shoes and shirt off but the silliness ends there. The acting and singing in this production are pretty close to perfect---again, Kaufmann isn't the greatest actor in the world though he well may be the best tenor. However, acting befuddled and confused suites him perfectly in this role.I don't think he fully assumes the title of keeper of the Grail and Spear collection at the end of the opera. He still doesn't really seem to get it. I give Kaufmann a B+.Pape on the other hand hits it so far out of the park that they'll never find the ball. Acting and singing is perfect. He nails it. A+Katarina Dalayman is really good Kundry. She seems to understand the personal hell that Kundry faces daily. She wants to do good but is owned because of her transgression. This is a tough role very well performed. Solid A for Katarina Dalayman.Peter Mattei is a terrific Amfortas. Man, I feel your pain. A+Maestro Gatti steers the orchestra for 4 1/2 hours of perfection.I cried at the end. It's that powerful. It's that good. Watch an act each night and savor it. This is well worth adding to your collection. It's a beautiful work of art.The staging? I thought it was rather interesting. It delivers the right message at the proper time. No, you don't get people in knight costumes running around a castle and you get a meadow scene with blooming flowers---well, sort of.

"This is a bit dated and often comes off as corny. I like that it is a traditional presentation---no space aliens or trapeze artists. Making an opera movie versus taping a live performance is going to be a little different and they can do things you can't do on stage. That's great and does add to the experience. However, it's easy to go overboard when short scenes or shots can be staged.There are some extreme closeups that are almost comical. There are a few shots of Pavarotti which reminded me of one of those ""Guys Night in Las Vegas"" movies.You've got a great cast and very good performances. I however found the more recent stage performances better than this. It's hard not to award 5 stars to anything with Pavarotti but as mentioned, the ""movie"" aspect is often excessive.

"This is a beautifully staged and well-sung opera. I wouldn't call it minimalist as some have said. While the stage is sparse, the entire theater is used. Sometimes, in some productions, that comes off a bit silly but in this production it works. The costumes are lush and interesting. They fit the period. The central characters are the least gussied up and that works well as we focus on their terrific singing rather than on some weird costume. Nobody in sweats an T-shirts. No trapeze acts. No Nazi uniforms. Imagine that. They don't even bother with rivers of fake blood.The acting is better than I'm seeing lately in many 5 star, top of the line, big name productions.The singing is in French but done ""Italian Style""? Funny, I have a little coffee business and we sell French Roast, Italian Style. It's a big seller (our best) so I wouldn't be too critical of that! The singing is wonderful. The cast sings their hearts out. I love that feeling when I finish watching a DVD that makes me wish I could personally applaud the cast. There are great productions and there are good productions where the cast connects with the audience and delivers an authentic opera experience. Opera was entertainment for the masses---think about vendors hawking food during an opera. These operas, romances, good guys vs bad guys, sword fights, evil priests, pokes at the nobility---these are great fun. This is the sort of opera that gives us the flavor of an 18th century experience.It's a ball! I wish everyone could see this and enjoy the beautiful sounds of Bel Canto, the fun of a good story done well, and a cast that wants to deliver a good time.Loosen your tie and enjoy this opera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YV312A98R3VO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LMSP26#wasThisHelpful","R2YV312A98R3VO","AG4D06TQLDFMH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG4D06TQLDFMH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this DVD very much. It's an interesting opera on a grand scale with lots of good music and some tunes that will make you want to sing along. If you like this opera, you will probably like this production. I love that it's not perverted by some maladjusted director who want the characters as space aliens or cavorting around in sweats. This production gives proper respect to the art of Bellini.On the negative side, the acting is sometimes a little wooden.  Nino Machaidze is the exception. Her acting is really good. There times when the other singers seem disconnected. She's all in, the males characters don't seem so. The big number of the opera lacks punch. I was anxiously awaiting it as I listen to this opera on my MP3 player often.

"Wait! Hold the presses, the bench presses that is. There is a better jump rope.I need to do some exercise that doesn't involve joining anything or buying special shoes. Jumping rope, even at a moderate pace, is great exercise and shown to improve not only stamina and muscle tone, but also bone density. Our bones want a little impact.So this high tech jump rope shows up and I skeptically open the box. Well, it's certainly minimal packaging. Can you get a decent jump rope into a little plastic bag? Yup. Okay, so this light weight cable won't really be that easy to flip. Wait! It has a nice weight. Unlike cheap and thin ropes, this is easy to flip. It doesn't twist. You get a smooth easy movement. That's pretty cool. I was certain that it wouldn't be long enough. At 6'2"", most of these things are too short and I have to bend to clear my head---yes, I've tried jumping rope in the past and have a few that became dog toys.This is not only long enough, it was too long. But that problem is solved but a very clever means of adjustment. But that's not all, the rope (coated cable really) attaches to the handles through gimbals. Really? An engineered jump rope? Indeed! You can jump, twist turn and this rope will never get twisted up. That's pretty amazing.The build quality is excellent too. This is a professional piece of exercise equipment.So after about 5 minutes I was wiped out. But after a couple months I expect to be doing better!The product is excellent. There was a very nice card in the package too. I won't say what it says in case they stop the amazing offer. But I'll say this: Order now before they discontinue that practice---READ THE CARD!Yes!

"Not sure that the reviews line up with CDs. Often Amazon mixes up which goes to what. My three stars go to the CD pictured here. The sound quality, certainly good for the time, isn't great. The editing is poor and the opera is pretty chopped up.This recording is great example of what people both like and dislike about Callas. Her control is beautiful but her voice is not. That makes this recording worth owning from a ""study"" point of view but if you have other, more recent, recordings of superior quality, you'll listen to them more often.This is bit like an old Caruso recording.

"These heat resistant, non-slip gloves are fantastic. Not only are they very convenient, they add a lot of safety around the kitchen. I've used mine to remove a hot cookie sheet (stoneware) from the oven. That's tough to do because stoneware is heavy and it gets very hot. So doubling up the pot holders and one-handing it is tough and dangerous. These gloves border on providing super powers as I can reach in and with BOTH hands lift out a very heavy stoneware bar pan.Ok, so as a pot holder they are great. Have trouble opening a jar because the old wrists just don't have the strength the used to? Glove up! You can twist the top off if it was glued on. Seriously, they make opening a jar much easier and again, they eliminate slippage.Here's a dandy problem. I love those Reynolds Turkey Bags. Turkey comes out great every time. You can overcook it an hour and have a moist, tender turkey. But there's a problem. A 15 pound turkey isn't easy to extract from that bag when done cooking. That's a downright dangerous event because the bag sticks to the bird. So while you're trying with forks and tongs and spears to lift the turkey out of the bag---whoops, the wing splatters hot juices across the room. Oh my, don't drop it or there will be boiling turkey juices everywhere. The bag, the bag! It's stuck to bottom. Harry! Get over here quick, pull that bag away----wait! I need to get it to the plate---no pull the bag, yes I know it's hot. Hurry, I can't...crap.Well, problem solved! Cut away the bag, lift out the turkey and with those super powers just use your red hands (gloves) to pull away the bag without a single plop of boiling juices taking out an eye. Amazing. You can easily get the bag into the trash, pour the juices into a sauce pan and make gravy. While the gravy simmers---hey, keep those gloves on---you can wash the turkey pan even though it's a bit hot you won't get burned and you won't drop it (Mine is Corel giant, deep lasagna pan) and the gloves get cleaned so you can rip the legs off the turkey and GET CAUGHT red handed doing it. Arrange nicely, hold the thing down and carve. No burns.This is a great gift item. Anyone who does anything in the kitchen will use them and think of you every time they do. It's not every day to find an item that is useful and adds safety. And, so many kitchen things are more trouble than they save. Not these. Easy to use, easy to clean.You cannot go wrong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AYS3813QLT7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBWAK8Y#wasThisHelpful","R2AYS3813QLT7M","AG4D06TQLDFMH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG4D06TQLDFMH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes an opera can be pure fun. Here's a great example.This is an older recording so don't expect HD. It's a standard 4:3. The singing is good, not great. There are times the tempi seems rushed.

"This is very decent production of a superb opera. The singing is very good. Behrens is great in the role of Senta and delivers near sacred music in her arias. It's beautiful. Salminen and Grundheber are superb and the lesser parts are excellently presented.The grand party chorus is terrific. Makes you want to jump up and join them---grab a mug and do it!I did find the slow camera tour of the castle during the overture to be annoying. I'd rather just watch the orchestra. There are too many cutaways to the water image. The annoyances are minor.The ending is what cost this DVD a star. The old Dutchman is boarding his ship, Senta is torn, Erik flashes his gun and we fade to a fake water image as Senta walks toward it. It's poorly conceived and misses the impact of her choice.Still, it's Wagner and done well. I would not pay top dollar for this DVD but it's a bargain at current prices.

When it contacts fur, it makes a burn. It does not stun. Not to be too graphic but one actually chewed on the end while I was zapping him.

"This production has it's quirks but to date is my favorite. Having purchased a handful of Lohengrins, I've decided this one is my favorite. There is a clean mix of the modern with the traditional---the piano scene is a bit weird---but for the most part it stays true to the intent of the composer.I am not too picky about the sound quality of a DVD unless it's very poor. Great sound comes from a studio, not a production of singers bouncing around a stage. That said, the sound is decent. The performances are excellent. I would give the singing a solid B+ and the acting an A. The acting in Lohengrin is very important. I doubt Wagner would tolerate sub-standard performance in any area, music, singing or acting. I do think that bad acting can destroy this opera and the acting here conveys the story's deeper meanings very well.Here's what I mean. Elsa approaches mental imbalance. There is a tension with her character from the beginning.  Is she the virtuous maiden or just a bit nuts? The King's herald is appropriately aloof and sterile. He serves as the referee between myth and reality. The king seems really conflicted. War is breaking out and he's got this divided territory and he must rule on whether Elsa is nuts or Friedrich is working a ploy. We feel the tension. The king looks conflicted unlike in other productions I've seen, this king looks really torn. Then this knight shows up. Is he really a good guy? The king asks that question---and in this production, he has the look of Montezuma.  Is this the return of the god-knight or some evil force? Meanwhile, Ortrud is blowing a gasket and conjuring up anything to help Friedrich prevail. The closing of Act 1 really is a mad house scene. It's beautiful. There is a coming together, an agreement, but it's chaos too as Ortrud shrieks, Friedrich crawls  off, Elsa is smitten, our magic knight croons and the king, at the top of his lungs, is basically singing ""Let's get on with things!""The other DVDs seem to dilute this very weird opera. They either stage it so screwy the original philosophy is lost, or it's so bland it ends up a watered down Arthurian story. This is a profound treatise on good, evil, virtue and conflict. In my opinion, the DVD allows those themes to play out. I liked it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RXOXNHVPTUY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001U5V04E#wasThisHelpful","R3RXOXNHVPTUY0","AG4D06TQLDFMH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG4D06TQLDFMH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is mildly entertaining but reads like one of the Japanese comic books. Here's a story that is about as vibrant a tale as possible with the honor of an entire culture riding on it. This novel fails to develop the characters and fails to convey any of the magnitude of the event.There's a line that just struck me as hilarious. In a bar scene, one of the boys wants to go get a potential traitor right at that moment. The wise Samurai, whoops, ex Samurai cum Ronin, says, ""Do not go off half cocked"". Picture the deep voice, maybe add a grunt, oh! No half cock grasshopper. The expression, half cocked, has to do with the readiness of a gun. These guys didn't have guns. No, Samurai sons [sic] do not go nuclear. I just found this book to be borderline silly.There has to be a better account somewhere.

"This is an odd production of an odd opera. Still, it's enjoyable and I'm glad to have it in my collection. The singing is good, the acting is very good, the staging is about as good as it gets for this opera short of doing a high budget movie version.The story is strange but it is almost a modern update or parody of Die Meistersinger. You have groups---which I suppose represent the unwashed masses of opera attendees---crying for more comedy! Make us laugh! Other groups call for drama. So the opera is trying to please these clamoring masses while delivering artistic excellence. Operas are somewhat known for nearly corny plots so Prokofiev takes that to extremes and still stays just inside of coherent. That's actually pretty masterful.I won't say that I was engrossed by this opera so I'll give it 4 stars. But I have mixed feelings about that and perhaps it deserves 5. I struggle because it does brilliantly make the composer's points about much of the absurdity around art and the public's demand for what they want. Again, think about Meistersinger. Wagner makes a similar statement but does so in all seriousness to ""preserve the German art form!"" Here Prokofiev uses a kingdom run by a clown king who hires a real clown to cure the heir of hypochondria who then falls in love with three oranges, one of which turns into a princess. The prince is cured and the kingdom saved. In the end, the crowds are pleased. Hum?Give it a chance. It's worth a venture out to something very different.

"Here is a nearly perfect production of a very difficult opera. Get it while you can. It's a treasure.The opera itself has a very convoluted plot. It can be difficult to follow the motivations of the characters, This staging is very quick paced which helps build continuity between the scenes. The set is a little bit strange---very dark. I wondered if it was meant to be a church or a torture chamber at times. The Count's headquarters are like an emergency exit from a factory. None of these minor criticisms detract enough from the performance to matter.The performances of all the singers are superb. Some of the arias are simply spell-binding. Verdi is about the music and this is a singers production. The orchestra does the job and is never in the way. This is one of the best operas on DVD for pure singing that I have seen. Every part is excellent and will have you holding your breath on some of the most beautiful long notes, diminutive expressions and leaps into high territory.When I ordered, I made an error and added this to my cart twice. It was a large order and the DVD was pretty inexpensive so I didn't notice. Now I'm glad to have a spare to loan to friends.

"Well, here's an interesting dilemma. I generally prefer a traditional production over a modernized one. Oddly, in this case, I'm giving my preference to the 'other' Faust starring Kaufmann and Pape.This production is good, and Terfel is superb. The production is excellent though Faust (Alagna) is not, in my opinion, well acted. This has the ballet---good---and lots of interesting dance numbers. Terfel in a dress is certainly decadent and devilish but maybe too much.Gheorghiu is good in the roll though perhaps a bit past the age prime to be the enchantress. That's horribly sexist but the role is about seduction and frankly she ain't got that.I love this opera and the music is excellent. This production is very, very good. The Kaufmann production at the Met is, in my opinion, better.Now, can someone answer a question?

"I want to start with a few statements about my own taste in opera. First, I confess to being a rather new consumer of the art having taken a few classes and listened to opera daily for a few years. I own many DVDs. My taste is in traditional staging over modernized productions. I love Wagner's operas. I enjoy Verdi. (There seems to be Wagner/Verdi camps)With that, how could I possibly give 5 stars to a modernized staging of this opera? The staging, while modernized, is not ""bare bones"" as some have said here. It's modernistic, not spartan. For comparison, I recently reviewed an extremely silly production of Parsifal that takes place with the singers dressed in leaves climbing around in bushes with lighting so poor you can hardly see them. That is modernized staging that goes to the awful. This isn't whacky. It's updated.That updating gives me an initial pause. When I see these modernized sets, the production needs to prove itself to me. This production had me within 10 minutes. The performances are rare captures. The entire cast delivers a magnificent performance. This will be the gold standard for Faust [performances] in the future. The singing and acting are so good, it's hard to focus on the set. It's there, it adds to mood, but doesn't intrude. If you allow your mind to wonder about what they are trying to say with the bomb and war and nuclear labs, well, you'll miss a great opera.To be clear, the performances are excellent. The acting is moving. The staging is unobtrusive---not in the way of this superb production.So, if there is criticism, it can possibly be traced to the opera itself. Why does Faust leave the girl of his dreams in the first place? That's a big hole to leave unfilled in the story. Can't blame the setting for what isn't in the script. Gounod gives us beautiful music but as is the case with many operas, the 'plot' is a bit convoluted and the storyline is certainly flawed. Don't blame the production. When a novel becomes a movie, the producers take great liberties with the story. That can't be done with opera. Remember that.This is a wonderful opera and I highly recommend it to anyone. And, if you are relatively new to opera and want to try a modern production that is as enjoyable as a traditional staging, try this. You'll be happy with it.Last comment. The between scenes interviews are interesting but demeaning. I haven't explored the DVD to see if those corny interviews can be shut off. These ""half time reports"" give the opera a sporting event feel. The questions are stupid---asking Pape if he mixes up the role from day to day as in evil one day, mysterious the next, etc., is absurd. His answer is fitting. Of course he doesn't change the role from day to day, there are other singers who must respond to his part---it would be nuts to be changing it up. So please Met, stop this opera for the masses nonsense. The masses can rise. Don't stoop.Thank you for reading this. I'd like your comments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IERX81NAVYQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPMFE6U#wasThisHelpful","R2IERX81NAVYQ2","AG4D06TQLDFMH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG4D06TQLDFMH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this viewer to replace an old brass viewer in my front door when I changed the hardware to a modern, satin-nickel finish.  The old viewer required a hole 1 1/8"" in diameter, and finding another door viewer that would fit that hole was definitely a challenge.  In fact, this particular viewer is the ONLY viewer I found to fit that space perfectly.I'm very happy to report that the optics in this viewer are excellent, and far surpass those of the old viewer.  I can definitely see a wide angle through the peephole, and the view is clear and crisp.  Sadly, too many viewers distort the view or are unfocused, which negates the benefits of using such a viewer.The finish on this product is smooth and works with the satin nickel color scheme.  Installation was as easy as fitting the two pieces together through the hole in the door and screwing them together.  It took minutes to complete, and looks great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VA42N3WGALG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A7LH4W4#wasThisHelpful","R3VA42N3WGALG6","A1BO59JIOSXMEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BO59JIOSXMEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge fan of using ""green"" products when possible, not only to save energy, but to reduce my personal expenses.  I ordered this 1320 lumen PAR R40 bulb in Daylight to use in a ceiling fixture in my kitchen's dining area.  I have 18 other PAR 38 65-watt equivalent LED bulbs in use in my kitchen, which uses a total of 171 watts of power.  If I used traditional filament bulbs for this purpose, I'd be using  1,170 watts of power... this is a HUGE savings as these lights are on most all day every day.This particular Satco bulb lives up to its description in every way.  It provides a bright light in the proper color tone (Daylight, in this case.)  The design of the bulb ensures that the lighting dispersal pattern is wide and truly floods the area.  Too many LED lights work more like a spot light, providing light only on the area directly beneath the bulb.I use the bulb with an electronic dimmer, and the bulb definitely dims properly according to the specifications of the dimmer.  At no time do I experience any flickering or buzzing... I suspect that those experiencing these issues may have problems related to the type of dimmer that's in use.I use Daylight equivalent lighting exclusively throughout my home... Cool White is simply too yellow for me and changes the color of my decor in an unflattering fashion.  We find the Daylight tone to be bright, cheerful and excellent for lighting task areas.  Finding bulbs in the Daylight tone can be difficult at times, as Cool White seems to pervade the market.Time will tell how well this particular bulb lasts, but my experience with similar bulbs has been excellent.  I've yet to have a bulb fail, and my home uses LED lighting for almost every fixture at this point.  The product works perfectly for my purposes, and based upon my experience thus far, I recommend it without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N8I07DRESGYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3SPZ8C#wasThisHelpful","R2N8I07DRESGYM","A1BO59JIOSXMEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BO59JIOSXMEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a past customer of Hydracentials products, I received the Kids Insulated Resuable Lunch Bag to test in exchange for an honest review.  My opinions are my own and represent my experience with this and similar products as a consumer.While not a ""kid"" by any means, I use the insulated lunch bag to tote my own lunch items to work.  When I received the product, I was surprised at the quality of it's design and construction.  The bag is heavily stitched at all seams, and the handles and zipper are very durable and should hold up to a lot of abuse.  The interior of the bag is lined to prevent leaks and to ensure easy cleanup should any spillage occur.  The PEVA insulating layer is dense but not overly thick and keeps food items (warm or cold) for plenty of time for my purposes.  The bag is definitely large enough to carry adult portions of food with room to spare.I purchased a similar product from a company called Thirty-One a few years ago.  For the price I paid, I was surprised at how cheaply the product was made.  Also, it was not very effective at keeping products warm or cold.  There's no comparison between these two products except for the color and intended use... the design, construction and usability of the Hydracentials product is outstanding in every way, and the price is less than half of the price of the Thirty-One product.  For anyone looking for a quality lunch tote, I recommend this product without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RZE1CMIH1LJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZT70J50#wasThisHelpful","R3RZE1CMIH1LJQ","A1BO59JIOSXMEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BO59JIOSXMEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe this was Christopher's first true foray into the romance novel genre.  I'm an avid reader of anything that Christopher writes, so I picked this up immediately to see how well Christopher could write in this genre.  My review of this work is completely subjective, based upon my own likes and dislikes, and that subjective opinion likely differs for every reader.  The romance genre is not one that I typically follow.The plot for the novella was definitely interesting and fresh.  The supernatural concept embedded in a three-way romance is definitely new, at least as far as I know.  When I picked the novella up, I did not put it down until I was finished.  The relationship of the three focal characters is emotionally charged, intensely erotic and thoroughly documented.  When the story ended, I definitely wanted more, which to me is the mark of excellent writing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R9LDCH76O513/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HCR6MJC#wasThisHelpful","R1R9LDCH76O513","A1BO59JIOSXMEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BO59JIOSXMEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me say that most any review of an author's work is completely subjective.  I can only speak from and report my personal experience of reading the novel, and that experience is likely different in some aspect for every reader.I generally love anything by Christopher Rice, so I stepped ""outside the box"" so to speak to read this novel.  I did enjoy the read, but couldn't completely engage in the storyline.  Perhaps that's because I seldom read novels in this genre.  It seemed like the characters emotions were somewhat blunted, preventing me from completely emerging myself in the storyline.Overall, I enjoyed the read and will continue to read anything that Christopher deigns to write.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37O8V0FMWB47E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8A262C#wasThisHelpful","R37O8V0FMWB47E","A1BO59JIOSXMEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BO59JIOSXMEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have two large dining room tables that I built specifically to fit our space, so finding a pre-made pad to fit is impossible.  The cut-to-fit intention of this product was exactly what I needed.  I had enough to cover both custom tables, plus enough to use as a cover on a smaller kitchen table as well.  I use the pads all the time and they are very effective at controlling spills and definitely product the surface of the table from nicks and dings.The padding was a bit thinner than I expected, but again, it works.  The coated side of the pad must be placed facing upward to protect against spillage.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it takes some effort to get the creases out of the material.  If you remove the pad from your table, make sure to roll it up rather than folding to prevent creasing.  Someone recommended using a cool iron to help with the creases... I chose to let the pad flatten naturally, as I did not want to run the risk of damaging the waterproof coating.I did find it somewhat difficult to cut the pad to fit.  It cuts fine with some sharp scissors, but cutting it straight can be challenging due to the density of the pad, or at least it was for me.  I definitely recommend measuring and marking the pad to the appropriate size, then cutting on the lines with very sharp scissors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29CVKGHYMEWHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00406U7WQ#wasThisHelpful","R29CVKGHYMEWHA","A1BO59JIOSXMEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BO59JIOSXMEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to use as a free-standing microphone to use with Microsoft Windows 10.  From the product description, this seemed to be an effective solution for my needs.  It works very well... training Windows 10 to understand my speech took only moments, with no adjustments to recording levels required.  Even with background noise (in my office I have a portable air conditioner that sits less than 3 feet from my desk) the system has no problem extracting the background noise and deciphering my speech.  The microphone is a bit large, but thankfully I have enough room on my desktop.  The cord is long enough for my needs, and the red color is a nice touch in that it helps to make the mic cable stand out from the others dangling in the wiring jumble behind my system.It would be nice if the mic and stand were a bit smaller, but otherwise this was an excellent choice for my needs.  Since the quality of the microphone goes a long way to determine a system's ability to decipher speech, buying a better, full-featured microphone helps to ensure success.  I'm successfully using voice controls and dictation now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AORMD9A3USIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S9UL020#wasThisHelpful","R1AORMD9A3USIO","A1BO59JIOSXMEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BO59JIOSXMEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The speed is more than adequate for my needs, and I think it outperforms the built in memory in the device.

"I've used similar dishwasher cleaner products in the past, and I can say that the Finish brand product works the best.  We use the Finish Quantum Power Free packs in our dishwashers (I have two:  A top-of-the-line Samsung Chef's Collection water-wall dishwasher, and a 6 year old top-of-the-line Kitchenaid.)  The dishwasher packs are very convenient and provide everything you need to result in clean, gleaming dishes, but the packaging for the packs melts in during the dishwashing cycle and tends to leave a film on the dishwasher.  I couldn't understand where the film was coming from, and only after quite a bit of research did I find out what was causing the problem.  I also found many recommendations for this product as a means to eliminate the film.  After a single use, the dishwasher was restored to it's original shine and was odor free.To use the product, I simply insert the bottle upside down in the silverware rack and run the otherwise empty dishwasher through a normal wash cycle.  At the end of the cycle, I remove and discard the empty bottle.  What could be easier?I buy these cleaners in a multi-pack through Amazon, and have them set up as a Subscribe and Save item for regular deliveries.

"I purchased these for use when replacing the electronic thermostat on my Toyota Prius.  I had three lines that had to be clamped... draining the coolant from the system is easy enough, but would require a two-hour-plus cycle to replace the fluid and to ""burp"" the system properly.  The repair part was $55, but the dealership estimated charges at over $500 for the repair.  After reading some of the reviews for these clamps, I was concerned as to how well they would work, but I can say that for me they worked perfectly.  They clamped the hoses completely and prevented any coolant loss without damaging the hoses.  My biggest problem was the fact that they are fairly large and I was working in a severely confined space, but they did what I needed.  For other projects where there's more room, they would be perfect.

"Using microfiber for dishtowels is not a new concept, I've been using similar towels for several years to dry dishes that I've washed by hand or that have come out of the dishwasher damp.  Microfiber towels also leave no lint, ensuring a clean finish.  What sets these towels apart from others that I've used is the fact that they are more absorbent, providing even more drying ability than any other towel I've used.  Perhaps it has something to do with the waffle-like texture of the towel, but they lift the water from the dishes and leave a dry finish in a single swipe.  Additionally, glass and stainless steel items are spot and streak free, leaving gleaming surfaces.Other great uses for these towels include cleaning windows, mirrors, eyeglasses, and any other objects that you want to have a clean, lint-free and streak-free finish.  When cleaning windows, I use a standard window cleaner and paper towel to perform the cleaning function, then use the Microfiber towel for the final drying wipe-down to pickup the remaining moisture and to remove any streaks.One thing that all potential users should note:  make sure that when you wash these towels that you do NOT use fabric softeners in the wash or dryer sheets during their dry cycle, as stated in the accompanying instructions  Fabric softeners impact the absorbency of the towels, which negates the benefit of using the microfiber towels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV5Z5XOWGQN1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NKKOBES#wasThisHelpful","RV5Z5XOWGQN1G","A1BO59JIOSXMEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BO59JIOSXMEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This footbath definitely has some high and some low points.  I've not owned a foot spa previously, but I've used others that I will consider in this review.First, the product is exactly as it appears in the photographs associated with the description.  It is indeed tall, sturdy and crafted to last.  The drain tube did drain the spa fairly quickly and completely.  I did not have any problem with the casters... they worked exactly as described, and since this unit holds 20 liters of water, they were greatly appreciated when it came time to drain the spa.PROS:-  This foot spa does maintain a present temperature, and does so very well.  Based upon my research, this is a problem in most foot spas, but this particular unit shines in this purpose.-  The pairs of massaging rollers for each foot are powerful and effective as a tool to massage the base of the feet.-  The unit is tall enough that water does not splash out.  I did not use the cover; doing so would have prevented me from moving my feet to use the massage rollers.-  This unit is HEAVY when filled with water, so having casters and a drain tube is definitely a positive.  I rolled my unit into the shower to drain.-  The water intake into the pump is screened to prevent any additives or debris from getting into the pump.CONS:-  There are no bubbles and the water action is minimal.  There is an intake at the rear of the unit and two ""jets"" near the front in the center of the toe position.  Water circulates through these ""jets"", but the force is so delicate that it's hardly noticeable to me, and definitely it does not create a bubble effect that I've experienced with other units, nor the bubble action that I understood in the description.-  The ""needled massage"" tool is located between the two foot wells, and is a disk with tines that you can rub your feet against for massage purposes.  The piece is stationary and difficult to use... it's useless to me.-  Other than being a deeper unit that allows you to submerge your ankles a couple inches of your lower leg, the unit provides no service for my calves.  Only a person with very short legs could find any leg benefit with this unit.While the overall product didn't meet my expectations or the description, I will keep it as I was desperately in need of a solution, and this unit does perform well as a soak.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AP2BRC3MZRYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPFBDU8#wasThisHelpful","R1AP2BRC3MZRYM","A1BO59JIOSXMEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BO59JIOSXMEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sadly, hardware/firmware issues with the Buffalo device have forced me to toggle power on the unit at the least opportune times, so I decided that a change for something more reliable was required.  I do not use this for hardcore gaming purposes, so I can't speak to those capabilities.This unit exceeded my expectations.  It was very simple to set up... a few instructions make it easy even for the most novice users.  As an IT expert, this unit also has advanced setup capability to handle almost any user's needs.  My WiFi-dependent devices now all work far better and more reliably.  As a plus, my router sits in the open on a shelf near the center of my home, so this stylish looking device doesn't seem out of place.  The wireless range far exceeds that of the router it replaced.

"After reading tons of reviews, I purchased this unit knowing that other users have experienced minor issues and was prepared for that at first use.  Considering that this isn't something I use every day and it would be stored on an open shelf in my kitchen, I had to make sure that it wasn't as tall as the traditional units, and the stainless steel appearance works perfectly in my space.  It is significantly shorter than most other units, making storage on a shelf or in a cabinet much easier.  It also includes an on/off switch, which was important to me.  Plugging in some other unswitched units causes sparking and can be an issue with GFCI outlets... having a switch avoids these issues.I've not experienced the issues with unpopped kernels that some have reported... I think that may have something to do with the age and quality of the popcorn kernels along with the level of humidity where they're stored... dryer kernels will pop easier and faster.The unit works great... it takes a minute or so for it to heat up, but after that it pops a full half cup of kernels in just a couple of minutes.  The speed of trajectory is sometimes too great, and popped kernels do fly out of the bowl, but I've taken to holding a hand towel in front of the unit to prevent these kernels from flying all over the place.  Cleanup is a snap... the cover lifts off easily for this purpose.I'm a fan of this unit and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants an air popper that's more elegant than a brightly colored plastic unit.

"I abhor carrying a large wallet... I seldom carry cash and I love the concept of a minimalist card case.  This one suits my needs perfectly.  With six card pockets and a larger center pocket, it has the capacity to hold all of the key cards that I used plus my ID and insurance cards.  Naturally, by the time I got all of the necessary cards in place, it is a bit thicker than I would have liked, but there's no fix for that other than to carry fewer cards.Putting the cards in for the first time was trying, and the wallet is quite stiff.  Using the cards for the first few times was also a challenge due to the stiffness and the number of cards I carry (most pockets have 2 cards.)  However, after a week or so I've found that the pockets have stretched a little bit and although the cards are held snugly, they are easy to remove for use.  I looked at virtually every option available, and this seemed to be the perfect fit for my needs.  So far I'm very happy with it and would definitely buy it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EVUDD25PF5GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUNBAYG#wasThisHelpful","R1EVUDD25PF5GE","A1BO59JIOSXMEL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BO59JIOSXMEL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all, let me say that the Pillsbury Cookbook is unparalleled... it's my kitchen Bible, my go-to every time I look for a recipe.  I own the 1986 hardbound version, and my poor copy is falling apart.  I thought I'd try to get another copy, but when I saw that it was out of print and the price for a copy ranged upward to $500, my jaw dropped to the floor!  Needless to say, I'm not going to buy another hardbound copy anytime soon.  When I saw that this paperback version was available, I thought it prudent to get a copy just so I have a backup.My 4-star rating is specific to this paperback version.  First of all, the content is great and contains everything that was in the original.  This book is HUGE.  In order to cram all of that content inside, it's become quite thick and the print is very small.  It's just not reasonable to open up this copy on the counter while you're working, and that impact on usability is why I removed a star.  I still think that as a backup, or for the cook who doesn't have a ""kitchen bible,"" this is a must have and is worth every penny.

"I love this product, and sadly it's becoming VERY hard to find via normal retail channels.  I tend to have a reaction to caustic chemicals, but this stuff cleans great without all of the odor.  When used as directed, it makes quick work of greasy, hard-to-clean pots and pans.  What most people may not realize is that it works great to clean up your oven, or your cooktop.  If someone's car leaks a bit of oil on my concrete driveway, I can spray it with this product and remove most (if not all) of the oil stain.  I understand that mechanics often use it to degrease tools or parts, too.  There are many, many uses for this product, and it does a wonderful job for all.  I cannot understand why such a useful product would disappear from the retail marketplace.This product is the equivalent of the retail version, however it's packaged differently (for industrial use) and is a larger quantity.

Since I decided to give my iPhone 4S to my partner to use, I added this case and I'm very happy with the result.  The bumper edge on the case does help to protect the phone from minor drops or falls, and the clear backing on the case doesn't cover up the phone.  The front edges do protrude a bit, enough to ensure the face on the phone is not resting on the glass when sitting face down on a table.

I've found it difficult to locate the headset/charger so that it's convenient and out of the way.With this charging stand all of my problems are solved.

Like the cable, it magnetically holds the headset in place during charging, and has a light on the base so that you can see when the headset is charging or fully charged.

"This book reminded me of a bygone era, when I watched Hardy Boys on television and read Nancy Drew mysteries.  The dialog was much more in tune with those days, however, the plot got a bit more complicated.  A ghostly pirate, dastardly villain who kidnapped researchers, and a brother and sister detective team.  Ted and his sister, Sam, run the Swashbuckler Investigations business in Boston.  When they are hired by a mysterious character named Blackmoor to investigate several disappearances in Maine, they scamper back and forth to do their detecting.  Did I mention there might be pirate loot to find?A terrible, smelly fog arrives before weird events occur, good clue the ghost is at work. Somber Bay Island in Maine is the key to the disappearances and perhaps the hidden pirate treasure.  The ghost is real and has an agenda that includes these particular detectives.  There's a bit of romance, lots of running up and down the coast, and more than a few ghostly shenanigans.  If you enjoy a ghost mixed up with your mystery and long for the days when the Hardy Boys were popular, this book is for you. No bad language--the swear words become funny references to sea creatures--and mild violence, so this is a clean read, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WDXG455KS876/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1499152248#wasThisHelpful","R2WDXG455KS876","A3KKFG3TA9IO8X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KKFG3TA9IO8X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This episode in the saga was a nail-biter and a worthwhile read.  Enjoy the beauty of the ocean, the strength of young love, and the action that keeps the characters busy. I won't give away any spoilers, but anyone who read the Makai Queen should enjoy book 2 in the adventure. I'm sure the third book will be coming soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GBUW4KUG7UWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N7407W2#wasThisHelpful","R3GBUW4KUG7UWN","A3KKFG3TA9IO8X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KKFG3TA9IO8X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of Sherlock and Watson will surely enjoy this story.  When Mrs. Hudson's niece, Mirabella, arrives to keep Sherlock's laboratory clean and organize his collection of fingerprints, she becomes embroiled in an important case and must guard a princess from the inside of Miss de Beauvais' Finishing School for Distinguished Young Ladies.  How can a young woman, raised on a farm pass herself off as a member of society, learn self defense, and protect the life of a foreign princess?  She immediately stirs things up and almost gets booted out of the school.Sherlock once let down his guard and fell in love with Irene Adler, but will he be tempted by this feisty young woman who simply can't keep her comments to herself?  The tale reminds one of Eliza Doolittle in ""My Fair Lady"" being tutored by Henry Higgins, but it has the added note of danger and adventure.  I loved the story and hope more books will soon be written by this talented author.  Of course I'm an impossible romantic and a big fan of Sherlock Holmes.  I could almost see Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law in another film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXH0ITB35D8L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5VK4PO#wasThisHelpful","RXH0ITB35D8L2","A3KKFG3TA9IO8X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KKFG3TA9IO8X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who enjoys romance will love this series.  I read the previous book in the series and got to know and care about the characters, especially Lizzy and Ian with their budding romance.  The book continues with their struggle to connect romantically without letting the relationship become physical. Lizzie fears allowing her growing passion to get out of hand, so she pulls back from Ian to protect herself.  He can't understand and starts to feel jealous of her friendship with Jeffrey, who tries to avoid the old temptations that led him astray.  In a world where people jump into bed on the first date and expect everyone to follow suite, it's difficult for young people of faith to navigate the dating scene.The book is a clean read with religious content but it doesn't preach to its readers.  The scenes between Lizzy and Ian are realistic.  Jealousy and doubt almost derail their romance making readers feel anxious to learn if everything gets resolved. Will Jeffrey slide back into his old life?  Will Lizzy learn to trust herself?  Will Ian give up on Lizzie and find someone else to love?  Rebekah Lyn is a talented writer who rounds out her characters and lets us know their faults as well as their love of God.  Faith is important to the story but human nature plays a large role, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R120EJ1ZWB9ZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVII2PQ#wasThisHelpful","R120EJ1ZWB9ZA","A3KKFG3TA9IO8X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KKFG3TA9IO8X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such a clever anthology.  I remember growing up in a world where girls were never good at math and science, so I made sure to hide my report card (with its straight As) from friends on the bus.  I loved school, excelled at math and science, but felt embarrassed to let anyone know.  The most popular girls looked beautiful and tried to sound dumb.  UGH!  If we'd had stories like the ones in this book to encourage us to stretch our brains and do incredible things, just think how much more we'd have accomplished.Women fought to be equal in everything and made fantastic strides.  Too bad many of their preconceived ideas of which subjects they'd tackle left them out in the cold.  As the world changes and girls read incredible stories like the ones in this book, their self images will allow them to tackle any kind of problem with gusto.I found it interesting that many of the short stories in this collection were written by men.  They obviously want their daughters to live in a world where anything is possible for them.  Kudos!  I'm going to make sure my granddaughter reads this collection.  Yes.  I'm a grandmother and writer, and I enjoy reading YA fiction because it's full of life.

"Fantasy mixed with science fiction and lots of action!  Areenna is born into a world once ruled and destroyed by men of science.  Changes wrought by radiation caused the women of Nevaeh to wield potent magic that was denied the men.  In this feudal world the Dark Ones hope to destroy Nevaeh and its rulers, hope exists to defeat this dark magic if the burgeoning magic of young Areenna and Mikaal can be trained in time.  They must travel alone to the Island, a potent place where death is promised to any man who enters.  Mikaal is no ordinary man, he's the son of Roth who was survived the apocalypse and spent 3,000 years in space.  Mikaal is the first of his gender to be born with magical talent and must face down the powers on the Island to save his world, hand-in-hand with Areenna.This is a complete story but it is also the first book in a series.  Anyone who enjoys science/fantasy will be drawn to this post-apocalyptic tale.  It's more fantasy but based on science in its magic and the story of how our world recovered from man-made cataclysm.  I enjoyed the story and feel the author is a talented writer with loads of imagination.  My only difficulty was imagining the creatures in the tale.  They had strange names although they evolved from animals that once roamed our world.  It was such a small irritation that I ignored it for sake of the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I1BUVIUYHAWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTYHVTO#wasThisHelpful","R1I1BUVIUYHAWN","A3KKFG3TA9IO8X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KKFG3TA9IO8X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This series ROCKS!  This is a humorous account of paranormals who live during Victorian times in Africa with a shape-shifter bat, lightning god, a ghost for a husband, and a suitor who absorbs power.  What more can you ask?  Beatrice has talents of her own, she can squint to see the image of paranormal energy in creatures but hates to intrude on other humans.  Her handy cane is like a Swiss Army Knife on steroids, and she rides a horse who ate a serpent demon.  Can Bee forgive herself for not rescuing her brother from the werewolf who turned him, or for the unfortunate death of her husband?  Will she survive another attack by the giant preying mantis? The Victorian dialog is charming and anyone who reads one book will certainly wish to devour them all.

"After previously reading the authors memoir GROWING UP COUNTRY, I felt eager to read her newest book.  Its a novel but it's based on the lives of her ancestors.  She incorporates actual family history into the narrative after conducting in-depth research into the time period and actual places they lived in Iowa.  I was not disappointed with the story.  The author successfully infuses a tone of authenticity into her novel, making readers love and care about the characters.Liddy is an ambitious young woman who hungers to explore the world, develop her creative talents, and escape from boring farm life.  We follow the young woman as she experiences success, love, happiness, and heartache in a compelling historical story.  Facing a world in 1918, where women must fight for the vote, experience roadblocks in business, and an unsullied reputation is vital for acceptance in society, Liddy breaks out of farm-life constraints to discover what is really essential for her own happiness.  I wont divulge Liddys choices, but we all know that brave young women like Liddy helped pave the way for subsequent generations.  Facing the world with courage and an inborn work ethic, Liddy must have been a fantastic role model for her descendants.I was provided with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

"This series is inventive and delightful.  I truly enjoy reading the humorous prose, written in an enchanting Victorian dialect.  A penniless widow, Beatrice finds herself in Africa, living with annoying relatives, and surrounded by strange paranormals who regularly disturb her peace.  She's haunted by her ghostly husband (who recently stole an automaton),  disturbed by a giant bat that interrupted a perfectly good party, and must rely upon a possessed horse with glowing eyes.  What's next?  She's quite capable of dealing with miscreants, using her lethal cane and a bag of cinnamon, but things get a trifle out of hand during the process.

"This ""steampunk fantasy"" was so much fun to read!  Although this genre is not one I usually read, I found this novel fresh and interesting.  I loved the wide variety of clockwork creatures, and the gutsy heroine, Penelope Farthing, is charming.  Penny is an intriguing cross between a proper Victorian maiden and a kick-ass feminist.  There are many surprises mixed in with the action (along with a smattering of romance, too).  You hardly have time to catch your breath--as Penny visits the spirit world or sips tea from a delicate porcelain cup--when the action begins again.  Keep your own ""ticker"" wound up so you don't miss anything.  The author, Lisa Mantchev, has a vivid imagination and the narrative skills needed to share it with her readers.

"I usually avoid vampire novels but this one seemed intriguing.  I quickly discovered that it's more than a vampire novel.  If Buffy the Vampire Slayer was Amish, she'd be the heroine, Jael.  Raised by parents who ran from the dark secret of their Amish community in Minnesota, Jael studied martial arts and hid from view as she grew up.  She longed to go to school and fit in with the other kids, go to dances and enjoy parties.  Now that she's turning sixteen, she's coming into her full power and will become the target of dangerous vampires.I loved dialog like: ""Instead of a sweet sixteen party and a possible first kiss, I get a big sendoff to kill vamps?""  Imagine the struggles of fitting in at school when you've got killer skills and a good reason to use them!  When my own daughter was a teenager, I enjoyed watching Buffy slay vampires while we safely ate a bowl of popcorn.

There are problems, the chimpanzees have become terrorists, animal species are dying off, and the human population is growing at a staggering rate.  How can Adam help to curb population and solve the problems he didn't see coming?  He finally meets someone who makes him want romance again, a descendant of Vera?

"This romantic romp through Detroit in the 1920s is full of action and surprises.  I had not read the first one in the series so I had to play catch up with the story line.

"The council has sent Alana to L.A. to find a lost grimoire. As a vampire huntress, she anticipates the job to be just like any other. That is until she is almost killed by a hellhound. A stranger steps in and saves her life. Turns out hes another hunter, but not just any hunter. Hes sexy, smooth-talking and distracts her in all the right ways. As they decide to join up forces to hunt lost grimoire, she fights her attraction for him. However, it may be a losing battle as he shows her theres more to life than hunting.Action packed with great characters, this novella was a surprising fun read! Alana was a awesome kick-butt huntress (Think Buffy minus all the ditsy high school drama). She doesnt quite have a chip on her shoulder but she has this mental thing about her mom was such a awesome hunter and she needs to live up to that reputation. Ty was flirty and funny but still all man. Im not one to fall over cowboys but I did find his smooth-talking very sexy. I loved their interactions as they battled hellhound. The battles they face kept things moving fast. Theres a smattering of a few secondaries, mostly angels with sticks up their ahems, with the exception of Malaki. Him I really liked and would love to read more about him. It all ends on a very nice HEA and a to be continued as everybody keeps hunting grimoires.A Hellhound in Hollywood by Amy Armstrong was my very first book by this author. I really enjoyed her storytelling as well as her characters. Im already eyeballing the previous titles in her Huntress Chronicles series even though I thought A Hellhound in Hollywood worked very well as a stand-alone. My reason for starting the series from the beginning? Im curious to hear more about the grimoires, where it all started and where this series is going. Definitely a book worth the read.I received this book from The JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"When I originally read the blurb for Smitten With Death, I expected a dark or twisted PNR. Dark and twisted is far from what I got. Try laugh out loud sarcasm, with a heavy side dose of smart mouth all served on a side of sass. Once I started reading OMG I could not stop LAUGHING!!! There were so many zingers and smarmy comments I knew not only I wanted Max as my new best friend but that I needed to get the first two books in the Max Logan series.As I mentioned earlier I missed reading the first two books in the series so I walked into this book blind. Not a problem because Ms. Saracino did a real good job of blending in what previously happened in small doses without giving it all away. In a nutshell, Max has accepted the loss of her ex-husband/boyfriend and is attempting to move on with her life. Shes been avoiding all contact from Hellhound Grim Reaper Morgan but when Mr. Sex On A Stick pops in at her sisters wedding asking for help retrieving Buddy the Zombie King from Hell, she reluctantly agrees.After spitting my coffee out a few times, I knew before I finished the first chapter I was going to love this book. I absolutely adore Max! She pops out smarmy zingers so fast as shes dealing with her currently life. Of course, since this story is told in 1st person POV, you also get to enjoy her inner monologs. She has a few issues she needs to deal with, with one of them being having died but not staying dead. Theres quite a few secondaries that are added bonus from her blonde, but not ditzy sister, to Granny-Apple-Head, to Lucifer masquerading as a tone-deaf Wayne Newton that help keep the har-har rolling along. Then there is Morgan. Mmmm hubba-hubba! And hes no slouch in the witty banner either. Their journey to Hell to retrieve Buddy is loaded with pitfalls and prats that at any other time can come out hokey, but in this case, was the perfect blend of wit and revelation. All this fun is rolled up into a book once I started, there was no putting it down.Smitten With Death is my very first book by author Sharon Saracino and I know most definitely not the last. Rarely do I fall in absolute love with a book right away but once I got started with Smitten With Death I knew it was going to be a winner. Consider this a book well worth read and get yourself a copy now.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"I'm not exactly sure how to begin my review for Y Negative. After reading the blurb I found it really wasn't what I expected. Is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? Here's what I think and you decide.Ember is Y negative and he hates it. He's felt his whole life he was just... wrong. Bullied and looked down on he is struggling to survive. He knows something has got to change and it does when Jess walks into his life. Jess is a masc with a heart, a environmental heart. His passion is to studying the recovery of their devastated world. His boyfriend, Heath, is pressuring for him to commit. On top of that, his father is expecting him to take over the family business. All jess wants to do is take his yearly excursion research out in the wild. Needing a specialist he hires Ember.I have this thing lately about reading dystopia stories that I find fascinating. All the possibilities of our actions if we don't straighten out what destructive course we are on and what kind a future that could happen. For those of you who don't know what Dystopia means according to Merriam Webster:dystopia - noun : an imaginary place where people are unhappy and usually afraid because they are not treated fairlyWell, that there describes Y Negative to a T. Here's how it all works on this world. At the top you have masc (masculine) and seem to be all bullies. Next you got Andro (androgyny). After that is Y Negative. Quick biology lesson: Males have XY sex chromosomes, females have two X chromosomes. So naturally you would assume a y negative would be a woman right? WRONG! For what ever reason there are no women left. But how does the population keep going? By the male Y Negatives! They are the surrogates for the masc, having multiple babies and having them all taken away and given to the masc. Once a Y Negative has finished having all these babies, the start shooting up testosterone so they can be more masculine but they are pretty much in limbo - Andro. Andros and Y negatives I originally thought were like Ken dolls in the anatomy department. How quickly I found out how mistaken I was. Confused? Yeah, me too at first and it only gets more batcrap crazy.The story moves very fast and at times is difficult to absorb. There's quite a bit of jargon that takes a while to grasp (See previous paragraph) some of which I never figured out. I got a het was a Heterosexual which is apparently a bad thing but someone please explain a exin to me. Ember is a likable enough character. His constant mental meanderings about 'poor me' do, on occasion, get real old. Jess is also likable enough although his internal thoughts always had me thinking he was more of a y-neg than Ember. The adventure they find themselves on is both interesting and at time devastating to think it had all come to this. There's not a lot of secondary characters. However, the few that are definitely help give a understanding of this insane world. All of this ends on a HEA that doesn't exactly have a cliffy but you can tell if they author wanted to write another book, there is definitely a way I can see it happening.Y Negative is my first book by author Kelly Haworth. As crazy as this book sounds, it was fascinating to read. She's created a very interesting world that does give your brain a workout. Her presentation of a all male world may be difficult to swallow but it certainly would make you pause and think: What would a world with only one gender be like?I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Based off the blurb for Filthy Rich. I was expecting to read another billionaire romance story. Normally I shy away from them because theres only so much variation you can spin on rich/guy seducing average girl and still keep it original. But this was a Virna DePaul book, and I do so enjoy her PNR titles, so I decided to give it a twirl. What I got was a spicy romance with intrigue to keep me guessing until the very end.Brandon I really like. Charming, smexy and playful, his character was a joy. He has his secrets but instead of coming off as a rich, snobby jerk, I found him very down to earth. And then theres Cara. She really had me on the fence of like/dislike. I found her to be very smart and a likable enough character. Things between Brandon and her were interesting as well. I enjoyed their banter and the sex. It was her yes/no, want/cant flip/flopping back and forth that I found grating. You want to stand on your own two feet? Got it. Your dad got screwed over and you want to redeem him. Fine by me. You dont want to depend on anybody but Brandon is sexy as sin but hes your boss but you didnt know it when you kissed him? But But But It just had me wanting to shake her and tell her Honey, fish or cut bait.The story itself I really enjoyed. The whole whodunit was spun very well. There was plenty of plot twists to keep everything rolling along quickly. Add to that a list of sleazy and/or suspicious characters that had me guessing until the very end. Really fooled me when the real bad guy was exposed. On top of the bad guys was other secondaries, mainly Brandons sisters, that I enjoyed. Their input and sisterly banter had me smiling. Despite all the yes/no from Cara, Filthy Rich was a really good book to read. Ms. DePauls fans are going to eat this one up.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Love the boots! I wear a 6 1/2 but had to order a 7. Plenty of wiggle space for my toes and lots of space to tuck in my pants although it was a snug fir over the top of my foot which kept my foot from sliding back and forth. My only complaint is there is zero support for my arch. After an hour my feet were aching. I put in arch supports which I had plenty of space for, and now it's all good.

"Let me start by saying, I have not read Taint. I have it because the cover was just so freaking awesome and everybody said it was a must read. I know nothing about any of these in characters in Tryst or whether they were in the previous book. Frankly, I opted to read Tryst without having read the blurb because of Taint and my friends opinion on that title alone. Was that a good idea? Not sure but I can tell you this: HOLY JAW ON FLOOR, BATMAN! How! What?! How! My next book had better rock because I have no idea how I am going to recover from reading Tryst! My brain is still spinning and its been a full day since I finished.The characters. Heidi, Tucker, Ransom. Lets start with Heidi. I had a love/hate relationship with her. Here this woman seems to have the perfect life: Perfect job, husband, everything. And yet here she is fantasizing about another man. Okay its really more of a who I would do with no consequences fantasy but still. She has the perfect lifeor so it would seem. Tucker, now he I found annoying. Not because he was a annoying character but because, nothing every seemed to ruffle his feathers. Ever. Generous, attentive and gentle to a fault he is the perfect husband. Hes also a shrink. Wrap your thoughts around that for a moment. Lastly, there is Ransom. Again a love/hate relationship. I found him exciting, sexy, intoxicating andneedy. Hes a rock-star yet I didnt find him to be that JLO demanding. It was more of a broken soul, but even they get tiring.The story. Happily married couple decides to take a walk on the wild side and gets more than they bargained for. No shocker there. Heidi and Tucker are happily married and very much in love but things have gotten a little too routine so they decide to spice up their sex life a bitby bringing one of Heidis fantasies to life. The one where she get to have sex with the start of her who I would do with no consequences fantasy, Ransom, while Tucker watches. And of course it is followed up by next day regretsby Heidi. Its not that she cheated on her husband, oh no. She had his full blessings. Only, it awakens desires in her that her perfect husband in her perfect marriage just cant fill.My thoughts and feelings. I literally stayed up all night reading Tryst because I could not put this train wreck of a story down. There were times I wanted to take everybody and smack them upside the head to ask them WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!!! No a take it back, not Ransom, at least not a first. Heidi and Tucker definitely. The story is told completely from her 1st person POV so you get to experience all her roller coaster inner turmoil and self-loathing. How she loves her husband and what she feels for Ransom. Its all very tumultuous and unpredictable blowing away everything I expected to happen. Except for the sex. Yeah that was Seriously. Hot. Stuff. However, I feel the need to mention a few things on that subject. If you have triggers regarding rape or multiple sex partners, this is not the book for you. For those two reasons alone I am tagging this book 5-Flames. So if either of those things bother you, put it down now and walk away. But, it you are willing to experience the good, bad and ugly, lock yourself in a room and be prepared to be blown away.Tryst is my very first book by author S.L. Jennings and let me tell you, it was well worth the read. Rarely do I find a book that grabs me, sucks me in and leaves me in shock. How I felt when I first started reading and how I feel now is a completely reversal. Im almost glad I didnt read Taint first because now I have something to read from this incredibly author. Will there be a 3rd book, I have no clue but I have every possible part on my body crossed hoping there will be!I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Wicked Edge hits the ground running from the very beginning and never lets up. Even the ending had a Go! Go! Go! feeling to it and I loved every minute of it. Action packed with laugh out loud moments and some steam scenes keep the momentum going so fast I could put this book down. A must read for everybody!Cee Cee is one very determine woman! I loved her character with all those crafty revenge plans of hers. As much as I adored Daire in all his smexiness, he was simple no match for Cee Cee and all her shenanigans. All those twisting plans she had going on, just when I thought she was done...OOPS! she did it again. Poor Daire, he never stood a chance. Then Cee Cee's secret comes out everybody begins to lose their minds. LOL!!! Between laughing and waiting to see what happens next, Cee Cee and Daire's courtship has to be the most exciting in this series yet.Beyond the romance, there is a whole other subplot going on revolving around Apollo. That in itself adds a whole new level of excitement. Bad guys and trying to figure out who they are, who the distributor is, well I THOUGHT I knew who they were. Half right and half wrong, looks like I have to wait for the next book for the next piece of the puzzle. Of course, as everybody is trying to figure it out, I get the pleasure of reading about all these great secondary characters. I do get my HEA for Cee Cee and Daire (which is quite the hoot!) but the plot thickens for those secondaries.Rebecca Zanetti's books have turned into a addiction for me. Her characters and sitting on the edge of your seat plot lines are some of the best I have read all year. Frankly, this author could not do wrong in my book. I'd even read a menu if she wrote it. HAHAHA!!! But seriously folks, having read several of Ms. Zanetti's series, she is definitely someone PNR fans will love and I will highly recommend.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"I got a phone call from a friend I had recommended Clipped to. She was all excited and did I hear Bound was coming out and you are going to read it right?! I told her of course i was going to if nothing else to find out if the located any lube (Inside joke). But seriously, I couldn't wait to step back into this world to see what the heck was going to happen next. Oh my! Quite a lot!Kinzer have hooked up together (No not that way!) and are on the search for the Christ. Still seems weird to think of that entity that way. I eventually ended up singing another tune. Zips lips! On their way to gather more info Veylo snatches Maggie and now Kinzer is trying to find Maggie and the Christ before the world is destroyed. Along the way Kinzer encounters Hayde which gives us some of the biggest mind gamess as well as the hottest sex moments. It also showed sides off Kinzer that both had my heart hurting as well as gagging. Yikes!In the other half of the story, Treycore's on the hunt for Kid who's been kidnapped by Treycore's sadistic ex, Vera. Along the way he gets help from another ex, Eilee, who not only is a wee bit (UNDERSTATEMENT!) narcissistic but seems to also be a bit off her rocker. Hmmm...two ex-girlfriends for Treycore and here I thought he batted for just the other side. The journey Treycore and Eilee take has this strange LSD trippy feeling as they travel through hell. Don't even get me started on how freaky the inappropriate tentacle thingy was. I will never look at a octopus the same way again. GAH!As twisted as Bound was, I freaking LOVED IT! This time around there is less sex and more intense mind games. Now don't get me wrong, there is still plenty of sex, some of it being non-con (Consider yourself warned!). HOWEVER, there's less dropping trough random acts of lubeless sex and more meaningful moments. As for the lubelessness that drove me bonkers, and had me cringing, there is still plenty of it except for maybe one brief moment of thinking ahead.* Zips lips again and smiles evilly* As for those intense mind games, most are brought on by Hayde and Veylo. Those two kept me guessing the whole way though until the very end that is until once again I notice Im at 95%, and there's still a lot that needs to happen. And I have a moment when I realize unless a miracle happens there is going to need to be another book. Great, just great. More waitingDevon McCormack has done it again with Bound. He has sucked me in to this rabbit hole story that spins all my good/bad theories on its axes. A word of warning: Bound is not a book that can be read out of order nor as a stand-alone. There is too much that has already occurred and without knowing Kinzer, Treycore, Kid and Maggie before, then most of what they are going through will not make sense.

"When I saw the next book in Victoria Davies' Fated Match series was coming out, I started snoopy dancing. I read the second book and fell in love with her characters and plot. A dating service for supernaturals, you just know it's going to be filled with romance and laughter. The title alone, The Alpha's Temporary Mate, suggested this was going to be a entertaining tale. So I sat back, relaxed and started to read.AND LOVED IT!Sparks were fly from Chloe and Keiran from the get go...and not in a good way. Keiran wanting a temporary mate went against everything Chloe worked hard to do at Fated Mates. Every potential mate she presented was just not a right fit, until Keiran realized Chloe would be perfect for the job. So she steps up to the plate and the charade goes live. Now things get very entertaining!Having read the previous Fated Match book, I pretty much knew what to expect; fun entertainment. What I didn't expect was to not be able to put this book down. Chloe is such a romantic sweetheart but under that is a spine of steel! She was not going to back down from Keiran and bow to the Alpha in him. Keiran is the oppose of her, never having to give a inch and use to getting it his way. Except the pressure from his pack to mate that is. His way to get out of mating was fairly comical, trick his pack into thinking it's a done deal and he found The One. You just know that's not going to play out the way he planned.The romance between them was very entertaining. Their connection had a nice gradual build that was peppered with laugh out loud moments as their battle of wills played out. Don't think it's all snorts and giggles. These two pretend lovebirds have dark secrets of which Chloe's is the saddest. Poor abandoned girl, I just wanted to hug her. On top of the budding romance is a whole slew of secondary characters that added that extra oomph and I am eenie meenie miney moe-ing which one I would love to see get their story next (Please let it be Vivian!)Folks, if you love your paranormal romances to keep you up all night because you can't put it down, then this book is what you are looking for. It's not necessary to read the books in the series from the beginning being that each book works very well as a stand-alone. However, considering how good they are, I recommend reading them all.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Being a Avengers fan I knew the minute I read the blurb for Viking Warrior Rising, I was going to need to read the book. Evil Norse god Loki, elite band of immortal warriors, Vikings, oh lordyPLEASE tell me theres a smoking hot Chris Hemsworth as Thor that comes with this book!Okay, theres no Thor except for as in a passing comment (Blue cats??!!) however there is a fairly nice substitute in one fierce Viking king, Leif. Sexy and all male, Leif was the epitome of what a Viking should be including a wee bit protective of his woman  hello caveman much! Naya is filled with secrets and super strength. Leif ends up at the wrong place at the wrong time and BOOM he is under attack by mysterious Wolverines! Good news - Naya comes in and saves the day...and then leaves. Bad news - Wounded and feverish, Leif kisses her, inadvertently triggering an ancient bond...and he knows nothing about her. The hunt is on to find her and then to protect her, however from her POV, there's nothing to protect. She's been taking care of herself, protecting her self for a long time. Naya doesn't want nor need a man, particularly, a warrior king in her like. There's quite a bit of battling between these two as he tries to convince her they were chosen for each other by the gods. The one place they can agree things are all good is between the sheets!Lots of action and intrigue in this book to keep the pace moving fast as well as keeping me guessing to the end what was going to happen. There was the right blend between adventure and romance to keep me glued to my Kindle. Bonus points for all the of secondaries, most being Vikings, that I cant wait to read more about. It a close tie between Astrid and Harald on which was my favorite. The dialog between all the characters as well as their attitudes at times was humorous. Really there was nothing to hate about this book. Except for the bad guys that is.Viking Warrior Rising is my very first book by author Asa Maria Bradley and it was real good. It sucked me in right away and kept me hooked until the very end. I did have a twinge or two where I felt I wasnt reading a book one of a series. I almost felt I should understand more about the lab and the battle they have with Loki. I checked and sure enough, this was a book one. I guess for now Ill call it world building and hope theres more in the next book. Of WHICH, I am going to be waiting very impatiently for. Cant wait to see who its going to be about.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Darker Nights was a naughty little nugget that I truly enjoyed. It has all the right heat in all the right places and a nice little story to go with it. Delia works in her family's law firm that serves immortal clients. Having worked there for a long time she's had her moments with vampires and has long since gotten over it. That is until she is forced to take care of two clients. Mark is a shifter and Caleb is a vampire. Caleb knows she is the one, their one true match now for the had part, convincing Mark and Delia.This story had quite the unique humdinger for me: immortals that need divorce attorneys. I found that a complete contrast to all PNR stories I ever read. Every story I have ever read has the immortal realm mating for life but apparently, the myth of a true soul mate is not what Delia's clients are willing to wait around for. That is until Caleb walks into her world. Jade from a previous affair, Delia is willing to 'play' with Caleb and Mark but life-time commitment, nope. And boy do they play. Hubba-hubba! These certainly get hot between these three...I do so love a yummy DP scene! Of course we get a nice little HEA which always makes this PNR fan happy.This was a very hot introduction for me to author Nan Comargue. I really enjoyed this book not only for it's hotness but by the authors ability to put a new spin on a old subject; PNR soul mates. Looking forward to reading more from her.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Way back when the Coletrane, aka Probie, character was first introduced, I had my doubts about the boy. Yes, boy. Don't know why I had the impression of him being young as in a teenager. Boy was I wrong. Probie is all man. YOWZA! Coletrane is hot sex on a stick. That's not to say he doesn't have his issues, which some of them are real tearjerkers. And a tat artist... oh I am in love! Then there's Sinclair. If it looks and walks like a socialite, then think snob. Hold up here, she may look like, and actually be one, but snob is far from what Sin is. She is more than a match for Cole and definitely what he needs to sooth his soul.Put these two together and you have sizzling hot fire. But that's not all, you have a great opposites attract romance filled with high energy, hot bikers and twisty moments that kept my riveted from cover to cover. I love a story that can not only make me laugh but can bring me to tears as well. Coletrane did both. But that's not all. This highly entertaining story brought back all my favorite characters from the series and showed another side of them. If only they all got their own stories. Throw in some intrigue, sexy bikers, lots of seriously hot sex and this reader was a very happy camper.Ms. Warren has outdone herself! Coletrane was the perfect ending for the Bad Boys of Retribution MC series. Not only was it the perfect ending, it HAD a perfect ending. I don't think I stopped smiling through the epilogue, which just kept coming and coming. Yeah baby! I love it when authors wrap up series in nice neat bows although, in this case it would be more along the lines of chains and handcuffs. Now for the hard part... trying to figure out what to read next.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Belinda McBride is not the first author who has written a story about fallen angels and she certainly won't be the last. The trick to this old hat story is how one puts a new spin on it and I think she has done a fairly good job with Falling.So what made this book different for me? I think it was Rex, or more likely what Rex is: a ghillie dubh. I had to Google that to find out that is a solitary male faerie. He's has wings and a tail, and he's also gay. No surprise there since this is a M/M romance but what is strange Rion isn't. He prefers women except he's gay for Rex. There is of course more to that as anyone who reads this book will discover. Filled with curious twists along the way this novella packs quite the punch as all the layers are revealed. It the building relationship between Rion and Rex that really got me. The genuine feelings they have, not to mention the hot sex (Rex you're a bad boy with that tail!) had me devouring this story fairly quickly.Towards the end there is a mention of the succubus, and I'm not sure what her part in the story is because no sooner than she was brought up then the book ended (Huh?, rather abruptly (What?!), with a cliffhanger (Oh no!) I wasn't paying attention that this was a series. *Slaps head* Things were getting so good and now I got to wait for the next book. I guess that goes to show that I got sucked in quickly and was easily lost in the story. Falling was for me a very good beginning to what looks to be interesting series. I can't wait to see where Ms. McBride takes her Bad Angels series next.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Emily receives a phone call from her husband, Land. She needs to head over to the warehouse district because he's found their missing friend. When she gets there, she's expecting they are going to need to help out Matt, who's been bitten by a werewolf. What she finds is Matt in a cage. her husband covered in blood, and some random vamp duct-taped to a pipe. Get ready for a wild, crazy read. Intervention Starts out interesting with a phone call, moves on to a curious trip to a warehouse and takes a sudden sharp crazy turn into WTH when everything goes down.I'm going to try to keep any spoilers down to a minimum here. So yes, Matt has been turned into a werewolf but that's not the only reason why he's in a cage. And Land, which I thought was a strange name, is covered in blood and has been turned into a vampire. All this ties in with the creepy random duct-taped vamp. Without going into do much more details, yes Emily ends up having sex with Matt, things get crazy from there and they all end up being a happy triad. I pretty much finished reading this book in about on hour and it was a fairly insane read. The sex is hot, the going ons with everybody going from human to their now paranormal state is gory, and the spilling of the feelings made this a very entertaining read. My personal favorite part is the next day when the duct-taped vampire (for lack of calling him anything else) wakes up.Fun, fast, gory and hot, Intervention by author Aurelia T. Evans had me hooked from the beginning and kept my attention all the way to the last page.

"Taken In was a surprisingly interesting read. The author has managed to create a unique world I haven't encountered before. Supernaturals have taken over Earth and the purpose of humans are to feed and take care of their sexual needs. Kitty is one of those humans. She works, more like is a slave, at the Store Front. Her regulars, Vic, a wolf shifter, and Gale, a vampire, have feeling for her. They know their bond with her is special but they are unsure if she feels the same way about her.As this is a quick read, there isn't much back history as to how the supernaturals have taken over the world. The owner of the Store Front is quite to jerk vampire and treats the humans under his control fairly shoddy. At first I though Gale and Vic were gay or at least had a M/M relationship. Seems it's more of the brotherly and not lover type. However, what they feel for Kitty is more than just food and sex and we get a fairly hot show of the affections they have for her. Warning, if menages with DP are not for you, you may want to consider reading something else.Author Wendi Zwaduk has a nice story here. Just because this is quickie novella, don't think there isn't a story because there is. It just happens to have some hot sex to go with the HEA. Definitely a pleasant read to pass the time.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"I'm jumping into this World of Nightwalkers series at the very end instead of starting from the beginning so I'm going to try very hard to not let my lack of knowledge influence my review. However, it's kind of difficult because for the most part I felt lost trying to follow along. Taking in the story as a whole was too confusing There are so many characters and trying to keep them straight in my mind was difficult. I ended up just shutting down and trying to forget they had a past history, absorbing Kamen and Vive's story and the battle they had with Apep.All the other characters aside, I enjoyed this book. At first I found it to be a bit dry. I'm not sure if the intent of all the world building in the beginning was intended to bring everybody up to speed of what's happen so far. For someone new to the series, I found it came across as someone has told a story so many times, they have lost their enthusiasm and now was just spewing out history just to get it out of the way. I almost gave up 20% in but pushed through it until finally coming to the meat of the story, Kamen and Vive. I liked and yet was annoyed by them both at the same time. I liked them because these two deserved some happiness in their lives. Vive had been, for her entire life been crapped on by other Wraith's because she was a half-breed Wraith. Kamen screwed the pooch playing on the bad side for so long and is trying to atone for his misdeeds. Two miserable folks finally finding love and acceptance, and coming together, even though it was pretty darn quick! And yet, these very reasons are why I found myself equally irritated. Kamen! Enough with the self-loathing. You screwed up, get over it! And Vive, you girl finally are being treated with respect. Stop acting like a kicked puppy.Now for the story, the battle and the ending. I enjoyed the whole bringing of all the races together to battle the evil and to triumph over all. It took me a while to get Apep. He's pregnant?! How...? What...? How...?! I did eventually get my AHA! together but until I found out the details, that made absolutely no sense. I do have to say, I did love to hate Apep. He made a great evil being with the whole 'take over the world and kill everybody who gets in the way' mentality. The epic battle did seem a bit deflated, however the journey all the Nightwalkers took to get there was very entertaining. I bet I would have enjoyed it even more if I had previous experiences with all the well established characters. Individually, confusion. However, I do like a variety of paranormal breeds and there was no shortage of them here.As my first book by Jacquelyn Frank, it wasn't half bad. I'm really looking forward to reading more of her works. I did learn the hard way this is not a series you want to jump into the middle of. The World of Nightwalkers series definitely needs to be read from the beginning because without know everything, a reader will just flounder around trying to puzzle it all together. So if you are picking up Nightwalker as your first book to read, put it down and start from the beginning. I'm positive it will be worth it.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"I do so love discovering new authors and I found On the Hunt the perfect mixed bag of authors and stories to tempt my pallet. From humorous to to heart-wrench, action to suspenseful it's the perfect combination to feel all my needs in one book. Four authors with introductions to the writing styles and worlds, what PNR reader could ask for more!On The Hunt is my first book by Alexandra Ivy and I know it won't be the last. The quick introduction into the Sentinels series has certainly got my attention. I'm ready to explore more of this world but first, Mika and Bailey. This was a nice two-fer for me. Romance story + twisting, turning suspense = a great read that has me begging for more. Did I have any doubt they would end up together? Well, she is a free spirit and he's a duty above all else kind of guy. You just know that kind of clash will keep things interesting. There's even a few characters that caught my attention and I'm ready for more.By far my favorite of the bunch, Scorpius Rising by my new favorite author, Rebecca Zanetti, was a thrilling read for me. The rehook-up of Nora and Deke was great, the sex was hot. A little afraid to make the same mistake twice they need to work on their issues. But in the middle of them trying to work things out is a growing plague, a deadly disease they are trying like crazy to stop. YOWZA! Now that's a story I can sink my teeth into. All those twists and turns had me on the edge of my seat. Then...CLIFFHANGER! NOOOO!!! I calmed down knowing these four books are novellas to series to only find out Scorpius Rising is a pre-novella. WHAT?! And the next book isn't out until NEXT YEAR! No! No! No! I don't think I can wait that long to find out what happens next. Consider yourself warned.There always has to be a sad, heart-wrenching story in a series and that is a very apt description of Phantom Embrace. Yuri and Cat's story is a very sweet one. She's a ghost and he's...not. I really enjoyed how it played out as friendship building into something more. As more as it can be with someone who isn't corporeal. My mind was guessing only one possible outcome for these star-crossed lovers, and even though it was sad, there is still a beautiful HEA.Stake Out was plain out funny to me. A vampire fashion designer on the verge of her big show and all her models are popping up dead, then undead. Following along with her capers was very entertaining. The ending was a complete surprise. Consider me even more surprised when I checked out the author, Hannah Jayne, to find out this is actually part of a series. Really? It felt so much like a simple novella. I'm wondering if the rest of the series is as humorous. Definitely worth looking into.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"With all the PNRs and M/M romances I read, One Bit at a Time is offering me a first for me. A gay (not new), shifter (also not new) who likes to wear women's clothing. Hello, now that's new to me. It certainly gave a interesting twist to the story. So let's break this down.Raven as I said before is gay, cross-dresses and is a shifter. Life has not been kind to him. To be exact, it's his father (Human) who isn't kind. After the death of his mom (Shifter) is when things got bad for Raven and his siblings. After his dad catches Raven wearing his sister's clothes, the violence escalates. Beaten down but determine, he waits until his siblings are old enough to escape and live the life he wants. His brother has heard of a safe place, a wolf haven, where Raven takes off in search of hoping for a better life.For such a short story, One Bit at a Time packs quite a punch. The story switches back and forth from 3rd to first person so you get to experience a very emotional story told from Raven. All his fears for his family, his journey, and his self doubts are all laid out for the reader to experience. There's quite a bit of homophobic slang spewed from haters and I can how this may shock and offend some readers. Turns out, it's a very necessary evil so you can see what Raven has to endure.I'm not going into much more detail than that because this is definitely a book that needs to be experienced first hand by the reader. I will however, say this did I enjoy the happy ending. Sydney Presley is done a very good job with this book and I look forward to reading more from this author.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"When I'm asked what my favorite reads are the first thing I'm going to say is a exciting paranormal romance. It's always about the fang and fur for me. That and it has to have a interesting twist. Something I haven't read before is a added plus. Beyond the Poison Chalice met all my needs and then some.The thing that really got me going with this story was Silver. Or better yet, it's the concept of Silver and what someone has done to him; turning him into vampire catnip. It's not like vamps aren't already attracted to humans with the whole blood nom-nom thing, but to now make a human even more attractive to vamps, my mind is filled with images of vamps acting like my cats rolling all over the floor after partaking in the tasty treats. That probably wasn't what the author intended but Claudia certainly has that kind of attraction for Silver. Now as for Lucan, he's got a bit of bad boy in him as he watches Claudia and Silver get on with the catnip sexing. He isn't just a watcher and does eventually join in on the fun.But it isn't all sex and frolicking her, Claudia is a badass vamp that guards her territory fiercely. I would have liked a bit more to the story, heck a full on novel would make me happy only to know the whys, what-nots and the relationship building between Claudia, Lucan and Silver. If author Helena Maeve would turn this novella into a full story, I would not say no to the read. This is my first book by this author and I found Beyond the Poison Chalice a great introduction to her works. I'm ready to read more by her.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"For folks who like that paranormals hot, quick and dirty, Steal Your Soul Away is what you're looking for. Angelique is a vampire who also happens to be a burlesque dancer. Tom (Human) is a artist and his friend, Lucas, is a lycan. Only Tom doesn't know Lucas' little dirty secret. A chance encounter during one of her shows bring Tom into her life. Lycans and vampires don't get along but Angelique and Tom feels a forbid attraction to each other. Now the only question is can Tom handle what they are and make their twosome into a threesome.Things happen fairly quickly between Angelique and Tom. It's not a complete wham-bam-howdy-do-ma'am but it's close. Throw Lucas into the mix and things do get fairly steamy. We do get a glimpse to Angelique history, which as simple as it was, there was still enough to get a sense of her. There are a few typical paranormal clichs (Vamps can't go into churches, sliver bullet references) that had me groaning a bit but I got over it. The sex between our characters is hot and dirty. In a nutshell, Steal Your Soul Away was a good read to pass the time away with.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"I just finished reading Stone Cold by Olivia Rigal and Im left with a curious feeling. These arent pressing I-need-to-know questions sorting through my head. More like, Im puzzling what is going on together. I see by other reviews people are bashing on Lisa. However, I am not one of those bashers. I get her. I get the losing of a close brother and seeking solace in the arms of someone she has, or at least HAD, a connection with. I know some people would think thats a slutty move but after feeling the loss of a loved one, sometimes you need that human connection. Its the same for Brian needing that human touch. So that whole sex after death, nope not a skanky thing for me. What did come out shady for me was Steven and Everest. Really guys! Flirting and trying to score a hook-up during a funeralbad form.There a lot more to the story besides the afore mentioned, theres intrigue along with creepy MC bad guys. For a novella there is quite a bit of backstory into Brian and Lisas history that I was able to understand their motivations. While this is a MC story, there werent a lot of what I would call MC moments. Lets not forget, there is sex although if youre hoping for it to be graphically detailed I hate to disappoint you. So despite this is a short book I feel it well flushed out.So here is what makes me curious: Why couldnt Lisa see her brothers body? There has to be something more than a ick factor that is keeping her from seeing him. I found that frustratingly curious. Yes, with all the other things going on, that is the one thing that is sticking in my mind. Hmmm Im already trying to guess where this is going. Why you may askbecause there was a twist at the very end that has me thinking, and guessing where this is all going. I guess the only way to find out is to stick with the series.

"When An Omega Snaps is the perfect title for this third entry in A Lion's Pride series because that is what happens when a controlling Omega meets walking chaos! Get ready to laugh yourself silly! Leo and Meenas story will have you giggling from the very beginning.When I first met Leos character in previous titles, I found him a bit uptight. So uptight I was wondering what kind of woman would do for him. Why of course someone who is his polar opposite! And Meena sure is that. Its not that shes a hot mess, but more of a bull elephant in a china store. Shes not exactly a dainty flower but then again, Leos no little man either. Shes knows he is the one for her and her ways of convincing him that she is are pretty funny as shes not exactly a subtle girl. Oh how the mighty do fall!And fall Leo does. That is, his inner Liger does for Meena! Now convincing the man was a different story. It does help when a rival comes into town. Between Meenas antics and his Liger screaming MINE! MINE! you knew he would eventually cave. The travels he takes to admit defeat made for a good read. As for their HEA, not only was it hot and funny but it was all I could wish for.Ive been a fan through several of Ms. Langlais series now. I know can always count on a entertaining story that will have me laughing from the character antics to swooning from the steaminess. When A Omega Snaps does not disappoint! The characters from previous titles make appearances in this book but not so much that their story is spoiled so you can read this book as a stand-alone. However, with all this fun A Lions Pride series offer you really should start it from the beginning.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"I usually really enjoy books Felicity Heaton. The worlds she creates I find so fascinating and the romance so yummy. For the most part, each book usually can be read as a stand-alone although I know better to read from the first book so I get the full feel of the series. Unfortunately, I'm jumping into the Her Angel series with Her Sinful Angel. It's not a bad thing but I think I'm seriously missing out on some of Lucifer's history, like his child and the bitter rivalry between him and Mihail just to mention a few. It's not that I feel lost, instead get a sense had I read the previous titles I would have grasped the importance of this final book.I have mixed feeling with Lucifer and Nina's story. The very first chapter I was really into the story. What's the deal with Mihail dumping this mortal on Lucifer's doorstep. Is there a ulterior motive? What's Lucifer going to do to her? I was excited! Then we drifted into several chapters of all this inner angsting, questioning and not a whole lot of dialog or action. For me it started to drag, and I was ready for something exciting to happen. AND finally it did!Once I got over feeling lost I really enjoyed the Lucifer and Nina. Actually, more Lucifer than Nina. Nothing against her its just Im a sucker for stories that portrays Lucifer as a scapegoat  to heavens doing. There was plenty of action, as in epic battles, to keep me entertained not to mention the swoon-worth heat between them. The secondaries were great bonus, which makes me want to really read their stories now. Erin is so sassy I cant wait to sink my teeth into her book! The HEA was all I could hope for and seeing how it ended, if Ms. Heaton was to write a what-happens-next book, I certainly would not say no to the read.As I mentioned before, I jumped into the series without any previous history. I dont recommend doing that. There really is a feel of world building with the characters and the situations that I feel I have missed out on. Knowing how off the hook Ms. Heatons stories, I think its fairly safe to say this series was awesome. I do recommend reading Her Sinful Angel but only after reading the Her Angel series from the beginning.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Well color me surprised! Hotter With A Pole was not what I expected. There's not a whole lot of time to get a developed story, so normally novellas are very 'Hi-wham-bam-HEA-the-end'. You don't expect to get a story that's moving but that is exactly what I got here.Let's start with the title; Not a fan of it. It implied I was going to get a tacky smutfest. I mean come on, hot fireman plus hot biker equal a smutfest right?! What I got was a story that actually had depth with interesting characters. Noah and Hoyt were a complete treat. Okay, yes they did hop in the sack fairly quickly, but they also had emotional personal baggage that they need to work through. Both had experienced loss of someone close and both were afraid of take a chance of getting hurt again. Added bonus were all Noah's firemen friends.Instead of acting like fillers, they actually contribute to the story. Enough so that I look forward to reading their stories. My favorite secondary character: Hoyt's mom. *SNICKERS!!!*Hotter with a Pole is my first book by author Delilah Devlin. If this is any indication of what I can expect from her, it won't be the last.

"Just finished Bo and oh my! I have a new favorite Carolina boy. Not boy, MAN! Unlike all the other characters in Ms. Warren's Bad Boys of Retribution MC series, I think Bo is the one that is in need of the biggest hug. Don't get me wrong. Bo is just as hot and sexy as all her other characters. He just seems to be the most broken inside. His last Recon mission left him with PTSD, survivor's guilt and he isn't coping very well. Paging Doctor Veronica Hartley! Smart, sexy and the star of his dreams, Bo doesn't want her help. Luckily for him she's just a stubborn and finds a way to get him help and let his secrets out. He, however, isn't the only one with secrets and now it's his turn to do some rescuing.So unlike the previous two books in the series, I personally think Bo was more on the dangerous side. I'm not going into details because it would spoil the surprise although I will say I did cringe a bit. What I can say is the dangerous side (Think SOA) is welcome because we get to see more of the Retribution guys. WooHoo! I love all the secondary characters in this series. Tuck, Tail, Handsome, and the rest of the bad boys are all making an appearance. What makes a ding-ding bonus for me as getting to find out how well the past Retribution main characters are doing.I've read pretty much every book Rie Warren has written. They all tend to be first person POV from the guy's perspective and I got to say, she's really nailed how I guy thinks, talks and acts. I think that's what makes her books so special. I personally think everybody should be reading her book. But don't just take my word for it. Grab yourself a copy of all the books in the Bad Boys of Retribution MC series and judge for yourself and be prepared to be blow away.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Every time I look at the cover of Coyote's Kiss I keep thinking I'm going to be reading a gay PNR. Don't ask me why the cover screams male PNR it just does. BUT, it's not. It's action - YES! Shifters - YES! and loads of fun.Luca has quite the wicked sense of humor and likes to blow things up...BTW, he's also a coyote shift. As ATF, he's working together with other agencies in the coalition and is having the time of his life. Jade is smart, tough and NOT a shifter. Unlike the FBI she works for, she is more accepting of shifters and has a curiosity about them then. Together they make a couple that I found very entertaining to read. Actually all the characters in the coalition are great. I can't even call them secondaries because they all seem very front and center and play very important roles. There was plenty of action and suspense to keep me from putting this book down. Great world building in this Shifter Chronicles series yet I have found the books also work well as stand-alones. I found that with this coalition building of combining different organizations, and different shifter types together, author Crissy Smith has created a great series that everyone into PNR book will thoroughly enjoy.So I now have a few Crissy Smith books under my belt and I got to say, she is simply wonderful. I can't believe I haven't discovered this goldmine of a author before. Her talent in creating shifters, their interactions, suspense and sense of humor in her books is something I look for in every PNR I read. Anyone who isn't reading her, should be. I can't wait to read more of her works.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Dragon Fall starts off fairly interesting. Its starts with a date, a ring, a murder (of sorts) and a two year trip to a mental institution for our heroine Aoife. Once she gets out, Aoife is determine to get her life back on track. That is until a dog and a stranger end up in her lap. Turns out the dog isnt just a dog but a demon and he can talk. And that stranger, is hot, hunky and, oh yes, a dragon. A moody black dragon to be exact. Turns out everything she was locked up for is true and she has to deal with it. Plenty of twist, turns and humor, keep this crazy ride going along. Hello Alice, I think you have discovered another wacky hole to fall into. So many twist and turns in this story keep it rolling along. Kostya has a few issues hes dealing with and he does NOT want a mate. Aoife has to come to grips with the reality she was told wasnt real, really is. Jim is a hoot as our demon/dog and his lack of filter is very entertaining. The adventure these two take to try to break the dragons curse is fraught with mishaps and hilarious discussions. Through in a cast of likable secondary characters and what you have is a good start to what promises to be a fun series.As much fun as I had reading Dragon Fall I have a few bones to pick. One, despite this being book one in the lack Dragons, I cant help but feel Im walking into the middle of the series, Theres a familiarity between some of the characters that Im not getting. If this a spin-off series a little warning would have been nice. Two, normally I like a book that can make me laugh but in this instance, there was almost a bit too much silliness for me. Obviously, Jim was the comic relief here. A demon that chooses his form to be a big dog - yup fun stuff, and the lack of filter was downright hysterical. I think the issue is I couldn't quite tell if all the humor was intended. Some of the parts that could have been serious got lost in the funnies and fell flat. Third, the ending. If I was reading a paperback I know when I hit the end I would have been flipping pages and comparing notes with other copies of the book because the ending was a bit abrupt. It certainly felt like I was missing something even though there was a HEA. Could that have been a intended cliffhanger?Despite my issues, this was a pretty good book and I did enjoy it. I think I may do some investigating into Ms. MacAlisters other series and see if I can get up to speed before the next book in the Black Dragons comes out. Maybe after reading some of her other books Ill get my AHA! moment. As for my recommendation, I say sure go ahead and read it. It has dragons.

"Oh my! Eve Langlais has done it again with When A Beta Roars. This second entry into the A Lion's Pride had me laughing from the very beginning. Hayder is quite the hoot and quite the ladies man. He's unfortunately tasked with babysitting a woman, which he thinks is way below his lofty Beta status. Arabella is a widowed wolf. Abused and beaten down by her previous mate, suddenly she a hot commodity by the members of her pack. Maybe it has something to do with her now being rich, and whoever gets her not only gets to be Alpha but they get her buckets of money as well. A wolf and a lion as mates is a pretty funny thought but when you throw into the mix that she's allergic to cats, HILARIOUS! Poor Hayder, she's sneezing all over him all the time. *Snickers!* However, he's willing to put up with it and all her timidness because with one look he knew his bachelor and catting around days were over. Instant mate connection!Between all her sneezing and constant threat of being snatched away by greedy wolves, there's a entertaining story. Big mighty Beta, the whipped wolf and how they change each other. She learns to be stronger, standing up for herself and him...okay all he really does is put his catting days behind him. They have a few escapades along the way (dinner, kidnapping, allergies) while Hayder proves he's quite the gentleman (Purr! Oh wait, lions don't purr!) as he's willing to wait for Arabella to decide she wants him. That translates into not a whole lot of sex in this one. *Sad meow* However, they do get on to the dirty deed and when they do, it's delicious! And the HEA...RAWR!!The best part of any story is the characters and once again I got to experience the lionesses in the pride which provide some of the funniest moments for me. They sure know how to keep the males in their place. That is all but one; Leo the Omega, He's actually turned out to be my favorite character in the series and I can't begin to tell you how happy I am to see he gets his own book. Happy meow!Whenever I read a sad book that turns me into an emotional wreck, I know I can always turn to one of Eve Langlais' books to perk me right up. Her stories always get me laughing and have the funniest characters. The situations they find themselves in always leave me smiling. Anyone wanting something light and entertaining to read, needs to get When a Beta Roars.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Wow, just WOW! I've got quite the book hangover here after finishing Breaking. The difference between book one in this series, Falling, and Breaking is close to being like night and day. So much action and intrigue. But on the other hand, they are very similar since they both have lonely men desperately in need of love.Conrad was certainly not what I expected. After finishing Falling I really didn't like him. At. All. Then I see he's getting his own book. OooKaaay. Guess I better get over my dislike of him. And....Yeah turns out I did like him. I certainly get why he was such a jerkface to Malachi. It doesn't excuse him but at least I get him now. Archer starts out as a scary hot dude and moved into my still kinda scary but maybe more misunderstood hot dude. Oh yes, both this guys are broken, Alpha personalities and neither wants to give an inch. I'd like to say it was Deefor (Freaking funny name BTW!) that helps bridge the gap between them. Once I learned their secrets I just wanted to give them both hugs.The first half of the book I really enjoyed. There's a lot of walls these two have to conquer both together and individually not to mention then need to figure out who is trying to kill them. Then right around 50-55% into the story I started to check the page count because I didn't thing things were going to go too much further without getting drawn out into BoringVille. All of a sudden WHAM! Everything kicks into to high-octane excitement! Holy Twizzlers! I did NOT see that coming! And things just keep coming and now not only can I not put this book done I also can't devour it fast enough. Just when I think these can't get any better and things have finally got to start calming down, author Barbara Elsborg manages to kick it up even higher. YOWZA! I was, finally, able to calm down when I got to the end. The end, oh yeah, that ending. Was all I could have wished for. *Sigh*You know the hardest part about writing reviews? It's when a book gets you SO EXCITED! you want to shout to the world how good it is and talk details... and you can't because you would be giving the plot and all the spoilers away. Author Barbara Elsborg has taken me on one heck of a roller coaster ride. Up, down, calm stretch, then dropping me into screaming loopy-dee-loops. By the end I saw in such awe I wanted to jump on the ride called Breaking again. I'm I recommending this book? You betcha! This series just gets better and better.

"My Obsession by Cassie Ryan was a great start to her new Club Desire series. Sandra grew up in a troubled home. To get away she heads out to NYC where she finds the BDSM scene much to her liking. That is until she ends up with the wrong Dom., an abusive one, a stalker one. To get away from him she returns to her hometown where she once again seeks out the BDSM world. There she finds a club more suited to her and discovers a Dom who is perfect for her. Brent grew up being bullied as a nerd. All throughout school, he was picked on. Now hes an adult and owns the hottest dungeon in Phoenix. Hes got it all except for a woman to call his own. The one day, the girl he dreamed about all through high school walked in his dungeon doors.I have mixed feeling about Brent. Let me start with I really enjoyed his character. I found him very sexy, smart and I would do him in a heartbeat. Hes come a long way from the abused nerd he was in high school. My problem is while he was very gentle to Sandra, I didnt find him to be a very strong Dom. My expectations of Doms tend to run on the very strong and dominant tside. I found him to be a bit more beta than alpha. Equally, I am questioning Sandras choices as being a sub. Im not getting the whole abused child wanting to be a sub thing as an adult. Both of them were head-scratchers to me but maybe this is what works for them.My personal issues aside with the MCs, I found this book to be a very good read. Theres lots of great secondary characters here that I enjoyed and look forward to see them get their own stories. In addition, theres a lot of sexy play and smooth dialog that gives this book a nice pacing. Equally good was the stalker hunting down Sandra. It certainly gives a new meaning to the title and added a very nice scary twist to the whole thing.

"Seeing The Love by Sofia Grey is a very sweet romance reads quick and is filled with swoon worth romance. Lucas is losing his sight but he's not letting that slow him down. Natalie was in a horrific car accident that has left her covered in scars. They both work for the same company and have a long distance working relationship for years. Neither know about each others conditions and they plan to keep it that way. When a chance to meet each other in person presents itself secrets will be revealed.Get ready to sigh and smile a lot. Lucas and Natalie are very sweet characters. Its easy to see how they are attracted to each other. Both are very self-conscience of what they consider their personal downfalls and both have been burned by previous loves. You would think a story about a man losing his sight hooking up with a woman covered in scars would come off being tacky and ironic, but the author has presented in a way that you are left feeling theyre soul mates. I really enjoyed their interactions as friends then moved into something more. As their secrets were exposed, all their vulnerabilities pulled at my heart. There are other little twists to their story that keep the story moving along at a good pace. And yes there is a very sweet, very satisfying HEA for these two.I expected a quick ready, which I got, but I didnt expect to enjoy it as much as I did. It was a nice break from all the heavy books Ive been reading lately.

"It's not often I give up reading a book. It takes a lot of factors to get me to stop reading a book. Too much/not enough info, bad plot, bad characters. Really, I will trudge through most anything thing, cover to cover, to give my honest opinion about a book. Sometimes it's me, sometimes it's the book. I think in the case of Castrato, it was me.I pretty much spent the first 40% of this book confused. There's a lot people that get introduced and of building up to the story but for me it was a bit jumpy and scattered. I just couldn't absorb and compartmentalize all of the what and who. I did like the characters, don't get me wrong here. I did find, for the most part, all the characters fairly interesting. And the premise of the story, from the blurb, was sound. I am a PNR fanatic; fangs and fur are my preferred reading so I actually looked forward to reading the book. I just couldn't get into it. Even going back and re-reading I found didn't help me. I really did want to know who the killer was and why. Maybe, if I kept going everything would have pulled itself together and I would have had my 'AHA' moment. I just couldn't force myself to keep going on.I just didn't get it. This is no fault of the author's, and what he has written was well done. A solid 3-Stars with the chance of moving up. The beginning of the book and the first murder was very riveting. Of all the characters I had read in Castrato, I found Nathan to be the most interesting.  But outside of that first murder and Nathan, my brain just kept shutting down. So for now, I'm putting Castrato down, and moving it into a possible into my 'be read maybe at a later date' pile. Who knows, maybe with time I'll be able to get into the story. For right now, I'm moving on.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"I was in the mood for something besides my go-to PNRs and standard contemporary readings. I read the blurb for Final Protocol, saw that is SciFi with dubious content and said what the heck. At 109 pages, I figured even if I didnt like the book, I wouldnt have to suffer very long. Turns out the book wasnt too bad. As a book about a killer, there isnt so much killing. Its more of shes letting her intended hits get away and bad things are going to happen. Then Gold dangles the proverbial carrot in front of her face: FREEDOM! She just needs to take on one more and then hell let her go. This final target isnt so easy to kill.Silence was a strangely interesting character. A reluctant killer and shes very good at it. Gold is the uber creepy guy that calls all the shots and abuses her in not-so-nice ways. That would be the dubious content there. Those of you who have rape and mind manipulation as a trigger, thats why Im giving this book 5-flames so read this book at your own risk. I kept wondering as her story unfolded, if shes such a great killer, why doesnt she just kill the sadistic bastard. Then that little nugget was explained, AHA, gotcha now. Bits and pieces of her story come out slowly at the beginning but once she goes after her final target who, no surprise is her lost love, the escalate very quickly to the end. There obviously more to the story than just that but as a short ready I dont want to give anything away. In a sense, Silence does get her happy ending, however, she is a killer and the only way shell be truly happy is to get her revenge on Gold.This is my first book by J.C. Daniels and it was fairly good. Final Protocol was a pretty quick read, with just enough content to keep the characters interesting and me entertained. The ending had enough of a cliffhanger to have me curious what Silence has in-store for Gold.

I dont like to be scared by things that go bump in the night so the fact that I signed up to read The Secret Casebook of Simon Feximal was completely out of the norm for me. To tell you the truth, I chose to read it because I liked the title. It was kind of quirky and I knew If I didnt at least discover what the title was about, I knew it would have bothered me for a while. And I really liked the book!I didnt realize it was a series of short stories about Robert and Simon collected to make one book. You see, Ive never read anything by K.J. Charles so I had no clue. Now I get it. The book is told completely from Roberts first person POV of his relationship and experiences he had with Simon. Not just hunting ghost but what they went through as two men involved during the Victorian era. Now, normally, I shy away from horror and ghosts because I prefer to not be freaked out. Frankly, after their first encounter, I realized this wouldnt be a uber scary story. Dont get me wrong, there is horror and evil, which doesnt all come from the dead, but Simons need to help ghosts seems to be more along the lines for good reasons. Some of the stories/chapters, are more fascinating than others although as I reach the end of each chapter, things would click into place the purpose behind them.Theres a interesting cast of secondary character that add a curious layer to the book. Ms. Kay had me scratching my head for the longest time. That is until her story came out. YIKES! There are others that, whenever they appeared I had mixed feeling about. For the most part, the evil ones were easy to detect and when they finally meet their end I was cheering. But then there were a few that I felt I almost should know who they were. The Fat Manis he a reference I should know or has the author created a character so sincere that I feel if I knew my British history better, I would know who he is?As Ive said before, this is my first book by K.J. Charles. I see she has a whole slew of books out with several of them about Simon and Robert. The Secret Casebook of Simon Feximal has struck me curious enough that I really want to read more about them, despite not liking ghost stories. I think its because in the end, I really enjoyed then. I think I will indulge in more of her books.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Secret Bliss was quite the giggler for me. At 30 pages it reads fast and tickles me in all the right places. Normally I expect closet erotic readers and not a closet erotic writer. Closet as in her hubby doesn't know she writes erotic romances. That is until he finds out she does and takes her on a little adventure. This quickie doesn't have a lot of detail but what it does have is fun characters mixed with just the right amount of heat.  Their escapades in the restaurant had me smiling and smirking. After finishing it got me to thinking about erotica writers. Do they only write about the naughties or do they live them as well?Secret Bliss was my first book by Cora West. It made for a entertaining read and well worth the half hour.

"Angel Lover is one action packed adventure.It certainly was not what I expected. Frankly it was way better than I anticipated. The energy level I am buzzing on after finishing this book is through the roof.Wow, just, wow! If I was to use one word to describe Mariel and Kas story it would be unpredictable. So many twists and secrets here. There's so much to both of them, their background stories, how got to where they are now, that I felt I really was able to get to know them very well. Mariel is strong, fierce, and her story is heart-wrenching and shocking once everything is revealed. Kas is equally strong and as sad as his story is Mariel definitely comes out the unfortunate winner here. I really got into the to trust or not to trust dance they did around each other. And as hot as the sex was between them, I'm glad everything wasn't all lust driven. These are two warriors, to make them into smut bunnies would have ruined the story.There's lots of secondary characters that have peaked my interest, (Jarrid Cain, Tanis to name a few) I'm ready to find out more about. I missed out of the first books in the series so I'm walking in blind regarding the battle between the Renegades and Heaven. Easy enough to think it's about good angels and demons but this isn't the case here. It certainly provided a interesting twist to what has become to me standard angel stories. Right around the time I felt I had everyone and everything just figured out, who's good, who's bad, and what I expect to happen next, Curveball! I love when that happens. The only thing I predicted right was that Mariel and Kas would end up together. That and there had to be a epic battle which there always is one when good and evil clash. But that's okay because it offered up the right amount of violence this bloodthirsty reader likes. Now Mariel and Kas do get their HEA however, I get the feeling this series doesn't end here because, TA-DAH! there's a cliffhanger. Not one that is going to drive me bonkers but enough that I am ready to find out what happens next to {BEEP}. Oh sorry, not telling. You'll have to read to find out for yourself.This is my very first book by Tricia Skinner and let me say it now, I AM HOOKED! The only problem is I am starting at book 2 instead of book 1. I keep jumping into these great series in the middle instead of at the beginning. I really need to change that pattern up because I missing that introduction every series seems to have. But that's not a problem since I want, no NEED, to read Angel Assassins series. Lovers of Angels stories that aren't of the fluffy white harp playing variety are going to love this series.

"I hopped into the series in the middle of it and knowing what I do now, I have GOT to start it from the beginning if for noting else this series ROCKS! Undying Hunger was so hard to put down.Alexandria and Markus are quite the exciting couple. They have one of those how-could-you, what-happens-next, forgive-him, swoon, kick-his-butt, yes! romances that I oh so love to read. She hates him, she has so many reasons to and yet, wants him. Markus, oh boy. He's such a vampire in quite the conundrum. He was good, then did bad, and is now trying to come out of the dark. I'm not sure why he turned Alexandria in the first place as I missed reading the first few books in the series but I totally get why he wants and desires her now. As their story unfold, I found myself cheering them on and booing everyone against them. Yes this includes all the good guys. I'm a sucker for rogue redemption and the journeys they take to their happy ending. I also like a story that is filled with action and intrigue which there was no shortage from here.The majority of the secondary characters we have already met in previous titles. I always like series that carry over their characters. They feel like old familiars friends and getting to experience them a second, third, fourth time around always gets me excited. There is a new player this time, Christian. I had mixed feeling about him in the beginning and really didn't think much of him. By the end, I was singing a new tune. Now I hoping he gets his own book. Please, please, please let there be another book with his name all over it. PLEASE!If you're looking for a great vampire romance with lots of action to since your teeth into, then let it be The Enclave series by Jessica Lee.

"Well that was certainly a good book. Carnal Risk was a exciting read. The beginning chapter had my jaw on the floor and all the exciting adventures pretty much kept it there.Usually somewhere along the lines I will find myself annoyed with MCs in the story. This isn't the case here. Garrett and Selby were two very likable characters. Despite Garrett being a billionaire he comes off as being very down to earth. Selby is very intelligent and, despite her many phobia issues, a very tough lady. It's very obvious that there is a instant attraction between them. Their interactions in and out of the bedroom are highly entertaining. Who knew almost drowning from surfing could be a aphrodisiac!Now before you think this is just another romance, there a mystery to solve as well. Someone has murdered Garrett's close friend and co-worker, Evan, the reasons why have yet to be discovered. Selby is brought in to help cover for and find a replacement for Evan. There's quite a bit of intrigue on guess the whodunit. Was it one of the many great secondary characters? Why was he killed? So many questions to be answered. I kept flipping back and forth on who was the killer and then... GASP! No way! I didn't see that coming. Quite the shocker let me tell you.I fell in love with Kym Grosso's PNR story and have been recommending her books for a while. The first book in her new contemporary romance series, Club Altera, is shaping up to be just as good. Anyone looking for a author who can multitask in several genres, needs to be reading Ms. Grosso. Now I've reached the hard part in a series, waiting for the next book!I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"I had such fun with this book! Dying to Date was fun and flirty with edge of intrigue from start to finish. At times I found myself giggling, others I was biting my nails.Melissa is a vampire socialite however thankfully I did not find her to be a snob. Maybe a bit grumpy, but who can blame her when shes dying to find a date (Get the title!). So she tries her hand at a dating service for supernatural. Shes not getting any matches until... Tarian has been around a VERY long time and he is looking for a mate. Necromancers arent exactly welcome in the supernatural world, so keeping his background on the down-low he tries out the same dating agency as well. Its attraction at first sight. And so the adventure begins!I found Dying to Date a hoot from the very beginning. Melissas situation as the dateless I found to be entertainingly funny. When Tarian walks in you can tell there is some serious va-va-va-voom between them. The dialog on their date was snappy and fun. And then Tarians family has to go in and ruin it by kidnapping her. Now things got real fun as Tarian goes for the rescue and the rush across the country to get back to her family to stop a war. The adventures they had along the way were some of the best parts for me. The ending was all I wanted it to be and more. Now the question is, will there be another book in this Fated Match series and who is it going to be about? Cant wait to find out!This is my first book by Victoria Davies and what a delightful treat it was. It had the right amount of sass, danger and heat to keep me entertained the whole way through. I missed reading book #1 in this series and if it is as much fun as Dying to Date was, then I will need to rectify that immediately. Very much a recommended read for lovers of fun PNRs.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"It's not often I get to indulge in a SciFi romance. Most I have come across are all about the boinking and I like my stories to have a bit more substance. Which is why I was completely delighted with Roark by Jacqueline Rhoades.Godan warriors have been at war with the Hahnshin for a thousand years. Their current battleground is Earth and the people on the planet have been paying the price for six long years. The survivors are doing all they can to stay alive. While this premise is not an original one, it's one that usually works for me especially if I can engage with the characters. Mira and Roark, Oh yes, I liked them a lot. Mira is such a tough woman doing what she can to keep her family going. Roark is all male and strong, even when he goes all caveman I still found him sexy. The heat between them was a nice perfect simmer. Things can't run all smooth for them and as the story progress we find out both are harboring some fairly powerful secrets. Hers was easy to guess them but his...yeah didn't see that coming. They do eventually work things out, although not without some serious issues, but in the end their HEA was a perfect, and surprising one.This isn't just all romance between these pages. Their survival, action, intrigue and some giggling moments as the Godan solders get educated in the fine art of English and human women. Not sure there was a intent of humor in those classes but I found some of them funny. The cast of secondary characters were simply a delight. Mason, Ahnyis, Mohawk, just to name a few, had me smiling and cheering them on. I hope as this series continues we get to see more of them.I've been a fan of Ms. Rhoades' Wolvers series and this is my first taste of her book outside of that world. I'm really enjoying this bite and plan on sampling her other books. Anyone who wants to try SciFi without all the extra tentacles and eyes needs to read Roark. Lovers of SciFi are going love it, too.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"I'm sure by now you've read the blurb for Rush and wanted to know what it's about. Let me break it down for you. Hot boy meets plain Jane girl, sees something special in the girl, decides to help her out, they fall in love and live happily ever after. Sounds simple right? Only this boy is heir to the biggest adult entertainment film maker in Canada. He's also VP and one of his duties is screening the talent. The girl is a heartbeat away from finishing school to become a lawyer. And what does she need help with? A bucket list of to do's left by her grandmother.Let's start with Everly. Plain, smart, studious. Mom's a lawyer, dad's a lawyer. You can pretty much guess why she is on the track to becoming a lawyer. Everly's grandmother passed away leaving her not only her house but a bucket list of things to do before she finishes school. Things to loosen her up, to live life. Little things like date someone you wouldn't give the time of day to. Queue Max's entrance. Hot, rich, cocky. He's whole life has been about the porn industry. Mom was a porn star, dad is the president. Sole heir to his parents' dynasty, groomed to take over for his dad, but he feels something is missing. Everly and Max: Two opposites yet so the same.I love this book! What a plot. It really wasn't what I expected. I thought what with the porn I was going to reading something sleazy. Instead, it was fun, exciting and had me laughing. The adventures Max takes Everly on to take complete her bucket list I couldn't get enough of. Dont expect shallow one dimensional characters here. With dueling 1st person POVs we really get to experience their thought and emotions, all their insecurities and desires laid bare for us as we take a wild ride with them to their journey to a HEA. One that they want to live and not chosen for them. Along the way we get to meet a host of secondary characters that you can help but like and want to know more about. I laughed, I cried but mostly I devoured their story in one sitting, Yep, Rush is one of those books that I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning reading because I could not put it down. If I had one complaint about this book that it isnt a series. I would love to see Bens and Graces futures.As my first book by Gina Gordon I keep asking myself why I haven't discovered her before. Her ability to write a hot story and still keep it fun is simply amazing. I can't wait to read more of her books. As for reasons why you should read Rush, I'll give you five.1. The bucket list2. Study incentives3. Levin Accomplishment Room4. Vagina molds5. Porn has never been this funny.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Eye of the Tiger is my first book by author Crissy Smith. I walked in with no expectations but I'm coming away with needing more. This book read hot quick and loaded with what I like - Action, excitement and adventure.What really sold me on this book are the characters. From the main to the secondary, I found them all a pleasant surprise. Zak and Abilene are the main ones and they immediately had me cheering them on. Throw in Jaime, Cody and Luca, who are all amazeballs. The intricate interacting between all the characters definitely makes this story. But thats not all. They are all working in an investigation that kept this story moving quickly. Now, what would a shifter story be without some heat? There are several scenes between Zak and Abilene that are steamy hot and wildly explosive. Of course, there was also a few that had me giggling ICE! Hee-hee!!Starting in the middle of a series sometimes can be a hot mess, especially if you needed backstories to understand. This is not the case here. Eye of the Tiger works great as a stand-alone and am throwing it in my recommended pile. Although, given how much I enjoyed Cody and Jaime, I backtracked to see what the first books in the series were about. And what do you know, there are my two favorite shifters starting in their own books. I am definitely, going to be checking them out.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Hotness. Only at the Cavern is simply hotness. And exciting. Did I mention it was hot, too? In all seriousness, I thoroughly enjoyed this latest installment in the Heroes of Saturn series. Almost all the other books have the main characters as being the actual folks from Saturn finding their soul mates. Honestly, after the last book I didn't honestly know how the series would go on. However, some of the secondaries were interesting enough (Thank Goodness!) to keep this series.Captain Marco DeWinter. I really didn't think much about him before but now... Mmmm! And Jasmine is smoking sexy. She is a smart, brilliant doctor use to giving orders. At The Cavern, watch out subs. No kittenish Domme here. She's all woman - knows what she wants and how she wants it. The dynamics between them both professionally and sexually were quite the treat. Normally I don't read Domme/sub books but Marco and Jasmine really made it work for me.Running in the background is a case that Marco had been working on for quite some time. Scary dude that among other things is into trafficking women. While Marco is trying to nail the case and put the bad guy away, he's trying to sort through being a sub and wanting a relationship with Jasmine, who has a few issues of her own. Action and adventure in and out of the bedroom...oh yeah! Throw in a visit from past characters plus a few new ones (Cassidy needs his own book...JS) and I was loving every bit of it.I've been addicted to this series from the very beginning. Only at The Cavern is a definite recommendation from me. Anna Alexander has created quite a few characters that you just can't help but adore and I'm sure once you start reading this series, you'll understand why. So grab yourself a copy and enjoy the ride.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"I have now read five out of seven books in this series and I have to say, Ghost's Treasure is my favorite. It has something that I found lacking in the previous books - real suspense and intrigue. I know that sounds harsh but when you read a series about 'warriors' and read the blurb describing what the Wind Warriors are all about, you expect action, intrigue and suspense. When it goes missing or plays a very minor role in the story, it can be very disappointing.The story begins with Josie rummaging through a box of book she purchased at a estate sale. Little does she know and much to her surprise, she stumbles upon a hidden treasure. Not know if it is real, she sends emails out to museums to determine what she actually has in her possession. Next thing you know, people are after her to get the priceless treasures she has. Not knowing what to do, she goes to the FBI for help. From there things start getting interesting. The FBI assigns her a bodyguard to protect her until all the evil players are rounded up and taken care of. All the action and intrigue surrounding the lost treasure and the means Ghost takes to protect Josie is what I loved the most. It kept the story moving at a great pace what with not knowing what was going to happen next.There is, of course, the romance that develops between Ghost and Josie. Ghost has his own tragic story and ghost of his past that haunts him. Josie is no dumb blond and is actually a fun character. The fact that she is a biathlon athlete and was raised around guns keeps her from being a shrinking violet when all the dangerous chaos ensues. Lots of surprising twist and turns as they deal with the bad guys and we get a revisit with all the previous Wind Warriors, which in a series, is always a nice plus for me. Things do heat up between them, thankfully well after the danger has all passed, and has a nice slow progression and ends in a sweet HEA.So this is the seventh book in the series and I'm not sure if there will be more. I know for me it will be my last. Over-all this is not a bad series and I'm sure there will be many readers who will enjoy and appreciate what it has to offer. I personally enjoy a book that has a lot more action. Although, I found the stories a bit repetitive, Cheyenne Meadows does do a good romance and I'm sure fans of hers will enjoy this series.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Silver Spoon is the fifth book in the Wind Warrior series and it's about my favorite character in the series so far. Which of course means I have very high expectations for this book. I think I may have set the bar too high. Hmm...As romance goes this one is fairly good. Lots of emotions between the two main characters, Riley and Spoon. In the previous books enjoyed Spoon's personality and found his wit and comments  very humorous and was hoping for more of that. Sadly, the Spoon in this book did not meet my expectations. He had came off more angsty . Nevertheless less, their story as it unfolds is sweet and as they discover each other secrets they find they have quite a bit in common. Romance blooms between Spoon and Riley while they struggle through challenges life throws their way. There's appearances from the characters from the previous books and everything ends in a nice neat little package.Here's my problem with this book and the entire series. I have now read four out of the five books and they all feel like I am reading the same book. Each book has a big dog that was either adopted as a rescue or was found and rescued. Almost all the characters have parent issues. All but one of the lead women was a virgin. Almost all the men to blow off steam after a assignment were man-whores but meeting that special woman has completely changed them in a blink of an eye. When there is action/assignment that the Warriors have to attend to, their thoughts are always on that special person, how they may die, can't be with them and other angsts. There's more but I think I've made my point. While the stories are all nice, have HEA and no cliffhangers, there is a very set pattern and formula that each book has to contain. This might work for other readers but I like variety. I don't want to feel like I'm reading the same book over and over. I want each book to feel uniquely different. Unfortunately, for me, each book was too dj vu for me to enjoy.Over-all, this is a nice romance. It has a nice flow, sexual heat and a HEA.

"I didn't think it was possible but Ms. Phoenix has outdone herself with this latest Brie book.In this latest installment, Master send Brie on errand that has me gasping for air. What? No...not possible! But just when I get over that first shock there a even bigger one on the horizon I DID NOT SEE COMING! Talk about kicking up that WOW! bar of shock up a few notches. Brie handles it all in her own fashion that shows you how far she's come and how mature she is from those early days of submissive training. Of course this errand isn't the only one Brie is asked to assist in. There's more that had me laughing so hard I had to stop reading before I could continue. Smooshed between all these gasp out loud moments is some delicious times with Master. I never get tired of those.Now grab yourself a copy, sit back and enjoy the ride.

"Dark Instincts is my first introduction to The Phoenix Pack series. I missed out on the first three books so I walked into this series blind not knowing the plot or characters. The very beginning I was good with and definitely sparked my interest. As more and more characters came into play I began to get confused and lost. Obviously, reading the first four books would have helped understand who was who as well as the different packs. For that handicap alone I would suggest reading the previous books. Once I got pass the first several chapters I got into the swing of things.I love Roni! First off, she is a very strong character. I like my lead women to be strong and she totally fit the bill. She also has the quirky coping devices, lollipops and sharing the weirdest trivia facts that I found simply delightful. Marcus is hubba-hubba hot! Everybody thinks hes an all charming man-whore. Theres so much more to him than that. The two of them together was pure entertainment for me. But deep down inside they have their reasons for their actions and it was so much fun watching them break each others walls down. Besides Roni and Marcus, theres a whole cast of characters that I thoroughly enjoyed. I think I need to go back and read their booksNow besides Roni and Marcus hooking up, theres a whole other story going on. Its filled with wolf and jackal shifters, which I have read plenty of ones with wolves but this is my first with jackals. I found the jackals to be of the stereo typical type you would find in the Lion King but hey, it still worked for me. Lots of action and mystery surrounding the between the different shifters that kept this story rolling along very well. Between the quick, snappy dialog and the who-done-its, I found myself devouring this book as fast as I could. I may have predicted that Roni and Marcus would have ended up together but the journey they were on and the mysteries that needed to be solved, I was pleasantly surprised. Of course everything ends in a fun HEA without and cliffhangers.Author Suzanne Wright may have a new fan in me. I really enjoyed her story telling. She has quite the way of keeping a story going as well and putting together some very interesting characters. This certainly will not be my last book of hers. Ill be recommending, this book, this series and this author to anyone looking for their next great PNR to lose themselves in.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"Sky's Lark, book four in the Wind Warrior series so far has been my favorite. I enjoy books more when the women are strong characters. Lark certainly fits the bill. As the sole woman on the Wind Warrior team she needs to be one tough, smart cookie and she is. Bryce, aka Sky, is fairly tough, too. Together then make a great team. Things definitely heat up between the two and, unlike the previous books, Lark is not a virgin so I had an easier time accepting them hopping into bed. Now normally I don't mind the first kiss in the book between the characters but in this instance I find myself very irritated. For a very smart woman, I cannot understand why she would kiss a complete random stranger that approaches her in a dark parking lot. Personally I would be running or defending myself, and I certainly would not find myself interested in said stranger. That kiss alone pretty much ruins the story for me.The first have of the book was really exciting and filled with action that kept the story moving at a great pace. I like it when a story is filled with secrets and actions. It keeps me on my toes. Right around the middle I felt the story dragged a bit but then perked up in the end. We get more exposure to the rest of the Wind Warrior team, which as a whole, I really enjoy. Still finding my favorite to be Spoon of all the warriors although altogether they make a interesting group.Each book in the series that I have read have worked out just fine as stand-alones. Sky's Lark is no exception to that rule, despite having past and future characters. From the very beginning Spoon has been my favorite character. His book is next and I'm dying to dive into it.I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"How can you pass up a blurb that contains '1-800-GHOST-HUNK'? I certainly couldn't and I'm glad I didn't. Must Love Ghosts by Jennifer Savalli was such a fun read. This short quirky story was exactly what I needed.Dec is a hubba-hubba ghosthunter, excuse me, paranormal investigator. Tia is a 'almost engaged' professor determined to prove love is nothing more than a biochemical cocktail. But once upon a time they were a hot and heavy item. When strange things started happening in her home she immediately assumed Dec was behind her trouble. With Dec's help she finds out what is going on. Turns out her problem is actually more of a after-life issue - an after-life with a sense of humor! The story starts out quick paced and carries that way straight through to the end. Lot's of snappy dialog and humorous antics from they dead keep this story moving along. On occasion I had an urge to shake Tia, but she does redeem herself. With the of exception of Richard I enjoyed all the quirky characters. The ending wasn't too surprising but I still enjoyed it.As my first book by author Jennifer Savalli, I must say it was very satisfying. Looking forward to seeing where she goes with this series.

"I'm not going to lie. I expected a romance. I'm not going to say this is the furthest thing from a romance since there were a few heated moments, but that certainly didn't not make this book a romance. Instead, The City Beneath is more of a paranormal, suspense mystery.Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed this book. I tend to be drawn to vampire stories that really don't have much variety to them. The formula that I fall for is the usual girl meets vamp, vamp is all angsty, girl is in danger, vamp caves, turns her and they live HEA. This really wasn't the case here. Rarely do I see a author come up with a new twist to this old vampire story formula. Not the case here. Ms. Johnson has managed to introduce a new way of creating vampires. Night bloods, and that's what Cassidy is. She's also a nosy journalist which of course lands her smack dab in trouble. Trouble being a vampire rebellion. Vampire rebellions are not original however I found the plot line regarding night bloods a refreshing change from the typical bite-suck-your a vamp conversion.Over-all, The City Beneath was fun for me. The dialog was snappy, the characters engaging, and the plot line, even though not too original (hello vamp rebellion!), I still enjoyed. The lack of romantic entanglements instead of detracting from the story, actually added to it. I could relax and absorb all the action and mystery without being to concern that things were going to turn hot and heavy at the most inopportune moments. Even though there's a nice mystery feel to the whole plot, the dialog between characters still had moments of getting me to chuckle.Too many mystery movies have me guessing the the whodunit from the get go so I wasn't exactly too surprised when the 'dunt dunt dunt' reveal happened. Guessing from early on and having my thoughts confirmed didn't detract from the story. Actually, if anything, it made it more interesting. I didn't know the why and when I did find out...light bulb. I got it now. The ending was all I liked and more. I'm finding myself excited and anticipating what happens next, which is rare for me. Not being a mystery fan usually I am over it quickly once all the cards have been played. But in this instance, I can't wait to find out what happens next. Well played Ms. Johnson!I received this book from the JeepDiva for the express purposes of an honest review.

"After round two of lice plague (thanks preschool) I didn't want to have to resort to pesticide shampoos that lice are becoming resistant to anyway and opted to give this bad boy a try. This comb is big enough to fit comfortably in the hand while trying to remove nits, and my gosh it works! It took only one thorough pass through with this comb to rid a kid with thick semi-curly hair of all the creepy crawlies. No pesticide shampoo needed, and no need for multiple sessions though we made it a point to check every couple of days for about a week and a half after. We were able to rinse off the comb when done with no rust after the fact. It did not appear to pull or tear our child's hair, however someone with particularly long and thick hair may have difficulty being thorough because you can only pass through a little hair at a time. Ultimately worth every penny to defeat the lice plague in our house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DUFX0B66PECF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q90UFIC#wasThisHelpful","R1DUFX0B66PECF","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The madagascar bourbon vanilla is amazing! There is so much vanilla bean in it the syrup almost looks muddy. The resulting flavor is rich, fragrant, and authentic vanilla flavor.

"I've ordered a few Amoretti syrups at this point and the cinnamon is the only disappointing one I've received. If you're looking for a syrup that tastes like someone mixed freshly ground cinnamon and simple syrup you will be disappointed. This syrup tastes like someone melted a bunch of red hot candies and even a 1/2 pump was enough to completely overwhelm a 12oz coffee. One star off for the artificially flavored candy taste. The syrup also arrived wrapped in plastic and dented up pretty badly. When I have ordered the syrups from other vendors on Amazon they arrived in nice Amoretti boxes which included a recipe booklet and coupon, this did not have the original Amoretti packaging but did, thankfully, include the pump. Lack of original packaging and dented up as a result: loss of a second star. Would I purchase other Amoretti premium syrups? Absolutely! Would I repurchase the cinnamon one? Not at all.

"The material is soft and the color is exactly as advertised, however the quality is very poor. The pictures that several customers have posted of torn sheets is exactly the experience we have had. The only reason for the 2 stars is because we did manage to get about a year of occasional use out of them before they tore completely down the side of the sheet(s) rendering them useless. You get what you pay for with these, they're cheap for a reason. The only reason I would consider repurchasing these is for an inexpensive guest bed set that would mostly sit around in a closet.

"This is easily my favorite popping corn. When using an air popper very little went unpopped. They kernels were just heavy and large enough they weren't shooting out of the popper before actually popping which often happened with the purple corn I had purchased before. This pops nice and fluffy and what I'd call a medium size. It is smaller than white/yellow corn and larger than the very dainty purple corn. The flavor is mild, and the slightest bit nutty. It is also really nice that the hard pieces of the hull that get stuck in your teeth pretty much disappear upon popping.

Of all the lipsticks I've tried this has had the most staying power next to Revlon's ""Bitten"" however that was more of a stain than a lipstick. This lipstick also stained the lips a bit to a point where I wasn't able to remove it all by the next day, but it would need to be touched up a little after eating/drinking/kissing, etc. It went on easily and stayed nice and velvety unlike some long wear lipsticks which have a tendency to dry up and crack.

I like that although it does have some salt in the mix, it isn't overwhelmingly salty at all like original Slap Ya Mama or Tony Chachere's Creole Mix. This blend is really mild when it comes to cajun seasoning heat, but it is by far one of the most flavorful cajun spice mixes I've tried and I would and will buy it again.

"I've used a couple of different brands of protein power in the past and they always ended up with a horrible chemical aftertaste. After some digging around for other options I decided to give whey isolate a try instead since isolate has less lactose and fat in addition to not having the sweeteners and artificial flavorings that regular protein powders have. Since I've had good experiences buying from BulkSupplements in the past, I opted to go with theirs and I wasn't disappointed.The isolate fresh out of the bag is a bit grittier than non-isolate whey powders but it dissolves much more easily in liquids. I'm also happy to report it doesn't have the nasty aftertaste either. Others have described the aftertaste of the isolate as ""slightly milky"" and that is quite accurate but it is subtle enough it doesn't overpower. The serving size of 30 grams translates to two tablespoons of powder and each serving has 27 grams of protein. The only ingredients per the package are diary derived whey protein isolate and soy lecithin used to emulsify.All-in-all it was a great purchase and I will buy this again. It is perfect for mixing in smoothies and yogurt to give them an extra protein boost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16N4QXNF7U2PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E7IODXQ#wasThisHelpful","R16N4QXNF7U2PW","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After an allergic reaction to deodorants with aluminum I opted to give this a try. While it says ""unscented"" there's orange oil in it that gives it a light citrus scent that actually smells kind of like lemon bars.Since it is not an antiperspirant you will still sweat, but deodorants are supposed to at the very least mask the scent. Arm & Hammer actually does use triclosan which is an antibacterial, and since bacteria is the real reason for BO it does in fact help with stinky pits. For someone that's a mild to moderate sweater, this deodorant does its job and no BO is/was present at the end of the day. So for that reason, it is OK.For the people that have stated they got burning/peeling/rashes under their arms, that can actually be a sign of a sensitivity to an ingredient, or even an outright allergy to one of the ingredients. That is why I tried this product in the first place, because I had that kind of reaction to aluminum based products. So, if you're having a reaction you may want to consider seeing an allergist.As for the triclosan: Triclosan is a product that keeps bacteria under control. (Hence its use in deodorant.) While studies are not showing it to be dangerous to humans, some have shown it to be dangerous to the animal models tested. While animal models can in many ways demonstrate what to expect in humans, they do not always match. So some things that negatively affect the animal models because of their unique biology don't necessarily affect us because of our unique biology, or at least not in exactly the same way. Until research indicates we are potentially being affected negatively too it is considered safe for humans to use. But, knowing that there's a bit of a grey area means some will refuse to use it and others won't. http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm205999.htmAll-in-all it does work ok. If it were a particularly hot day, or if you are particularly sweaty you may need to re-apply it.If you're wanting totally all natural and/or triclosan free then you'd want to avoid it.If you're allergic/sensitive to any of the following ingredients you'd also want to avoid it: Dipropylene Glycol, Water, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), Anthemis Nobilis (Camomile) Flower Oil, Coriandrum Sativum (Coriander), Fruit Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Geranium) Flower Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Triethyl Citrate, Triclosan, Tetrasodium EDTA, Allantoin.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13W7U07VD1WDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3B47ZQ#wasThisHelpful","R13W7U07VD1WDO","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ingredients: refinery syrup, and honey.With refinery syrup as the primary ingredient it means what you're getting has more non-honey than actual honey. So calling it granulated honey is kind of misleading in that regard. Also note: Refinery sugar is the byproduct of cane sugar refining, it is NOT corn syrup.I've ordered several products from Hoosier Hill Farm in the past and all of them were excellent but this is one that has been a disappointment when taking into consideration what is advertised versus what you get. (*It appears the ingredients are now updated on amazon because it used to just say honey.) I wanted honey powder for a spice mix/rub and could even have dealt with the fact that it is mostly non-honey if at the very least the honey flavor was strong. This tastes exactly like you'd expect of a sugar/honey blend. It primarily tasted like cane sugar with a bit of honey on the back end instead of a strong honey taste. This is obviously disappointing when you were at the very least expecting a strong honey flavor but instead get something only moderately honey flavored.That being said, why the 3 stars? It still gets three stars instead of one because at the end of the day it can still be used as a sweetener for various things that maybe just need a little honey flavor. Blending this with some cloves and a pinch of salt will make for an excellent ham rub, or mixing it with some savory spices for a BBQ rub will create a unique flavor I would not get from just using regular white or brown sugar. You could also run it through a grinder or processor to get the consistency of powdered sugar if you had a recipe that called for powdered sugar but needed a little extra something flavor wise. (I imagine in powdered form it would make a wonderful lightly honey flavored buttercream.) So, it is still usable as an alternative sweetener and there's just enough of a honey taste at the end to warrant a three star rating, but it ultimately wasn't what I was looking for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCABJ3CV1KWI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTVD7ZM#wasThisHelpful","RCABJ3CV1KWI2","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has been a good, and versatile powder for adding to green smoothies, scrambled eggs, making an easy vegetable based broth, and sneaking into meatloaf and other foods so no one suspects you've made it a little more nutritious. Note that it can be strong and a bit bitter like its fresh counterpart so a little goes a long way. For green smoothies I've found that 1/2-1tsp is more than enough and it pairs well with matcha green tea powder and a frozen ""banana bread ripe"" banana to make a green tea flavored green smoothie that is just sweet enough to offset kale's bitterness. (Honey works too if you like things sweeter.) Since a little goes such a long way, there's enough uses in each container that I do feel as though it is money well spent and I would order it again. In fact, I'm thinking about giving some of their other vegetable powders a try since I've also enjoyed their mushroom powder in the past. I would purchase again.***Note about how powder compares to fresh:A little bit of helpful information regarding the nutrition label on the container: 1tsp = about 4-5 grams, note that in the image of the nutrition label they have the serving as 100g which if assuming 5g per tsp is a little over 1/2 c of powder per serving. So, if you want to know the %DV of the nutrients, or the calories per tsp serving, a good rough estimate is taking the number on the label and dividing by 20. (So, approximately 17.8 calories per tsp, 53.8% DV of vitamin A per tsp, etc.) If we're looking at macronutrients 1 tsp = approximately 1/2 c fresh kale. Reasoning: Using the ~5g per tsp there would be approximately 1g protein per tsp which would be the same as about 1/2 c of fresh kale, and 0.65g fiber per 1/2c fresh kale lines up with the approximately 0.6g fiber in a tsp of powder kale.So there you have it ladies and gents, 1tsp = about 1/2 c fresh kale when comparing nutrients. That being said, this is obviously an approximation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J24RFDXNWU4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBFR9RU#wasThisHelpful","R2J24RFDXNWU4Z","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a surprisingly versatile ingredient and I'm actually on my second bottle! The paprika is not spicy, but has a rather smokey and a little bit sweet pepper taste. It goes perfectly in chili, is great for making your own chorizo, taking deviled eggs up a notch, in a BBQ rub with some brown sugar and salt, and in paella. It is fresh and the flavor is strong enough that a little goes a long way. The only ingredients are: smoked paprika and silicon dioxide.

"First off, I received a lipstick with the barcode crudely sharpied off which was odd, but that isn't why I'm marking this down. The #001 color looks like a deep cherry red color in the image, and what arrived seemed like it might be a deep red until it was actually put on. What it looks like on is several shades lighter (even taking into account my lighter skin tone) and in pictures showed up more pink than red even without strong lighting or flash involved which was disappointing. It goes on smooth and stays slick without needing any gloss which is nice, but it does not stay put at all. Lipstick was smearing right and left with minimal effort. The fact that it wasn't true to color when worn, and the need to either frequently apply or rely heavily on lip liner or powder to help set it costs the lipstick two stars. It is just ok overall.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SQB8Z1EQAUTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WZ9X8M#wasThisHelpful","R3SQB8Z1EQAUTZ","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After having blown a hole in the arena at the end of Catching Fire, Katniss finds herself aboard a plane headed to District 13, a district believed to have been wiped out after the war many years ago. Katniss becomes aware the revolution is in full swing and she is urged to take her place as the Mockingjay, a living embodiment of the rebels' anti-Capitol symbol modeled after Katniss' token in The Hunger Games which means taking up arms in the battle against President Snow. As the war rages on Katniss struggles to separate friend from foe, and truth from the fiction, all while trying to keep those she loves alive.As a standalone movie it still fits well within the series, it still makes sense to those that have not read any of the books without leaving any gaping plot holes which can be a problem for books turned movie. This movie provides all the set up needed for the final installment while still having a sense of conflict resolution at the end. Another common issue with the whole split finale thing is that too often the first half of the final part just sort of ends leaving the viewer wholly unsatisfied as you never get the feeling anything resolved during the movie you just watched; because of where the director chose to break up the first and second half the audience has a clear break and you are given the satisfaction of having a major part of the end concluded setting up for the rest of the war that will be the central plot of the next/last movie. This is still a good movie, but it is admittedly the more boring of the two halves so hang in there for the final installment! It loses a star because it cannot stand as a movie entirely on its own. You would be pretty lost if you didn't at the very least see Catching Fire.As a treat, here's a couple of deleted scenes: http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/mockingjay-part-1-deleted-scene-drove-fans-insane#.pepwJ52e2As a fan of the books, as well as the movies, I had mixed feelings at first in regards to how it was translated to film. Mockingjay is my favorite of the books in the series and I was curious how faithful the cinematic adaptation would be considering the author was consulted on the making of the movie and on inevitable changes. My mixed feelings stem from the fact that major changes have been made to the movie that I questioned, but after having read an interview that director Francis Lawrence did with Buzzfeed (found here: http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/mockingjay-part-2-katniss-president-snow#.ulBaz5RnR ) I can at least understand why some changes were made for the sake of the non-booking reading audience.******Some of the more prominent deviations from the book discussed below, but kept vague enough to not really spoil anything for non-readers, so if you're afraid of any kind of potential spoiler stop reading here****Effie: Ok, Effie's story has actually been altered. She is reintroduced much earlier than in the books and at District 13. While at first this is annoying and seems pointless to have changed, I suppose it makes sense from a film making perspective to not bring in a different actor to take on a prep team role for the filming of the ""propos"" when at the end of the day the fans just want the Effie we've all grown to love through the series so bringing her back eliminates the need for the extra casting and gives us our Effie. While personally not a fan of losing the emotional impact of her reintroduction in the book, they tried to maintain that aspect as much as possible by still having her struggle with the differences in lifestyle between the Capitol and District 13.President Coin & District 13: Coin's personality has been muted. Very little time is dedicated to really emphasis how strict and militaristic District 13 is. This is an important deviation when considering the events of the second half of the book.Peeta: I don't know about the rest of the book readers, but I know I definitely wanted the impact of the movie ending in the hospital. Sadly, that is not the case. In an effort to wrap up the first half of the book within the first movie, the end of the movie is extended beyond the Peeta scene. While it definitely takes away from the drama, it makes sense that ultimately movie one is focused on the people that never made it on the plane with Katniss after Catching Fire, and movie two is war focused. Not as fun as the cliffhanger that could have been, but it makes sense to focus each of the final movies on a clear mission that can be wrapped up for the audience which gives that sense of conflict resolution at the end.Snow: You get to see a little more of his family and the moment his granddaughter decides to stop wearing her Katniss inspired braid as a symbol of Katniss becoming public enemy number one. Also, Katniss did not include anything about President Snow in her list of demands to Coin! WHAT?!? The moment she includes her bit about Snow in the demands you know she has hit her breaking point with his crap and losing that is a bummer.The action: The director has clearly set us up for an action filled final movie since most of the action is left out of this one. There's still the important scenes such as when Katniss is visiting District 12, and the bombing of the wounded, however the most exciting part of this movie is Peeta's hospital scene which feels underwhelming compared to just how much happens in the latter half of the book. Even the rescues are toned down. It seems like the director's intent was to focus on Katniss' emotional transition to mockingjay in this movie and then unleashes the full out war with the mockingjay leading the pack in the last one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MX8BE96F36DK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYLT4YI#wasThisHelpful","R2MX8BE96F36DK","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can FINALLY reach the dust on the topside of the fan blades! This has been immensely helpful for dusting between blinds and on fan blades especially for someone that is a bit...height challenged. The duster does an excellent job picking up dust and holding on to it until the job is done instead of having it fly around everywhere settling somewhere else. A little spritz of cleaner on the duster makes it even easier to trap the dust. The duster is extendable and also folds fairly flat for storage. The telescoping body is as simple as twisting to extend or lower, and then twisting to lock it in place. The microfiber can also be removed and run through the laundry as well. I really love this and am glad I purchased it. Other dusters either sucked at picking up the dust, weren't easily washable, or were too long/too short/not able to fold flat taking up too much storage, etc. I would repurchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3612VDS15AJ4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00940DV3K#wasThisHelpful","R3612VDS15AJ4X","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used this glue for a couple of tasks: 1) To repair a small hole in particle board 2) To patch up a small hole in a door. The particle board hole was the result of a stripped screw so it wasn't particularly large. All I had to do was fill the hole with the wood filler, scrape the excess, let it dry, and re-screw the screw. Had the hole been bigger, it would have been easy enough to first fill with pieces of toothpick and then the wood filler. For the hole in the door it was a little more tricky because it was actually a hollow door which I actually didn't expect to work but figured I'd give it a try! There are bits of what feels like sawdust in the wood filler that add enough texture that it was able to hold onto the edges of the hole and actually create a plug in the door where a screw had gone through which was rather impressive.The filler IS stain-able, but it will not be an exact match to the wood around it so you may still notice where the patch was done. We were able to compensate for it by instead painting and using a little bit lighter of a shade as the filler made a spot that was slightly darker than the rest of the wood.Some have complained that the stuff is nearly impossible to get out of the tube, and they're correct that it requires a bit of force to squeeze this stuff out as it is a thick paste. You can adjust the hole you cut in the tip to be smaller or larger, but the smaller the hole the harder it will be to squeeze out. It is not impossible, but it is annoying enough to have resulted in the loss of a star. The very thickness and wood fibers that make this a good wood filler are exactly why it is so difficult to squeeze so it is worth a little extra effort for how useful it is. The fact that it can be re-capped and used again for other small repairs is also a plus.All-in-all it is really useful for small repair jobs so for that it was a very worthwhile purchase and I would purchase it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REI9IM51BW8SL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001T4YU7K#wasThisHelpful","REI9IM51BW8SL","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little hesitant to give sticky rice another try because for some reason I simply cannot get the texture just right with other rices I've tried. This rice was perfect! The bag says it comes pre-washed, but I went ahead and rinsed it first anyway. It took only a quick 30 second rinse for the water to run clear so it had little to no starches on the outside which is a pretty good indicator it was in fact pre-rinsed. Using Alton Brown's stove top sushi rice recipe worked beautifully with this rice and produced a lovely sticky rice that held together great for sushi without getting gummy even though I had to cool it in a large mixing bowl instead of a traditional wooden bowl.

"This light is worth every single penny! The day after the freshly cleaned carpet smell wore off on a new place the stench of pet urine took over. We purchased this black light expecting to find a couple of spots and what we found was horrifying enough to warrant replacing the entire carpeting. Even in a semi-bright room this blacklight will clearly show urine spots. While we were at it, we also opted to check out how well the bathrooms had been cleaned and let's just say looking clean does not actually mean clean. YUCK! Not only was this valuable for convincing prior owners to replace carpeting, but it is an incredibly useful tool for making sure you've cleaned well as a properly cleaned spot will no longer shine under blacklight.The actual light is about the side of my hand wrist to fingertips, so it isn't particularly large. It takes 3 AAA batteries and it does in fact shine brightly. The light does have a good weight to it and does not look or feel as inexpensive as it actually was. If urine is present it does not even take a particularly dark room to be visible. Considering how much we've already used it to go back and thoroughly clean areas where the naked eye could not detect a mess it was worth every cent and I would definitely repurchase it.

"Since it takes over 75,000 hand picked saffron crocus flowers to get even a pound of this stuff, it is expensive. Expensive also means it is frequently faked. (Yes, saffron faking is a real thing!) The presence of the yellow stile in the saffron is a good indication that it isn't faked by being dyed making it appear to be the higher quality stuff. Another way of faking it is by supplementing with safflower as a filler. Either can be detected when you let saffron sit in warm water to extract the flavor. The water should turn bright yellow and be fragrant. If the ""saffron"" is dyed, or it has safflower fillers, the water will turn a murky orange-yellow.What I received does appear to be the real deal, on the lower end of the saffron quality spectrum hence the affordable price, but the real stuff nonetheless.A little goes a long way, in fact a pinch of about 20-25 threads crushed just a little bit and then steeped in warm water/stock/broth can easily season a paella for the whole family, even less is needed for plain saffron rice.A fair bit of warning for those just trying saffron, for some people it tastes metallic. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the actual saffron but it is simply how the taste buds of some people react to it. The same thing happens with cilantro. Even if you're not one of the unlucky people that taste metal when using saffron it can still happen by using too much.This single box of saffron has lasted approximately 10 family sized batches of paella and a round or two of saffron rice as a side dish, so the price is worth it. I would recommend it, and I will repurchase it in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AFXG1LYGVHJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OPCMZO#wasThisHelpful","R3AFXG1LYGVHJ6","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this not for a faucet, but as a fix for my Keurig coffee brewer. We use reusable k-cups since the disposable ones are not only super wasteful but they're so expensive. The problem is that after a while the Keurigs start to leak water everywhere and we realized that if you use a 1/2 inch rubber washer placed on top of the reusable k-cup where the water flows through it solves the water leakage problem. So, for next to no money we were able to keep saving a ton of money using the reusable k-cups. These washers worked out great for that purpose and they arrived quickly.

There is information on basic techniques such as how to properly hold your knife, what different methods of cooking (boil, broil, saute, etc.) are and how to do them. Information on picking your ingredients to ensure they're fresh and/or ripe is also included along with proper storage of the ingredients and proper cooking temperatures. The recipes vary in difficulty from how to make a very basic guacamole to a more complex braised beef with wine. The skill levels do start as basic as how to properly remove rosemary from the stem and progress as the book progresses.Overall this is an incredibly valuable resource for the beginner cook or even those that want to know how to cook like a chef does with proper knife techniques, etc. As someone that can cook I'd still add this to my cookbook collection for the recipes it includes even if I don't need the beginner skills.

This is an instant coffee that takes like fresh brewed coffee and isn't too bitter and muddy tasting!

It dissolves well even in cold liquids without leaving a thick coffee sludge at the bottom. A blender full of ice, enough milk to cover the ice, and a packet of this per serving makes a really good coffee frappe that I often add protein powder to for an easy breakfast smoothie on the go.The coffee is 100% Arabica which means a slightly sweeter and more flavorful coffee especially compared to robusta or arabica/robusta blends.

A 12C+ dilution generally no longer contains even a single molecule of the initial ingredient, this is a 200C dilution so the active ingredient is non-existent leaving behind nothing but the other ingredients which are literally two different forms of sugar. A literal sugar pill! No form of science has concluded this actually has any effect on the flu and as such lawsuits have popped up against the makers for their false and misrepresented claims. (A quick online search will show you that the cases are in fact being settled by the makers because they simply have no evidence this works as claimed nor is otherwise effective.

Homeopathy works under the idea that introducing the smallest amount of something that causes illness/symptoms can help you fight/prevent it. The guy whose research this is based on mistakenly identified what he believed to be the cause of the flu back in the 1900s. What he identified as the cause of flu was incorrect and this product is based on that incorrect information.Saying this single product does not work isn't an attack on homeopathy, but a review of a single product that does not work as advertised.*****For those that attack my review with the misguided assumption that I have never even tried it: My reviews are posted with integrity and honesty plain and simple.

"These are perfect for using in any Keurig that uses the original standard sized K Cups, but NOT the Keurig 2.0 versions. These pods come with a scoop that is actually the exact perfect amount of grounds while still being able to snap shut easily. (8 grams or 2 teaspoons.)The mesh is extra fine so no grounds escape, and they have held up beautifully to top rack dishwasher abuse. We like them enough we purchased a second set. It is nice to be able to save money while using whatever grounds I want instead of purchasing expensive and wasteful single use cups.****Update: When using make sure you use the scoop that comes with the pods and do not over fill it. Also make sure it is fully closed and facing forward.How to fix the leaking Keurig: You need a 1/2 inch flat faucet washer. Simply place the washer in the indention where the water flows through the top of the cafe cup so that the hole in the center of the cafe cup and the center of the washer line up, then use normally. No more leaking! That trick also works with the My K Cup reusable filters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWFPA2QQ3CVXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009PTQSGC#wasThisHelpful","RWFPA2QQ3CVXB","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had high hopes for this despite there only being two current reviews as they were both very positive. Then, I received the ornament and was instantly disappointed. First, as a testament to the poor craftsmanship it doesn't lay flat but is actually a concave. When you actually look at the details they're very poorly done and it looks like a homemade art project done by a novice artist. The details are very poorly painted, and there's sloppy blobs of excess material that just simply looks like I spent $10 on a $0.50 craft project.

"We tried several brands of bottles and the playtex ones with the drop ins have by far been superior to any else we've come across. While I hate how wasteful the idea of drop ins are, they were really helpful in reducing excess gas that other bottles caused from all the excess air. We also love that the nipples can be purchased in different sizes and materials depending on the baby's age and flow needs. The bottles held up well to all the abuse we could throw at them including repeated dishwasher cycles. We liked them enough to have also purchased them as baby shower gifts.

"Our cat is obsessed with this thing so much so that if we won't wave it around for her she'll toss it in the air with her paws and go crazy chasing it around. For a cheap impulse add on item, it was actually a great buy. The concept is simple enough, it is a plastic stick with a long piece of fleece attached that you wave around and makes your cat go insane. It does tend to knot up from all the waving around, but it doesn't really matter since the fabric strip is so long. Also, the fabric is well attached to the stick and it has held up against a cat fully dangling from it in an attempt to steal it from us during play. Such a simple idea and a great purchase.

"This was my first go at raw honey and I'm glad I gave it a shot. This honey is amazing! I put it on everything from peanut butter sandwiches to apple slices or soft cheese, or I'll just eat it with a spoon if I really need to indulge my sweet tooth. Being a dandelion honey it does have a nice but subtle floral note on the back end that is hard to describe but delicious to eat. The consistency is that of a whipped raw honey which simply means the crystals that typically form in honey are well incorporated which leaves it really smooth and easy to spread instead of ending up with a giant crystal brick at the top of the honey. Now that I've switched to good raw honey I can't wait to try other flavor variations.

"The ""small"" size fits a peewee player wearing a size 12 little boys when actually wearing shin guards. There's no way a size 13 would fit with shin guards in the ""small"" per the description. It is clear the description does not take into considering the player will be wearing guards so if you're at the top end of what the description says size wise go up a size.Despite the size being a little off, they have proven durable against a very active little one and a large dog that decided they were chew toys. You'd never know a 50lb+ dog tried to eat them as they still look brand new post chew session and full season of practice. For that reason alone they are a great buy. It also helps that they are elastic enough to hold the shin guards in place without causing them to dig into the shin which is nice.The failure to account for shin guards in the size description results in the loss of a star as following the description could end up with them being too small, however for prime members it appears there are free returns so that is helpful in case you got the wrong size.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KC33N8XG4QVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DF0S5HC#wasThisHelpful","R1KC33N8XG4QVS","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This brace is the best brace for someone that needs heavy support for their ankle. I've broken/torn bits in that area multiple times and now have to pretty much live in one of these any time I will do more than a little walking so needless to say it needs to be durable and do its job which it does. Once you slip your foot in, you lace it up. After lacing it you take the side straps and cross them across the front and velcro on the side. You then take the final straps that go horizontally across the top and secure everything in place. It is needless to say VERY secure and your ankle isn't going anywhere which is probably why it was recommended by a doctor in the first place.Now, that being said I took a star off for poor sizing. A ladies 10W is a ""L"" according to the chart so that is what I ordered. It was definitely too big in the foot area and yet the horizontal straps are actually a little bit tighter than they should be. While the laces and straps keep it on my foot the extra fabric can get uncomfortable at times as it bunches up and needs to be taken off and re-adjusted from time to time. The inconvenience of the size being off is less than needing to go back to the doctor for another injury so it is worth putting up with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KSJ4F0YAMPVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TGSIMM#wasThisHelpful","R1KSJ4F0YAMPVO","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Le Puy lentils are excellent and I don't think I'll ever go back to the cheap stuff from the grocery store. I bought these at the recommendation of a chef for their ability to hold up well to cooking without turning into straight up mush. They definitely delivered and while they do soften, they don't turn to mush like many lentils do with slowcooker cooking. I treated them like rice with a 2:1 ratio of liquid to lentils and they turned out excellent. We served these with some carrots and sausage for a great comfort dinner during chilly weather. I will definitely buy these again. Even the highest quality lentils MUST be checked for tiny pebbles and then rinsed to remove any residual grit. This isn't a lack of quality but merely a product of the fact that they're mass produced and the machines can't distinguish between a tiny pebble and a lentil. It happens, so just check 'em over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P3VS5NUKVV63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BK87H2U#wasThisHelpful","R3P3VS5NUKVV63","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love this mix. I've been able to successfully convert a family of white rice eaters to whole grain brown/wild rice eaters that now love the nutty goodness of this rice. I was a bit hesitant to purchase this at first because you can easily purchase pre-cooked brown rice in the freezer section of many grocery stores. The problem is that it gets gummy easily so we opted to give this a shot instead. I'm glad we did. This takes minimal effort to cook when you simply throw it in a crockpot with some stock. Using a 2 1/4 cup of liquid to 1 cup of rice ratio I can set this in a crock pot on high for approximately 4 hours and not have to think about it and it comes out perfectly with only a little fluff at the end. I would gladly repurchase and like that the bag has a velcro closure to reseal it. If you're wondering why the bag says to keep leftovers in the fridge, it is because brown rice can actually go rancid I doubt this will last long enough to go rancid, but it is good to know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IQYCYG9NLB8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000G82L62#wasThisHelpful","R1IQYCYG9NLB8K","ARJLYJQ4XDD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARJLYJQ4XDD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sure, I can pay a lot more per candle to get that look but it is mostly an aesthetic preference. Anyway, we got these as a flameless source of light in case of power outage during storms. The price is excellent considering you get 4 of them. They have a lovely vanilla scent that I can still smell months later.

"These traveled well, were easy to roll back up, fairly comfortable to use, and retained shape even with nearly 400lbs of pressure on it. We brought a couple of these on a trip as backup because let's face it air mattresses fail. These were a lifesaver to have. They are much easier to roll if you first remove as much air as you can, then go back and use your body weight to remove even more air as you re-roll it. They only took maybe 5 minutes to inflate from brand new and another 5 minutes to re-roll and bag. We were able to stack a couple of them on top of each other to create a makeshift bed which was surprisingly comfortable even for someone with a bad back and with a considerable amount of weight on them.

"These are so well made I couldn't tell a difference in these and the name brand! In fact my 5 and 14 year old sons liked these better! They loved that they could change out the legs and adjust the body to make the men as they pleased. These are the same size as the other brand. And even made just as well.

"Jillian Banks is Michaels little sister. She has been attracted to Michaels partner Leo Santoro since the men graduated from the academy. She knows Leo is attracted to her but he will not make a move and Jillian has decided she will. I liked Jillian, she is grounded, sincere and intelligent despite the fact she is unsure of her career goals. As strong and confident as she is, there is a vulnerable side to her, and I appreciated how open she was about her feelings.Leo, poor, poor Leo, I felt sorry for him for about a minute. He wants Jillian bad but two things are stopping him. The first is Michael, because you do not bang your partners little sister. The second reason is that Leo is dominant. As much as he wants Jillian, he does not think he can change and Jillian is far too bold, vibrant and stubborn to be submissive.Oh what fun Sinful was from the intense attraction to Leos spiraling fall. The set up for Jillians plan of action was fun, and Brandon a friend of Leo and Michael was sexy and hilarious. I cannot wait for his book. Jillian has no idea about the Dom/Sub world and it was powerful witnessing her introduction. Forget Fifty Shades; Dawson introduces a more realistic exploration of the Dom/sub relationship. Compared to Crave, Sinful is smoking hot. The foreplay, games and build up were delicious. We get a few darker scenes as Leo tries to fulfill Jillians fantasy and I appreciated how Dawson made clear Jillian was always in charge.While the tale is heated, the romance itself was sweet, and slow building. We see the characters grow and I love when two people bring out the best in each other. Dawson gives a small-town feel to her stories including family and friends. The friendship between Michael, Leo and Brandon is strong and an enjoyable dynamic. We see Michael and witness his reactions to their relationship. If you have met Michael, you are sure to snicker as I did. We also meet Leos family and learn his history. Dawson pulled on my heartstrings with Leo and a scene towards the end made me deliriously happy even as I shed a tear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HV1NG0U5E29Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BR5HBI#wasThisHelpful","R1HV1NG0U5E29Y","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Merry Mary delivered a believable story allowing us to connect with Scottie. While we might condone her actions, as the story unfolds we certainly understand her motives and feel her internal struggle. It highlights human connections and the power of love between a child and a mother, a brother and a sister. It portrays the way family willing  protects those they love. Farley does a great job of sharing Scotties mindset, her volatile marriage and the hardships she has endured. As events unfolded, I understood her actions, and the way she reasoned things in her mind.  I appreciated how realistic the story was particularly the ending. This story could have been heartbreaking, but Farley focuses on the powers of faith, family and love delivering the perfect holiday read.Copy provided by author, full review at caffeinated book reviewer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LNDPCOHL29S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01434AX6E#wasThisHelpful","R3LNDPCOHL29S","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unwrapped had a wonderful set-up. The author unwraps the plot in the first chapter and it was hilarious and heated. Kane even weaves in a little mystery allowing me to slip in with a sigh and a giggle.Jacqueline is a little flawed, but good at the core and while you may initially find her shallow, Lane soon has you caring for her, even as you laugh and roll your eyes. Patrick is a contractor and quite the bachelor, but has not been able to forget Jacqueline. The author used a familiar trope to bring these two together again and it worked. Both characters see growth as their relationship developed adding depth. She then weaved in interfering Aunts, a vivacious best friend and a sister you do not want to mess with.The story was balanced and while at times heated, it had a small-town vibe and was set in Denver Colorado. I loved the page time spent on family and friends as these two work towards their happy. Unwrapped was a great little romance for the holidays that will leave you with a smile.

"All the ladies at Nightingale wear masks to hide their identity; the men do not. Ashe, The Duke of Ashebury, one of the notorious Hellion of Havisham is intrigued by the masked Minerva, and invites her to a night of pleasure. Their first encounter is interesting and Ashe soon wants more. He is determined to discover who she is. This added a little Cinderella mystery. The two of them have encounters during social events and I enjoyed their engaging discussions, and banter. She of course knows who he is and he is quite confident that the masked lady and the spinster Dodger are one and the same. The dance these two begin is delicious to watch.Things are heating up between the masked lady and Ashe as their dance continues. The budding romance between Minerva and Ashe is sure to curl your toes. Heath adds some complications that may throw the identity reveal into a wicked spin. All of which had me flipping the pages and curious about the outcome. Ashe has a secret and I loved that Heath weaved in this disorder. She showed the impact it has on a strong, intelligent man. Passion and emotions from the characters had me swooning, smiling and crossing my fingers. Seeing the growth in Minerva as Ashe tries to woo the Lady Dodger was delicious. Minervas parents were positively delightful and a breath of fresh air for Regency London. We see growth and acceptance as we move towards the end of this date. Heath provided a eulogy that will delight and satisfy readers.

"Pirateship Down shares a collection of stories and interesting facts about the world Suzanne Johnson has created in her urban fantasy series the Sentinels of New Orlans. All of the stories while based on the characters within the series are standalone and gives fans of the series a deeper look at favorite characters. I like to know where stories fall within the world, and Johnson begins all the stories with a little insight and places the story within the timeline of the series. It is important to note that some of these appeared on Johnsons website, as guest posts and in shorts.Pirateship Down- This is an all-new novella and takes place between Elysian Fields and Pirates Alley, which will release in 2016. Pirateship Down involves DJ and Renee as they try to keep Jean Lafitte out of trouble. One of Lafitte ships had been discovered off the coast and Jean is determined to retrieve what is his. Johnson mixed humor and suspense with plenty of complications. *Jean Lafitte*  DJs quick thinking skills come into play as these three go on an adventure.

"Typical of new adult Once Kissed  has two damaged characters who are good at the core, and through each other, they become stronger. I love Robsons approach to her stories and the depth she brings to her characters. You get to know them, want to friend them, and ultimately care about them. Tess has been controlled her whole life and her Daddy holds the strings. She resents it, but has her eye on graduation and freedom. As I said, Curran is dealing with the rookie incident and the emotional impact. Robson avoids relationship drama and instead focused on their personal issues and suspenseful storyline. I was simply delighted that she had her characters recommend outside help, instead of the love fixes all approach. Brilly! She then weaved in danger, a little suspense and a whole lotta love.The romance is sweet, hot, heated and at times downright cute. Curran is hilarious but also gentle and sensitive. There is so much more to Tess. She is strong, brilliant, and clumsy. At times, her deadpan comments had me laugh aloud.Robson weaves in the OBrien family and I loved this loud, genuine, foul-mouthed family. They tease each other relentlessly, but make a move against one of them I dare you. Declans story is next, and a couple of scenes hinted at what is to come. I have a feeling it might be a hot, heated, haters to lovers story and I am giddy at the prospect.

"I loved how SeRine had these two reconnect. It was clever and felt genuine. We quickly learn these two still love each other, and the reasons Abby broke it off. You could feel the sexual tension between the two of them and those feelings were only intensified by the situation surrounding Abby. I knew these two were going to tango, it was only a matter of when. SeRine kept the drama low and I appreciated how the complications were realistic.The case was far-reaching, with men whose pockets are deep. These are the kind of men who can pay to make problems disappear. Yikes! Abby and Kyle soon find themselves caught up in a lethal game of cat and mouse. SeRine added an interesting twist with a skilled contract man. I actually liked the guy, which is rather twisted. The man is a kidnapper, extortionist, and kills people for a buck. The authored weaved in twists and linked threads as she pulled the case together.Stop at Nothing struggled a little in finding balance between the romance and case. I felt SeRine tried to give equal page time to both, which is not necessarily a bad thing but at times the intensity of the case was pulled too thin. I will say that the characters were fully developed. I loved Abby and Kyle, their romance felt genuine, as did their actions. Secondary characters like Kyles partner and the villains added interest and were unique giving depth to the tale. We meet his brothers and I already have a favorite whose story I am anxious to read. (I will let you pick your own) Both the case and the romance wrapped up nicely giving the reader closer.

"Delia and Alecs first encounter was hilarious and had me giggling. When Alec discovers that his younger brother has eyes for Delia he is determined to keep the young lady occupied and save his family from further hurt and scandal. He devises a plan to ruin Delias reputation. Delia is no ones fool and soon the game is afoot.Alec made me crazy. On one hand, he infuriated me with his pompous attitude and determination to ruin Delia. I seriously wanted to slap him across the back of his head.  However the way in which he doted on his sisters and worried after his mother moved me. Thankfully, Bradley peeled back his layers and allowed him to grow and grovel. We see tremendous character growth as the story progresses, so do not hate on him to hard.Delia was a breath of fresh air with her clever quips and tendency to say what she thinks. Alec Sutherland unnerves her and their interaction were humorous, sensual and filled with banter. Delia is unfamiliar with the art of flirting but she manages to drive Alex insane. She too has some issues and thinks Alec is playing a game; one she fully intends to win. Getting to witness the results offered plenty of swoons and laughter.Secondary characters were not as fleshed out as I would have liked, but added to the tale and made events plausible.

"Beka lives in a decked out bus that looks like it is straight from the sixties on the outside and is much more modern inside. She lives with her faith-full dragon disguised as a rather large, scary dog.When a mer-woman pulls Beka and her surfboard into the deep-sea to save her baby from a fishing net, she soon finds herself in trouble with Marcus Dermott, a former U.S. Marine who has returned home to help his ailing father operate his fishing boat. She also discovers that the mer-people have left the safety of their underwater cavern because their old and young are getting sick. Something is poisoning their waters. Beka soon finds herself tasked with saving the Mer-people and assigned a mission by the Queen of the Otherworld.The mystery was solid and kept me listening even as I struggled with the romance. I did not care for Dermott. He was cold, bossy and opinionated. Sadly, by the time he came around I was already disconnected.  Thankfully, the mystery, villains and action kept me in the game.Blake wrapped up Wickedly Wonderful leaving me with a smile as she set up the next book in the series.

"Blakes Baba Yaga is not the old woman; from the tales I remember as a child. Blake has twisted the tale creating a unique heroine. She is still quite witchy and not to be messed with. Clad in biker jeans and tattoos, she loves to be barefoot and has a sweet tooth. When summoned she requires payment and yes sometimes it is in the form of a chicken, but usually it requires the requestor to give up something important. Liam does not know what to make of Barbara and her enormous dog, but soon the two are knee deep in the solving the case.Three children are missing, someone is sabotaging Barbaras remedies and there are those in the town that want Liam fired. Barbara senses an Otherworld presence and soon things get complicated for both of them. Blake writes an engaging, suspenseful tale with plenty of twists but she wove in humor and romance keeping the story light. We have a villain that you will love to hate and you will meet creatures from the Otherworld.The small-town added depth with its nosey neighbors, politics and grieving parents. Of course, as the stranger in town, Barbara soon finds herself suspect numero uno and the fact that someone is trying to sabotage her only complicates matters. The romance was sweet, with touches of heat that consummated in a fade to black scenario.While this book introduces the series, Blake did a wonderful job of slipping us right into an interesting case while fleshing out the world. We learn a great deal about Baba Yaga without information dumps. I loved some of her awkwardness when dealing directly with humans, but she has a quality about her that endeared her to me. I was completely enthralled by Baba Yaga, the three riders and her dragon companion. They guard the magical waters and doors to the Otherworld. The Fae populate the Otherworld and I loved Blakes depiction of it, right down to its Queen.Romy Nordlinger does a wonderful narrating and I loved the Russian accent. I will definitely be continuing this series on audio. The tale was twelve hours in length but it felt like four.

"Playing with Fire by Tess Gerritsen  is a standalone mystery thriller that held me captive. I went into this story blind and was delighted to discover Playing with Fire takes place in present day, but also shares life in Venice, Italy during World War II. Gerritsen weaves her magic in Playing with Fire.I am going to be purposely vague as the story is best left for the reader to discover. The story begins when Julia Ansdell discovers a piece of composition called the Incendio Waltz in a little antique shop in Rome. Julia is a violinist and loves collecting old music.She returns home to her doting husband and three-year-old daughter. Mother and daughter spend their first day home together and while her daughter plays, Julia picks up the piece and begins playing it on her violin. As she becomes caught up in this haunting piece, something happens and she is pulled from the music to find blood on her daughters hands. From here, the tale is chilling as Gerritsen leads us on a tale to discover the musics origin and save her daughter. Julia soon finds herself in danger, not only from those around her but also from an even bigger more powerful threat.Gerritsens tale is dark, beautiful and suspenseful.  She held me completely spellbound. as the outside world slipped away.  I tried to determine if our unreliable narrator was losing her mind or the only one who grasps what is happening. In between our riveting present day story, we learn about a young Jewish violinist living in Venice during WW II. Beautifully researched with characters I came to care about this aspect of the story was powerful giving the reader insight into this troubled time and the atrocities this young man and his family faced.  I had to break out the truffles, so be prepared.Playing with Fire was brilliant from the suspense to the story that unfolds. The way in which Gerritsen tied these stories together. The reveal on the origin of the composition itself and answers to our present day mystery raised the hair on the back of my neck and made me shiver. It is the type of story I will remember a year from now and ten year from now.Playing with Fire is a must read for fans of mystery thrillers, unreliable narrators and Word War II history. Tess Gerritsen is an auto-buy for me and never disappoints. Her stories are fresh, chilling and beautifully executed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D2CLCWNWVM9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101884347#wasThisHelpful","R3D2CLCWNWVM9D","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The case was intense tying the past to the present. I enjoyed all the suspects and clues as the murderer becomes more brazen. The paranormal aspects are in the form of ghosts. They are all victims who have been murdered and they reach out to Scarlett. The connection between them and the past was interesting; as was the motive for the present day murders. Graham weaves local history into her stories, and we learn a little about Stephen King and his stay in the small-town, as well as the history of Nathan Kendall. It gave the story a little more depth and I loved all the tidbits. I also felt a connection to the characters from the past and current murder victims.A second chance romance between Scarlett and her ex-husband Diego felt genuine. Graham gave us chemistry and enough back story that I became invested in their outcome. I enjoyed seeing them admit to past mistakes and realizing it takes two. Graham did a great job of sharing their feelings and I am glad that the physical need to connect helped them open up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE1LGXVID587O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317587#wasThisHelpful","RE1LGXVID587O","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The world Charish has created is fascinating, never have I met so many unique supernatural creatures as we travel the world in search of ancient artifacts. We meet zombies, vampires sirens, succubus, snake people, Jinn, and elves. While the creatures may appear in other stories, Charish has given them unique attributes and destroyed myths about garlic, life forces and more  giving me a unique story full of surprises.While the overall story arc involves Owl, each book takes us on a madden quest that has our heroine in peril. In Owl and the City of Angels the IAA (the international archeology responsible for keeping supernatural artifacts and creatures secret) are after Owl, whom they believe has stolen artifacts from the City of the Dead. These objects are cursed and her boss wants them retrieved and the identity of the person impersonating Owl caught. Poor Owl, the girl has people and things chasing her from every angle. Even, the creators of WorldQuest are gunning for her because they believe she is using the game to plot robberies. All of this led to an action-packed game of chase that took us all over the globe and deep into ancient burial sites. While at times the story read like an Indian Jones movie with improbable action scenes, I had a blast as we raced through streets and fought off the dead. Owl and the City of Angels was fully developed providing readers one heck of a ride. I loved the little tidbits weaved into the tale about the burial sites, and artifacts.Owl and the City of Angels has a nice blend of humor, similar to those one would find in the Hollows by Kim Harrison, or the snark in the Kate Daniels series by Ilona Andrews. The author has done a fantastic job of fleshing out the characters; expect maybe Ryan, Owls love interest, but we keep learning more. Lady Siyu is the dragons assistant and oh man, I love this dreadful, snarky seneschal. Even, Captain, Owls vampire hunting cat adds humor. Friendship and a slow-developing romance round out Owls crazy life, along with her relationship with Carpe, her elfin gaming partner.

"The story is told in alternate perspectives. We have Meiras as she struggles to control her magic and become comfortable in her new role. Her feelings for Theron are conflicted and she is unsure if she can trust him. We see tremendous growth in Meira as she accepts, opens up and steps into her role. One of the things that I admire about this strong heroine is her unwavering love of Winter and its people. Meira also sees the bigger picture and worries about more than just her people. She is concerned for all of Primoria. Some of her actions annoyed me as she struggled to grow, but by the end, I was rooting for her.Mathers is the second perspective we witness  struggle. He feels misplaced, unneeded and resents Cordells oppressive intrusion. Mathers also undergoes a transformation, but first we have to see him sink before until he finds his purpose. Mathers remains behind in Winter as Meira and the others travel the countryside. I really want to adore Mathers and struggled in the beginning, but towards the end he becomes a worth hero.Raasch continues to flesh out the world of Primoria and its different kingdoms. The questions regarding magic, and the Decay held me captive. I enjoyed visiting the kingdoms and seeing what each held dear. The author did a wonderful job of bringing each kingdom to life and introducing us to colorful characters within. Meira begins to confide to those within her inner circle and I am seeing a strong alliance build. The quest involving the chasm felt a little too easily solved, but did not bother me enough to hinder my enjoyment.Those looking for romance will be sorely disappointed, as the thread is minimal at best, as Raasch focuses on the quest and growth of these characters.The last one hundred pages of Ice Like Fire were intense and actionpacked as the author prepared us for what lies ahead in the last book. The ending is climatic with death, danger and betrayal. The story closes with an answer and a cliffhanger to keep us looking for the final release in 2016.

"Jones spins a captivating tale as she drew me into the story, introducing strong, complicated characters and a mystery surrounding Rebecca. The tale is sexually heated, and Jones knows how to create these erotic, sensual scenes but the book was tamer then I expected and the sex while detailed did not steal the stage. Saras discovery, sexual awakening and pursuit of a passion once thought lost to her kept me engaged.I loved Jones take on the dominant and submissive relationship in If I Were You. It has a much more realistic approach. One scene opened the door to other areas of exploration but none of the characters participated. It left the door open for situations that are more adventurous in future novels.The men she meets at the museum are strong, dominant and wealthy. Mark owns the museum and pushes Sara to pursue her dreams even as he hints at controlling her. Chris  is an artist she has long admired who wants to possess her even as he warns her away. Sara is pushed from her comfort zone but is also thrilled. As Jones peels back her layers, she reveals a strong and confident woman.While Sara does spend time with one of the men, and gets closer to finding what happened to Rebecca, If I Were You ends with things on edge between them and Sara in danger. Of course now I need more!

"The tale focuses on three friends whose names you will quickly recognize. Stella, Evelyn and Mildred. The story begins when they are six and moves quickly forward  as it highlights childhood events before settling in as the girls, now young women, reunite at Chatham Castle where they begin working for the Network.Evelyn and Mildred become the key players in this novel and Cross quickly submerges us into this fascinating world from her vivid descriptions to her fully developed characters.  We go inside the inner chambers of the council and those of the High Priest and Priestess. I loved all the different aspects as we begin to see cracks in the friendship formed so long ago.Evelyn is a bit of a fruitcake with a strong conviction on how to improve the Network. Her character is easily influenced and her emotions are often childlike as she works to move up the ranks within the council.  Her plans  set in motion an elitist society. Evelyn is the perfect politician as she greases elbows, manipulates those around her and seeks approval. Cross does, a wonderful job of allowing us to understand where the cracks began that she so desperately tries to fill.Stella is the stable friend who sees both sides and is always practical and patient. While her role is not as significant, she added depth and perspective. I loved Stella. She is strong, confident and knows what she wants.Mildred was my favorite character. The weakest of the bunch she slowly transforms throughout the novel. Strong convictions, strength and compassion make her a character to admire. We watch first had as Mildred advances her career through hard work. She eventually accepts a job as the Network Librarian.This is a job she swore she would never take, but ever-practical Mildred does exactly that. It is here that we slowly witness growth in Mildred. She finds her purpose and I found the journey exciting.Katie Cross is an exceptional storyteller. Her world is fully developed and she brings it vividly to life from the vineyards to the musty basement that are Mildreds offices. Her characters have depth and love them or hate them you will come to understand them. Some parts of the story are slower, but I loved all the details as Mildred and Evelyns careers advanced. Some of the story is told in letters between key characters, family and May the teacher who influences Evelyn. We even see a little romance with the characters. They were small threads that further fleshed out the characters lives. Cross delivers some suspense, humor and some intense action scenes particularly in the last one-third of the book.

"While the Conquering Dark and its predecessors are plot driven  it is the unique and colorful characters that truly bring this tale to life. Simon is brilliant even if he is sometimes a little stubborn. *snort* Kate Anstruther our beloved alchemist is fearless. The aid she gives Simon had me holding my breath. Malcolm MacFarlane monster-hunter and heart of the group makes me smile and I know the descriptions do not quite match but I see him as cleaner looking version of Hagrid from Harry Potter. Geek girl,  Penny Carter is another favorite with her impressive gadgets. Our werewolf Charlotte and Imogen, Kates sister, impressed me and did a fine job of assisting our crew.The action was intense as Gaios minions create chaos when they attack the royal coronation. Our courageous heroes pursue them and mayhem ensues. The climactic last battle has the team working together to save all of Britain. The scenes are vivid and I bow to these authors. Their ability to bring the scenes to life gave me thrills.  I could smell the fire, taste the fear and hear the war cries.  One particular scene involving a dead man hanging from a tree was creeptastic. If you appreciate world-building and thrive on the details you will quickly become lost within these pages.  The gadgets, villains and city sprang to life before my eyes. It was brilliant and quite the adventure.Nothing makes me happier than a series arc having a satisfying conclusion. Nothing felt rushed and if anything, I was saddened that this is the end of our journey. After finishing the trilogy, I lay in bed and dreamed of new obstacles for our motley crew.Nicholas Guy Smith added an extra layer of enjoyment to the tale. His voices he created for our characters brought them to life.  His ability to deliver the snarky banter between the crew and the creeptastic tones of the villains gave me goosebumps.

"Annie Carson returns home to her familys farm after a divorce that has shaken her to the core. She and her young son are preparing the home for sale. She plans to use the summer to get her life in order before moving on. She has a plan, but being home brings back memories and of course, there is sexy neighbor Sawyer Kane to deal with. He is the reason she left Brightwater the first time but can he be the reason she stays?Annie is a blogger who has a popular website for Mommies. Her blog shares recipes, how to make homemade-dye for Easter eggs and daily parenting issues. However, her life is not as rosy as the image portrayed on her blog. I liked Annie even with her self-doubt and insecurities. We do see her slowly transform throughout the novel and I enjoyed seeing her go from insecure to downright sassy.Sawyer Kane has had his share of difficulties but Brightwater is in his blood from the land to the town he protects as local sheriff. His biggest regret in life was not holding on to Annie Carson. She is back in town and he is determined to woo her and her son. Sawyer is sweet and downright sexy. The man knows how to work with his hands from building to cooking and I liked him from the start.The romance was slow building with tender kisses, conversation and a little heat. I adore second chance romances. Their friendship and history added believability and sweetness.Secondary characters have me curious. We meet a few newcomers and oodles of Kanes. Eden Bankcroft-Kew has just opened up a coffee and cupcake shop and Archer Kane is moon-struck. The possibilities for future stories and romances have me excited. Kanes grandmother the DON of Brightwater was an absolute hoot.

"Sideswiped takes the reader back five years before The Drafter begins and introduces us to key players. They are all brilliant college students who are in their senior year and taking their final exams. One of those tests involves a mission to retrieve an item in a real world environment. Told from the perspective of Silas we learn about the characters, witness their test and see them band together to change the outcome.Harrison was clever allowing Silas to tell us their story; He shared his relationships with his fellow students and introduced us to Peri Reed the main character of The Drafter. The idea of drafting, anchors and the technology are briefly described teasing the reader with tid-bits. We learn that upon graduation they will all find careers as drafters or anchors working for the government. Silas is already a doctor and is also a student he is working on his thesis. His theory is that drafters are actual shifting sideways in time to alternate versions of reality and not going back in time as the scientist believe.Events that occur in Sideswiped clearly have a strong impact on Silas, Perri and their friends. A stranger introduced near the end  hints that there is an alternate path for their careers.While I have a million questions, Sideswiped left me excited for the Drafter and crossing my fingers we meet up again with all of these characters in the Drafter. If you are like me, and love the backstory then I recommend picking up Sideswiped before you begin the Drafter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV9RWQL8XG7S9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012OS8WBE#wasThisHelpful","RV9RWQL8XG7S9","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The tale takes place in a beach side community in North Carolina making this a delightful summer read.The Shaughnessy family- consists of four brothers, their Dad and a baby sister who is now seventeen. All the boys are wildly successful and Darcy the little sister is trying to deal with her overprotective brothers. The family lost their mother during Aidens first year of college and it influenced all of their lives, particularly Aidens as he stepped in to help his father out.The plot-  The story centers around Zoe and Aiden. Zoe Dalton is an interior decorator who, after losing her mother, moves to North Carolina. Zoe was sweet, successful and perhaps the only one who will stand up to Aiden. I had some issues with her, and really felt the authors intention for her did not come across. (See Decaffeinated Aspects) Aiden has some serious control issues and while it worked in his professional life, it has done little for his personal life. His whole world revolves around taking care of  and protecting his family. Many of his traits are admirable, but oh, lord the man needs to drop the lease. We get a hurricane, a cute dog and banter as Zoe unlike everyone else isnt ready to fall in line and take orders from Aiden.Secondary characters- from siblings to the local sheriff they added interest and hinted of storylines to come. I am most excited about Anna and Quinn whose book will be a friends to lovers romance. I am hoping Dad will get one too and I have a character in mind.The romance- despite the angst the romance was slow building and I believed in their affections. Chase shared some sizzling kisses but the sex was not overly detailed. It was a nice balance somewhere between Robyn Carrs small-town romances and Bella Andres Sullivan series.

"The past: In 1995 at the age of  sixteen Tess Cartwright was found in a Texas field, buried alive along with the dead bodies of other missing girls. Their shared grave was covered in the wildflowers known as Black-Eyed Susans. Thus, the press dubbed these girls the Black-Eyed Susans. Her memories of the events leading up to her discovery are shattered, but her testimony helped sentence a man to death row. We learn about her childhood, friends, family and her recovery. We tag along for visits to her psychologist, spend time with her best friend and take part in courtroom preparation.The present: Tess still struggles nearly two decades later but has forged a life as a single mother and artist. A patch of Black-Eyed Susans planted outside her bedroom window in the dead of winter has her reexamining events from the past. She agrees to work with lawyers to exonerate the man accused of the murders and her abduction. She worries that, the killer is still out there and sending her messages. Through the past and the present, we learn that Tess has not shared everything and it was creeptastic.The Writing: Heaberlin spins a griping tale, with an unreliable narrator who will have you suspecting everyone and questioning Tess as her memories begin to emerge. From red herrings, mysterious packages and quests to unearth clues the author quickly pulls the reader in.  The author managed to make this a dark, suspenseful thriller without gore or violence. By sharing with us past and present events, she is able to give us an intimate knowledge of Tesss mindset, her recovery, the trial and the new investigation. The past/present format for unfolding this tale worked wonderfully adding suspense and depth to both the characters and story.Well researched and fascinating: In the present story, we tag along with the forensic team. We learn about DNA, exhume bodies and begin to grasp advances in this field. A scientist who ends up befriending Tess uses bone to extract mitochondrial DNA. (mtDNA) mtDNA is inherited solely from the mother and they can use it to determine the identity of the dead girls. One of the specialist was able to determine where each of the dead girls lived based on deposits in their bones. I found this fascinating and the author delivered everything in non-technical language.Twists, turns and draw dropping conclusions: I read an enormous amount of books and it takes a lot to surprise me but I was kept guessing in Black-Eyed Susans. I had my list narrowed down to two possible suspects. A line in the past tipped the scale and I was ninety-nine percent sure but even with that, the revelation and climatic ending shocked me.

"I adore Angel Crawford! The girl is crazy, badass and quite clever. Each installment we see growth as her confidence grows.  New York terrified her, but she went out and attempted to save the day. Her inner commentary keeps me giggling and her one-line snark is the best.The Saberton thread offered some serious problems for our zombies while allowing Angela, and her zombie baby to grow closer. *snort* I still have questions regarding Saberton. Why is the corporation and particularly Nicole so intent on these particular zombies. Is something bigger funding this? I hope that with new developments we will begin to learn more. A thread has the zombie parasite behaving differently and it has me worried about what that means for Angel.The interactions, friendships and Angels on-again off again romance all added interest to How the White Trash Zombie Got Her Groove Back. Secondary characters are well developed and we some really weird developments that are sure to make fans exclaim what is this f@ckery?While I know, fans adore reading this series, for me the audio version is the only way to go. This series and the spectacular voice of Allison McLemore is the only way I will get my zombie on.

"The Snow White Bride had suspense, danger, and a swoon-worthy romance. Eleanors story touched me. I admired her bravery, strength and grace. I found myself hoping she would find her happy. Her story has some dark moments and I will warn you, while not overly detailed it is upsetting. I have always admired Alexander, the Laird of Kinfairlie. Despite what his sisters say, he is honest, charming and sexy. He cares deeply for his homestead and those in his keep. I loved that we had villains, danger and unexpected surprises throughout the tale. As the couple became acquainted and learned to trust we hit a few obstacles but they communicated and did not run around acting like ninnies. I loved the mixing of humor, heat and conversation allowing their relationship to feel genuine. The last section had me biting my nails, crossing my fingers and even shedding tears.

"The World: The Veil is set in a dystopian New Orleans after a great war that occurred when the veil between our world and the paranormal world opened. Magic is now banned, there are food shortages and very few people remained in the effected areas. Para (beings from the other side) trapped in our realm when the veil closed and humans known as sensitives who have paranormal abilities are contained in a walled of section of NOLA known as Devils Isle. The government occupies NOLA and for those who chose to remain life is hard. Neill did an excellent job of explaining the world and did so without info dumps creating a wonderful flow. I consumed this story in two sittings.The Characters: Claire Connolly our heroine owns a store in NOLA, and loves the city.  I loved this ginger-headed, kick-ass character. Claire is fearless, and harbors a secret- she is a sensitive and must be very careful not to expose herself. She has no training and understands very little, in fact she feels very alone despite being surrounded by friends, and loyal customers. This allows us to learn with her and leaves room for her to grow as a character. Liam Quinn is a bounty hunter who hunts para and wraiths. He lives within the walls of Devils Isle and when he sees Claire fight of a pair of wraiths he steps in to help her. Liam is a total alpha without being controlling. I enjoyed their interactions and his belief in Claire. There is some chemistry and complications there but Neill has me curious about what could develop. The secondary characters are mix of humans and para. Some are part of the military controlling NOLA and others are citizens like Claire who are just trying to find normalcy. It created a dynamic group and their interactions added depth and furthering my enjoyment of the story.The Veil: The world beyond the veil and the paranormal creatures we encounter all have me curious. The Veil itself is almost a living breathing character. Despite being at war with creatures from the beyond the folks know very little about the para.Suspense/Action: Neill is an excellent storyteller and she created some intense battles, placed our characters in danger and gave us a villain to loathe. All of this had me reading just one more chapter.Original/Fresh storyline: From the world to the characters Neill created a world I am anxious to return to. I loved how down to earth and normal Claire was. While the males had alpha tendencies, she added some depth, particularly with Liams backstory. The ending was climatic and had me holding my breath. Neill even managed to surprise me with a little twist and reveal. The threat in this first installment was handled and I appreciated that the ending didnt feel rushed. She has created unlimited storyline possibilities with this motley crew of characters and I am curious as to what will happen next.Copy provided by publisher/original review posted at caffeinated book reviewer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S21TUN8D58CL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451473345#wasThisHelpful","R1S21TUN8D58CL","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While the previous books were laden with angst, suspense and danger, Brand of the Pack focused more on shoring up the relationship between Morgan and Greyson as it introduced a new threat. Shanley has created an engaging series and I quickly slip into the story despite wishing for a full length novel. To her credit, she tells a tight tale and I guess one should appreciate being able to slip away for an hour and enjoy a good story.Brand of the Pack wrapped up the romantic aspect of the series but also opened the door to a new threat. I am anxious to learn more about this new danger, and see the White Wolf Clan strengthen. Shanley continued to add depth to her characters while weaving in some sweet moments. While this installment wasnt as action packed as the last few, we did get some battle scenes, a good dose of humor and a little snuggly time. Greyson continues to be his smexy self and is becoming comfortable in his decision to form his own pack.The world building and clan structures are fascinating.  The author continues to strengthen and flesh out this world. Secondary characters add substance and threads like those of a jealous she-wolf have me oh so curious. The bonding ceremony was interesting although not as ritual rich as others I have read. Unlike the previous books which ended with a cliffhanger, Brand of the Pack has more of a closed ending as it hints of what we can expect in the next installment.

"The tale surrounds two thirty-something characters whose upbringing has them swearing off long term relationships. When Victoria Slade, a successful divorce attorney suffers panic attacks after a home invasion, she temporarily moves into a condominium for the summer until her newly purchased condominium is available. A shared bedroom wall and poor sound proofing soon have her exchange banter with smexy, single investigative reporter Ford Dixon. The tale that unfolds had me consuming this in a single evening.Suddenly One Summer is a novel the reader will easily slip into, they will soon find themselves laughing, wiping a tear and  becoming fully invested in this couple. The secondary characters weaved throughout gave this novel a small-town community feel and enhanced the story. The depth of the story from the fleshed out characters to the couch sessions with a therapist both surprised and delighted me.  James weaved in delicious banter, page melting heat, humor and side stories that held weight.Both carries scars from their childhoods but are survivors with successful careers and strong social networks. Victorias personality and her need to be observed as normal by others was one I am sure many women can relate to. There is a story about Fords sister that I found especially touching and I loved the way it caused Ford and Victoria to interact. We do get some miscommunication but it was realistically done and not overly drawn out.If you are looking for a feel good, swoon-worthy summer read with a small-town feel and a little heat then you cannot go wrong with Suddenly One Summer.Copy provided by publisher, full review at caffeinated book reviewer","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7JR6WOF7H5VE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425273768#wasThisHelpful","R7JR6WOF7H5VE","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First Date: Holly Bell is a  single divorced Mom and has the night off. She decides to take an unauthorized walk into her future home after learning the bank accepted her offer. Holly has big plans for the rundown Craftsman and has spent the last five years saving to realize those dreams. The events that unfold have me giggling and annoyed when we discover Dan Amador has outbid her and now owns the house. These two have chemistry but I would not exactly call it sizzling, unless thoughts of frying up Dan are romantic. I have a feeling we are in for a ride.Second Date: I love this quirky little town.Dan is a bone-headed idiot at the moment, but I have hopes.  The banter between Holly and Dan slowly develops into friendship and more. Saint weaves in wonderful secondary characters from the other Amador brothers to Hollys daughter. We get plenty of banter as Dan makes some assumptions that quickly get him in trouble with folks. It was fun watching him make amends and discover how wrong he was. Holly is a perfumer and I liked her snark and independent streak. Saint does a wonderful job of fleshing out Dan and bringing me around to liking him.Third Date: Growing pains, a little two-step and some ah ha moments had me flipping the pages, swooning a little and losing myself within the story. When I began reading, I did not realize this was the first in a series. In fact, I often felt like I had missed something regarding secondary characters and eventually stopped reading to see if this was perhaps the third book in a series. I was surprised to find it was the first. Secondary characters piqued my interest but felt information was lacking. I enjoyed the romance, which was slow burning and offered passionate kisses and eventually some heat.Copy provided by publisher, full review at caffeinated book reviewer","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VGN1GDG7KY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTR7J6#wasThisHelpful","R28VGN1GDG7KY0","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Night We Said Yes is a second chance romance that includes fleshed out secondary characters, and a summer night reliving the night, they said yes. The tale is realistic but be warned it portrays underage drinking and is filled with dorky, sweet moments and friendship.I loved how the tale unfolded using alternate chapters of then and now. The then tells the story of the first night Matt and Ella or El met. Gibaldi shows us those first moments of a budding romance, of the getting to know that special someone. She gives us all a glimpse at the chemistry, that awkwardness and adorableness as it unfolds. We also met Els best friend Meg and her volatile relationship with Jake. The now chapters take place almost a year later. Matt moved away six months early without any closure and has returned hoping for a second chance not just with El but their friends too. He tries to recapture that first night. It was sweet and had me shaking my head, feeling for both of them and laughing aloud.While I certainly cannot condone some of their behavior from trespassing to underage drinking, Gibaldi kept it realistic and still managed to impart common sense such as not drinking and driving or vandalism. It evoked memories of high school years.Matt and Els romance is adorkable and reminded me of first love. I became caught up in wondering whether El would forgive Matt and take chance. Surprisingly mature and low on angst the now chapters filled us in on everything that happen between then and now. We get a secondary romance between Jake and Meg. It is volatile and exposes their rocky relationship.The friendship between Meg and El was perhaps my favorite part of the story from memory bracelets to having each others back it truly captured those magical friendships that are a part of our childhood.Copy provided by publisher, full review at caffeinated book reviewer","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5HL3RBN0FBSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062302191#wasThisHelpful","R5HL3RBN0FBSY","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always found novels set during this era to be fascinating even as I try to wrap my head around the atrocities. Bruce brought us two very interesting characters. She delivered a tale that shares the struggles of individuals while giving us a sense of the war itself and its impact. I appreciated her attention to detail and the way in which she brought these characters to life.Eleana is a Russian widow, who works at the hospital as an aid, but secretly works with the black market. She reads banned American and British literature and believes in God. She finds herself assigned to a hospital near outskirt of the war, and eventually is assigned to the front-line as medic. It seems the fates are against her when she is assigned to be a Night Witch. These female pilots dropped bombs on the Germans forcing them to retreat.For most it was a death sentence flying about in these tin cans.  Eleana is strong, passionate and at times fearless. I found her to be remarkable and Bruce did a wonderful job of allowing me to connect and gain insight into what her life must have been like. Bruces descriptions of her transformation and internal struggles felt genuine.Friedrich is a German professor and architect who covers up his disdain for the Third Reich by becoming a German lieutenant. He works at a concentration camp and gives us a harrowing account before he is assigned to fight with troops invading Russia. Friedrich is not as strong of a character as Eleana.  He does what he must in order to survive. One cannot help but question how we would handle the situation. Is he a coward or survivor?The two accidentally meet and find themselves holding up on a Russian farm during Russias harsh winter. It was fascinating seeing these two enemies relying on each other and discovering how very different the other is from their own preconceived notions and of course, from the propaganda their leaders have fed them. A friendship forms out of necessity and soon they are confessing their sins and darkest fears. The two become lovers and eventually hatch a plan to desert and escape together. Their time on the farm felt very genuine from their distrust to their need to feel safe and loved.Death Steppe: A World War II Novel shares a love story but do not look for happily ever after. Bruce beautifully captures the brutal landscape of war while weaving in the effects upon humanity and individuals. It was sometimes dark, sometimes beautiful, and at times incredibly suspenseful. The words flowed wonderfully allowing me to become completely immersed in their story. While the ending was awash in sadness Bruce also gave us a glimmer of hope befitting such a tale.

"The first in An Ember in the Ashes series, Tahir brings us a roman like world filled with gladiator type military schools, slaves and an oppressed society ruled by violence and fear. The author did an excellent job of bringing the world to life from the impressive academy to the slums.Dual perspectives gave us both sides of the story. Elias is a solider at the academy who dreams of freedom and an escape from the violence that rules his life. He unwittingly finds himself competing to be the next Martial emperor. Laia is a Scholar, living under the control of the emperor, but when her brother is arrested and her grandparents murdered, she soon finds herself working undercover in hopes of freeing her brother. The chapters alternate between the two and I immediately became wrapped up in their stories. Laia is an unlikely hero, in fact if given a choice she would be in hiding, but it is her love for her brother that drives her and her transformation alone was worth the ride.Tahir delivers a dark tale that touches on the darker side of war, and the sacrifices on both sides. The emperor faction is dark and blood thirsty, with political maneuvering and quests for power. Scholars and slaves are treated like commodities in this quest. In the middle of it, all we have a rebel group. The Revolutionist, and we learn that Laia has ties to them; she uses that connection to aid her brother.What strengthened this novel and gave it its heart were the protagonists. Both are struggling and see tremendous growth and enlightenment throughout the story. The tale is surprising romance free although seeds have been planted. I loved these little teasers they gave a little hope to all the darkness. I thought a triangle was in the making, but with one line, Tahir squelched that and I was delighted. An Ember in the Ashes is dark and falls on the higher end of young adult genre making it a great crossover novel.Fiona Hardingham and Steve West did a splendid job with the narration allowing us to feel Laias and Eliass internal struggles, fear and growth. The choice to use two narrators was a good one and I hope these two continue the series.

"Learning your ABCs has never been more fun..from the vivid pictures of bugs to the tongue twisters accompanying each photo in The Alphabet of Bugs. Each page opens with the Letter of the Alphabet on the left side of the page and a tongue twister and on the right side a colorful picture of a BUG! Unusual bugs, dare I say beautiful bugs. They are detailed and quickly caught my granddaughters eye. The bugs are placed on colored backgrounds and the sentences teach not only the bug name, but a unique color as well. For example, Mason Wasp Magnificently mimics Moccasin or Katydid keenly kicks Keppel The book is intended for preschool to kindergarten but will require a parent who is good at pronunciation to read them. My husband and son enjoyed reading this as much as Sophia liked the pictures.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DCKXFF7YC3GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=163220407X#wasThisHelpful","R3DCKXFF7YC3GR","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The focus was on Leisel and Evelyn and they had this whole Thelma and Louise vibe about them. Leisel is extremely broken when we first meet her, and I will be the first to claim I wanted to slap her and yell, Snap out of it bitch! She felt more like the first character to be killed in a B-horror movie, but then Alex said something about her strength and I realized he was right. From that moment on, I changed my attitude about her and watched as the authors allowed her to grow and become this little kick-ass. I am woman hear me roar. I loved the transformation. Evelyn, Alex and secondary characters added to the tale and I lost myself listening. At just under 12 hours, I consumed this over a two-day span listening into the wee hours and finding excuses to slip in my earbuds.C. J. Bloom did an excellent job of narrating giving both Leisel and Evelyn clear voices. This was important since the story switches perspectives each chapter. Her male voices were especially pleasant and did not have that gruff weird tone that many female narrators give to male parts.Thicker Than Blood was dark and twisted at times but the gore is rather low making it a listen even non-zombie fans will enjoy. Thicker Than Blood wraps up nicely despite having a slightly open ending. It appears there will be another book and I for one will be snagging it on audio.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21FW6I1MPY1LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WEWJ7LA#wasThisHelpful","R21FW6I1MPY1LZ","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"eveneves had a realistic vibe that makes you stand up and take notice. Instead of aliens attacking or a meteor bumping Earth out of orbit, Stephenson created a scenario that felt realistic. Fans of the Martian will enjoy Seveneves although be warned there is a lot of technical jargon. From the characters to the technology Stephenson offered up a suspenseful tale.Get your geek on. I loved all the technical jargon from how they built things to handling resources. It was truly fascinating and I found myself completely caught up. It delves into so many aspects from mining asteroids using tiny robots and housing folks as they build. Then there is the whole process of determining who will be placed on board the ship to ensure humanities survival. The story the governments tell folks sent me chills it was so realistic.The story is broken up into three parts. The first shares the catalyst and humanities plan to preserve the species. The second part focuses on Earths final days and the final section unfolds five thousand years later as the survivors of humankind return to Earth. The action scenes were suspenseful and beautifully described giving me a panoramic view as events unfolded.I was disappointed that the segments werent balanced and that we spent the least amount of time learning about the return. The last two hundred plus pages was intense and some of the strongest writing.Seveneves is massive, and generally, I do not have a problem with that. It is also a standalone, but in this instance, I really would have preferred this to be a trilogy with the three segments being balanced. Who knew I would encourage a trilogy?","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LCANZMJLY4K3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZWV8JO#wasThisHelpful","R1LCANZMJLY4K3","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We learn about the first time Donovan Pate and Sofie Martin tangoed. Let us just say Donovan didnt make the nice list and it changed both of them.  Now we fast forward to the present and Sofie has created a wonderful business in town.  Donovan has returned after his grandmother passed leaving him her estate. He plans to sell it and learns the house has been contracted out to host a charity event. Um, guess who is handling the event. *hehe* Yep, Sofie and oh how the sparks that fly when these two are in the same room. Right away, I am in lust over Donovan and looking forwarded to seeing these two tango.I love how Lemmon weaves in secondary characters and already I see the promise of another romance with Sofie and Donovans friends. I already love the dance Lemmon is providing in Rescuing the Bad Boy but then she introduces a dog to the mix making me fall further. I loved the old estate and the youth group who is the recipient of the charity event. Friends and banter had me giggling. I laughed so hard at moments and was grinning from ear to ear. Donavon and Sofie cave into their needs and I suggest you get some oven mitts because these are some of the sexiest, hottest scenes. Did I mention Donovan has tats? The story behind them will make you turn to mush, so grab a tissue and truffle.The author does a wonderful job of fleshing out the characters and sharing their backstories particularly Donovan. He may be a bad boy, but it is all a faade and seeing what lies beneath will have you adding him as your latest book boyfriend.

"Crave is first in the Undone series and I am anxious to learn about all of the characters we met. Layla and Michaels story was bittersweet and I quickly consumed Crave.Layla is a successful business women who once had it all but things fell apart by an unexpected tragedy. In her darkest hours, she craves what she once held dear. Michael is attracted to Layla and knows exactly what she craves. I love how he takes control but allows Layla to feel as if she is taking the lead. The man is hot and his sensitive side is so sweet. Laylas reaction to him felt genuine.This explores the early stages of  a dom/sub relationship and it was beautiful, tender and fresh.  I would hate to classify this as BDSM, since this just dabbles on the fridges and takes a more realistic approach. If you liked the vibe of Bare It All by Lori Foster, you will enjoy Crave. Even though it touches on the subject, the tale is low on heat and details. Instead the author focuses more on the emotional aspect as Layla heals and finds herself.Dawson gives us a full romance, allowing the characters to become friends, trust and find something meaningful. The slow development and delicious tension created as these two tangoed captivate me. Their story felt genuine allowing me to connect. We also meet secondary characters that tickle our interest and whose stories we hope to soon hear.Dawsons grasp of human emotion brings this story unexpected depth. While she brings heat, she also gives us a couple whose passion, pain, love, and emotions we experience first hand. Layla and Michaels romance is one you will remember long after you close the book.If you love Foster, Kaye and Dawsons Something New series youll love Crave and the Undone series.

"Bette Lee Crosbys writing: Is magical from her descriptive writing to the easy flow in which her stories unfold. She offers unique characters with depth, lovability and manages to allow me to slip into her stories and lose myself.Memory House Bed and Breakfast: located in Burnsville, just outside Richmond Virginia is a quaint home surrounded by a garden with a sign half hidden. The owner runs an apothecary shop in the front and has two rooms available for guests. The white house is situated at the end of Haber Street and the owner never advertises as folks have a way of finding Memory House when they need it. I love that the house itself is like a character.The Characters: Ophelia Browne is almost ninety years old. She knows her time here on earth is limited but she is spry and intelligent. She tends her garden, mixes herbal remedies and has the ability to read memories in objects. She collects them and keeps them safe. I adored Ophelia and found myself envious of the time Annie spends with her. Her story, gift and presence were delightful. Annie Cross is at a crossroads. She has recently broken up with her boyfriend of seven years and is frustrated with work. She decides to take off for the weekend and soon finds herself at Memory House. We learn about her troubled romance and experience the growing friendship with Ophelia. Ophelia shares her gift with Annie and I loved how their friendship grew and strengthened.Narrative: The tale is delivered mostly in third person with chapters weaved in from Annie and Ophelias perspective. While I enjoyed the tale, I found myself particularly drawn to their first person perspectives as we grew to know them and learned their secrets.Magical Realism: I loved the concept of Memory House. Watching Ophelia share her stories regarding objects and Annies determination to unlock secrets from one object in particular. The tale is sweet, light and perfect for a rainy evening. I truly enjoyed the characters and was sadden when the story came to end. While Crosby chose to leave it open-ended, she gave us enough that creating our own happily ever after was easy. I closed this book with a smile while wishing I had some dandelion tea.Copy provided by author, full review at caffeinated book reviewer","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGYU8LMIRM8Y7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6W3VWQ#wasThisHelpful","RGYU8LMIRM8Y7","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I liked:London hooks the reader from the opening pages making us very curious about what is happening to Caroline and Jack. I wanted to know who they were, why they were in trouble and what was happening.The story has chapters both in present day and of those in the past. The chapters in the past make up the majority of the tale as we meet Caroline and Jack and witness their romance unfold. In between, we get chapters on what is happening both to Caroline and in the United States. These chapters were suspenseful and oh how I wanted more.The romance is a slow burn with friendship, heat, and growth. London fleshes out the characters taking us into their personal lives as well as their careers in government. I enjoyed both Caroline and Jacks characters. Of the two, we get to understand and identify more with Caroline. She is strong, confident and as a politician, she tends to be bi-partisan and relentlessly stands by her convictions in the all-boys club.From the chapters in the present we know Caroline is injured and have an inkling of where Jack is. It is the why we do not learn about, at least not yet. Caroline is injured and we meet other characters such as doctors who go beyond in their duty to help her. We know there is civil unrest, the government is like a regime and that states are seceding. These chapters held me riveted and I was begging for more.The story has a nice flow and is well written. The reader can easily identify where they are in the story.What I didn'tThe romance between Jack and Caroline is fully fleshed out and developed slowly. Normally this is a good thing and to a point, it was but after a while, I started skimming. I loved that they developed a strong relationship but the getting to know each other slowed down the story. Conversations on books they liked, plays, and movies became overkill. While the synopsis clearly states Dissident focuses mostly on their romance I ultimately ended up skimming through some of their tete-a-tetes . I would have liked the romance slimmed down for more chapters in the present. Maybe in book two I will appreciate the depth but I wanted more action.This is a six-book commitment and the books must be read in order. I am hoping we get more depth from the dystopian angle in future books. As a romance despite some heated moments I am not invested enough. However, the present day situation really drew me in.While the book has been edited, I personally felt the book would have benefited from being more balanced between past and present day.

"Our protagonist, Lila Merriweather is a tough, orphaned thief who makes her home in the basement of a library in a town filled with magic. The story takes place in Cloudburst Falls, West Virginia where tourists come from all around to see pixies, Fae and monsters. Rich families who are constantly feuding run the town. Estep brought the world to life in vivid three-D imagery from the troll on the bridge to the pixies preparing meals.The characters were unique from zany Mo to the cold and manipulative mother of Devon. Lila is a colorful heroine who I quickly warmed up to. Lila is young and has some baggage but she is also street smart and in some ways wise beyond her seventeen years. Fiercely loyal she has several talents. She is content attending high school by day and thieving by night but she unwittingly finds herself involved in protecting one of the royal families sons after intervening in a deadly fight. A certain grumpy pixie about stole my heart and the attention to detail with this secondary character was amazing.The story Estep weaves is magical, filled with action and growth for Lila. I would love to see this made into a Disney movie. I can just see the Sinclair mansion on the big screen. Weapons, spider spun jackets and rare talents amped my enjoyment of the world. I have a feeling with the right narrator this would be an amazing listen on audio. Estep weaves in several storylines from the feuding families to Lilas own past. She satisfied my need to know while leaving room for more details as the story progresses. Villains, a mysterious stranger and betrayal added danger.While there are hints of a budding romance, Estep did not bog this tale down with unnecessary drama, insta-love or triangles. Instead, she hinted at a slow-burning romance.  This added a few swoony moments and left us with the possibility of a future romance. I l found it to be refreshing. The tale wraps up nicely, giving us closure but also an idea of what is to come leaving the reader satisfied.

"Touching, tender and with secrets that could rip them apart I quickly became caught up in their story. Sofia has always been the most fragile of the Santos family and has the deepest scars. I was worried about how Robson would handle the romance between her and Killian.I enjoyed watching this delicate romance with its tender moments unfolded. Their story was not an easy one to share. Killian carries guilt for what happened to Sofia and blames the events on himself. Sofia carries not only the memories of that painful event but also the dark path it led her own.Robson tackles some tough issues including domestic abuse, rape and molestation. She tackles these topics head on and does not gloss over the darkness that grows from them. At its heart, the story is about healing and finding love and forgiveness. Of being ok with the past and moving, forward. She also weaves in secondary stories involving other characters. Wren, Killians sister and Finn both have me curious. Robson even gave us updates on previous couples as we see Mateo and Evie, and heard from Brody and Lety.While I still am not a fan of the angst, miscommunications and volatile relationships typical of the new adult genre, I do love the heart that Cecy Robson brings to these characters and enjoyed Once Pure. I am looking forward to the next books in this series.

"N.D. Byma was kind enough to send me a hardcover edition of The Letter and Sophia and I quickly began reading.  The story is beautifully illustrated both inside and out by Amanda Grove. The colors are vivid and the font used for telling the story is cute. Each page offer a few sentences making it easy for early readers to follow along. The story begins with a little girl trying to write a very special letter at the park. Unable to think of the words she sets it on a park bench. Throughout the day folks find the letter and add to it. This was fun, adorable and added a little suspense from things happening to the letter to finding out what it says. Sophia while very little loved the vivid images and of course Nonnas hilarious narration and sound effects. I can definitely see why The Letter is a readers favorite. Its message is sweet and the adventure was fun. The Letter is available in Hardcover and as an eBook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROY16VY3ZQAKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692314474#wasThisHelpful","ROY16VY3ZQAKY","A3AVRSSNHRMNEI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVRSSNHRMNEI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"t is a character reunion! So many characters begin appearing at the convent and it was delightful seeing them and learning new developments. Jones takes secondary characters and gives them pivotal roles for future novels. Folks you will not be able to set this down. Call your boss now. You need a mental health day.For fans, this book might make you pee your pants a little because we get answers. I am talking big answers! Ones that have driven us crazy for example, Who is Mr. Wong? or Who sent the twelve hell hounds? and so much more.Twists, turns and oh baby, Reyes is in trouble! Jones continues to surprise me and it is clear she knows what direction she is taking this story and these characters. It is one hell of ride. While we see some of Charleys wit and sarcasm and get some heated moments with Reyes this story is much more serious. The ending was brutal but it is not a cliffhanger. Jones likes to deliver these zingers and while it is clear where we are heading the last chapter will bring excitement, tears and have you contemplating driving to New Mexico for an advanced copy of Dirt on Ninth Grave. Unless you are up for a road trip and possible jail time, you will just have to wait like the rest of us for January 5, 2016.

"I'm a longtime user of a Dove's beauty line because the products usually deliver on their promises. I also love Dove's campaign to help build self confidence and self esteem in young girls and women of all ages. I use Dove's softening body daily but with the colder months around the corner I thought that I would try their Deep Moisture wash. I was not disappointed! This wash is creamy and a little bit goes a long way. My skin felt moisturized and super soft. Certain scents trigger migraines for me but this scent didn't. It smells fresh, clean and lovely but it doesn't linger and overpower my perfume. On another note I really, really like the new bottle with the pump. It is much easier to use than the old bottle. I highly recommend this body wash fir people with normal to dry skin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O8EKUP58VYWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MEDOY2G#wasThisHelpful","R2O8EKUP58VYWR","A2D4FQHV506EPB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D4FQHV506EPB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My six year old first grader is transitioning from reading children's books to reading chapter books. I selected this book for him because the premise sounded unique and the illustration on the front looked fun. As predicted, this story held his interest from start to finish and he really liked the black and white illustrations (which I also thought were super cute). This story made him laugh and also sparked a new fascination with Yeti folklore. This is an entertaining story that contains thoughtful lessons for younger children that parents will appreciate. 'The Yeti Files' is the first book of a new series that we will follow and I highly recommend it to advanced first grade readers and up or children ages 7-10.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XC7MYRO8BIU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545556171#wasThisHelpful","R2XC7MYRO8BIU2","A2D4FQHV506EPB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D4FQHV506EPB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the best moisturizers I've ever used! It's so rich and creamy and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft without any greasiness. I'm a 39 year old female with very sensitive skin. My skin type is normal with an oily T-Zone and I have some redness on my chin and around my nose. This moisturizer not only leaves my skin feeling amazing but it also tones down the redness I have. My 44 year old husband has very sensitive, combination skin with slight rosacea. He's been using this moisturizer for two weeks and he said that this is his new favorite. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I don't care for the scent which is very faint but it smells like old lipstick.

"Jack Black is one of my favorite skin care lines because they make high quality products that have always delivered on their promises. Unfortunately this Glycolic cleanser didn't agree with my skin. I'm a 39 year old female with normal skin and an oily T-Zone. My skin is very sensitive and I'm prone to occasional hormonal breakouts. The first time I washed my face with this cleanser, I noticed that my skin felt very dry and tight. I immediately put moisturizer on and although it helped, my skin still felt very irritated. It's been four days since I used this and my skin has reddish dry patches on my cheeks and chin. I realize that this product line is targeted to men but I've been using Jack Black skin care products for years and I've never had a problem until now.

"This screen protector was easy to put on my phone. First I cleaned my phone with a microfiber cloth then I aligned the protector holes with the speaker and camera. It wasn't perfectly aligned the first time I tried, so I pulled it off and I got it right the second time. So even if you make a mistake, it comes off easily and is easy to readjust. There are a few bubbles on my screen but they don't bother me and they aren't a distraction.

"My first impression when I felt this lotion was that it's too watery but once I rubbed it into my arms and legs , my skin just soaked it in. My skin felt so soft and not at all greasy like I expected. The scent is a very fresh citrusy scent that is not overwhelming. It very common for scented products to give me a migraine but this one didn't. My husband also uses this lotion and he doesn't have any complaints, which is a good thing because he is a man of few words unless he dislikes something. We both have normal to oily, sensitive skin and neither one of us had any breakouts or issues with this lotion.

"This toaster oven has been a great way to cook food without heating up our entire home using the full sized oven. With this toaster oven we have the option of baking, broiling or toasting food. So far I've used this to cook everything from pork chops and chicken to corn dogs and taquitos. All of the food has been cooked evenly and thoroughly. This comes with a cooking rack, a baking pan, a crumb tray and tray grabber. The rack and the pan can be positioned in three different slots and the pan is dishwasher safe. This is the first toaster oven I've ever used and I've enjoyed cooking with it. I'm really looking forward to trying different recipes. This is a sleek looking kitchen appliance and the stainless steel will compliment most kitchen decor. When considering the space needed for this, I want to add that this oven needs 6"" on each side and 6"" from the top for proper air circulation.

"I'm a fan of Johnny Shaw's first book from his ""Jimmy Veeder Fiasco"" series, 'Dove Season' and this story is another action packed, violent, exciting adventure involving best friends Jimmy Veeder and Bobby Maves. The fellas go in search of Bobby's fifteen year old daughter after her mother calls asking Bobby for help when the teenager is missing. If you liked 'Dove Season' then you will probably enjoy 'Plaster City'. This story also has an exciting chain of events and the same crude humor that is really just what I consider ""guy humor"". For readers who have not read Dove Season', this book stands out on its own and it's not necessary to have read the first book.

He could easily wear a thermal shirt or pants underneath if it's cold on Halloween and if it's not, he will still look great. The length of the jumpsuit fits him perfectly as well. I deducted one star because the mask is supposed to attach in the back of the child's head with elastic strings and Velcro but the Velcro doesn't stick together. Also one of the lightening bolts was folded over in the package and now it doesn't stick out the way it's suppose to.

"This story is so beautifully written that I devoured it in two days and I would have finished sooner if I didn't have to do things like feed my family, shower, sleep etc. ;) This author is a truly gifted story teller and I was completely lost in this story that broke my heart, made me laugh and infuriated me. Maggie is an African-American psychologist who is married to an East Indian man and because of that she is assigned a new patient who is an East Indian woman who had attempted suicide. While trying to figure out why Lakshmi tried to end her life, she realizes that this woman is incredibly lonely, homesick and stuck in a loveless marriage. Maggie and Lakshmi's connection to Indian culture and the fact that they both lost their mothers at a young age bonds them and a friendship is born. Unfortunately, the friendship is unethical and unbalanced. Through the course of their relationship secrets, betrayals and self-revelations are revealed. Ultimately, this is an incredibly captivating story that really hinges on forgiveness. There are small flaws like how unlikable Maggie turned out to be. Her indignant attitude towards her husband and her lack of compassion when Lakshmi confesses her deepest secret were very hard to swallow. Especially given the fact that Maggie held some pretty big secrets of her own. However, what I struggled with the most was the way the story ended. I love this story, I was invested in this story and I cared about these characters (even Maggie) so I felt disappointed with the abrupt ending that left me completely in the dark as to what happened between Maggie and Lakshmi and between Maggie and her husband Sudhir.

"This is a super cute book in a new series about four sister's (Spring, Summer, Autmn and Winter) who are the daughter's of Mother Nature. This book is Winter's story involving themes of friendship, jealousy and feelings of being left out. I read this story to my 6 year old son and 3 year old daughter. My daughter is too young for a chapter book and this didn't quite hold her attention the way it held my son's. He particularly liked Flurry, Winter's best friend who happens to be a polar bear. Even though this book is targeted more towards girls, my son really enjoyed the story. This is a great chapter book for children about age 6 and up. The black and white illustrations are really cute and there are good lessons to be learned in the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12QR3L6SXOEGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619632675#wasThisHelpful","R12QR3L6SXOEGL","A2D4FQHV506EPB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D4FQHV506EPB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My three year old daughter was giddy with excitement when I pulled this game out for us to play. Like many little girls, she is Frozen obsessed and that being the theme of this fast paced matching game helped to hold her attention and keep her interest in this game. So far this has been a fun tool to help teach her the letters in the alphabet and I'm positive that in continuing to play, she will recognize all the letters very soon. This game comes in a very small, round tin box that is easy to throw in a purse and travel with. This would also make a great stocking stuffer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S28M381YMTEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LK0N1ZK#wasThisHelpful","R3S28M381YMTEL","A2D4FQHV506EPB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D4FQHV506EPB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the most adorable umbrella and it looks ever better in person! The bright pink and red colors are eye catching and the black details are a nice contrast. My three year old daughter loves the clear ""see through window"" to see where she's walking and I love that it curves down instead of sticking out and poking people. My daughter can easily open and close this without the worry of her fingers being pinched. This is lightweight enough for a toddler to carry but big enough for an adult to use as well.

"This is a very sturdy caddy that fits all of our shower essentials easily. The top shelf has three openings to hold bottles that are upside down, which is a unique feature that I particularly like. I also love that underneath the caddy there is a place to hang two razors. The only suggestion I have to make this even better, is a couple of suction cups to secure the caddy to the shower wall.

"The idea behind this toy is great but the finished product needs some tweaking.1) The web shooter is a loose on my average sized 6 year old son.2) The silly string style ""web"" clogs and runs out very quickly3) replacement web fluid cans are too I expensive for how quickly they run outWater can be used in place of the web fluid (and it's less messy), but after my son used the web cartridge, water wasn't as much fun. I wouldn't mind purchasing web fluid refills, except that because it clogs easily and runs out fast, I just can't justify the cost.

"I get so excited whenever I get new kitchen gadgets, utensils and pots/pans, so I've cooked dinner with this pan for the last four nights. I love it! This cast aluminum pan is very lightweight, I can easily hold it with one hand (unlike the much heavier pans that I own). This pan is coated with Ecolan, which is a ""professional grad non-stick ceramic coating that uses earth's natural substances"" and is free of PFOA. I've cooked chicken breasts, pork chops and steaks without using cooking spray and there weren't any problems with the food sticking. My food cooked evenly and quickly and the pan was easy to clean using a soft sponge and gentle dish soap. This is dishwasher safe but I prefer to wash it by hand. This is a deep pan and at 11 inches it easily fits 4 chicken breasts/pork chops or two large steaks.

My brother came and set this up for us and he said it was very easy to do. We've been using this for about a month and our Wi-Fi signal has greatly improved, especially in the dead zones of our home.

"I'm 5'7"", weigh 136 lbs. and I typically wear a size 6-8 in clothing and a 34/36A bra.

"My family and I host extended family gatherings regularly and having a crockpot of this size and quality helps tremendously. So far, green chile shredded beef, pot roast and red chile shredded chicken are the main courses that I've made in this slow cooker and I'm incredibly happy with this crock pot! Having the all in one option to brown meat in the ceramic pot is easy and convenient, as is the built in timer. I hand wash the ceramic pot to protect the ceramic coating but the lid is dishwasher safe. This crock pot is high quality and makes cooking for a larger group super easy.

"I must admit that when I first tried this curling iron I felt that it was too lightweight to be a quality tool. Also, as others have pointed out, the temperature button is located in an awkward place on the handle where it's very easy to change the temperature without realizing it. However, this curler did a nice job of curling my hair and managed to maintain some shine in my curls. The feature that makes this staying tool different from others that I own is that the barrel is coated with moringa, argan and macadamia oils to protect the hair from heat damage. I must admit that I wonder how long the oils will stay coated on the curling iron, but in the meantime I will continue to use this, as I have received the desired results that I was looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM1N1MZUY55G4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ID8H4OG#wasThisHelpful","RM1N1MZUY55G4","A2D4FQHV506EPB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2D4FQHV506EPB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The story of a young girl in Appalachia, The Killing Tree is written in a lyrical, almost poetic style that one would expect from a novel about this region of the country.  In fact, the thing that most makes this an ok-but-not-great book is that so much if it is expected, even stereotypical almost.But first, let me talk about what I liked.First and foremost was Mercy, the main character.  A lonely orphaned girl raised by her grandparents and starved for a mother's love, she captivates the reader's sympathy almost from the first page.  Even her best friend Della, in spite of her wild and promiscuous ways, captivates the reader as an equally lost and lonely soul.  Although at times a little too heavy on the poetic imagery for my taste, still Keener's writing is strong and skilled, painting a story in vivid pictures.  At times, for instance when Della's boyfriend betrays her, the emotion it evokes is so strong as to be almost painful.  She creates a plot full of conflict and tension that keeps you reading, wanting to know how it's all going to turn out.But there were a couple of things that disappointed me and kept this from being a 5-star book.  One was the way it ended.  I will keep my comments deliberately vague so as to not be a spoiler, but there was a lack of resolution in the story involving two of the main characters that felt very unfinished and left me disappointed.But even more disappointing, I think, is that so much of this book is so expected as to be almost stereotypical.  The young girl raised in Appalachia by a crazy grandmother and a cruel, warped grandfather just seemed so unoriginal.  And the fact that the cruel, warped grandfather is a sin-obsessed deacon in the church was a turn off for me.  Why do so many authors love making their cruelest, most warped characters be a Bible reading churchgoer?  As though church is nothing more than a gathering place of holier than thous, and a spawning place for the worst in society.The book would have been much more enjoyable had the author developed a story more original, instead of using already overused characters and plot elements.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E4AZREMVYI4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599951118#wasThisHelpful","R3E4AZREMVYI4B","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A non-fiction tale of murder, injustice, and freedom come too late, The Innocent Man is the story of Ron Williamson.  It is a sad, tragic tale of a man already spiraling down into depression and mental illness, when a wrongful conviction for murder pushes him further into mental and physical illness and, eventually, premature death.

"The Last Juror is a fictional tale of murder, injustice and revenge set in rural Mississippi in the early 1970s.  Danny Padgitt, of the notorious and powerful Padgitt family who have had Ford County in their iron-fisted control for over 100 years, is found guilty of the rape and murder of a young woman.  No one doubts that he is guilty -- the last words of the dying woman sealed his guilt -- but everyone assumes that the Padgitt clan will pay false witnesses, buy off the judge, whatever it takes to secury a verdict of innocent.  To everyone's surprise the jury finds him guilty, although they deadlock on a death sentence and so he is sent to prison for life, instead.But in 1970s Mississippi a life sentence really only meant about 10 years behind bars.  With the Padgitt influence Danny was set free in even less than that, and as soon as he returned to Ford County the jurors in his trial began one by one to be brutally murdered.This sounds like a chilling tale of suspense; however it is anything but and if that is what you are looking for you will be sorely disappointed.  The Danny Padgitt story occupies the first couple of CDs and the last couple.  All the CDs in between -- the majority of the book -- is a tale of small-town life in 1970s Mississippi.  This is really the story of Willie Traynor a young man from ""up north"" (Tennessee) who comes to Clanton, buys the town's newspaper, and immerses himself in the life of the small town.  Narrated by him in the first person, it is an engaging story with a cast of whimsical, eccentric and entertaining characters.John Grisham's style is so engaging that it is impossible not to enjoy the story, even if it is not the highly charged suspense tale that the cover blurb makes it sound like.  Michael Beck does a fabulous narration -- his pace and cadence are perfect, and his voice has just enough twang to perfectly fit the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUNXIM46BD6BU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LV64WM#wasThisHelpful","RUNXIM46BD6BU","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Angela Hunt is one of my favorite writers of historical Biblical fiction and, since it's been several years since she's turned out anything historical (I don't at all care for her contemporary books) I started this with eager anticipation.In spite of the fact that Hunt is a gifted writer, whose style is polished and skilled, I found this book somewhat lackluster.  Perhaps this is because it took me 2+ months to read it and so I thereby lost the rhythm of her writing.  Or perhaps the lackluster quality of the book is what caused me to set it aside for weeks at a time - ?All I know is that the story lacked spark.  Hunt's depiction of Esther's life and upbringing prior to the palace was believable, her depiction of Esther's experiences in the palace plausible, but I think the main problem was that too much of the book was focused on events outside of the very exciting plot of the Biblical book of Esther.  Hunt spends most of the book focusing on the king's military activities and the imagined/presumed machinations of the deposed queen Vashti and, while all of this is somewhat interesting, it does nothing to advance the story.  I don't know if Hunt felt that the the biblical account alone was not enough to fill a book and so felt compelled to expand on it - ?  The character of Haman wasn't introduced until three-quarters of the way through the book, and the exciting intrigues and events of the Biblical story were rushed and crammed into the last 80 pages.Nevertheless, I plan to read Hunt's next book in this series -- skilled Christian fiction writers are few and far between and so I am loyal to my favorites and don't give up on them after just one disappointing book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SYUJJDV4ZZNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764216953#wasThisHelpful","R2SYUJJDV4ZZNE","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in a small English village in the 19th century, The Return of the Native is the story of crossed affections involving several young adults.  It is a mostly sad tale of irony, misplaced affections and misunderstandings.  Although tragic, the tale never descends into the melancholy or gloomy.  Eustacia Vye is at the center of it all -- a young lady beautiful but vain, selfish and self-centered.  Although she is not all that likeable, she is not totally unsympathetic and there were many points in the tale when I identified with her.This is an elegantly-written classic that I will listen to again.

"This Side of Paradise, F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, is a semi-autobiographical sketch of a young man in the first decade of the 20th century.  It covers Amory Blaine's years at Princeton, and immediately afterward, aluding to but not detailing his time in-between in the battlefields of WWI.  Although in even this his first novel Fitzgerald demonstrated a skill with language, the lack of plot makes this book a tedious bore to read.  A mix of prose and poetry it reads like a disjointed mix of stories and vignettes written independently and then strung together into a single novel (which is probably exactly what it was).  After a rambling, aimless wander for 6 or 7 discs, the last disc or so descended into philosophical ramble.I find it hugely ironic that when it was published this book became an instant bestseller that catapulted Fitzgerald into fame and fortune.  While the vastly superior The Great Gatsby sold poorly and only achieved popularity and critical acclaim after Fitzgerald's death decades later.The narrator does a good enough job, but I just can't recommend this tediously boring book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQZV3UZDHL8AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400148073#wasThisHelpful","RQZV3UZDHL8AJ","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Black Tulip is a tale of love and intrigue in Renaissance Holland.  Cornelius van Baerle, a wealthy but somewhat native young man, wants nothing more than to grow his tulips in peace, and to become the first to develop a perfectly black tulip.  However, politics is in turmoil as his country struggles for independence, and tulipmania is at a high, and Cornelius finds himself unwittingly embroiled in both.  Will he ever be free from his sentence of life imprisonment for a crime he did not commit?  Will he ever be able to rightfully claim the reward for developing the first perfectly black tulip?This is an enjoyable but unremarkable story, which is no doubt why it isn't one of Dumas' better known books.  However it is difficult for me to objectively rate the quality of the book due to the quality of the narration.A narrator can make or break an audio book, and in this instance the narrator definitely breaks it.  Some months back I purchased several audio books, three of which were narrated by unknown-to-me narrator John Bolen.  As soon as I began the first CD narrated by him, I immediately regretted the money I had wasted on the three books.At the risk of sounding scathing, I have to say that John Bolen is just about the worst audio book narrator I have ever listened to.  His ""natural"" speaking voice when narrating is so drawling and affected that it is annoying in the extreme.  His cadence when reading dialogue is so off that the dialogue is completely stilted and unnatural.  He manages to make almost all the male characters sound foppish and effeminate, and his narration style is so distracting that it is almost impossible for me to focus on the book.  In fact, I was unable to finish two of the three audio books I purchased that were narrated by him.  I was able to finish this one, although it was made somewhat worse by the poor quality -- it is obvious that the book was not recorded in a studio but at Bolen's home.I will not purchase or listen to any more books narrated by John Bolen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R392OMJFJXHSUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400139384#wasThisHelpful","R392OMJFJXHSUJ","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Although it is written with the smooth, elegant language for which the Brontes are known, it is totally lacking in the powerful plot and characters of her sisters' famous works.  It is simply a nice, short little novel about a nice litle governess who has to endure absolutely horrible employers and situations before finding true love and living happily ever after.I think only true Bronte fans would enjoy this one, and even at that I can't see this book being anyone's favorite.

"Ben Hur is one of my favorite classics, because it has it all:  love, hate, vengeance,adventure, endurance and restoration, all set against the backdrop of 1st century Judea and with the character of Jesus woven throughout.  The one thing Ben Hur is missing is forgiveness; although Judah ben Hur does succeed in avenging the wrong done him and his family, and though he does encounter Jesus and become a follower of him, he doesn't ever come to a place of forgiveness against his enemy Masala, at least it's never expressed in the book.  To me this is a critical omission, and one that would have made the story even greater.That being said, it is still a great story that I have read more than once, will doubtless read again, and would recommend to anybody.  As far as audiobook narrators go, Todd McLaren is ok but not great.  He has a pleasant reading voice that is perfect for narrating the story itself, but his performance is weak on character voices.  Everyone sounded middle-aged or older, and it was especially true of Iris, who did not sound at all like the sultry, young, seductive character she was.A great book suitable for the whole family.  If you listen to this book and like it, then I highly recommend Focus on the Family's dramatized version; it is much more abridged, so much of the story is cut out, but the performance is excellent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NJ6OJ0UXDUVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452601348#wasThisHelpful","R2NJ6OJ0UXDUVM","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Room With a View is a well-written and enjoyable novel that blends skilled writing and gentle humor into a comedy of manners set in the very early 1900s (although dates are never referred to in the novel, it seemed to be around the turn of the century).  It is the story of a young gentlewoman, Lucy Honeychurch, who must choose between two men:  one who is well-connected and well-regarded by her family, and one not of her family's social standing.  Although the outcome is predictable, there was a time near the end when I had some doubt and wondered if the author was going to throw in a real twist.  Alas, he didn't; I say alas, because books with twists and turns and unpredictable outcomes are much more interesting and memorable.Even so this is an enjoyable book, and the frequently recurring theme of views and rooms with views makes it no doubt a favorite of high school English teachers, as well.  Steven Crossley does an excellent narration; his voice is pleasant and with no distinctive qualities that often make narrators' voices distracting and even annoying.This was my first book by E.M.

"Focus on the Family does an outstanding job with their Radio Theatre productions, and this one is no exception.  The voice actors and sound effects are top-notch.In this production they turn for their source to the Gospel of Luke.  And I must say that the original title of this series -- The Luke Reports -- is much more appropriate than the title it's been re-issued under, The LIfe of Jesus.  For the focus is much more on the imagined backstory of Luke's writing of his gospel than on the actual life of Jesus.  That isn't necessarily a negative, as Luke's story -- which is the story of the turmoil of Palestine in the time of Nero -- is interesting.  However, if you're looking for a dramatization of the Gospel of Luke then you may be disappointed, as the life of Jesus occurs as just snippets throughout.I have just a few criticisms of this production.  For one, I didn't particularly care for Luke's voice -- which is purely a subjective opinion I realize.  Mary the mother of Jesus was voiced way too young.  The story takes place 30 to 40 years after Jesus' death, which would put her in her 80s.  However, she sounds about 20 years younger than that, and much too vigorous for such an elderly woman. I didn't particularly care for the scene where Jesus scourged the money changers in the temple, as the way they had him growl and roar made him sound almost like an animal.  And I was especially disappointed in the crucifixion scene as most of Jesus' words were omitted -- and thus the power of the moment was omitted, as well.While all of these criticisms are fairly minor, taken all together they make this one 4 stars rather than 5. Another observation -- which has no impact on my rating but is expressed just as a tongue-in-cheek comment -- is that many of the characters had cockney or Irish-sounding accents.  I found the same to be true with the other FOTF production I listened to from this same setting (Ben Hur).  I didn't realize there were cockneys living in 1st century Palestine!All in all an enjoyable listening experience, and one I will definitely listen to again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R321QE2086YLXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589973682#wasThisHelpful","R321QE2086YLXL","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Little Women has been one of my favorites since I first read it at about age 9 (a very long time ago).  Although old-fashioned, and sometimes preachy and moralistic, nevertheless it is a comfort read.  Every time I re-read it, which I do every few years, it is like wrapping myself in a warm blanket.  Somehow it manages to touch my heartstrings every time.As always, Focus on the Family does a fine production. Although it is impossible to capture the richness of Little Women in just 4 CDs, they manage to convey much of the book's spirit by hitting the highlights.  My only criticism of their production was that they had different actresses voice Jo's character (a young Jo and an older Jo) but didn't do so for Meg or Amy.  The actress who voiced Meg sounded too old to be a 16 year old girl in the beginning, although she was fine for an older Meg at the end.  Just the opposite was true of Amy -- in the book Amy grows from a spoiled and selfish 12 year old into an elegant, refined and gracious young woman who wins the reader's admiration.  By having the same actress voice her throughout, this production fails to capture the essence of Amy, as she sounds like a 12 year old throughout the entire book.One other disappointment was that many of the scenes in this production failed to capture the depth and poignancy of the book, or at least the way I've always voiced them in my head the many times I've read it.  One example in particular is the scene where Laurie declares his love for Jo and she turns him down - this is truly a heart-wrenching scene in the book that makes me cry every time I read it.  But in this production it didn't touch any heart strings at all.  Perhaps it is simply that an abridged dramatization can never equal the power of the much-loved and much-read original.Nevertheless, this production is highly recommended for enjoyable family listening.  If you truly love Little Women then I recommend the unabridged version produced by Recorded Books and narrated by Barbara Caruso -- it is outstanding.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PX9LS6MGEPPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589971248#wasThisHelpful","R3PX9LS6MGEPPJ","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this audio dramatization solely on the strength of the fact that it was done by Focus on the Family Radio Theatre.  Having listened to several of their productions I know that they are always first-rate.  And in terms of production and performance this one was no exception.The disappointment was in the story itself.  When I opened the package I was a bit dismayed to see it was only one CD -- I guess I should have checked closer before purchasing.  Had I known it was only one CD I probably wouldn't have bought it, knowing that such a short story would necessarily be lacking in development.And so it was.  The story of Billy Budd, a young man apparently without flaw, was not only lacking in development but was pointless.  Pressed into service on a British warship during the Napoleonic wars, Billy endeared himself to almost everyone with his pleasant disposition, honesty and integrity.  There were a few on board, however, who hated him for reasons unknown; he suffered persecution at their hands and ultimately,...... well to say anymore would be a spoiler.Focus on the Family generally chooses stories that are based on issues of right, wrong, injustice, and that have some redemptive quality.  Billy Budd, Sailor was lacking in all of these, in spite of Dave Arnold's attempt at the end of the story to draw parallels between the story of Billy and that of Adam or even Jesus.  I just didn't see the parallel and I think this was a disappointing choice of a book for them to dramatize.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PXE66XB8FHPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589975073#wasThisHelpful","R1PXE66XB8FHPR","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I will never be a fan of Jane Austen -- her works are too tedious for my taste -- I have recently enjoyed a couple of them in audio version, this being one of them.Emma is the story of a well-to-do young lady who likes to arrange matches for her friends.  With her mother long deceased, her sister and governess married and in their own households, and living alone with her fussy, silly, doddering old father, there is no one in Emma's life to curb her self-important interference into other people's affairs.  Mr. Knightley, a long-time friend of the family and Emma's brother-in-law, is the only one who will even dare to criticize her, as everyone else in Emma's life thinks she is perfect.  The story centers around Emma's relationship with Harriet Smith, a poor younger woman in unfortunate circumstances, who Emma takes under her wing, convinced that she can improve Harriet and make a perfect match for her.  Alas, every one of Emma's schemes goes awry as she constantly misunderstands and misinterprets the feelings and actions of others, and poor Harriet suffers as a result.It is a credit to Jane Austen's ability to create subtle, nuanced characters that I liked Emma.  She was full of qualities that should make her unlikeable, and yet I liked her in spite of her flaws.  And when she bore Mr. Knightley's somewhat harsh criticism of a particular instance of bad behavior with grace and contrition, I knew my liking of her was justified.All that being said, this book isn't nor ever can be one of my favorites.  It was too long and drawn out -- as Miss Austen's works tend to be -- for my taste.  It took me much longer to finish this book than it should have, simply because I often lost interest and did other things rather than listen to it.  I also don't particularly care for tidy, they-all-lived-happily-ever-after endings such as this book has.The narrator, Nadia May, does a fine job.  Although narrators can make or break any audio book, I find they are particulary crucial to Jane Austen's works.  Her books need more than just a nice, pleasant voice, they need some character and drama to keep them from becoming just so much monotonous background noise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BFQYW83T66YR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1441755365#wasThisHelpful","R3BFQYW83T66YR","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ivanhoe is that most quintissential of Medieval adventure stories.  Written in Sir Walter Scott's old-fashioned but easily readible 19th century style, the story captures all that we most associate with chivalry and the Middle Ages.  The large cast of characters spans nearly all of Medieval English society:  Norman knights, Saxon nobles, a hermit, a jester, Knights Templar, Jews, palmers, knights errant, friars, and of course, lovely damsels.  And there are even a few ""celebrities"" -- King Richard the Lion Hearted, his nefarious brother John and the legendary outlaw Robin Hood and his band.This is a sprawling adventure that covers many facets of Medieval English society:  wandering palmers and knights returning home from Crusade, a noble feast, tournaments, battles, dungeons, all are worked into the story.  It is a story that covers all the color and glory of Medieval society, but much of its treacheries and injustices, too.  Scott's style keeps the story pretty lighthearted, no matter what the scene, so that even the less attractive aspects are told in a way that is never dark or brooding.Although the story is named after Wilfred of Ivanhoe, a young Saxon warrior returning home after being on crusade with King Richard, he is hardly the main character.  The story's focus shifts from one character to another so that it could be said there really isn't any main charcter.This is a story suitable for family listening and will doubltess have special appeal for young boys, since much of the story focuses on tournaments, battles, loyalty and betrayal.  Simon Prebble does an excellent narration","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I2KBQZQ9ZE6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400116066#wasThisHelpful","R3I2KBQZQ9ZE6S","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never been a fan of Jane Austen's works, having tried to listen to a few of them in audio version and finding them too tedious to even finish.  However, I recently tried another of her books and discovered that a really, really gifted narrator can actually transform her books into a pleasant, even entertaining listening experience.I purchased this copy of Northanger Abbey on the strength of Anna Massey's narration alone; I have another audio book read by her and know that she is a truly gifted narrator.  She definitely didn't disappoint this time, although even her skilled reading couldn't mask or make up for some significant flaws in the book.It is clear from almost the first sentence that Northanger Abbey is a satire of the popular romantic novels of Austen's day.  However, once past the almost-sarcastic beginning, the story settles into a nice tale.  The heroine is Catherine Moreland, a young and innocent girl of a good family who is invited to vacation in Bath with some family friends.  In spite of her naivete and propensity to view everything through the lens of the Gothic romances she loves to read, the reader can't help but like Catherine.  She is not silly, but simply a girl who is lacking in experience but not lacking in good sense.  Although she becomes involved with some people of less than sterling character, her natural intelligence allows her to discern this and the reader can't help cheering for her and hoping that she will come though it unscathed.Then another family invites Catherine to visit their country home Northanger Abbey and here begins the weakest part of the novel.  Catherine's relationships with those around her are suspended as Jane Austen turns the book into a parody of Gothic novels.  Immediately caught up by her overactive, naive imagination, Catherine is sure that the Abbey harbors dark secrets and immediately sets about discovering the truth behind the death of Mrs. Tilney, mother of her friends.  This part of the book is simply ridiculous and silly, with Catherine acting like a 19th century Nancy Drew.  Really, this section could have been (and should have been) completely cut from the book and nothing would have been lost.Finally, Henry Tilney, the young man Catherine loves, becomes aware of her ridiculous quest and firmly makes her aware of the facts behind his mother's death.  With this Catherine is overcome with embarrassment, this silly Goth parody comes to an abrupt end, and the story of Catherine and her society resumes.Besides the silly Gothic parody there are other significant weaknesss.  One is the author's tendency to suddenly turn to the reader as it were and start writing in the first person.  Another major weakness is the character of Captain Tilney; although his reason for suddenly dismissing Catherine and sending her home alone might have worked had it been written with Austen's usual sophisticated style and polish, it wasn't.  So it came across as clunky and even dumb.My conclusion -- this book was badly in need of some editing.  It lacks the polish of Austen's other works -- perhaps  because she died before being able to finish it to her normal standard?  It is not a terrible book but I can't help feeling that money would have been better spent on some other book and I doubt I will ever listen to this one again.  It will probably appeal most to ardent Jane Austen fans.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VS46XW2J7FX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160998112X#wasThisHelpful","R3VS46XW2J7FX0","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Turn of the Screw is quite possibly the stupidest and most pointless story I have ever wasted my time on.  Purportedly a ghost story, the ""ghosts"" are nothing more than occasional appearances by the former governess and valet, both of whom are now dead.  The reaction of the current governess and housekeeper to these appearances are immediate, irrational and overdone; both are convinced that these ghosts are evil and are controlling the two young children in the governess's charge.  Though just exactly what it is about the ""ghosts"" that makes them evil, or just what evidence there is that they are controlling the children, is never revealed.  The only thing ""bad"" that either child does is when 10-year-old Miles is suspended from his private school for -- ok, we are forced to wait until almost the very end of the story to find out just what terrible thing Miles did, so a drumroll is appropriate here -- as he finally confesses to his governess, ""saying things.""  Seriously?  Yawn.The narrator did nothing to help this gutless and pointless story.  Her pleasant monotone lacked drama and turned into so much dull background noise.  I don't think a better narrator could have rescued this terrible story, but she definitely did nothing to help it.If, after this scathing review, you still feel that you simply must read this story then get it from the library; don't waste your hard-earned money on it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R991KOM2X5VBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433209543#wasThisHelpful","R991KOM2X5VBJ","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never been able to understand the enduring popularity of Jane Austen's books.  The one I read in print years ago was unmemorable.  The two or three I tried to listen to on audio, and was unable to finish, were monotonous, genteel British chatter that quickly became background noise as my mind wandered.  Thus, I long ago concluded that I simply was not a fane of Jane Austen and never would be.So I'm not sure exactly what made me try another of her books -- but I am glad I did.  Mansfield Park is a Cinderella-type story of Fanny Price, a young girl removed from her poor family and taken in by her more prosperous relatives, ostensibly for her own benefit but really just to satisfy their own proud sense of generosity and magnanimity.  The book covers the next 10 or so years of her life, as she grows from a girl of 9 to a young lady of 19.  It follows her trials as the poor relation who is practically friendless, treated almost as a servant while continually being reminded of how grateful she should be to those who have taken her in.I found myself actually liking Fanny and wondering what would become of her.  Which young man would she ultimately marry -- the cad who pursued her relentlessly, claiming his undying love and that her goodness had reformed him, or the cousin she loved but who himself loved another young woman totally unworthy of him?So what made his book different than the other Jane Austens I have tried?  The narrator:  Frances Barber gives a performance that is nothing short of fabulous.  She breathes color, variety and character into each voice that brings the story to life.  She particularly excelled with the sultry-voiced Mary Crawford and the nasally, odious Aunt Norris.The only thing that keeps this book from being 5 stars is the happily-ever-after ending; a little too flat and pat for my taste.  In fact, the last several chapters were anti-climactic, as Ms. Austen was tying up the loose ends and the drama and action virtually came to an end.  I particularly missed the presence of Aunt Norris; dislikeable as she was, Ms. Barber's rendition of her added a lot of color to the story.Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book so much that I purchased a copy for my own (the one I listened to was from the library) and I will definitely listen to it again when I am in the mood for a cosy, easy story.  And I am now trying out other Jane Austen works on audio, being careful to choose different narrators from those I've tried before.  While a narrator can make or break any audiobook, I find this is especially true of Jane Austen's books.  Her stories need more than just a pleasant voice.  I wish Frances Barber had narrated more of her books; still, I am hopeful that some of the others I will be trying soon will be just as enjoyable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QBMBBT8586SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1471352439#wasThisHelpful","R3QBMBBT8586SC","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having never read The Prince and the Pauper, I was expecting a lighthearted, funny story in the vein of Mark Twain's other works.  Set 16th century England, the story is about Henry VIII's son Prince Edward and a pauper boy Tom Canti born on the exact same day who also happens to look exactly like the prince.  Their paths happen to cross one day when the prince witnesses the pauper being mistreated and he takes him back to the palace.  Intrigued by the fact that they look so much alike, and thinking that Tom's life sounds like carefree fun, the prince decides they should switch clothes.  They are both amazed by how indistinguishable they are.  Then suddenly the prince decides to punish a servant who has mistreated Tom and runs out of the room still wearing Tom's tattered clothes.  Thus he sets in motion a chain of events that traps each boy into the other's role..The story was as lighthearted as one would expect from Mark Twain, but the adventures each boy faced were more intriguing than I expected and made the story better than I expected.  This is great family entertainment, well-done by the Colonial Radio Players.  I do wish the ending hadn't tied up so nice and pat -- after all the conflicts each boy was entwined in, to have it all end so neatly was somewhat of a letdown.  But that's Twain, I suppose.  And younger listeners should be satisfied with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9J2HCFOABFDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611064902#wasThisHelpful","R9J2HCFOABFDP","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok, so it's my own fault that this ended up being a waste of money to me.  I'm no fan of horror and this is Dracula after all, right?  I guess I just wasn't prepared for how much different a full-cast dramatization of Bram Stoker's classic would be from a simple narration -- which I listened to several years ago and thought was good but not great.  Hearing the screams, the moans, the whispers, the sounds of someone lapping up blood was just too creepy for my taste.  Although that's probably evidence that BBC Radio has done a successful dramatization of this most classic of vampire tales.  I have several BBC Radio productions and their voice talent and sound effects are always top-notch; this one is no exception.  The only fault I find with this production, performance-wise, is that it constantly changes scenes with no narrator or other method of informing the listener, so that the performance feels very incoherent and disjointed throughout.  Perhaps that is the effect they were trying to achieve, to enhance the eerieness of the tale, but I didn't like it.If you like horror stories then you'll no doubt love this one.  I was truly impressed by the actor who voiced the American character.  I don't know if he is a Brit or not, but if so then he is the first British actor I've ever heard who can do an American accent -- and a southern one at that -- convincingly.I just hope I can sell this on ebay and get a few dollars back for it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T92EYAXRCVJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1408467003#wasThisHelpful","R2T92EYAXRCVJE","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've listened to several productions of The Colonial Radio Theater, and so far this is the best one by far.  The cast is small, with each actor giving an excellent performance.  I've noticed in some of their other productions that some of the actors' performances are a bit stilted, as though they are reading their lines, but there is none of that here.  The sound effects are just right, also -- enough to lend color and atmosphere but with not a single ""dead spot"" such as is typical of all the other CRT dramatizaitons I've listened to.This is a short performance, at only about an hour and a half, but psychological and atmospheric and excellently done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPDQOYQXZJ7JN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1469208636#wasThisHelpful","RPDQOYQXZJ7JN","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Captain, Blood, written in the 1920s and immensely popular in its day, is the quintissential pirate story.  Peter Blood, a soldier turned physician in 17th century England, is accused of treason for treating a wounded rebel during the Monmouth rebellion.  Originally sentenced to hang, his punishment in instead commuted to slavery in the West Indies.  After being purchased by a wealthy and prominent planter in Barbados, his talent for treating the sick is soon discovered and he is granted a large degree of freedom, especially since his medical services are highly regarded by the governor and his wife.However, when he regards the brutality with which his fellow slaves are treated, and when he concludes that he will never win the regard of the young woman he loves or the acceptance of society, but will always be regarded as a convict and slave, he arranges an escape for his friends. They capture a Spanish ship in the harbor and, turning his back on respectable society, Peter Blood becomes Captain Blood, pirate of the Caribbean.Of the several productions I have listened to by The Colonial Radio Players this one is the best; as a whole the actors' performances are better and there aren't quite as many ""dead spots"" as I've heard in their other productions -- that is, places where there is no dialogue and little sound effects, leaving the listener to wonder what is going on.  There is also a nice musical theme woven throughout.A large part of the story focuses on the sea battles and treachery between Blood and other pirates, both Spanish and French.  While this will certainly appeal to some listeners, particularly male, I found it a bit hard to follow and my attention sometimes strayed.  The story is tied together by a nice romance that is not sugary sweet but believable, although I never could figure out what it was about the self-righteous and obtuse Arabella that would cause two decent men to turn to villainy because of her.  She must have been really beautiful is all I can figure.Although I don't consider the performances of The Colonial Radio Players to be quite up to the level of BBC4 Radio or Focus on the Family Radio Drama, still they do a nice job overall at producing entertaining stories.  This one has a few mild oaths, but should still be suitable for family listening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KT4J85FDTPYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455804045#wasThisHelpful","R3KT4J85FDTPYN","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having never read The Legend of Sleepy Hollow I don't know how this audio adaptation compares to the original, so all I can say is it is a somewhat odd story.  Washington Irving's classic tale about an idiosyncratic school teacher and the legendary ghost of a small country village in New York is spooky in a lighthearted, non-creepy way that is appropriate for family listening.  The story starts off somewhat strangely with a montage of soundbites that I assume is supposed to create the feeling of ghosts and haunted woods; once past this the story improves.This is my third audio adaptation my Colonial Radio Theater and I have to say that, for the most part, they do a fine job (not quite as good as the BBC dramatizations, but then that is strictly a matter of opinion).  With a few exceptions their actors are animated, and they use a lot of sound effects which enhance the story; The Legend of Sleepy Hollow even includes a full-cast song.I enjoyed the story enough that I will listen to it again sometime -- it has also sparked my interest in finding out more about and perhaps reading Irving's original.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FKHWAQQ0JD9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455831565#wasThisHelpful","R2FKHWAQQ0JD9Y","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've listened to enough of P.D. James' books by now to know she is not a favorite of mine, so why do I keep listening to her books?  I guess because when I'm at the library desperately in need of an audiobook to listen to, hers are one of the few that I know will at least be free of graphic sex, violence and profanity (except for her occasional use of the f-word, more on that below).Admittedly, what makes me continue to pick James' books off the library shelf is her elegant skill as a writer.  She has a gift with words that I find irresistable (since so few modern writers have it) that makes me keep trying her books, hoping that this one will be a 5-star read.Alas, it was not to be with The Private Patient.  In spite of the elegance of the prose, there are many things about this book that keep it from being any more than a 3-star read.  First is that this book, as all of James', is almost completely lacking in anything resembling suspense.  And for a book that touts itself as a murder mystery, that is a death sentence (no pun intended).  After all, what is a mystery without suspense?  A flat story, indeed.  To her credit, this time James did throw in a little twist at the end that gave credibility to the otherwise overly-contrived and unbelieveable motive of the murderer.  However, for some mysterious reason, she never stated it outright but only hinted at it.The second reason why this, as all of James' books, are only mediocre at best is her persistence in throwing in elements that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot of the book and which only serve to sabotage what would otherwise be a lovely, elegant story.  In the case of this book it was the dropping of the f-bomb in the middle (yes, it was only a few times but it was jarring, unnecessary and crude) and the inclusion of characters and a minor side story that, again, had no bearing on the plot (I kept thinking it would) and introduced issues I find distasteful.  I don't know why James persists in throwing such things into her books unless she feels it makes her more ""relevant"" and attractive to modern, younger readers.  Perhaps it does to some, but for me it degrades her otherwise fine writing.All in all a typical offering by P.D. James -- ok, but not great.  Slow moving with nothing to offer, really, except an interesting insight into modern British life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NL4BOXYLTZX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0739376918#wasThisHelpful","R2NL4BOXYLTZX1","A3R1E4K7B6RUHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1E4K7B6RUHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have tested this portable USB battery with a 1 amp resistive (fan-cooled) load tester and can confirm that I measured very close to the rated capacity on the first discharge cycle. My experience testing these battery packs shows that this capacity will increase somewhat after several more charge/discharge cycles. This pack is so close on the very first test that I'm confident it will reach its advertised capacity.My wife really likes the size compared to the available capacity....as this battery will give close to 1.5 full charges for most smart phones - and will not take up much room in her purse.I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review - and that is exactly what I have provided. If you have any questions about this item or my review, please post a comment below - I will respond promptly.I like the button, so that we can quickly get an idea of the charge status (many battery packs no longer have this feature, and don't display any charge information until you plug a device in).

"I ordered these for one of my teenage daughters.  They already own real diamond earrings, but are always nervous about losing one of them and therefore don't wear them very often.  I thought CZs might be better in this regard.  But I still wanted solid 14k gold so they wouldn't cause any issues.  So these seem to be just the ticket...These earrings look great.  They are 5mm - which to my eye looks like about a 1/3 carat diamond.  I think this is a great size - especially for teenage daughters.  At this size, they show up very well and are not large enough to look gaudy or showy.These have plenty of sparkle - and the screw-on backs work great.I was very fortunate to receive a discount on the first pair I ordered in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review.

"This is a great watch/bracelet.  I ordered it as a gift for one of my daughters - showed it to my wife and she gave a solid approval!  She and I think our daughter is really going to like it.As far as the style, it looks just as good in person as it does in the photo.  It all seems to be well put together.  My wife really liked the slide type adjustment (I have no idea what this would be called since it is made out so what looks to me like embroidery thread).The stem was locked in the out position to preserve the battery.

"Let me start by saying that we are a family of five avid cyclists (with three teenagers). We ride mountain bikes, road bikes, commuter bikes, beach bikes and I restore and ride vintage British bikes.  I almost always like to use my phone for tracking my rides, navigation, etc.  Sometimes my employer needs to be able to reach me quickly.  So taking the phone along is anywhere from a strong desire to a necessity.However - finding a quality and rugged mount for large, late model smartphone has been a challenge.  In the past, I had some very nice mounts but my phones outgrew those.  More recently, I've used a small frame saddle bag to hold the phone, but this is less than ideal.  I keep looking - primarily for a mount that is sturdy and reliable - and that is affordable and can accommodate a late model smartphone in a reasonable case.Now it seems I've finally found it!  This mount from Gear Beast is inexpensive, rugged and reliable.  The handlebar clamp seems to be made of very rugged polymer (possibly fiber filled).  The phone clamp has a gripper cushion for the rear of the phone (or case) and rubber grippers for the side clamps.  And this mount comes with the stretchy (rubber-bandy???) safety harness.  Just a little extra protection for your phone.I believe this is a SOLID 5 star item - especially when considering the low selling price!Note #1:  Just out of an abundance of caution (and I don't want to ruin a $700 phone), I tether the phone clamp portion of this mount to my handlebar with a small camera strap (threaded through the oval hole in the phone clamp portion of this mount).Note #2:  This mount will open wide enough to hold a Galaxy Note or Iphone Plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H2LU3RSEPZNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTD6DCA#wasThisHelpful","R3H2LU3RSEPZNG","A1FD8C6K2WD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FD8C6K2WD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is easy to call a product ""professional grade"" or ""salon quality"", but an entirely different matter to deliver a product that truly is.Our teenage daughters had been wanting a flat iron of their own, so I ordered this unit from Bebella. They have really ""put it through its paces"". I can assure you that it has been thoroughly tested! We have also compared this Bebella model to a similar true professional flat iron owned my my wife.Our daughters have used a number of similar irons (mostly irons that belong to their friends), and they insist that this unit from Bebella is one of the best that they have used. It is very close in quality and performance to my wife's professional iron. The Bebella heats up fast, but not as fast as the professional Iron (the professional iron heats to 425 in less than 8 seconds - unbelievable)...it takes about 30 seconds to reach maximum temperature. These findings were determined utilizing two different calibrated infrared thermometers and a stop watch.Qualities I like about the Bebella include quality construction, very fast heat, and long, long cord. Also, the surface is well designed for easy gripping - this feature is very well done.Considering the high quality and good performance versus the low selling price (less than a third the price of my wife's professional iron) I consider this unit a solid 5 star value!We were very fortunate to receive a discount on this item in exchange for an honest opinion and unbiased review.

"Let me start by saying that we are a family of five avid cyclists (with three teenagers). We ride mountain bikes, road bikes, commuter bikes, beach bikes and I restore and ride vintage British bikes.  I have several sets of panniers - some of which were rather expensive.This set compares favorably to another set I have which cost nearly five times the selling price of this Faswin product.  The zippers are comparable, the quality of construction is comparable, and the design and size is comparable.  It really makes me regret the purchase of the expensive set!The zippers are a little stiff at first.  I worked in a very small amount of beeswax (as I do for almost all non-garment zippers)...now they are smooth and operate trouble-free.I like that the main compartments have stiffeners panels in the back, and I like that there are weather flaps over the zippers for the main compartments.  I also like the reflective striping.These panniers appear to be of good quality and seem like the should hold up well.  I will come back and update this review if any issues arise.I am sort of on the fence on these bags - wishing I could rate them a 4.5.  So I've got to go down to 4 or up to 5.

"Every so often, I run across an item that really surprises me and fully exceeds my expectations - this is truly one of those items! If you are looking for great sound in a rather small enclosure - and for a good price - this is the best I've found for its size (and price range).We are a family of five (three teenagers - woohoo) and we have a number of various Bluetooth speakers, including big brand speakers that cost quite a bit more than this speaker from TaoTronics. This speaker almost outperforms our Sony X33 (which cost us over $100). It does outperform several other models we spent a lot on from Altec Lansing and JBL.The neatly engineered design includes two forward-firing drivers, and an oblong rear-firing passive radiator.  It is a very similar acoustical and driver design to some very expensive Bluetooth speakers out there (some of which sell for crazy high prices).I've tried this speaker with wildly varying genres of music - from classical to 80s rock to bluegrass. It handles all of these with amazing ability - seriously. The sound is very balanced, and does not sound over processed. When you need smooth bass, you get smooth bass (and possibly a lot of it). When you need punch bass you get punchy bass. Enveloping mid-range? Yep. Crystal clear highs? Yep. And it seems to handle all volume levels very well.This speaker is well-constructed and I'm satisfied with the weather-resistant efforts in its design.. I especially like the ruggedized rubber surround and the clip for hanging (like on a backpack).I cannot imagine anyone not being impressed with this speaker considering its size and selling price.  In my opinion, this speaker is a SOLID 5 star item!I was very fortunate to receive a discount on this product for which I provided an honest opinion and unbiased review. I was even more fortunate to discover a truly fine speaker - one that sounds great in a really compact and durable enclosure.

"This is bright - hard to believe how bright it is for only 30 watts! I have about 15 similar lights installed around my property - some of which have been installed now for more than two years. All the lights I already have are 10 and 15 watt - with one exception - a 20 watt. This 30 watt light looks to me to be at least twice as bright as my similar conctruction/design 20 watt LED.This light has a great finish - and is easy to install if you're used to this sort of device. All of these lights I've purchased through the years have a pigtail for wiring. This works well for me as I always hard-wire them to a circuit.

"This is a great Induction Cooktop - far superior to the older unit I've been using.

"As a device-heavy family of five (three teenagers - woohoo) living in a rural area (poor signal strength causes cellular 3G/4G/LTE devices to deplete batteries quickly), we rely a lot on portable battery packs to keep our devices charged.

"Seriously, this is the 1st beard balm I've purchased that DOES NOT smell like turpentine!  I have three other brands that do.  Now, if I'm in my back yard splitting firewood, I don't mind the manly smell of turpentine or tree sap.  But if I'm going to the office - or somewhere ""nice"", I'd rather have a more refined ""manly"" smell.  This balm from B.I.G. provides that more refined (non-turpentine) smell.I've kept a beard for 15 years, and only recently started using beard oil and balm. I started with oil - trying to eliminate a little skin dryness. But the oil was, well, oily. Too oily for my tastes. I've tried several different balms, and have found them to be much better.  This balm from B.I.G. is equally as good as the other high-quality balms I've tried - except for the smell.

"Let me start by saying that we are a family of five avid cyclists (including three teenagers). We ride mountain bikes, road bikes, commuter bikes, beach bikes and I restore and ride vintage British bikes.  I'm very familiar with the type of gear included in this kit - and have used many similar bags, patches, pumps, tools, etc. for years.This is a good kit with a GREAT pump!The pump is a dual stage pump - which means it delivers air on both strokes.  So when you are pumping, you are increasing the air volume and pressure twice as fast as a traditional single stage pump.  I call this engineering ""stroke of genius"" (yes, pun intended).  The concept has been around for decades, but this is the first time I've seen it implemented on a small, frame-mountable bike pump.  Awesome!The pump is made from a fiber-filled polymer that looks to be very high quality.  It is very sturdy, yet remains a very lightweight design.  And the mount - which is designed to mount between a bottle cage and the bike frame - is one of the best I've seen.The under saddle bag included with this kit is well made from ballistic nylon.  It is a smaller size bag - large enough for tools and a patch kit along with a road bike tube.  It is not large enough to include a mountain bike tube.The levers are small, fiber-filled polymer - strong and lightweight.  It is nice that three are included rather than the standard count of two.The included patches are the ""scab"" type stick-on patches.  These are not my favorite, but they can be used quickly and are generally good enough to get you back home.  Sometimes they last much longer.The included tool is the most comprehensive tool I think I've ever seen (except for the possibility of adding a chain break tool).  It has every size of Allen wrench you'll ever see on a bike....along with sockets and a wrench.  It is a bit on the heavy side but very sturdy.Overall, this kit is a super value.  You could really consider that you are buying the pump - and getting all the other stuff for free!I would rate the pump a solid 5 stars - and the other items 4 or 5 stars.  But considering the low selling price for what you are getting, I think that makes it a 5 star deal!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIW8458YFBTVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0KHB3W#wasThisHelpful","RIW8458YFBTVE","A1FD8C6K2WD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FD8C6K2WD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been looking for gloves to use when cooking in our backyard wood-fired brick oven. It cooks at around 1000 degrees F, and up until this point, I've been using cumbersome leather welding gloves to protect myself from the heat. The handles of my tools (rakes, metal pizza peels, etc) sometimes reach 700 to almost 800 degrees F (according to my infrared thermometers).I ordered these gloves - hoping that they would be more flexible and less cumbersome - and that is exactly what they are! These are so much better than the welding gloves I was using. I used a torch to heat a metal pizza peel handle to 750 degrees F - I tried the gloves and everything was great. I could feel the heat somewhat - but nowhere close to being uncomfortable.About sizing and my hand size: As a man, I've always thought my hands were a little on the small side....but apparently I was wrong. I actually need the XL size in disposable gloves (like latex and nitrile rubber). These gloves are a little on the small size for me - although they fit my wife's hands well (even though the fingers are a little long - they are still very usable for her). And I am still able to use these gloves, even though a little small. I did purchase an almost identical product from another company that is slightly larger than these - even though they all sell a ""one size fits all"" glove.I was very fortunate to receive a discount on this product in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review.

One of the qualities that really appeals to me is precision - and this pump is a very precisely manufactured device.I really like the small size, the lightweight but high quality construction, and the mount that goes under the bottle cage.  This pump is constructed almost entirely out of anodized aluminum.  It appears to be very durable.I also like the fact that this pump can be disassembled for maintenance - I really like to lubricate the seals on all of my pups each year or so (I use a mix of silicone grease and silicone oil...has worked great for many years).This pump also converts from Schrader to Presta very easily - and works well with both.  Obviously, due to the small size of this pump, it takes a lot of strokes to increase air pressure in any tire larger than a road bike tire.  But there is no way around that.  I'd rather have any functional pump with me rather than no pump at all....especially on a long road bike ride.This is a very good pump overall - and sells for a bargain price.

"As a device-heavy family of five (three teenagers - woohoo) living in a rural area (poor signal strength causes cellular 3G/4G/LTE devices to deplete batteries quickly), we rely a lot on portable battery packs to keep our devices charged.

"I really, really like these scissors.  After using them, I quickly realized how poor my other kitchen scissors were...they are really bad!These scissors from Namtso cut very, very well.  I've tried them on a number of different foods and packages - and even heavy cardboard.  I like the silicone grips, the way they disassemble so easily for washing or dishwasher.  I especially like the holster.  When I ordered these, I didn't realize the holster was magnetic.  I stuck it to the side of my refrigerator - so now these scissors are quickly accessible - not lost in a drawer somewhere.With so much functionality versus a low selling price, I'm going to purchase more of these for ""stocking stuffers"" this year.I was very fortunate to receive a discount on this product in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review - and that is exactly what I have provided.

"When I travel,  I always need to charge camera batteries and my laptop (for managing photos).  I'll need to charge my phone too, and sometimes a tablet and other devices.  I rarely ever trust the ""cleanliness"" of the electricity...and I've seen the unfortunate results of transient voltage on devices too often.  This seems to be even more evident on ships, where their generator power is just not clean (nobody was charging delicate electronics when these ships were built 15 or 20 years ago).Up until this point, I've traveled with a small surge protector, a separate travel size power strip and a couple of USB bricks. Now I can replace all of these with this one Poweradd brand device!  It is a great solution.Testing/Verification:I load tested the USB output amperage with two resistive (fan-cooled) load testers.  I was able to veryify 3 amp output using both ports.  Due to limitations of my test equipment, I was not able to verify the advertised 3.4 amp output - but I have no reason to doubt this output capacity.This device seems to be well-made and durable.  The green edge you see in the photos is a bumper to protect the unit.  I also like the say the cord winds around and stores in place.I was very fortunate to receive a discount on this product in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review - and that is exactly what I have provided.

"This charger is excellent. I load tested it with two resistive (fan-cooled) 2 amp load testers and it maintained the amperage output without issue. So I confirmed a 4 amp output (but was unable to test the 4.8 amp rating - even though I have no reason to doubt this stated output). While delivering 4 amps for a number of minutes, the charger did not get hot - I was very surprised. It did get slightly warm.The fit and finish are very well done...with an knurled and anodized aluminum sleeve that is nicely finished.For my needs, the best part about this charger is that I can use it in all of my vehicles - due to its slim design. We have four cars with power jacks that are rather recessed. With many other chargers, they bulge out around the USB ports and therefore cannot be inserted into these power jacks (these are all German cars).I was very fortunate to receive a discount on this product in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review - and that is exactly what I have provided.

"This light is outstanding!  But let's just cut right to the Pros and Cons...Pros:Bright - very bright for its compact sizeQuick and easy to install on railQuick and easy to removeVery compactGood fit and finish (I cannot find a single flaw in the finish)Cons:Logo is large and noticeable - would rather have this subdued (user correctable)Silver screws on rear of unit could/should have been black (also user correctable)I tried this installed on a number of different arms.  I also compared it to other lights I already own, including my favorite compact light/laser combo - the Streamlight TLR-4.  The Sinvitron is a good bit brighter than the TLR-4, so the 180 lumen rating seems very realistic (the TLR-4 is rated at 115 lumens).The two cons I mentioned are really being a bit nit picky.  A small dab of black paint or even a Sharpie marker can correct this issues quickly.I have noticed others complaining about the CR2 battery - but that is really the standard battery for lights (and some lasers) this small (again, like the TLR-4).  I keep a number of CR2s on-hand for my other lights and lasers.  The CR2 is a great lithium cell that has tremendous capacity and shelf life - and not that hard to find.  I wonder what other possible battery they were expecting to find in a very bright light this small (I don't know of another option).I did add a dab of silicone grease to the threads and gasket (I do this will all of my tactical lights).  For the selling price - this light is a bargain!In the photos below, the AR is just for size comparison (obviously a hand would block the output from this light).  It is perfect mounted on the side of the CZ Scorpion EVO.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11QCPZVWA4NQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLIET5Y#wasThisHelpful","R11QCPZVWA4NQD","A1FD8C6K2WD20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FD8C6K2WD20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had been experiencing some issues falling asleep recently - and it seems that as I would be almost asleep, some insignificant noise in the house or outside would wake me back up.  I tried playing music softly, but then a favorite song would come on, or a song that would remind me that I forgot to do something earlier in the day...lol...etc.I decided to try a sound machine and ordered this product.  It is very easy to use, and has various sounds that I think would be helpful for many people.  The rain, ocean and brook sounds have been great for me.  These sounds, along with a new pillow (a very good pillow) have been helping me sleep like i'm in a coma!  I feel so much better the next day now.I particularly like the soft blue back lighting for each setting, so that you can quickly see the status.  And the volume can adjust the sounds from very, very low to way too loud!  I have tried the timer just to see how it works, but so far I've been playing the sounds all night....softly (I don't want it to keep us from hearing something important - like a smoke detector).I was very fortunate to receive a discount on this product in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review - and that is exactly what I have provided.

"I already owned several Zilu brand products and was accustomed to their high quality - and this charging hub did not disappoint!As a device-heavy family of five (three teenagers - woohoo) living in a rural area (poor signal strength causes cellular 3G/4G/LTE devices to deplete batteries quickly), we rely a lot on portable battery packs to keep our devices charged. In many ways they are more convenient than other types of chargers.  So keeping these portable batteries - along with all the devices - takes a good deal of charging.  That is where this 6 port charging hub fits into the picture!This hub has the power I wanted - and has proven it over and over now.  Most nights, I connect 3 devices and 3 battery packs.

I highly recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OQWCY4L0C5VF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SM251C0#wasThisHelpful","R1OQWCY4L0C5VF","AP1N90V2GN7Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP1N90V2GN7Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I believe anyone can learn to be a leader but people without the inherent sense of leadership may need more help than others. That is where this book comes into play. This book has so much great advice and tips on how to become an excellent leader and persevere at leadership. I believe this is a great book for anyone to read as everyone can gain some skills to help in every aspect of their lives from this advice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QYH8GGOTZDCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3KEQDM#wasThisHelpful","R3QYH8GGOTZDCR","AP1N90V2GN7Z8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP1N90V2GN7Z8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*Note: you should have read the first part before starting this one. This is a continuation of the same story*Wow this story just gets better and better! Hansel Part 1 leaves off when Hansel/Edgar/Luke kicks the girl he was testing for a sub out then finds out she was actually Leah. This part picks up a few days later and man. I am loving this story. I am so glad I gave it a try. The whole dark erotic fairy tale was kind of an eh idea for me, but man is this good. If you like dark, of you like hot, if you like characters that have issues but use those issue to make the sexy time super intense than this is the story for you.In this chapter you get to see more of Luke's past pre-Hansel. This story is so intense my heart was just pounding from the moment I start reading until I get to the end. I just have to keep going and see what will happen. Luke has not had a good life. He has a pretty messed up childhood and man...no wonder he is the way he is now. He wants Leah, but doesn't think he can have her. He is a monster. She wouldn't want him if she knew everything he did. He can't really deal with his feelings for her. He tries to burry them with alcohol and such, but oh my heart just broke for him.Leah is all set to go back home and try and forget Hansel/Luke, but she still has one more night in town. She goes out and happens to run into Hansel. Oh, Leah is so kind. She cares so much for him. She is wonderful even if he hurts her heart mistakenly at times. They both want the other, but can Luke deal with his past and let Leah take care of him? Can he put aside some of his demons so they can have a future together? Oh this story is amazing. I absolutely love it.

"Phew. Hansel was...part 1 is kind of amazing. I read the synopsis and thought dark erotic fairy tale? That could be good or it could be a disaster. I will either love it or I will hate it. I hadn't read anything by the author before so I just decided to give it a go. It is a quick read so if it was bad I wouldn't be wasting a lot of my time. Well this was far from bad. I loved this story, at least this first part. It is dark and gritty and everything I wanted. The story is so much better than I thought it would be. If you do not like dark than this is not the story for you. It is kind of an intense read.Hansel and Gretel(Leah) first meet after Leah is kidnapped by Mother Goose. She looks the part of Gretel and Mother has been needing that. She is locked up and her only source of companionship is Hansel on the other side of the wall. He makes a small hole in the wall so they can talk and hold hands. He tries to help Leah as much as he can, and she him. It sounds horrible and you get to see what it was like through some flashback. Man Mother is crazy. Obviously. She would have to be, but I loved how crazy she was. I loved that she was crazy with fairy tales. It was just a really interesting idea. Terrible for the kids, but she was a great villain.The story takes place years after Hansel and Leah escape Mother's house. Leah stumbles upon Hansel again only he is now a famous Dom. He has subs who he uses to try and be with Leah when he knows he can't. It was...oh. It was hot and intense and everything wrapped up in this dark fairy tale. Leah and Hansel obviously both wanted to be with the other, but not sure why they weren't after they got out. You don't get to see much of the in between time yet, but phew! I cannot wait to see what happens! Amazing read so far.

"The best thing about All Your Reasons is that is was a really short, quick read. It doesn't really have much substance to it so it was just blah.Presley is this girl who apparently falls in love with everyone instantly and doesn't make the right choices with men. She is married to a rock star, but has been separated for six months. She just wanted him to put her first instead of his career, which he wouldn't do. Now he wants to come back, after his tour, and be husband and wife again. Apparently she had only known the guy for 4 weeks before they got married and none of her friends liked him even then. She also reveals at one point that she almost married a guy twenty years older than her when she was eighteen. So she seems to just jump right into things without thinking much. The problem with the story was even though I know all this about her I don't really feel like I know Presley. She meets and falls for Jett instantly, but I have no idea why. Because he is good looking? Maybe? I don't know.Jett sleeps with lots of women, but has never found one he would want to settle down with. Until he sees Presley at a club one night and just like that he knows she is different and he wants her. Again not sure why. He mentions at one point that he can talk to her unlike most women he meets. So I guess that is as good a reason to be instantly in love.Now everything in this story happens instantly. They meet and instantly both just want to get out of there and have sex. The sex scenes? Well they are basically just take your clothes off as fast as possible and get to it. Not a lot of working up to it or anything. It was just...it made even the sex scenes not that good as I just couldn't even connect with them being that attracted to each other. They were all over before they started. I didn't buy it so it didn't work. Instead of feeling like they just can't wait, they have to be together, it was awkward. It could have used a bit of development so you could actually get to know the characters some or at least let you feel the attraction between the two. It just wasn't there for me. There is some slight drama with Presley's husband, but not much. It was all just too quick. There is a second book with the rest of their story, but I don't think I will read it. I just found this one to be kind of dull so I don't need to read more.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SOOLSSESF8L4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1X8ORC#wasThisHelpful","R2SOOLSSESF8L4","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maybe In Another Life was not quite what I expected. It started off not so good for me, but by the end I was loving it (and I loved where the story ended up). At first I was curious to read it as it reminded me of that movie where the girl gets on the train or she doesn't...sliding doors maybe it was called? I only vaguely remember it and I thought this would be a similar thing. It was surprising and I really liked a lot of the story and the thoughts behind it.At the beginning I really did not like Hannah. I also didn't like the style of writing and it was just something that I put aside to maybe pick up again and finish. The writing was too descriptive at times in a way that I don't like. For example:I don't need to know all of that. It just takes me out of the story as it is unnecessary and kind of bulky and just not for me. Pair that with not liking Hannah, not liking her 'well if I just pretend like I don't know that I am doing something I shouldn't then that is okay and I am a good person' thing. I really just did not like her attitude towards everything. I found her annoying. Then we have the time split. The decision to stay with Ethan her ex or to go home with Gabby her friend. After that I didn't put the book down until I got to the end. After that it was really interesting to read what happened in both timelines. You would get one chapter from one then one chapter from the other timeline. It was fun.I don't want to say too much as I don't want to ruin anything for those who have not read this yet, but if you find it just kind of blah at first keep going. It does get better. I loved all the talk of the one and soul mates and just knowing this person is right for you and so on. I truly believe there is more than one person for everyone. It doesn't make sense to me otherwise. To think in this entire world there is only one person for me and I was lucky enough to find them and live in the same area as them? To me that is crazy. If I hadn't met my husband, if I hadn't gone to college in Washington state, if I hadn't made the decisions I did I am sure I would have found someone else and be equally as happy as I am now. Or be happy by myself. Either way it would have worked out. Or maybe we would have found each other some other way. Who knows. So it was interesting reading a story where the characters talked about that and you see if there really is one person for them. I liked seeing what that one decision would and wouldn't change. If no matter the decisions you would end up in the same place or not.Where everything ends up I really enjoyed. Things happen, you make decision and then you deal with what happens afterwards. Really a great read once I got into the story.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16MTZ9VPT3QW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42X1P0#wasThisHelpful","R16MTZ9VPT3QW8","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paper Hearts is the story of Mia and Jensen. It is a second chance romance and I really enjoyed it. This was the second book I read this week where the main character had qualities I normally hate, but the story was written in such a way that I really liked them. I always love when that happens.If you have read Torn Hearts, the free prequel to this story, then you know Mia and Jensen were in love. They both thought the other was the one for them, but some bumps int he road tore them apart. Her mom said something in that story about how she was not with Jensen because she didn't like the idea of him being away at school with other women and Mia not being there. That Mia didn't like not having control of the situation. I see that. I see that in her. She just seems to be afraid of everything so much so that she is missing out. If she can control everything then everything will be fine, but if not...When she found out Jensen got some other girl pregnant her thoughts were immediately that she cannot be with him anymore, that should have been her baby even though she says she doesn't want kids, it just completely destroys her.This story starts off with Mia in New York, where Jensen lives, working for the same place Jensen often works. So of course they get thrown together on an assignment. And what does Mia try to do every time? Run. That is what she always does. If things are uncomfortable, if she has to deal with emotions or anything, she runs. She tries to just stay in her safe, controlled little bubble. The problem is that doesn't work. She still loves Jensen even though she won't admit it. And his daughter? Well she doesn't even want to think about her. She is Jensen's with some other woman! Mia is ridiculous, but she is kind of pitiful at the same time. So much so that it is hard to be annoyed with her. I was reading and just thought normally this would be so irritating, but she is so sad I can't be annoyed with her.Through it all Jensen keeps trying to win Mia over. He has never moved on from her. She has always been the one for him, and now that she in in New York for a few months he thinks this is his chance. He writes a column for the newspaper and she is in it a lot (even if she doesn't realize it). It is a long and bumpy road to get Mia to realize that a) she can take a chance with Jensen again and b) what her dreams were might not be her dreams anymore. That maybe she needs to make big changes to get what she really wants. She just seems to put her head in the sand and not know what is actually happening, but I really enjoyed this story. She is so afraid, but she learns to not be so much by the end. It was painful at times, heartbreaking for poor Jensen who kept throwing himself out there, but you do get the happily ever after eventually. Really a great read.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R342JBBH0FJ4BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014YLQX74#wasThisHelpful","R342JBBH0FJ4BM","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gah - Mia Sheridan really knows how to make you feel the feels. While Greyson's Vow was not as devastating as some of her books (I'm looking at you Kyland) that doesn't mean it wasn't just as amazing. Really I started reading it and loving it, but thought good this is not going to make me an emotional mess before I have to go out and meet my friends. Only by the end it did. I teared up because it was just so beautiful! Oh Mia Sheridan, you get me to feel all the feels for these amazing characters!Kira and Greyson - there are not two people more perfect for each other. I loved them both, loved watching them grow closer and work through things and be better people because they know the other. I just loved them so much! They both get the other person and phew were they hot together!Kira is one of the sweetest, kindest, nicest people. She has such a huge heart that she shares with those who need it. She is always giving, always trying to make things just a little bit better for those who don't have much. She is this ray of sunshine that you can't help but love. Man the things she does to help others, the things she does for those she cares about...absolutely amazing. Yes she has crazy ideas, and they don't always work out the way she planned, but she was so much fun. She has this youthful exuberance that just makes you happy. She has not always had it easy, she has a lot that has happened to her that would have crushed others spirits until they were nothing, but she just picks herself back up, dusts herself off and gets on with it.Greyson has not had the easiest of lives either. Always reminded by his dad and stepmom how he is not wanted, how much they hate him, it was rough. When you learn everything that happened, man I could  just cry for the child he was. He does get in some trouble with the law and ends up doing time. Now the people in his town don't know him, don't want to know him, as he is an ex con. They are so judgemental it is terrible. He really is a good man, but he has a lot of hurt inside. Since he got out he has not really been living, not until his little witch comes into his life.When Kira comes to him with her business proposition to help him save his winery and her to get out from under her fathers thumb it was fun. Greyson makes a lot of assumptions about who Kira is and what she is like. He thinks she is a spoiled little princess and really doesn't want much to do with her, but he is out of options. It was so much fun. I was just waiting for when Greyson would realize that he was being a huge judgemental jerk. I loved it.The best thing about the story is it is kind of fairy tale-ish, but the scaly dragon who breathes fire falls in love with his little witch. I loved that. I loved the imagery and just everything about it. How it started off as a negative, but soon turned into terms on endearment. Really a great read. There are issues and things to overcome, things to work on, to get to the happily every after but it was just beautiful. It was so sweet. It was just a wonderful read. Kira and Greyson are perfect together. It just took them some time to figure that out.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13THVY9SVPTSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155Q0LWA#wasThisHelpful","R13THVY9SVPTSH","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Note: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*Overall I really enjoyed The Madmen's City. It was a fun noir style book. It is like a dark super hero, Batman type story. I can just see Towton as a similar city to Gotham. I loved that aspect of it.Towton is a dark, gritty, corrupt city. There are two different families ruling different parts of the city. They have their hands in everyones pockets. The cops are corrupt and the ruling families can get away with anything. There are few people who are actively working to try and keep the city safe. Gwen is learning from her father, the vigilante known as Phantom. Phantom also works with Ethos, the other masked vigilante. While Phantom catches the bad guys and turns them over to the cops (only to have them be set free again usually), Phantom kills the bad guys and doesn't think twice about it. After all why capture them to have them be set loose to kill more innocent people? I understand why he does what he does and in his place I might do the same.Everything is going great, Phantom and Ethos sharing patrolling the city. Only one night Phantom gets arrested for murder, a murder Ethos committed. Someone is setting up Phanton and Gwen is determined to figure out who and save her dad.When I started writing this up I re-read the synopsis and thought Gwen is 17? Really? She seems much younger. While reading I kept thinking she should be annoying me, but she was written in a way that was fun instead of annoying. She seems really young and not the smartest person. Well it is that she really just rushes head long into situations without thinking about them too much. She doesn't have a lot of patients and she sees everything in very black and white. She really just acted like a kid who would be upset if she didn't get her own way. Also some of her thought processes I didn't quite get. She doesn't like Ethos/Silas because he kills people. She says at one time that she would never ever kill anyone (so then I kept waiting for that to happen. It was near the beginning of the book that she said that so it was just like yep, that will happen eventually), but she is on board with the death penalty. Apparently she can't kill anyone, but the cops can. I just seemed odd to me especially since a lot of the cops are corrupt so...Anyways in order for Gwen to figure out who is setting up her dad and save him from jail she has to work with Silas. Silas who was so sweet, who obviously likes Gwen, but who would be hurt by her mean words she would spew without thinking. Sometimes I thought I don't even know why he likes her, but I liked him. I got him. He was out doing something and he is good at it. Yes he kills people, but only bad people.He does what he has to to try and keep his city safe. Reading him was heartbreaking at times. Gwen is so mean, cuts him so deep, and she doesn't even realize it. There are also some friends and family to deal with, some good, some bad, and it was just a lot of fun to read.So why is it not rated higher? Well it was a good four plus stars most of the way through until the end. I was reading and thought oh, this must be the first book in what will be a series. I only have a few minutes left and there is no way to wrap everything up in that time. Only that is what the author does. The story gets wrapped up all well, there we go everything is sunshine and rainbows now. It didn't make sense. It didn't work. There is no way what happened in two pages stopped all the badness from happening anymore and made everything great. Also Gwen suddenly likes Silas and that felt like it came out of left field. I didn't see her actually coming around to him that much until the rush at the end to fit it in. So I was loving the story, but the end was way too rushed. Still a good read, but know that the end is a bit rushed.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OCKBULK1236K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0N57QK#wasThisHelpful","R3OCKBULK1236K","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 starsI am so glad Aurora Rose Reynolds started writing these Until series spin off books. I love the original books and it is so much fun getting to see those characters again and seeing them as parents watching their children find their boom. I just love it. And all of the kids are just as amazing as their parents so...I just love the Mayson clan!Until Jax is the story of Cash and Lilly's son Jax. He always heard about the boom - when you see the one for you you just instantly know it. All the kids kind of think it is an old wives tale, but Jax has always kind of wanted it to happen to him. After all he sees how all of the parents are together and he wants that. He wants that one person that he can love and care about with his whole heart. He is a sweetheart.Ellie did not even know what she was getting into when she meets Jax and the Mayson clan. She was just pulled from a horrible situation (if you have read Until July you know a little bit about that) and she has never really had that family that she wants. She has her daughter, Hope, but the rest of her family, at least those who cared about her, are gone. She is not used to trusting people and counting on them for things as she has always had to try and survive by herself. She has always had to provide for Hope by herself. When things go down and Jax knows Ellie is his boom he does whatever he can to move Ellie and Hope to his town. They can even stay with him while she looks for a place to stay. Not that he is going to let them leave...When Jax finds out Ellie has a daughter at first he is shocked, but it doesn't really matter to him. Ellie is who he wants and he will love her daughter as well. When he meets Hope he instantly falls for her as well. Hope is so dang cute! She wraps Jax around her little finger and gets away with everything. It was so sweet.Hope is so adorable! Watching Jax take to her and be this amazing father was so much fun. You can just see how much he cares about both of these ladies and I loved it.Ellie doesn't know how to trust people and she fears if she lets Jax in he will leave and then she will have to try and survive by herself again. She tries not to get her hopes up as everything has been taken away from her in the past, but how can she resist Jax especially when he is so adamant that this is going to happen. That they are going to get to know each other and date and live happily ever after. She still has a hard time really opening up especially when his past keeps trying to ruin things. She is very insecure, but Jax will do whatever he can to reassure her and keep her and Hope safe. He does push her, but she needs it. You can see how much he cares about her and doesn't want her fears to ruin what they have.Ellie, Jax and Hope just make such a cute family. I love that he is just as alpha male as his dad and uncles. I also love that they have such similar situations, but at the same time they are very different. He can relate a lot to what she has gone through and her situation and everything just clicked. It was like these two are meant to be! And Lilly is such a sweetheart with Ellie. I love that Ellie gets this whole other family, the family she has always wanted. These two are just so perfect for each other. They don't always have it easy with Ellie's insecurities and unresolved past, but together they can get through it. If you enjoyed the Until series then you will not want to miss this book. Such a great read.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDFE2B65YDBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015EPMZ0I#wasThisHelpful","R1JDFE2B65YDBZ","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow The Air He Breathes was just an incredible read. It is one of those books that just broke me down, but then put me back together in a much better way. One of those books where I care so much for the characters that I feel everything. It has been a long time since I have had a book affect me as much as this one and it was amazing.Elizabeth and Tristan have both suffered loses that neither has really dealt with yet. They are both so broken it is heartbreaking. While Tristan has been pushing everyone away, acting like a super jerk to keep people from getting close, Elizabeth just doesn't have that option. She has her daughter Emma to worry about. She doesn't want to become her mother and force Emma to take care of her. She has to keep it together, at least somewhat, so she will be there for her daughter.Tristan is the town jerk. Everyone thinks he is this horrible human being, maybe on the run from the law or something, and you should watch out. He will get you. Only he really isn't. Elizabeth can see him. She can see that he is hurting just as much as she is. She can see that he is really a kind person behind that gruff facade. She can see what he is hiding because she is doing the same. Ah these two just killed me!""He was hard to look at, because he was so broken, but every scarred part of his existence seemed to draw me in.""Elizabeth is such a kind and caring soul. She is having a hard time, but somehow things aren't quite so bad with Tristan around. Even though he doesn't want to be her friend, she knows they need each other. They can help each other try and remember their loses. This book....seriously it made me feel all the feels. There were many times I teared up for these characters. There were times when I was so devastated as I just couldn't see how this wouldn't end in heartbreak for the both of them, they are both just so broken, but it was so beautiful at the same time. Tristan's chapters were particularly hard to read, but particularly beautiful. There was just so much pain in there, but it was beautiful.Elizabeth and Tristan slowly start to become friends and open up to each other. They are heartbreaking to watch, but so wonderful together. And Tristan with Emma? Oh, my heart almost couldn't take how incredibly sweet he is. I am not really a kid person, but Tick and Tock? Oh, my heart was so full watching them together. Tristan really has this incredibly big heart. Once he lets Elizabeth in he is just the sweetest. His kindness to others, people others don't even notice, is incredible. He is a truly a remarkable person touched by lose. I cannot get over how much I loved these characters.Through the book everyone kept warning Elizabeth about Tristan. How she should stay away, how he is bad new, etc. Oh, these townspeople made me angry. I cared so much for these characters that whenever someone would say something bad about one of them I would just get angry. I was very defensive and had to put the book aside a few times and just get my angry rant out so I could go on. It was all very realistic in how the close-minded small town people were. I couldn't live there that is for sure. And the worst offender for me? Faye, Elizabeth's bff. She does provide some comic relief, but I couldn't forgive her for not standing by her friend. For not trusting that her friend knows what she is doing. For not trying to see past the awful rumors that have no basis in fact.This book was just an incredible read. There were times when things were revealed, or something would happen, that would just rip my heart out. There were times when I was just so full of love I was overwhelmed. Times when I was completely devastated, and times that were so hopeful and happy. This book about losing and learning to love again, about the painful process of moving on and letting love in, was simply beautiful. Tristan was so wonderful, such a great person, and even when he ran, when he tried to push Elizabeth away, he never really got far. It was hard at times to see how these two broken people would ever be whole again, but gah! I really loved this story. It made me feel all the feels. I finished reading and just couldn't get the story out of my head. Even now, a few days after finishing, I am still wrapped up in it. Amazing. Beautiful. Just such an incredible story. Definitely give this book a read.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ8ITF91NADYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015L78KRQ#wasThisHelpful","RQ8ITF91NADYK","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Snapped was another great Tracer series read. I just love these. I love reading how everyone goes about trying to solve the crimes. Even though some of the characters in this story annoyed the bejeezus out of me I still loved reading it.Snapped is the story of Sophie and Jonah. At the end of the last book Sophie had been kidnapped by the killer and was rescued just in the nick of time by Jonah and the cops. There was something between the two of them even then, but with that incident Jonah didn't want to overstep and try to start something when she is still healing.When this story opens Sophie is on her way to the local university to sign up for some classes. She wants to try and get a promotion at work so she is trying to take classes to help her career. Only she never makes it to registration as a gunman opens fire. Three people were killed, multiple injured before the gunman killed himself. Sophie was there watching as a pregnant lady died across from her. So not the best time for Sophie. Just trying to get over her abduction and now this.Jonah is one of the cops that responds to the school shooting and when he sees Sophie there he is worried about her. He likes her, he just might not admit how much even to himself. Now that she is a witness to the shooting he really should stay away. Only he can't.Sophie was annoying in this story. She treated all men like they only want one thing from her - sex. She also keeps trying to throw herself at Jonah and have sex with him as a way to like repay him for stuff. She is all kinds of messed up in the head, but she frustrated me to no end. I just wanted to be like can't you see how amazing Jonah is? He is so nice to you and obviously doesn't just want a one night stand. You keep trying to use sex with him, and he doesn't take you up on it and you still think the only thing he wants is sex. Argh she was frustrating at times. She has a lot going on and when she remembers seeing something that prevents the police from wrapping up this shooting in a nice little bow she gets in even more trouble. Someone is after here and she doesn't make the smartest decisions. You would think almost getting yourself killed multiple times would make you more cautious, but apparently not with her. She is set against doing what Jonah wants her to do to keep herself safe because...well because she just is.Jonah gets frustrated with Sophie just like I did. He would get so angry with her and I loved it. Even though he would be furious and was trying to stay away from her romantically since she is a witness and needs protection, he can't help but want to be with her at the same time. His self control is really tested and it was fun to read. He was really a great guy and always trying to do the right thing by Sophie. I loved him.Through all of that I loved reading about how the cops tried to solve the case. How they try and unravel everything to make the picture complete. I love that stuff. So even though Sophie could really frustrate me, I still loved reading this story. They are so much fun! And intense and sweet and just really great read. I cannot wait to read the next one now.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CZQ3Y5XB4TBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IK9CCA#wasThisHelpful","R1CZQ3Y5XB4TBY","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 starsI loved Love, Tussles, and Takedowns. Hudson and Lia are amazing together. Where they both end up by the end of the book is just perfect. Such a great read.Lia is this strong, tough, girl. She is the bouncer for the local bar, she is an antique arms authenticator, she does kickboxing and martial arts, she is just amazing. She is small, but man you do not want to mess with her. Loved her.Hudson is trying to figure out his new life outside the military. He was forced to retire when he was injured before he was ready. Now he is working on films helping with the fight scenes and weapons expert. He has a bit of PTSD and just not really dealing with what happened to him well. He is just kind of existing until he sees Lia at a friends wedding. When he runs into her again at an antique arms convention he is intrigued.One of my favorite things about this book is how much Hudson loves Lia for her strength. How he admired her for her skills and knowledge of things. How he is just in awe of her as a person. He spars with her, they fight, and he doesn't always win. He loves that and I love that about him. I love how he can appreciate someone who is so strong and able. She has some issues to deal with herself, but he is so sweet with her. He helps her work through some things that she didn't even know she wanted or needed. He helps clear some things up for her and he is just amazing with her.Hudson has some injuries that made it so he could no longer be in the military. He has some things to deal with regarding that last mission that injured him. He carries a lot around with him and Lia is the perfect person to share some of that weight. She helps him in more ways than he could have imagined. They didn't think there could ever be anything long term between them since he works on movie sets and is stationed all over all the time, but man I am so glad they figure it all out in the end.""Hudson, anything with you and the word 'home' in it sounds better than perfect to me.""And it makes me wonder if what Lia and her brother came up with to help Hudson and people like him - do these places actually exist? Is what she did something returning soldiers have access to? This book made me want to look into more what resources there are for injured returning soldiers. Really amazing.Oh there is one other thing. I have absolutely no idea how Lia puts up with her brothers. There is protective, there is over protective, then there are her brothers. She wears a watch that signals them of her mood every second of the day with alarms if she seems upset. Really? Why would you ever wear that? I would not have been able to handle that. That is way too overprotective for me. And too invasive. I can see with her past she might have had some issues, but man. That was a bit much, but she doesn't seem to think so. And Hudson deals with it too. It was just like woah, I would not be able to handle that. I would be getting them to back off. I know they do it because they care, but it was way over the top for me. But if they don't mind then I guess I shouldn't either.Overall another great read. I love how the author writes and handles every situation. I love the characters and the town and I just am always left wanting more. Amazing.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IXA04SWE4KN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3698M2#wasThisHelpful","R1IXA04SWE4KN0","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Redemption is the final chapter in the Alexa Montgomery series and I must say it was a bit of a let down for me. I don't understand why some things didn't happen while others did. It really made no sense to me at times, and the ending just annoyed me. Some spoilers ahead so if you don't want to know how this all goes down in the end don't continue reading!!This final chapter starts out with Nelly and Alexa both in the safe haven for anyone who doesn't want to do harm to others. Only the people there find out what Nelly really is and so then they don't trust her anymore. It almost caused a riot, which would have destroyed the protection on the town. I get the mistrust at first, and understand things are a little tense for Alexa since not everyone is happy with her sister. However Nelly can take care of herself. Alexa still sees her as the weak little sister she has to look after when really she can hold her own. I don't know why Nelly never speaks up and lets Alexa know just how powerful she is. Alexa is making plans to kill the king, but she doesn't want Nelly to be anywhere near there. She wouldn't be able handle it is Nelly died. Okay, fine, but why does she have to be in the middle of the fighting? Her mind control thing works at a distance so why can she not just come along and hide outside, but still help out? Apparently no one thinks about this so...Nelly gets sent into hiding. Alexa tricks her into thinking she will come back before she goes to kill the king, and it just didn't make total sense to me. Alexa started acting really not like herself in this book. I know she has been conditioned to always keep Nelly safe, but can't she see she could be useful? Think of all the people she could save in the battle. Argh it didn't make any sense to me some of the irrational things Alexa did and how everyone else who knew just went along with them.There is also this sorceress who comes to try and kill Nelly and Alexa for killing her brother. Only they didn't, the kind did. I am not sure why she was added to the story. She didn't really do anything, she wasn't an ally. She just came, realized her mistake, said she would kill the king, then nothing happened with her after that. Such a let down. I'm not really sure why her storyline was added since it didn't really add anything to the story.So with Nelly hidden away safe and sound Alexa and everyone else who wants to help go to kill the king. Nelly wants to get out and help with the battle, but she is stuck where she is. She is finally shown what would happen if both she and Alexa were to live so you get the entire battle scenes, everything that happens with both sisters, then jolted back to oh that was just a vision. So then you get to see it all again. Slightly different, but not enough to warrant reading it twice in a row. I didn't quite understand why it was written that way. I would have much preferred to only read the battle once unless it was completely different the second time around.So again I don't know why Nelly wasn't included in the plans to begin with. She shows up and just controls everyone to stop fighting. She could have saved so many people if she were there. Yes, Alexa is worried about her because of the prophecy, but she doesn't have to be right in the thick of it. There was no reason for Alexa and Kayden to die. They didn't need to in this situation. I don't mind so much that they did, but how it all went down. If they needed to die fine, have them die, but do it in a way that there was no other option. Do it in a way that makes sense. In a way that shows it was inevitable. As it was I just didn't understand why Nelly wasn't there. She was so strong and powerful in the last book and I loved that. It was just wasted in this one. All of those people didn't have to die. I guess the whole thing, how Alexa made her decisions and everything, just didn't feel true to character for her so I didn't like it. I know she would try to keep Nelly safe, but as it was written I didn't feel she was acting like she actually would have. Or the other characters would have tried to make her see more clearly or something. Maybe I am just disappointed in Nelly since I loved her in the last book. Maybe some slight changes would have made it better, but still have the same outcome. I don't know. I might be the only one who feels this way though as a lot of people seemed to love this last book.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T1XPW852OBEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARFNR9E#wasThisHelpful","R3T1XPW852OBEB","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rise is the third book in the Alexa Montgomery series. So far there have been some ups and downs for me, but overall I am enjoying it. This continues right where the second one left off and woah no one should mess with Alexa or her sister!Really this book is more about the sister and her dark side than Alexa. Alexa saved her mom at the end of the last book only to have her become very angry that they left Nelly alone! Alexa's only job is to look after her sister! And on and on the mom went. Man I did not like her. So they have to rush back to Two Rivers and hope they are not too late.Nelly was taken to see the King at the end of the last book and man was she amazing in the beginning of this one. I loved that she has the dark side as well and watching her go a little crazy and seeing just what she is capable of. I loved her even if she is not completely good at the moment. I loved that she is so strong and powerful. Her mind control abilities are awesome! She just gets angry and man when she gets angry it is not good. Really I think she is more of a threat than Alexa is as she would be able to do more damage to more people more quickly. I wouldn't want to mess with Nelly.Throughout this book Alexa fights to try and save her sister from herself, but she doesn't know what to do. They go to another safe haven, some place that is full of lots of mythical creatures not just vampires and werewolves. It was fun and they have a chance to try and figure out a plan to save Nelly. I liked getting a glimpse into rest of this world where there are other mythical creatures. They just stay out of the werewolf/vampire politics which is why we haven't seen them before now. Very interesting.Everything leads up to the big ending. Will Alexa be able to save her sister, or will she have to figure out how to go on without her help? It was a pretty great read. I cannot wait to see what happens next.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17S6SJEX96VCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GBDMHW#wasThisHelpful","R17S6SJEX96VCC","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Half Black Soul seemed like a completely different book from the first one. Alexa is completely different in this one, in a good way. She is not as annoying, stronger, more grown up, but it doesn't make sense since there is not a time gap between book one and two. Still because it was such a change for the better I didn't mind.Alexa in Half Black Soul was not as annoying as she was in the first one. It is like she was more grown up, more accepting of her responsibilities, but yet still vulnerable and still thinking she is a monster. She talks more with her monster self, she hates when she lets it out and bad things happen. She killed a guy who wasn't a good person, but that still hurts her. She feels terrible about the things she does when she lets the monster take charge. Good thing for Kayden who helps ground her. He can take some of her pain and suffering and help her feel better. He can also tame her monster side.This book also starts the multiple point of views. In the first book we just got Alexa's viewpoint, but this one we have some chapters from her and some from Nelly. Really you needed it since Alexa left Nelly in Two Rivers to go try and save their mom. Without Nelly's point of view you would miss out on a lot of the story. And there are some twists in this one, some things I was not expecting! Can't wait to read more and see what happens!Alexa and Kayden grow closer in this chapter of the story. They both set out to try and save Alexa's mother and they can't help but be drawn to each other. They are perfect together, they help each other so much and would do anything for each other. I will say Alexa being all I love Kayden then remembering that she has a boyfriend back in town was a bit...I wish she would have been like I need to break up with Jacks when I get back as obviously I should be with Kayden, but she wasn't. Because really you know that nothing will work with Jacks. Besides the fact that you obviously love Kayden romantically, you need him. That would never work with Jacks as your boyfriend. Just cut him loose already! Hopefully that happens soon after she returns in the next book.While Alexa and Kayden are out trying to save her mom, Nelly is still in Two Rivers. She is starting to figure out that things aren't what they seem. She is starting to realize that maybe she should practice her skills and try to be better with the whole mind control/reading people's mind thing. She starts to see what Alexa saw in the first book and realize that she should have listened to her all along. It ends in a bit of a cliffhanger so I can't wait to see what happens next.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30X66S0GFDV7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073GX70O#wasThisHelpful","R30X66S0GFDV7C","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsOh Blood Warrior. I have had the Alexa Montgomery series on my Kindle for awhile waiting to read, but I held off. Why? Well I am just not much for paranormal romances usually. Sometimes they are great, but usually I just find the story to be eh. Blood Warrior was better than most, but wasn't my favorite read ever. It still made me want to read the next book though to see what happens so that is good.This story was not what I expected. Alexa has grown up kind of normal. She runs to and from school everyday with her sister, no matter how far they live from school, trains in the evenings with her mom, and doesn't really fit in with other people. Other than that she has a normal-ish life. Until everything changes and she is forced to leave her home, keep her sister Nelly safe and find answers to all the questions she now has. She is thrown into this world she really knows nothing about. She has this fire within her that if she is not careful will take over and make her do things she doesn't really want to do. Between battling that, keeping Nelly safe, and trying to figure out what is going on in this new world and how she can help she has a lot on her mind.When Alexa and her family are attacked one night by vampires she runs away with her sister Nelly and her best friend Jacks. Suddenly she finds out she is a warrior, her sister part vampire, her best friend a werewolf, and they are on the run. They find what looks like a safe haven in Two Rivers, but things don't appear to be what they seem. As Alexa tries to figure everything out she also gets closer to Kayden, a vampire guard in the town they are staying in.For the most part I enjoyed this story. I loved the world that was created. The different types of vampires and beings were pretty interesting. I can't want to read more about it and how everything works. My one issue? The boys. Jacks obviously likes Alexa as more than a friend, as well as like every other guy who talks to her, but she and Kayden have a connection. They both obviously like each other as more than friends, but Alexa is so stupid about the whole thing. She is afraid of their connection so she doesn't make the smartest decisions. **spoiler alert** She chooses to be Jacks girlfriend when he asks just because she does love him. Only she keeps thinking about Kayden. Yeah. I hate that. She is so stupid about the whole Kayden situation! Argh it annoyed me. Really the problem is I didn't believe that she likes Jacks like that at all. I only saw that they were friends, but she liked Kayden as more. She is just like well I like Kayden, but he obviously doesn't like me like that so I guess I will be with Jacks because he does. So when she is with Jacks it just feels like she is stringing him along when she knows she doesn't like him like that which is a really terrible thing to do, especially to a friend. She loves Jacks, but it is obvious it is as a friend and nothing more. That and she doesn't completely trust Jacks so...I understand wanting to be strong and independent and not wanting to need Kayden, but whenever something with him would come up it is like she turned into a two year old. We shall see what happens with that. Off to read the next book!This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JSIWY1GTLJKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LEPOYC#wasThisHelpful","R3JSIWY1GTLJKS","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About Last Night was a fun read. Mia and Quinn were so cute together and I really enjoyed their story.Quinn is an escort. He has been doing this job forever and he enjoys it. I don't know that I have read a book before with a male escort, but it is the kind of thing I would just be eh about. However since this was Belle Aurora I thought I would give it a try and I am so glad I did. Quinn is just a good person. I was surprised by how much I liked him. I was expecting him to be more cocky or something, more like I am all that, but he really wasn't. He just seemed like a normal guy who happens to have sex for money. He seemed like someone I would be friends with which was great. Man some of these scenes where you get to see him at work....They were so hot! I see why he is popular.Mia is an awkward, shy twenty six year old with not much experience in bed. She plans to remedy this by hiring Quinn, her brothers best friend. She was so much fun. I loved how awkward she could be, how shy, but how outgoing and funny at the same time. Some of the things she comes up with and says were just so great. Once she opens up and gets comfortable she is amazing. I loved the back and forth between her and Quinn. I loved how they got to know each other and became friends. It was just really sweet and fun at the same time.Of course there are going to be some issues since Quinn is Mia's brothers best friend. I loved watching it all unfold and play itself out. Quinn and Mia are just so great together. They both are supportive of the other no mater what they do. Mia never judges Quinn for being an escort. She knows what she is getting herself into and it is what it is. I loved her so much. And Quinn? He is just as great. You can tell he really cares for her. They were great together.Even though I did love this story, there were a few minor things I found that I didn't like as much. One was some of the small moments when something would happen didn't feel real. Like in the beginning I didn't get why Quinn was instantly drawn to Mia. It was just a moment, just a few sentences, but it didn't make sense. Or when one of them realized they loved the other. The exact moment it happened didn't feel real to me, but if I just went with it right afterwards everything was good. I am not sure what exactly it was that was off for me, but it just needed tweaking slightly and it would have been like oh sure, of course they love the other or whatever. As I said they were just a few moments, a few sentences that just felt off, but then went right back to amazing. Right after the moment passed it was fun and great again.There was one other thing that was odd to me. You get a chapter later in the book from someone else's point of view (I don't want to spoil anything, but not the last one -that one made sense and worked) and it just...I am not sure why it was included. The author seemed to want to put in another story, but for me up until that point it was just in the background and I didn't really care that much about those characters. I think it would have been better to just have the narrator to just tell Mia the next day what happened or something like that instead of having a chapter from their point of view. It was just confusing to me why it was included since I wasn't that invested in that storyline (I didn't realize I should be as it was just in the background).So those were my two minor issues, but please don't think you shouldn't read this book. You should, you really should. It was amazing. I didn't think I would love the escort aspect, but it was written perfectly. Mia and Quinn were great together and I did really enjoy reading this. So definitely check it out especially if you are a fan of this author.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S4HTZVURYNR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010L8T5RO#wasThisHelpful","R2S4HTZVURYNR9","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perfect Kiss was a nice read. Levi is so sweet and just perfect for Shelby. Another great read by Melanie Shawn.Levi first met Shelby at a friends wedding over a year ago. They danced the night away and shared one amazing kiss, but then she ran and he has not seen or heard from her since. He hasn't been able to stop thinking about her though. He knows that is a little crazy since it was just one kiss, but it was the perfect kiss.Shelby got scared when she shared the perfect kiss with Levi and ran away from what they had. She has now just gotten out of an abusive relationship and is pretty broken. She doesn't even recognize herself anymore and is angry with herself for staying with her ex for so long. She comes to Hope Falls to help her sister take care of her new babies, and to try and find herself again.When Shelby ends up working with Levi at his bar there is obviously still something there. She is still afraid of the connection, and Levi knows there is something that has changed about Shelby in these past months since he saw her. She is not her carefree, fun self anymore. No matter how much he wants to be with her, no matter how hard it is to not try to start something between them again, Levi is determined to giver her time and space to heal. He knows she is not ready for a relationship and he was such a sweetheart! I loved him so much. Shelby thinks at times that she might just want to hook up with him, but he doesn't let her do something she would later regret. He wants more than a one night stand. He was amazing and only looking out for her wellbeing. He was a great friend to Shelby and was just there for her so she can find herself again.By the time you get to the happily ever after it was just perfect. I loved Levi and his patience paid off. Shelby was able to grow and change and find just what she was looking for. A great read. A sweet read. I also loved how the abusive ex situation was handled. Not what I was expecting which was nice. Overall just a great read.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PRW0J3Y0I6XH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNLIPOG#wasThisHelpful","R3PRW0J3Y0I6XH","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Autobiography of a Face was an interesting read. I can't imagine what Lucy went through when she was a child. At first I was enjoying reading the story, but as Lucy got older and the story went on I started enjoying it less and less. Probably because it was more and more about Lucy hating herself which I didn't really connect with through the writing.At age 9 Lucy was diagnosed with cancer. She had to have a surgery to remove part of her jaw followed by two and a half years of chemo and radiation therapy. Man all the medical things, the chemo, everything sounded terrible. I know I have watched shows where people have cancer and things like that, but none of them describe chemo the way Lucy did. It is like they all try to put on a brave face, where this book tells it like it is. It must be so hard to watch someone go through something like that, or to be the one who is in that situation. Really I felt bad for her. She is so young and has to go through so much. That and her family doesn't seem to be very supportive. After her first chemo appointment the mom is disappointed in Lucy for crying. I was just like geez, this family needs to get it together. If there is anyone that could use a supportive hug, or really just support, it is Lucy. It almost seems like from Lucy's point of view her family was upset with her for being sick. I just can't imagine going through something like this at this age and not having the loving support of my parents. That would make it so much worse and sure doesn't help with the emotional scars this leaves Lucy with.""I felt my mother was disappointed in me. I hadn't gone straight to bed last time - why was I doing it this time?...'I know it's hard, but you can't get depressed by it. Don't give in to it. You were not so bad last time, so make sure that what you're feeling isn't just in your head.'""That is some supportive parenting. It just makes me feel that much more for Lucy and what she went through. Really she says that there were issues at home, but as to what and how bad it was at home I am not sure. We never really get to see that so it is hard to understand why everyone was the way they were, or what exactly she went through at home.I will say the parts with the medical procedures and her time in the hospitals were the best parts of the book. I really felt like I understood and could sympathize with her. Also I had never heard of this pedestal procedure. That sounds kind of terrifying and I don't question her not wanting anything to do with it. Really this book made me think more about what people with cancer and other illnesses go through. I have been lucky in my life so far to not have first hand knowledge of this, but my heart does go out to those who do. It must be incredibly difficult.The rest of the book is more Lucy's struggle with her own self worth and image. She thinks she is ugly and that no one will ever love her. I can imagine that the kids in school were horrible to her, but I never really felt like I got to see that. You get bits and pieces, but it doesn't seem as bad as I imagine it really was. Like it wasn't a cake walk, but I didn't really get all the emotions involved like I had hoped. That was the issue by the end. It starts to get more and more of Lucy just going on about how she is ugly, how her face is hideous, how if she had a perfect face everything would be fine (only it isn't when she is 'normal') and I didn't really connect with the emotions that were told. I didn't really feel what she was feeling and going through when it was just her telling us the emotions. It...like I still did feel for her as I kept imagining what it would have been like. How people would have treated her and such, but the writing itself didn't connect me to it as much as I would have liked.""No matter how philosophical my ideals, I boiled every equation down to these simple terms: was I lovable or was I ugly?""Since a good chunk of the book is her struggling with her self worth and self esteem and since I wasn't as connected to the emotional part as I had hoped it just started to get to be a bit much. Really I kept reading just waiting to get to the end, which was a bit rushed I think. **slight spoilers I suppose** It was like it was trying to have a sort of happy ending, sort of uplifting, but I didn't really buy it. For the entire book you read how Lucy is not happy with her face, then suddenly she kind of is okay with how she looks because she suddenly has a revelation. Sure. As much as I had really hoped that we could see Lucy actually become okay with herself, grow, be happy even, I didn't believe that she ever really was. I wanted her to be able to get to a good place after all that she had been through, but it just was not to be. Then I looked up her to see what happened after the end of the book since it just kind of ends. Unfortunately she died of a heroine overdose at age 39. Very sad, but based on the book and how much she doesn't think she is lovable because of how ugly she is, not that surprising. I had really hoped that something good would have come of all of this, that she had found her peace and happiness, and maybe now she has. A really sad story with a sad ending. I just wish the emotional parts would have engaged me a bit more. Thinking about the story, what happens, even now is so sad. I just wish the writing would have always backed that up for me.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H5IFYHIAABL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H1UEO0#wasThisHelpful","R3H5IFYHIAABL5","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Suddenly One Summer was a fun read. Ford and Victoria were so great together! I love their banter, I love the hate turned to grudging like turned to love story.The story opens with Victoria's house being broken into which sends her into a panic attack and awakens memories she has tried not to think about. Since she no longer feels safe at her place she buys a new one. Only it won't be available until the end of the summer. So she leases a place, coincidentally next to Ford, for the summer.Ford is such a sweet guy. He is fiercely protective of those he cares for and would do anything for them. He brings a girl home the first night that Victoria is staying in her leased place, and when Victoria sees him with some other girl the next day out on the balcony she is sure he is a player (even though he definitely is not). She is positive he not someone she wants anything to do with, so when they meet she is not very nice to him. That starts the amazing banter between them. Victoria thinks he is a jerk, he thinks she rude, it was so much fun.Ford's sister, Nicole, has a child but doesn't know who the father is, but needs to find him to try and get some support. When Victoria, who is a divorce lawyer and used to dealing with custody cases, volunteers her services free of charge things really get good. Ford and Victoria have to work together to try and track down the baby's dad. Their surveillance work was just so much fun! Of course their hate for each other turns into grudging respect which turns into a sex only relationship.Neither Victoria nor Ford want anything serious. Victoria has some panic issues which make her unable to take the subway or be calm in enclosed spaces. She doesn't want anyone to know, she doesn't want to be out of control ever, so she tries to hide it. She really needs to always project this strong, together, tough woman. Ford has his own issues to deal with, but they are perfect for each other. Ford really is the sweetest guy. All the little things show how much he cares. It was a little rough getting to the happy ending since they both have things to work through, but together they can work through it. A great read.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPGD527M7XB4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2BS4O2#wasThisHelpful","RPGD527M7XB4N","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eight Hundred Grapes was a frustrating read for me. The main character, Georgia, acts like a petulant child even though she is thirty years old. Oh she annoyed me. She thought she knew what was best for everyone even when they told her that what she wanted for them is not what they wanted.Georgia returns home about a week before she is supposed to be married there. She found out something about her fiance which sent her running. Now she needs to figure out what she is going to do - get married still or move on. Though really she puts off thinking or even talking about this to mess in everyone else's affairs. Why deal with her problems when she can butt into other peoples?Once she gets home to her families vineyard things aren't as stress free as she thought they would be. Her parents have secrets, her brothers have secrets, really pretty much everyone is doing something Georgia doesn't agree with. She is determined to make everyone do what she wants, regardless of what they say they want. I mean she knows what is best for everyone obviously!""You're just acting like you know the right think for everyone when you don't even know the right thing for yourself.""The biggest issue Georgia finds when she comes home? Her dad is selling the vineyard to their hated competitors. She is not at all happy about that as her dad obviously really doesn't want to do this. No matter how many times he tells her this is what he wants she doesn't believe it. She tries her hardest to get her dad out of the sale. The company buying it must have tricked him or something. She should have been consulted before the sale, even though she made her life far away and wanted nothing to do with the vineyard in years. She was so frustrating! Constantly trying to tell people what they should want/do and not listening to anyone! Then yelling at them/throwing temper tantrums when they don't listen to her. Argh!""Have you ever considered that your desire for us to keep the vineyard has less to do with us and more to do with you?""Her spoiled little brat attitude I couldn't deal with. Her she knows what is best for everyone when she can't even figure out what she wants to do for herself was annoying. I really couldn't stand her. Since she was the main character, the story is told through her, it made the book very frustrating to read. I was reading it and part of the story is will she still get married? I found I really didn't care either way. Get married or don't, but just stop acting like you are two. The end, how everything works out, that was just not very good. Well it was a good thing for most of the characters, but Georgia? It was hard not to roll my eyes. I had thought that the author might be going the way it did, but then I thought no. That can't be right. There is not really any set up for that so it wouldn't make sense to have it end that way, only it does. So it wasn't believable. All this whining temper tantrums leads to a let down of an ending. Not a book for me.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JVZQPGW4RS36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476789258#wasThisHelpful","R1JVZQPGW4RS36","A1TUBKEWD01LLS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TUBKEWD01LLS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the past, I've had a bike light that has a silicon mount that loops around itself, and is just a tiny white light.  That did the trick.

This means that if you want your light to be focused on something that is in a relatively shady area, it is tricky.  I like for the light to be pointing toward my door, but I have a shady front lawn, and there's no way to put distance between the light and the solar panel.That said, it's a great light and very bright.  Even with a shady front lawn, it works - just not when it's totally covered by leaves or whatever.I received a discount/sample in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38PT3QGAZ7GA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011O8OXXG#wasThisHelpful","R38PT3QGAZ7GA4","A2RM5ZSZJQL7WY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RM5ZSZJQL7WY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This scale is awesome.  I started using postal scales about five years ago when I realized that eventually they pay for themselves (rather than just slapping on a ton of postage to make sure I had enough ""just in case"" or wasting time in line at the post office (time=money)).  This particular one is impressive.  It is very accurate (I tested it out on a variety of different pieces of mail, some that had postage on them so I knew what the post office weighed them as, some that I tested against another postal scale that I have).  It's super easy to read.  I love that it folds open for letters to sit on, because frankly that's the one complaint that I have with my other scale - that laying a big envelope flat across it makes it difficult to read the numbers (although that's also not a problem with this scale, since the numbers are separate).It looks good, and works well.I received a discount/sample in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QMPUXHQVICF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016LKCQDG#wasThisHelpful","R1QMPUXHQVICF6","A2RM5ZSZJQL7WY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RM5ZSZJQL7WY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't believe how cheap this is for what you get.  It fits easily on your head, and is bright and comfortable.  My parents started using headlamps in their basement - the light switch is at the top of the stairs, and they have a bed down there, so sometimes they sleep in the basement, and nobody wants to go back to the top of the stairs to turn off the light.

"I am really surprised, in a good way, with this dress.  Given the price point and the other reviews, I thought it would be too small and terrible quality.  I'm a size 8-10, but quite busty, so with the extra large I figured I wouldn't be able to get it on.  It's small for an extra-large, that's true, but it's stretchy enough that shockingly, I was able to wiggle into it.  And it is super flattering, with the silhouette.  The only bad side is that the white on top is almost see-through - I wouldn't wear a dark bra under it, and probably I will try to put a white cami under it, just so I don't have to worry.  The other problem is that I am 100% guaranteed to spill coffee on it, but you can't blame the product for that.I really expected to get a crappy dress that would work for dress-up for my kid and not much else.  Instead, it's a dress that I'll be able to wear to work (probably with a cardigan over it), and that gives my post-partum body an hourglass shape.I received a discount/sample in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHORLX4L77DDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXYRGLW#wasThisHelpful","RHORLX4L77DDV","A2RM5ZSZJQL7WY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RM5ZSZJQL7WY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"About a year ago, I bought a hamper on Amazon that looked just like this set, and was about the same price (well, half as much, but there are two in this set and it was just one).  It was an absolute piece of junk.  I use it, because I bought it, but it was tiny, and quickly got holes in the mesh and the wire pieces got bent.These, on the other hand, for the same price, are AWESOME.  They are the standard size (I am surprised I have to write that, but I guess some of them are tiny), so they hold a lot.  And the side pocket is a cool feature.  Most importantly, the mesh is strong and the wires are strong, and I can tell from the get-go that they will last.  It's nice to get two in the set, and I am very, very happy with them.

"Years ago, I would use my laptop in bed, and have it sitting right on top of my comforter.  This led to overheating to the point that I would sometimes get burns on my legs (like a suntan almost?

My mother-in-law just moved in with us, and we gave her a laptop - and right away she started putting it right on top of the comforter in her bed, which makes me tense up.  This pad is FANTASTIC for calming my nerves and protecting her laptop.  It is lightweight and easy to set up, and the little ""feet"" at the bottom make sure the laptop stays in place.

"I recently received this amazing Therma calm Stress relief Cream. after the first time using it it workde great it could be all in my head though. I mean Maybe t is because I think it should stress relieve me because it says that what it does. Either way I don't care because when I use it I feel the stress just leave so I will continue to use it.  If you have a great product and it really feels like its working then you would want to continue to use it.

This is a product I would highly recommend to anyone who is under stress.
