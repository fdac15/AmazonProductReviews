"This Seagate 2TB external drive is replacing a 500GB Iomega drive I have been using for my Mac.  I do not have USB 3.0, so I cannot evaluate the speed difference, but I can say this drive is extremely quiet compared to the Iomega.  I can't really tell when it's doing a Time Machine backup.One of the key things to note if you are going to be using this on a Mac:You have to reformat the drive, because it comes formatted for Windows.  You can do this with Disk Utility, and reformatting with Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format, which will work for Time Machine.When doing my first backup of about 150GB, the drive did not get hot...only slightly lukewarm.  Things are looking great so far, so I highly recommend getting this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJG3R68363SX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00834SJS0#wasThisHelpful","RJG3R68363SX0","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Compared to his first novel, ""Spycatcher,"" Dunn hones his skills in number two of the series, ""Sentinel.""  The new novel is a full 100 pages thinner, and shows tighter prose than what was on display in the first novel.Also, whereas ""Spycatcher"" had some unbelievable dialogue (or monologue) towards the end, there is a better ending to ""Sentinel"" with more believable events and dialogue.  Because of this, I would be willing to read the third book when it is released.  At the end of the first book, I was a bit skeptical of whether I wanted to read anything further from Matthew Dunn.As a former MI6 agent, Dunn has the necessary knowledge to write a character such as Cochrane, but he does need to polish his writing skills, and appears to be doing just that.  I would recommend reading this if one is interested in spy novels, since the author shows promise of becoming an engaging writer in the genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7FN2E9ZUQZ9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062037927#wasThisHelpful","R7FN2E9ZUQZ9P","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main thing I'd like to do in my review (as so many others have addressed specific details about this particular addition to the series) is to alert prospective readers to the fact that this is the fifth book in a series, so if you think you're interested, it would be best to read them in order, in my opinion.This is the order:Napoleon's Pyramids (2007)The Rosetta Key (2008)The Dakota Cipher (2009)The Barbary Pirates (2010)The Emerald Storm (2012)For a historic adventure series, you really cannot go wrong with the Ethan Gage set.

"Because of the information already included on the Amazon page for this product, it should not be a surprise to anyone that espionage plays a part in this novel, so I will admit without fear of giving spoilers that I have always loved novels related to espionage.  However, I have never read one in which the protagonist was female, and espionage is not really the main story in this novel.In keeping with my desire to not give spoilers, I will refrain from explaining character backgrounds and major plot points, at least with any specificity.Kate, the protagonist, is married to Dexter, and they both have each other fooled, to very different extents, and in very different ways.  They have a commitment to each other that transcends the deceptions, and both have very good reasons for their deceptions, though perhaps not reasons with which everyone will have sympathy.The plot is one with many twists -- a veritable roller-coaster ride -- and takes the reader across various countries and continents, mundane and exotic.  It also jumps back and forth in time enough to cause vertigo.The only serious weak point of the novel, in my opinion, is that the author has the characters' actions mostly occur in their memories, rather than simply showing us all of the action as it occurs.  A great deal of the story, action or back-story, is simply explained in dialogue, which is not ideal, but it is still quite interesting.In my copy, it is stated that this book is ""being developed for major theatrical release by CBS films.""  I think the story lends itself well to a movie version, and possibly will be even stronger as such, but there is little doubt that Pavone is a talented writer (a former editor and ghostwriter), and I expect to see much more of his work.The strongest recommendation I can give for this novel is that if there were a sequel, I would read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XC3T527I11J2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307956350#wasThisHelpful","R1XC3T527I11J2","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"***UPDATE 8/12***SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, I was still getting the same information from Crucial, double checked with Apple, and apparently the two companies do not see eye to eye on what should go into the MacBook specified.  So, I went with Apple's information, and purchased this item, and have been using it for a few months with no problems, so I upgrade the review to five stars, and inform anyone reading this that Crucial has faulty information on their site about what can work in this MacBook.**********************I ordered this item, then a few hours later, looked up the part number on Crucial's website, because when I originally checked Crucial's website for RAM, this part did not show up when using the advisory tool for my new MacBook's specs.When I searched specifically for this part number, the part came up on the site, with an advisory tool to the left of it, asking if I wanted to check to see if this particular part is compatible with my computer.  This is the result:""This part ct2kit51264bc1339 is not compatible.View compatible parts for the MacBook Pro 2.4GHz Intel Core i5 (13-inch DDR3) Late-2011.""Now, I don't know how accurate Crucial's own site information is, because when clicking on the ""view compatible parts"" link, one of the choices was a 16 GB kit (8 GB x 2), and that particular MacBook only takes 8 GB.Anyway, I decided to cancel the order, because while it may work, check out the one-star reviews that mention kernel panics, etc.  Those reviews are not specifically about the MacBook Pro 2.4GHz Intel Core i5 (13-inch DDR3) Late-2011, and it may work for all I know, but I think I'll wait a while to see if Crucial's information looks more reliable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SEZJ4ILSMYZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DZJQQI#wasThisHelpful","R3SEZJ4ILSMYZ1","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Have you ever watched ""Airplane""? If you have, you know what slapstick is, which is similar to the type of humor primarily used in this parody of Sherlock Holmes stories. The stories have absolutely no purpose but to tickle the funny bone with frequent displays of repartee with little or no attention to plot. Hence the last statement of the book, below what appears to be a 19th century illustration:""You call that a plot?""One may also be reminded of Monty Python to a degree, but perhaps not up to the quality standards of Monty Python.I was going to read this after another book I was reading, but decided instead to take a break from the other work. It was funny and relaxing for a change, though I regret it is a self-published book with some lack of editing. This was not severe, but simply noticeable to one that pays attention to detail -- catching the occasional misspelled word, unintentional repetition, or grammar flub. In my opinion, a major publisher could do far worse than taking on this writer's work, and polishing it for mass production.I was a little surprised to come upon a similar title by someone else, Sherlock Holmes and the Zombie Problem, that was released a couple of months before this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IKKAH7UZX78N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906669023#wasThisHelpful","R2IKKAH7UZX78N","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review will take the pros and cons approach:Pros:1. Lightweight2. Locking serrated knife with lanyard hole -- wicked looking blade, stainless steel3. LED flashlight emits bright light for size, removes from knife and has magnet base to attach to metal surface, with pivot to direct light.4. Very loud whistle in base of handle (seems to be an odd thing for a knife)5. Clip to attach to belt or other item.Cons:1. Size is not convenient, mainly because of flashlight attachment -- also the heaviest part, and the part that will surely break eventually.2. Flashlight uses four button cell batteries at a time that are taped together (comes with one replacement)3. Flashlight turns on by unscrewing the head of it -- so not too far, or it falls apart.4. If the flashlight stops working, you will still have the cavity for it attached to the knife.In summary, the flashlight is the weak point of this item, and may have been better as an entirely separate item within the package.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37BPVVS5AWLHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001WC6LS#wasThisHelpful","R37BPVVS5AWLHI","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was on offer from the Vine program almost a year ago, and at the time, even though I am normally interested in books that deal with Russia, I passed on it.  Big mistake.  Since then, the second book in the series was released, Shadow Pass, and I decided to take that one, which got me hooked. I had to go back and read the first book. One does not necessarily have to read this book before ""Shadow Pass,"" but I think it may help a little.If one is drawn to the history of Russia and the Soviet Union, and thinks even the darker components of Russian history have something of a romantic nature, Eastland's novel will please. If one has ever read a Tom Clancy novel -- one of the older ones -- and found oneself at least partially intrigued and respectful of the Soviet characters, that reader is likely to find something of interest here.The main character, Pekkala, is a Finnish man that became the special investigator for the Tsar of Russia (before the Bolshevik revolution), and is known as ""The Emerald Eye,"" a name that comes from a special badge issued to him by the Tsar, a unique disc with the appearance of an eye and an emerald in the center. Stalin was supposedly known by some as the Red Tsar, so the title refers to Pekkala becoming for Stalin what he initially was for Tsar Nicholas II.Pekkala is sent to Siberia for many years, after the revolution, only to be brought out of exile by Stalin to investigate the murders of the Romanovs. Now, this is not strictly historical -- it is fiction -- and it has characters and plot points that do not necessarily reflect actual history.  There is no intention to claim an alternate history. In fact, in the end of the book, there is a section entitled ""What Really Happened to the Romanovs?"" In that section, he gives brief points of items that happened on certain dates, even up to present times regarding discoveries of various Romanov bodies and DNA evidence. Much of this does not match the novel. Just suspend disbelief and move on.That I decided to go back and read this book after reading ""Shadow Pass"" should show there is something attractive about this character, setting, and the writing of Sam Eastland. This author and his Inspector Pekkalashould be priority reading for anyone interested in historic Russia/Soviet Union.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ETVZ4NNT01E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553807811#wasThisHelpful","R3ETVZ4NNT01E7","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a comparatively small volume, which contains some of David Hume's most critical arguments related to religion and god from a ""natural religion"" or ""natural theology"" perspective, but do not allow that to deceive you, potential reader, as it is incredibly dense with thought and meaning, and cannot be read lightly if one expects comprehension.Hume, an 18th century Scottish philosopher, and one of the greatest philosophers ever, is known as an Atheist, though it is difficult to come up with that conclusion from reading these particular materials. Sure, he may have been, but he seemed to avoid any type of label, preferring to ""suspend judgment"" with regard to things that are ultimately unknowable. With that perspective, it would be reasonable to consider him an Atheist, in the sense of not having a belief in a god. It would also mean he was Agnostic, not knowing whether there was a god or not, and reserving judgment on such matters, but that term would not be used for such views until T.H. Huxley.This wonderful book put out by Oxford University Press, edited by J. C. A. Gaskin, contains ""Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion"" and ""The Natural History of Religion."" The first is a dialogue set up in the tradition of Cicero, with three persons arguing from different points of view, and the latter is simply a straightforward treatise on its subject.In addition to an excellent introduction by Gaskin, there are also other minor additions:1. My Own Life -- a brief summary by Hume.2. Section XI of An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, one of his greater philosophical works -- a section related to religion.3. A letter concerning the Dialogues -- from Hume to Gilbert Elliott, requesting input for the dialogue portion of one of the ""believers,"" Cleanthes.This is a fairly good introduction to Hume, at least with regard to his religious and nonreligious thoughts, and I wish more people, both believers and nonbelievers, would challenge themselves with reading such as this, rather than resorting to some of the inane, superficial hype put out by both sides in recent years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14DTEIA0QW9YQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199538328#wasThisHelpful","R14DTEIA0QW9YQ","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing about a book like this: I cannot divulge many details at all, because it would destroy the surprises (such as sex, drugs, and violence), and there are quite a few surprises. I do not feel it appropriate to provide more details of the plot than the blurb from the back of the book, and then I will give my impressions:____________________________________________________________""A murdered woman. A grieving husband. Between them, their mentally handicapped son with a long history of violent outbursts. It's a simple open-and-shut case. Or is it?Leo Hewitt, a former Assistant DA once blamed for setting free a notorious child-killer, is eager to redeem himself with this intimate and grisly crime. He's not convinced that anything is as it appears. As he digs below the surface of visible motives, he discovers more than he ever anticipated-including an emotionally disturbed wife, a husband who'd do anything to escape his disastrous marriage, and an accused young man with no apparent means of defense. But with each shocking new revelation come only more disquieting questions, leading Leo deeper and deeper into the inescapable darkness of blood bonds and twisted family secrets.""____________________________________________________________This is without doubt one of the fastest page-turners I have read, an easy read, and an average reader could complete it within a few hours without interruptions. It is an extremely dark novel with no true heroes or villains comparatively, but shades of gray permeating the entire story. It is not exactly real life, but one could imagine the situations occurring in real life, as long as someone was truly inspired in a dark, surreal way. I think some threads of the storyline could have been tied up a little more neatly, because of implausibility, but it was still a fun experience.The writing starts off so simple, I was thinking ""yes, it is a debut novel,"" and it is, but the simplicity is only a sort of deception to draw the reader in. The language is basic and the chapters are short, especially in the beginning. Some chapters are only half a page, and are frequently followed by a blank page. This actually works to great effect, making the reading light and easy, causing the reader to turn pages faster in anticipation of the next small chunk.It has been optioned by writer/producer/director Nicholas Kazan for a motion picture. The book reads like it was written specifically for that purpose, but I doubt it would do as well as a movie as it should do as a book. I hope Grant Jerkins keeps his focus on writing more books, because he has talent worth watching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YV95XTW3GRIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042523830X#wasThisHelpful","R1YV95XTW3GRIB","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first article in the entire collection, the one that kicks off the best American science and nature writing, is an article from GQ.GQ.Seriously.It is an article devoted entirely to the worship of Elon Musk.I have no intention of offending anyone with this review, but potential readers of this volume should be aware of what they are getting. If this is the ""best American science and nature writing,"" America is in trouble. However, I know for a fact it isn't the best writing of that type, because I read science articles frequently.Since so many other reviewers have done an admirable job of providing a blow- by-blow description of every single article, I will just give a summary of my thoughts. Perhaps the best articles in the entire book are the ones pulled from National Geographic, The New Yorker, and The New York Review of Books, though it is best to be clear on the nature of most of this writing, all of which was written in 2009.The writing of the various articles, as an art form, really is excellent for the most part. However, the nature of the writing is best viewed as stories, frequently biographical, with science or nature themes. This is not the type of science writing I am accustomed to, perhaps with the exception of a few National Geographic articles, but even the NG articles get on my nerves with all of the useless details given in order to tell a story. The other ones, even the ones from The New Yorker, are much more airy with ethereal details that have nothing to do with the science. I'm sure this appeals to many, but when I select a science article to read, my intention is not to read a novel or a short story -- I can do that at other times.Allow me to give another example of the light nature of this book. In the back of the book is a list of the articles that were not selected for this collection. Any article from Scientific American was conspicuously avoided, as well as one from the premier journal, Science. Scientific American may not be what it used to be with regard to the level of science writing, but the long articles were still mostly by scientists in 2009, though that is changing in the end of 2010. There were not many articles selected for this collection that were written by scientists.Dyson even alludes to the fluff nature of this writing in his introduction. Not only that, but for some reason, though he states that people tend to like nature writing more than science writing, and one can almost detect his disappointment, only about the first fourth is science, if one actually counts the GQ piece. Dyson, a climate-change skeptic, selected what he considered to be environmental pieces, including climate change subjects in the last 57% of the book. He divides those into ""Doom and Gloom,"" ""Small Blessings,"" and ""Big Blessings."" It almost appears he is trying to create skepticism of climate-change, as if that were the purpose of the book. While I agree with his assessment of Environmentalism as a new secular religion, I am left wondering why he would have made the majority of the book about exactly that. I have some ideas.Personally, I think if someone is interested in science writing, it is better to start out with a science magazine, preferably above the level of Popular Science. Discover or Scientific American would be good starters, Discover for beginners and Scientific American once Discover is outgrown. Science News is good if you want to keep a light touch on many fields of science. For nature, science, and a smorgasbord of other topics, National Geographic and Smithsonian are great selections. American Scientist may be good once someone is ready to graduate out of Scientific American, normally only for someone with a science degree, or an actual scientist -- many consider it to be what Scientific American used to be many years ago.A book like this may give the impression of selecting the best of what science writing has to offer, since it is selecting from many different sources and being narrowed down, but it is only the best of science light.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VGCEZSB830GU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547327846#wasThisHelpful","R1VGCEZSB830GU","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It can be reattached, but breaks off the wire again.As far as price, I don't know if these are a good value without comparing this type of earbuds against others of the same type, and that is something we have not done. The only ones my wife has used that have the ability to use with a phone are the ones that came with the iPhone 4, and she does not like that one because of the standard Apple large discs that go in the ears.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8JGZB9SGEH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042X8PB2#wasThisHelpful","R8JGZB9SGEH6","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David P. Clark is a microbiologist with educational experience at Cambridge University, Bristol University, Yale University, and University of Illinois. He is a professor of microbiology at Southern Illinois University currently.This book has much good information in it, though there are no references for any of it. I believe the reason for this is because it is intended for a lay audience, but I have read other books intended as such with copious references. I think most of the information is fairly accurate, though his mention of Al Capone dying in jail was not accurate -- he died on his estate -- but that is not Clark's area of expertise.There are copious helpings of speculation, but that is to be expected in science . . . one of the driving forces of experimentation. Clark adds humor to the depressing subject, and that may offend some, but I enjoyed his sense of humor. We must laugh at ourselves and our situations, or we become miserable.The one thing about the book that causes me to give an average rating is exhausting repetitiveness, as though one were reading a series of microbiology lectures that had much overlap in subject matter, all cobbled together to form one volume, with no editing to make it appear as though the book were written with the intention of writing a naturally flowing narrative (or perhaps the writer and editors are senile). It would be speculation to say whether the fault was more that of the author or the publisher, but this is the second book I have read recently published by FT Press, and I intend to read no more of their books. They must not have editors.This book has many high points that are enjoyable, it did not kill me to put up with the back to back unedited microbiology lectures, and it has made me stronger in the will to avoid FT Press.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GA4PBCB4W4XL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0137019963#wasThisHelpful","R2GA4PBCB4W4XL","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My impression of the writing of this book is that it is an impressive debut novel by a promising writer. It was not engrossing, and was not a page-turner, in my opinion, but it was descriptive enough to bring dimension to the characters and at least give the potential for the reader to care what happens to the characters. Something does happen to one of the characters that caused me to be disappointed, so Col Buchanan did his job pretty well.One point that I have mixed feelings about is the way he takes so obviously from religions on Earth (though this setting is not Earth, at least not with two moons), hardly disguising the names, such as ""Dao"" or ""true prophet Zabrihm."" Even the religion of ""Mann"" is a thinly disguised suggestion of ""Man"" worshipping itself, with mention of ""the divine flesh,"" as opposed to the religions that have a more selfless focus. I understand the need for this if the purpose is to provide social commentary, such as Star Trek.The map within is reminiscent of the Mediterranean Sea region, in more ways than simply shape. Even the locations of some of the peoples mirror the Mediterranean region today, with the ""Alhazii"" (Arab) region to the east, or the evil empire (Greece or Rome) to the north.Buchanan's writing has its rough spots and cliches, and he does some things in his writing that writers are really not supposed to do. Too many adverbs and too many spots where he substitutes other creative words in place of ""said."" However, he has obvious talent, and judging by the quality of the first book in the series, I am going to keep an eye out for the next one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OS7RPBV1PQQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765331055#wasThisHelpful","R1OS7RPBV1PQQO","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As for the book, ""Adam Bede,"" there is perhaps little to review, after > 150 years, but I will also focus on Kindle issues I have noticed.As far as the novel, this was the first real novel written by Mary Ann Evans, as ""George Eliot."" At ~600 pages in print form, it promotes the feeling that the author has all the time and room in the world to explore and expand on any idea or character at her whim. The reader can truly get lost in a world built by George Eliot, and feel as though one knows the characters intimately.I will not give any spoilers, but it is essentially a novel exploring provincial life at the end of the 18th century. The main character is not the most colorful of the characters, being the one that is the most stable, while a few characters surrounding him, especially one he is in love with through most of the novel, serve to make the novel more interesting through controversial actions.As far as the Kindle issues, this particular file seems to be the best ""Adam Bede"" as far as the free classics go, though there are formatting errors and misspellings (I checked against the online version on Princeton University's site).

(The screen is larger vertically, also, but the 24"" has more aluminum below the screen.) I have to say, there is more computer screen real estate on this beauty than anyone would likely ever need, but if you're game for overkill, order one of these.Some noticeable improvements over previous versions: Twice the previous RAM (now 4GB standard), 1 Terabyte HD, SD card slot below the optical drive slot on the right side, wireless keyboard and mouse (one may see this as an improvement -- or not), the mouse is upgraded to the Magic Mouse with no ball/wheel, but works partially like a mouse, and partially like a laptop track-pad.

"The title quote is from novelist Gustave Flaubert, advising a friend who was wondering how to approach Montaigne (pp 10-11).Allow me to put your mind at rest about one thing first: This is not a self-help book. I know ""How to Live"" sounds like something in that category, but be assured that this book is of a much better quality and nature, ascholarly work on Michel Eyquem de Montaigne (1533-1592), French essayist and philosopher.Essayist? Yes...he is the one that coined the word, from French ""essai,"" meaning test, try, attempt, etc. Philosopher? He was an excellent observer of himself and his surroundings, from the very simple to the absurdly complex, and wrote what we know as the ""Essays,"" his life's work.Sarah Bakewell has performed a wonderful service in putting together some chapters which may be described as essays of her own. The book is really a history of the life of Montaigne and the life of his written work. The impression one gets of the man and his work is that there were inconsistencies, contradictions, rambling, self-centeredness, possibly false modesty, and scores of other possible criticisms. Yet, there is a tremendous amount of wisdom in his thoughts, statements, and observations. It is impossible to really give an example of his wisdom that would appeal to everyone at every stage of life, but it is likely that anything he said would hit a chord with anyone at some point, if they are thoughtful.One of the beautiful aspects of his personality, in my opinion, was his realization of what humans share with other animals, the idea that we are part of the same family. Almost everyone over 450 years ago in his milieuwould have assumed that humans were completely set apart from the animal kingdom or nature in general. Humans were to be thought of as divinely appointed to rule and judge over nature, not be part of nature.Montaigne saw through this. Descartes later had a problem with Montaigne's view. Descartes saw animals as automatons without thought or feeling.""When I play with my cat, who knows if I am not a pastime to her more than she is to me? We entertain each other with reciprocal monkey tricks. If I have my time to begin or to refuse, so has she hers."" -- MontaigneHe had an entire section that dealt with stories of animals performing acts of sacrifice, bravery, altruism, and other forms of goodness thought only in the realm of humanity. Modern science has confirmed that good and evil are not only human traits again and again, so Montaigne was onto something, and well ahead of his time.My first introduction to him was in regard to his skepticism, but he had some devotion to various ancient philosophies, such as Stoicism, Epicureanism, as well as Skepticism. He was also supposedly a good Catholic, but if one takes much of what he wrote into account, it seems unlikely that he was a ""true believer"" in any sense. He also tried to play himself off in his writings as slow of intellect, with major memory problems, though he did not come off that way to people that knew him.  There is every sign of unparalleled shrewdness.Perhaps a few quotes regarding his religious thoughts may be of help:""How many things served us yesterday for articles of faith, which today are fables to us?""""Philosophy is doubt.""""To know much is often the cause of doubting more.""""Nothing is so firmly believed as what we least know.""""Man is certainly stark mad. He cannot make a flea, and yet he will be making gods by the dozen.""""It is setting a high value upon our opinions to roast men and women alive on account of them.""""Men of simple understanding, little inquisitive and little instructed, make good Christians.""During the time in which Montaigne lived, though, skepticism was an important part of Catholic faith, the focus being on us not knowing how so many things work, so faith becomes so much more important. Those views gradually changed, presumably as the skepticism focused more on the faith itself.This book is worth five stars, not least for the desire it has created in me to read and study the ""Essays"" of Montaigne, but also for learning much of his personal life, habits, and views.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A2JYVUZLO7BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590514254#wasThisHelpful","R3A2JYVUZLO7BQ","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This item is exceptional as a alarm clock-ipod player, but would be better if not for a few things. There are several reasons I would say it is overpriced. In my opinion, the sound is not good enough to merit the price. The EXB function increases the bass quality, and you pretty much need to have it on from the beginning, because nothing will sound decent without it. The functionality is lacking, as well.An iPod or iPhone can be placed on the dock to charge, but there is also an auxiliary line in the back in case you do not wish to charge your iPod/iPhone every time you have it hooked up to the iP28 to play music. I don't think the alarm would work that way, but contrary to what another reviewer wrote, the alarm does work with music rather than the buzzer if you have an iPod hooked up to the alarm clock, without the need for the iHome app. At least, it did for me.If you want to use it as an alarm clock without an iPod/iPhone, you can do this as well, because of the included buzzer alarm. This is important to me, because I have no need to keep an iPod or iPhone connected every night, and do not wish to, since charging often or constantly, especially when not necessary, is really not good for the battery.One very important requirement for using a device as an alarm, for me, is that the alarm must not shut off automatically after a minute or so. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but sometimes, for me, it takes a while. I allowed the buzzer alarm to go off for more than five minutes. It starts off low and slow, then gradually increases in frequency and volume to a pretty noticeable clatter.It would be nice to have more than one alarm, and to have a headphone jack. Being able to control song play from the machine itself or from a remote would also be desirable. An irritation is the battery indicator blinking when you are not even using batteries, and I'm not speaking of the small flat battery that saves settings in case of power failure, but even that one blinks that it is low sometimes, even though I just got it and am using the battery included. If one is on AC power, why have the battery power indicator blink?A nice touch is that the clock display has four different brightness settings, one of which is completely off, which is a good thing at night if the light bothers you. I'm not sure why the brightness doesn't auto- adjust, as so many other average alarm clocks do, but at least it is adjustable.Altogether, it is a good device to have, at the least for being an alarm clock and iPod/iPhone charger, but also for being portable. However, there must be more functionality and sound quality included to be worth the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROE0R5TLCH0WS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039STTVQ#wasThisHelpful","ROE0R5TLCH0WS","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rick Riordan's ""The Lost Hero"" is, to me at least, an even better start to a series than ""The Lightning Thief"" was to the Percy Jackson series. I could be biased, of course, because I already have read the entire Percy Jackson series, and thus was already hooked before beginning. There is another reason, though.I have always been fascinated by Greek and Roman mythology, and studied them both extensively in my younger days. Why is that any more important for this series than the last? In ""The Heroes of Olympus"" series, it is not just Greek mythology that undergirds the story. Now, he interweaves threads from Roman mythology, the very close counterpart to Greek mythology.Now, a couple of important points:1) In tradition, when the Greeks finally defeated Troy, Aeneas flees Troy and has his adventure, as told in the Latin classic, the Aeneid. As a former citizen of Troy, and a demigod (son of Aphrodite and Anchises), Aeneas makes it to Italy, where his descendants become the founders and rulers of Rome, worshiping the same gods as before, but most with different names and personalities.2) Another crucial part of the story deals with a stronger threat to the demigods than what they dealt with in the last series. There is a greater and more primeval threat to the order of things than the Titans of Percy Jackson fame.Why are these things important? No, I'm not going to tell you the story, like so many others -- you have to read it yourself to discover the significance of these points I have put forward (or read reviews that contain spoilers). I do recommend reading the Percy Jackson series, first, if you haven't yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V0I5N7S7J3O3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142311339X#wasThisHelpful","R1V0I5N7S7J3O3","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I regret to admit that this is the first book I have read by Sir Salman Rushdie, having known of his work for many years, and having long wished to read The Satanic Verses: A Novel. As mentioned by so many previous reviewers, this particular work is a sequel, but I did not find difficulty in reading the work as a result of not having read the previous work, Haroun and the Sea of Stories.There is much to commend Rushdie's writing in this volume, though I would not consider it necessarily a great work of literature. He does incorporate elements from various great works of literature, however, and some of the most entertaining, to me at least, were references to those elements studied by classicists the world over. The story is shot throughout with lively references to mythologies and the old gods and goddesses of the ancients, something that has always produced a fascination within me. Perhaps this is the main reason I enjoyed ""Luka.""Another reason this book was pleasing to me is that Rushdie's prose, though on a level that could be understood by a ten to twelve year old, is eloquent enough to be pleasing to someone with a much higher reading level, with language and subtle suggestions thrown in that hold the attention of the more mature in the audience. We see techniques like this in almost all animated movies that are produced, and though we adults may watch them for the children we bring along, there is always something that flies right over their heads, intended for us.I give this four stars, as any book deserves (at the least) when it makes me want to read more of an author's material.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TRRH4WUG99A8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679463364#wasThisHelpful","R1TRRH4WUG99A8","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is a pleasure to have completed the second volume of Janet Browne's magnificent ~1200 page biography of Darwin, perhaps the only biography needed to review the life of a much greater man. Part one, can be found here: Charles Darwin: A Biography, Vol. 1 - Voyaging. Volume two begins with preparations and publication of ""On the Origin of Species,"" and continues until his death 23 years later. His autobiography, edited by Nora Barlow, The Autobiography of Charles Darwin: 1809-1882, is a wonderful addition, mainly to get his own thoughts on a few things, but autobiographies are inadequate to fully examine someone's life.Allow me to explain a little why Browne's biography is a stellar piece of work. Perhaps you are interested in reading a much shorter treatment of Darwin's life, and there is no shortage of works by competent authors, even writers that can make it all so much more exciting. You may notice a certain spin or a thesis around which all of these authors build their stories of the subject's life.To an extent, perhaps even Browne does that, but after reading the whole, I cannot easily come away from her work believing she did it all for some political or ideological reason. What I am trying to convey is that she has presented an extremely thorough, wide-ranging, utterly exhaustive treatment which has been done in fairness, showing the great and minor events, even the virtues and vices of Charles Darwin and surrounding significant characters in his life. One can truly walk away from this reading feeling like one has known the great scientist.So many other articles, books, or even forms of video seem to have gotten so much wrong. One major message I have received from this more authoritative source is that Charles and Emma did not seem to have had much problem because of the differences in regard to faith and belief in Christianity. Emma apparently did not have enormous issues with the things Charles wrote, and was even quite involved with helping him with editing and anything else he needed, as were his sons and daughters, especially Henrietta.Another revelation (to me) is how late in life it was when he lost faith. ""I never gave up Christianity until I was forty years of age."" -- pg 484. That was part of an interview with some freethinkers that were asking about that particular subject. Earlier in this volume, on pg 391, it is recorded ""he felt decisive -- these were the most godless years of his life."" This is speaking of the last decade of his life, after the publication of ""Descent of Man"" and ""The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.""One last example of a treasure mined from this book is a quote from writings of his son, Francis. Only part of this quote is in the book, as Browne was discussing the primitive methods used by Darwin when so many technologies were springing up to modernize his type of experimentation. I went to the source to widen the context a little:""I have always felt it to be a curious fact, that he who had altered the face of Biological Science, and is in this respect the chief of the moderns, should have written and worked in so essentially a non-modern spirit and manner. In reading his books one is reminded of the older naturalists rather than of the modern school of writers. He was a Naturalist in the old sense of the word, that is, a man who works at many branches of the science, not merely a specialist in one.""The odd thing is that even though he shunned much of the technology available to him that may have standardized and increased the accuracy of his work, he still was more accurate in his assessments and predictions than the vast majority of other scientists working at the time in state of the art facilities, while Darwin was working in his home and the surrounding grounds.There is indeed beauty and genius in simplicity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HWVDKWIO70CR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691114390#wasThisHelpful","R3HWVDKWIO70CR","A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F5NFPJ5XTT2Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:20 Mins I traveled out of the country with this product and I had no issues. I don't remember where I purchased this from.  I have not done extensive travel with the Travel Neck Wallet, Boarding Pass Ticket Organizer Pouch for Passports and Kindle that I will discuss as well. I was sent the Raqpak product to review.Pros-The Raqpak is about 1.5 inches longer than the Victorinox product.-I was able to place a   full 50 count pack of Huggies baby wipes inside of it, I would not have been able to do that with this product because it is not long enough.-My Samsung Galaxy 3 phone, car keys, small pocket camera fit inside securely.-The material for the Raqpak is easier to clean but the material for the Victorinox seems to be more durable. I have not washed it but I think I can place this in the washer machine.-The zippers are made well.-The Raqpak's two zipper pockets on each side are very convenient.-I like the zipper pock on the front.

" 0:20 Mins I was sent the Raqpak travel wallet to review. I already own a black Victorinox  Deluxe Concealed Security Pouch,Nude,One Size for years. I will compare the two.I traveled to Israel and Rome with the Victorinox product, so I am very familiar with it. I have not done extensive travel with the Raqpak product.Pros for the Raqpak- Its about 1.5 inches longer than the Victorinox product.- I was able to place a  3/4 full 50 count pack of Huggies baby wipes inside of it, which is gravy in my world.- My Samsung galaxy 3 phone, car keys, small pocket camera and wipes all fit inside securely.- The material is easy to clean.- The zippers are made well.- The two zipper pockets on each side is very convenient. I really like that design.- The small pocket on the front flap is nice for change or a small key. The Victorinox product does not have a pocket on the flap.Cons- The security window sounds like a good idea but, it doesn't seem secure to me. I would not place my passport in it. The security window needs a zipper or some Velcro to close the window. My husband would have no problem placing his passport in it, but I would not take the risk.- The Victorinox product has a zipper on the front pocket of it which is a better design and my passport fits in it.- The neck strap is okay. But, the strap on the Victorinox is easier to adjust.I am giving this a 4 because its bigger than my previous travel wallet and I can make it work for what I need it to. But the front security pouch is not secure. I used it for our activities this weekend with no problem. The kids were running around at the Easter egg hunt and my items were secure in this pouch. I did not try to place the Kindle inside of it because we use it with a large rugged case for the kids.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHO1LL8M9D4OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZEJ2NW#wasThisHelpful","RHO1LL8M9D4OB","A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent the product to review.As soon as my husband saw it he immediately started taking one every morning. He says he feels a boost in energy. He placed the bottle in his car; therefore, I couldn't find the pills so I could take them when they first arrived.When I was finally able to get the bottle from him I started taking one in the morning with a small glass of Almond milk. I do feel refreshed when I take these.  The one morning I forgot to take one I could tell the difference. I have made this a part of my morning routine.I have two young kids and more energy is necessary.I have been taking these for two weeks. I have not noticed any negative side effects.  Pills, especially vitamins can easily make me nauseated if I swallow them on an empty stomach but these do not.I am glad that I was sent this product because I may not have noticed it otherwise.I would recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C3PIZTHGBKOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T7KHCM8#wasThisHelpful","R1C3PIZTHGBKOC","A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We purchased this mattress with the fuchsia cover in Nov 2013 from Walmart.com.Pros- This works well for our 2 year old.- I have slept on this on three different times when she was not feeling well. It is comfortable for me, but I wouldn't suggest doing it more than a few nights.- The cover is easy to come off and put back on.- All the Disney sheets we purchased fit with no issue- I would recommend this product as long as its under $100. I purchased on Walmart.com for $79. I am not sure I would pay $130 for this mattress. Its just foam.Cons- My daughter is potty training. There is an accident sometimes. At first this was not an issue. But, now it is soaking through the moisture protector. I have washed the protector so I am not sure if that has contributed to the issue.- We have started placing a pad under her sheets to keep the mattress from getting wet.- I cleaned the mattress twice without the cover. I pushed it up the window and allowed it to air dry.  It dried with no problem. I plan to get a twin mattress protector for it soon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YR2IJP4T39IU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWFORWA#wasThisHelpful","R2YR2IJP4T39IU","A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent an electronic copy of this to review. I decided to read eat while eating lunch my desk.I must say its very funny. I grew up in a rural town in the South. A good Yo Mama joke always got a good laugh on the playground.  These jokes are truly funny. I love the Yo Mama is so old jokes in the book. I could not recall any good Yo Mama so old jokes.  It was a really nice flash back to my childhood.I must admit that I personally would not buy a book of yo mama stupid, ugly or fat jokes for my kids.  They will here this in their own time. I dont have to present it to them.  This may not be a bad idea for some parties. I know jokes are jokes but I dont need to reinforce the words fat, ugly and stupid to my kids. I catch myself saying other things around them that I shouldn't. I want them to use better language than I did when I was young.I ran across one profane word in the book. It is not terrible, but I didn't understand the reason for it. The stop the funeral joke could have been re-written.  The word is so unnecessary for a 5 year-old to read. The books description on Amazon states that the beginning target age is 5.This book is totally hilarious for people who like Yo Mamma jokes. I am going to give the book a 4 because I dont think it should be marketed to kids at age 5 and because of the one profane word I read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LCJVYRW3RC1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYOMP6A#wasThisHelpful","R3LCJVYRW3RC1W","A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this product to review.I usually stick with The Body Shop Seaweed Line of Skin Care Products.  I don't usually deviate from that line, but I tried this product twice so far.- I have been to the Dead Sea and lathered myself with the mud. So I do know the impact of the Dead Sea on my skin.- This product has a lighter feel than other muds I have used.  I guess the Aloe Vera Juice and Shea Butter contribute to that feel.- I did not feel the tingling sensation I usually feel with other muds so I wasn't sure it was working at first.- I used a SeaWeed cleanser from The Body Shop. I am out of the toner I usually use. After 15 minutes I washed it off and my skin. My skin did feel cleaner. It definitely acts more like a moisturizer than other muds I have used. However, I do think it will be necessary for me to us my normal toner with this for a true comparison.- My skin was not dry when I used this. I did use an additional moisturizer on my skin but it wasn't entirely necessary for me.- My husband used the product and he really liked it.Compared to Body Shop Seaweed Mask- You get more for the money with this product than the Body Shop product. Therefore, I am more inclined to purchase this product.- This product feels better on my face. I thought the tingling feeling of the Body Shop product was necessary to work effectively but maybe that is not the case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RC2WN3KIC3X4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LG63K8G#wasThisHelpful","R1RC2WN3KIC3X4","A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased for about $15 I think for 2 bags. Normally I would not spend that much for a shopping bag. But, I was very curious about this product. The grab bag website has it for that price.Pros- This bag is bigger than any other shopping bags I got for free.  The size of this bag is great.- In Walmart or Publix it fits great in the shopping cart. Once at the checkout I load it up. That process is very convenient for me.- I like the fact that the bag prevents major spills with the flap. It's a pain when items roll under the seat and I miss them but smell them a day later.- I don't use the pocket on the side but it's nice to know it's there.  I have a separate coupon book.- I purchased a very good insulated bag from Whole Foods that works well, but I must say the Grab Bag insulated bag looks easier to fill up.  I think I paid $9 for my bag which is made of really good quality. I am not sure the Grab Bag's insulated bag is worth $15 on its own.Cons- The clips to attach the bag to the shopping cart fall off easily. This is not a huge problem but it is a little annoying.  Because the bag has a flat bottom I can work around that.- I do think it should be a little cheaper for the quality of material but I am crushed by the price. I feel that way because my other bags have been free that are made of this material.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OVQY6XI7JT5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBUF1UG#wasThisHelpful","R3OVQY6XI7JT5N","A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this product to review months ago.I have been adding Chia seeds to my morning yogurt on occasion because my sister told me it was good idea. I normally don't add anything to my yogurt and I was hesitant to do so. But this hasn't been too bad. They don't have a bad taste. I haven't had any bad reactions.I can say that I have noticed some benefit. It seems like my energy does increase a little after consuming some. I also must admit that I haven't been very consistent with them. My goal is to be more consistent with this product and take more time to access the change in my body.

I took a few sips and it was okay but of course I missed the sugar from traditional Hot Chocolate. There was an after taste. So I added two packets of honey.

"We have 2.5 year old and 1.5 year old girls. I researched activity tables for a few days. I asked my siblings to purchase this one from amazon for my daughter's birthday.Pros-  My husband put it together without any complaints-  It is sturdy. The kids broke the RiverRidge Kids Table with 2 Chairs and 3 Plastic Storage Bins after 10 months. But this one is still in good shape. The girls stand on top of it all the time if I am not watching. Surprisingly it has not broken. The other table could not handle my kids abusing it :-).-  I like the cups that hold markers and crayons.-  So far it's been easy to clean off crayon marks.-  We have had this table for almost 10 months.Cons- The storage bins are too small for their coloring books. They need to be wider for our usage.- The storage bins fall off the sides very easily. I am thinking about placing some Velcro on the bottom.- The kids constantly fall off the stool. It is very slippery. They stopped using it. I wish the table came with two chairs that have backs on them.- The molded storage areas come off very easily. My 1.5 year old constantly takes them off. They are often on the floor. I wish it had some type of child proof latch. But, when they get older I may feel differently.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UNTXI2MMNAY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SL1HG8#wasThisHelpful","R2UNTXI2MMNAY1","A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this activity table from Walmart.com in March 2014 for our 2 girls.Pros-  It looks nice- The shelves and trays are very functional. The coloring books and crayons fit nicely. Unlike our other table where the trays are too small for most of their items.- It's not expensive.Cons- Unfortunately, 11 months after we purchased this its broken and unusable.  My girls have not treated this table well. But, I am disappointed with how fast it came apart.- The first thing to break was a chair about 3 or 4 months after we put it together. My 2 year old stepped on the top part of it and it cracked. In case you are wondering, she is not over-weight. It was too dangerous to continue to use it and my husband, who is handy, couldn't fix it for safe use. Therefore, we threw it away.- Ten months after we had it some of the bars for the shelves were broken by one of the kids.- Finally the table started rocking to the point where some bars for the shelves came out and my 1 year old was able to take the screws out.-  We can no longer use the table. One of the chairs is alive. I will continue to use that. I am so disappointed.- This is not made of wood which is expected for the price, but I did need 2 years out of this.- I am giving this 2 stars because we got almost a year of use out of it. But, for $100 I did expect more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31BULEJ23HT1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CYD0JG#wasThisHelpful","R31BULEJ23HT1R","A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two children. Therefore, I use many pre-treat products. This actually gets out very NEW spaghetti stains.I had two bibs with spaghetti stains on them for about 4 days before I washed them. I used Tide sport or Tide color guard as the detergent. This product did a poor job of removing those stains. I washed the bibs a 2nd time by spaying some OxiClean Max Force Stain Remover Spray, 12 Ounce (Pack of 2) on them. They looked a little better. Then I washed with a 3rd load and used bleach in the dispenser. I did not poor the bleach directly on the bibs. That did the trick. I only use the bibs when they eat so I was not worried about any potential color deterioration.My kids love spaghetti with red sauce. This product works well to remove very new spaghetti stains from their bibs. If the stains have been there for a few days it doesn't work as well.In general the OxiClean Max Force Stain Remover Spray, 12 Ounce (Pack of 2) works better for us. But, I can't say that I use the same process all the time. I don't always pre-teat and wait for the number of minutes that the bottle says too. Time does not always allow for that.

"I have a 2.5 year old daughter with Eczema. It is so hard to find products I can wash her body or hair with.I usually buy Exederm Baby Wash which works very well. But its hard to find it in the local stores. I went to CVS and I saw this product (Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash) on the shelf. It was $1 cheaper than the Exederm product and the ingredients were very similar so I purchased it.Pros- Price is a little lower than other products we use. CeraVe Baby Wash and Shampoo, 8 Ounce and Exederm Cleansing Baby Bath 8 oz (237 g). At CVS I paid $7.99 for this bottle and Walgreens had it on the shelf for the same price. Sometimes coupons are in the paper for Eucerin products. Sine this is new I expect to see coupons soon.- We trust the Aquaphor brand in our home because the ointment is is one of the few things that works for our daughter. Its pricey but worth it.- It makes bubbles. Most of the other products we use don't lather well, such as CeraVe, but this does lather.-  We have been using it for about 5 days each time we bath her. We have not had any issues. Thank Goodness!- We have not used it on her hair yet. I use Exederm Shampoo on her hair which keeps her from scratching.- This works well for the 1 year old too.Cons- I have none at this time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SA4T8UJEV3QG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2P3JO0#wasThisHelpful","R1SA4T8UJEV3QG","A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 2.5 year old daughter has Eczema. It breaks my heart to see her scratching. The doctors have not been very helpful with their recommendations. Lately she has been scratching her scalp.I purchased this on a whim in CVS one day out of frustration with my daughter's scalp. I had been trying olive oil on her scalp and that didn't seem to work all the time. This product worked well for weeks.  But I noticed  after a few days it seems to flake a little bit. It made her scalp look dirty if she wore braids. Granted, I may have been using too much but I have a 2 year old frantically scratching.I thought I just had to deal with that issue because she wasn't scratching as much any longer.

"My 2.5 year old daughter has Eczema. It breaks my heart to see her scratching. The doctors have not been very helpful with their recommendations.

The little nozzel on it is perfect for scalp application.Cons:- I have to use a towel around her neck when I apply this because it drips and gets on her clothing.- It can be very messy if I use a little too much.

"My 2 year old daughter has eczema. It has been hard for us to find solutions for her that are not prescriptions. She seems to be so uncomfortable at times. Therefore, I have tried many different products.- I saw this on the shelf at CVS and decided to give it a try. It WORKED. I wanted to throw a party.- This product and CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, 12 Ounce are the only two washes I have found that work for her. I use the CeraVe baby wash & shampoo or the regular one with no issues.- I like this product better because it lathers. CerVae does not lather. I need to see suds to believe she is clean. It's a mental thing :-). This product also seems to moisturize better than the CeraVe alone. CeraVe does have a lotion.- Both the baby CeraVe and Exederm cost about the same. CeraVe baby wash at Wal-Mart is around $8 or $9 and Exederm at CVS is around $8 or $9. CeraVe often has coupons in my pediatrician's office or the Sunday paper.

"I know I will have to update this review at some point. There are much more thorough reviews than mine.Pros:- We purchased the 7 inch for our 2 year old daughter. I could not complain about the monthly price for prime members. Our budget doesn't allow for lots of gadgets like it used to.- It downloaded the movies well. They play really good. I had no issue with that.- Anything that has a picture of Dora on it gets my daughter's attention. So she liked the Dora app.- For the price it's all worth it.Cons- The 1 year old and 2 year old are constantly at war over my first generation iPad. I thought this would be a good solution. But, not exactly. The apps on the iPad that the 2 year old loves are really good. I have not found comparable apps on the HD Fire yet. With that being said. I have not had time to research. This device doesn't keep her preoccupied like the iPad so I am not sure how that will work on a long road trip.- I personally had a hard time with the device because I am so used to an iPad. These were my own issues. Simple things like getting the home button to pop-up drove me crazy for the first two days. I could not find a tutorial online to help me with the small things like that. So I had to leave it for a few days and come back to it.- The battery life does not seem to be best. But, I am not sure how long it actually lasted.

We usually use olive oil to fry items. I have just started using coconut oil to fry with recently.1. First, I fried some pork chops with this Coconut flour because that is the meat I had already seasoned and thawed out.2. I fried in olive oil. It started to brown really fast and I didn't expect that. Just plan ole lack of knowledge. I turned the pan down a little and all was not lost.3. I was very pleased with how it turned out. As expected it didn't taste like white flour. It was different in a good way. It was not as heavy as the bleached flour I grew up with.4. A few days later I decided to fry some chicken breast in coconut oil with this flour. Now that was the jack pot for me. The toddlers loved it. My husband thought it was great. I was very nervous because I am experimenting. There were no complaints in the kitchen after I added some green beans.5. This is pricey compared to what we usually pay for any flour. But, considering that we need a better option than the white stuff I will purchase this again.6. I must say a small amount went further than I thought it would. I also think because it cost more I am a little more conservative than I would be if it were the white flour.7. I also love that the bag is resealable and doesn't leave such a big mess like the cheap stuff.8.  I must say that it doesn't have a strong coconut taste to it. At least I don't think so. But, I really like coconut so I may not have noticed as much. My husband did find it to be a little sweet.9. I also should mention that with regular flour you can reuse the same pan to fry another batch. This doesn't really allow you to do that. It becomes more solid in the pan when cooking. So if you have a 2nd batch I found that I need to clean the pan and start over. Now there may be a way around that but I didn't figure it out. That could be more a product of using coconut oil now that I am thinking about it. That is new to me as well.10. I can't wait to use this product for baking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R228APTH0Q0ZQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDCFXFE#wasThisHelpful","R228APTH0Q0ZQG","A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6UPHSBJ0SOY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""From Asia With Lust - Volume 1"" provides 2 Japanese exploitation fliks for the price of one - a factor which slightly sweetens the deal as these type of films are, generally, relatively short in length (approx 70 min each).  As 'stand-alone' features these two movies might also seem somewhat disappointing, but as a two-pack their individual deficiencies become somewhat less annoying, for the price.Both films have been released by Troma, but are NOT Troma productions. It would appear that Troma signed a deal to secure some low end Japanese weirdness to cash in on the surge of interest in Asian exploitation product and have released, to date, 2 separate 2-4-1 packages under the ""From Asia With Lust"" banner.Having checked out the premiere offering (as a 'fan' of the genre) I'd remark that these were pretty lackluster forays into the venerable realm of the traditional Pinky Violence style of Japanese cinema.  Both of the films in ""From Asia With Lust - Volume 1"" (AND Volume 2 as well!!) feature Jap AV 'star' Miyuki Yokoyama in the lead female role(s). Mz Yokoyama is attractive enough, and doesn't mind shedding her clothes when required, BUT her ability to deliver a performance with any passion is sadly lacking... a factor that contributes to the somewhat low-key vibe of both of these, supposedly strongly transgressive, films.The first feature: ""CAMP"" contains more sexually perverse action. Two quibbling sisters become stranded when they have a car accident and they take shelter at an abandoned 'summer camp'. Ironically, their time at the titular 'camp' is short as they are  discovered by a 'neighbor' guy who invites them to spend the night over at his place. The 'sisters' relief at this 'hospitality' is soon ended, however, when four more men show up at the cabin and things get weird. It turns out all the men are 'sexual degenerates' that were released from a near-by 'bankrupted' mental institution and they have continued to live together, trying to control their perverse libidos.  The presence of the two cute and  vulnerable women make them immediately revert to their wicked ways and each member of the group enacts their particular fetishistic fantasy upon the captives.  Torturous indignities are heaped upon the two girls- including: pee fetish, abuse w/ a BBQ lighter!, rape, and ultimately even necrophilia - after the younger sister is grimly killed by being put into a plastic garment bag from which all the air is sucked out by a vacuum cleaner! Pretty 'nasty' stuff.  The older sister (Miyuki!) escapes and fortuitously/improbably! hooks up with another woman who is also trying to hunt the perverts down (with a bow & arrow) and the whole affair moves into a classic feminine vendetta scenario as the women wreak their vengeance.  No 'surprises' here and, consequently, not a lot of excitement generated via the 'by-the-numbers' action.The second feature ""Hitch-hike"" focuses on a road-trip by a husband and wife who share a pretty abusive relationship.With Miyuki again in 'the driver's seat' they pick up a hitch-hiking man who turns out to be a dangerous bank-robber criminal on the run.  What follows is, again, plot-line territory that has been well mined over the years - as the psycho in the backseat proceeds to reveal his true identity and terrorize the couple for the duration.  Lots of fights and shootings, and a rape (while the 'husband' is forced to watch) provide the thrills in this one - right up to the predictable ending.Both of these films provide over-the-top exploitation situations that are, unfortunately, dulled by clunky scripts, character development, and acting. Situations that could be considered as extremely shocking end up feeling sorta mundane due to the formulaic nature of everything.  There is a fair bit of female nakedness displayed in the film ""CAMP"" and a lot of sexual brutality! ""Hitch-hike"" relies more on guns and shocking murders to provide thrills and Miyuki is only briefly nude during her rape scene.Ultimately, I found these 2 films to be an 'OK' watch - but not great.  Makes one appreciate the quality and craftsmanship that went into many of the 'older' Pinky Violence productions.  Technically - the DVD image quality is excellent (widescreen) - Japanese language w/ English sub-titles - no 'extras' of note.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q9BRBE0PIIA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5KJIKA#wasThisHelpful","R3Q9BRBE0PIIA9","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having just about exhausted the potential for outrageous ""Shark' films - One must imagine that the folks at Asylum pictures were casting about for other genres to plunder - and hit upon the concept of mimicking the venerable 'Pinky Violence' style films that have long been popular in Japan and other parts of the far East.In typical Asylum fashion, they managed to get 'some' of it right but the final product definitely feels like it was hastily slapped together (a suposition that is verified in the 'Making Of...' featurette that is included on the disk). However, in this case, that is not necessarily a 'bad thing' due to the fact that most 'true' Asian made Pinky Violence features are also sort of 'thrown together' cheap exploitation affairs.To their credit (in my warped opinion) Asylum has created a fairly watchable product because they didn't shy away from some nice gratuitous sex & violence and included ample scenes of female nudity within the simplistic 'rape/revenge' plot-line... at least this is the case in the 'UnRated' version!The story follows the exploits of 4 (you guessed it) Asian Schoolgirls (based in L.A.) who get drugged & raped by a ring of bad guys who, apparently, basically drug and rape schoolgirls.  One of the abused schoolmates kills herself (because of the shame of it all) and her, similarly ravished, buddies determine to avenge her (and themselves) by taking out the organization that assaulted them.  The 'police' are little help so they decide to take matters into their own hands and arm-up with a variety of Western and Eastern style weaponry which they pay for by doing what every underage Asian Schoolgirl knows is the quickest way to earn big bucks - they become strippers. This is good news for the audience as it provides the opportunity for lotsa T&A action as the gurlz begin their vindictive program of pay-back.In this type of 'film' who really cares if the acting is good or the continuity is spot on - you've got a bunch of cute girls running around in school uniforms and/or less! righteously blowing away their foes.  And that's about 'it'.  What's not to like?!  Personally I found it a great mindless watch & would recommend it to those who enjoy such fare.  The DVD image quality is very crisp/widescreen - extras include a short 'Making Of' segment and a brief 'Gag Reel'.  There's a broad hint at the end of the flik that the 'grrrls might be back' - do I sense the potential for an Asylum Asian Schoolgirl franchise??.... here's hope'n!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37CSCPWU9G1JO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRYH4TW#wasThisHelpful","R37CSCPWU9G1JO","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Sexandroide"" is a French 'film' made in 1987 that attempts to mix horror and eroticism.  How successfully this blend has been achieved may ultimately be a matter of personal taste.  Por moi - I found the imagery & concepts to be 'interesting' if not particularly 'inspired'. Given the time of the film's original release some of the things depicted were pretty avante-garde.The format presents 3 separate, unconnected, segments that all feature naked women and some 'horror' element.The first scene is, perhaps, the most imaginative - in it: a woman at a bar is affected by a remote individual who is inexplicably tormenting her via a wax voodoo doll. The woman takes refuge in a lavatory and is compelled to rip her own clothes off and is then subjected to a series of 'tortures' as the unseen voodoo manipulator pokes and prods the wax effigy in a variety of 'intimate' areas.  Pretty creepy & bloody!The second vignette follows a lanky brunette down into a satanic basement setting where she dances around and flagellates herself a little before she is set upon by a demonic individual whose make-up, strangely, reminded me of the look of the flying monkey creatures in the old 'Wizard of Oz'.  This segment featured a lot of cringe-worthy graphic depictions of long needles thrust through sensitive body parts on the naked woman, eyeball gouging, bowie knife carving, and even a depiction of hari-kari!  I particularly appreciated this 'act' because it had an authentic 'Grand Guignol-esque' feel to it - seemingly recreating the experience one might have had at that infamous Victorian period Parisian 'theatre of horreur & comedy'. This is emphasized as the 2 'actors' in the piece stand up and 'take a bow' at the end of their torturous sequence...  It was quite satisfying (in a sick & depraved way).The final episode of the perverse trilogy is the most mundane in terms of 'horrific' content.  An attractive, ashen faced, widow sits by a coffin, until the vampiric 'corpse' pops out of it and rips her clothes off. The, totally nude, dancer then basically does an 80's style 'stripper' act next to a coffin for an extended period. Any guy who has ever sat thru a typical strip-bar show  will recognize all of 'the moves' and the camera does not 'shy away' from from any of the action - making this the most explicitly erotic of the scenes... somewhat reminiscent of similar sequences in director Ed Wood's: ""Orgy of the Dead"".  It should be generally noted that, although full female nudity is abundant, there is no XXX porn action (in the original French film).Interestingly, there is no verbal dialog in any of the segments (no pesky sub-titles to detract from the viewing experience) - the sound trak consists of music and a lot of panting, screaming,  grunts and groans - as appropriate to whatever bit of weirdness is transpiring on screen at the moment.  While this, relatively brief, Franco foray into erotic-horror doesn't really have much to recommend it beyond its' hefty dose of full female nudity - in THAT department it scores admirably and could be considered as a 'fun' watch by the sort of bent individuals who gravitate to this type of (s)exploitational strangeness.The visual quality of the DVD transfer is 'appropriately' grainy but good. The 'extras' include some (even grainier) scenes from a version of the film duped from a Japanese VHS release that featured additional XXX footage not actually related to the original French release, This, fairly lengthy, series of scenes appear to be out-takes from some European made hardcore BDSM movies - a male midget is a prominent player in several segments.  Because these clips were in a Japanese release they are 'plagued' with the annoying digital censorship that is imposed on much Japanese hardcore material and make the sex scenes difficult to watch - but it is nice that the DVD authors thought to include them!  There are also some trailers for other 'Massacre Video' oddities.  Gratuitously vacuous as it may be - I liked it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKRYJ4G59CV0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9VAQHW#wasThisHelpful","RKRYJ4G59CV0P","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Super Eruption"" is a made for the SyFy Channel product that chronicles the effects of a potential eruption of the massive volcanic caldera that houses Yellowstone National Park. Personally, I love a good disaster flik and am particularly drawn to scenarios that involve volcanic and/or tsunami imagery. ""Super Eruption"" definitely delivered lotsa lava action, but was pretty flawed in many areas of its' basic plot development and editing - thus detracting from its' enjoyment level.Perhaps one of the most disturbing elements, for me, was the fact that the film was obviously NOT shot in Yellowstone Park - or even America. As is the case with much SyFy Channel product the end credits revealed that the production took place in Eastern Europe and the landscape just didn't look 'right'. I have had the pleasure of visiting Yellowstone and know what it looks like - this factor alone made it hard to get into the feel of the film. The acting was all reasonably well done, but the story line was so 'by the numbers', that it didn't manage to build any kind of suspense or intrigue and, ultimately, relied on some rather improbable plot twists and ridiculously un-realisitic actions that totally destroyed any credibility in the plot. The CGI effects were pretty decent throughout but they felt sorta 'wasted' due to the sloppiness of the screenplay.A vastly superior take on the same Yellowstone eruption premise was realized in the Knowledge Network generated docu-drama ""Super Volcano"" which is available on DVD (albeit somewhat scarce), and the Yellowstone sequence in the film ""2012"" also gives much better 'bang for the buck'. Still - ""Super Eruption"" wasn't the worst thing I've seen come out of the SyFy pipeline and it could be recommended for some light weight diversion by fans of the genre.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STFV3RXJP7NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CSW0A8A#wasThisHelpful","R2STFV3RXJP7NR","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As others have stated - this particular DVD doesn't really deliver on the promo hype presented on the DVD box cover.  Perhaps the biggest 'error' is the fact that the subject matter covered isn't really the San Andreas fault!  It would appear that the distributors have rushed this product out to take advantage of the release of the Hollywood blockbuster, of the same name, and have done the BBC a disservice in the process. The box cover art and promo write-up are both quite deceiving as they would lead one to believe that the contents might depict a story and visuals of a dramatic nature - showing simulated earthquake disaster effects.In reality this is an  'interesting documentary' of a relatively mundane nature that 'speculates' on the effects of a major earthquake along the so-called ""Cascadia fault line"" located offshore in the Pacific Northwest - well above the San Andreas fault.  The program presents  lots of archival footage of the tsunami disaster in Sri-Lanka to allude to how devastating a coastal earthquake can be.and many stock shots of angry ocean waves and people walking around in cities full of tall buildings as the narrator does a lot of ominous ""what if"" speculation about a potential Cascadia quake.  Perhaps the most intriguing material provided focuses on scientists who demonstrate historic & geologic evidence of previous times when this fault shifted. As far as 'simulations' of tidal waves and/or land-based earthquake disaster goes - there are only a couple of limp CGI effects of swaying buildings and rippling roadways to allude to how such an event might manifest. Over-all, however, this is a pretty dry little scientific extrapolation with little 'exciting' visual material.The DVD actually includes a second 'bonus' feature of equal length entitled ""Earthquake Storm"" that features a similar scientific investigation into the phenomenon of 'sequential' earthquake patterns - such as have apparently been observed in parts of the Middle East.This feature also mostly shows present day 'crowd scenes' and scenery of the regions being discussed - but no earthquake simulations.While both of these programs are interesting enuf in their own rights as a light weight educational experience - they sure don't provide anything visually exciting and left me feeling sorta ripped off by the 'hype' of the product description for 'action' that was not delivered.  Maybe a 'renter' - not much of a 'keeper' - unless, perhaps, you are a grade school science teacher who might want to show it as an educational film about fault-lines. Time would be better spent re-watching the San Andreas disaster segments from the film ""2012"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F8NK5WACGPBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UA00H1W#wasThisHelpful","R1F8NK5WACGPBA","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A couple of purported reviewer comments on the DVD box cover for ""The Lesser Evil"" (2015) refer to it as: ""The most disturbing film of the year"" and ""An unrelenting squirmfest!"" Having given this (latest) of mega low budget horror auteur Bill Zebub's offerings a watch I'd have to agree - BUT - likely NOT for the reasons  stated in the promo hype. Mostly I was 'disturbed' that I had actually been duped into paying money to purchase this bit of junk and ""squirming"" in frustration at the lameness of it all - praying that it would 'get better' as it went along - which it never did.As I have noted in some previous reviews of Zebub's works - it is sometimes difficult to determine whether the 'director' is taking himself seriously or if he is attempting to pull off a parody of sorts... ""The Lesser Evil"" continues this tradition of genre confusion. Regardless of whether this IS supposed to be satirical in nature or a truly 'disturbing' film I'd have to say that Zebub has pretty much failed in achieving either goal with this flik.The premise that is, doubtless, intended to provide the 'squirm factor' is the concept of: a young mother who is grabbed by a freakish ner-do-well who tells her that he has kidnapped her daughter and will harm the child if the mom doesn't participate in all the 'debasing' sex acts he has planned. This 'set-up' occurs in the most perfunctory manner in the first few moments of the plot and it's almost the only portion of the film where there is any spoken dialog. The 'bad guy' then takes the woman to a hotel room and begins to film her as he 'directs' her to perform a series of 'humiliating' sexual acts.  While this might sound like a formula to stir the libidos of the 'sick & twisted' amongst us - Zubub, and his 'actress' de jour (Rachel Crow), manage to make the perverse action seem totally banal.  A lengthy interview with Ms Crow is provided on the disk (ostensibly to 're-assure' the viewer that all the 'disturbing' action was just 'make-believe' - DUH!) wherein she speaks of 'pushing herself' as an actress... well she coulda fooled me! Throughout the entire proceedings Rachel shows not one ounce of 'emotion' and woodenly goes through the paces of whatever 'embarrassing' act she is miming at the moment!  As previously noted - there is virtually NO 'dialog' in the film - the action all takes place 'silently' - accompanied by a collection of weird satanic tonalities blaring away in the background - Zebub is a huge fan of this sorta 'death metal' dirge.On the 'prurience meter' ""Lesser Evil"" DOES provide A LOT of nudity as the 'victim' is commanded to strip, right off the bat, at the start of the feature and remains basically naked throughout - whilst her 'tormentor' looms over her with his video camera recording all the lack-lustre action for posterity.  The camera moves vary between annoyingly jerky POV type shots to bland static set-ups that create little excitement or drama as the girl is forced to: dis-robe, crawl around on the floor, use the toilet, and lay on the bed to be 'ravished' and stimulated with a Hitachi vibrator for 'our viewing pleasure'.  A few open crotch shots are about as 'nasty' as it gets - all 'sex' acts are (poorly) simulated. While she's forced to wear a ball-gag there is virtually no other bondage at play and the abused heroine seems to just stoically lie there and 'take it' until the limp 'surprise ending', and (thank god) the end credits finally roll.Zebub appears to have a thing about 'rape'- it features prominently in virtually all of his flix! - the write-up on the DVD box seems to want us to believe that ""The Lesser Evil"" is presenting some 'new' sorta take on the subject. In reality itz pretty much the same old thing but in this instance I'd have to say that Zebub has, instead, committed the most grievous of faults by producing a '(s)exploitation' film that is BORING!On the technical front - a nice clear shot-direct-to video picture - extras include the aforementioned 'interview' with Rachel Crow - and a few trailers for films that look a lot more amusing than the feature just watched. Personally, I felt that (unless U R a rabid Rachel (Sexton) Crow fan!) this one is more of a renter than a keeper.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27UIMWXXUGMIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2YNNQM#wasThisHelpful","R27UIMWXXUGMIN","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This recent Drive-In Double Bill from Vinegar Syndrome provides 2 'R' Rated films from Director Chris Wakefield - a guy, who it would appear, seems to think that women are out to 'screw' men (both literally and figuratively!) OR that, at least, such sexually malicious machinations make for a good exploitation plot.  The female protagonists in both of these 70's vintage 'adult' flix have an 'axe to grind' and it is some poor guy that ends up on the chopping block.Personally - I found ""Little Miss Innocence"" to be the more satisfying film - largely because it had two super cute 70's sweeties in it and they took their clothes off A LOT. In the simplistic plot line: a nice average middle aged guy in L.A. picks up a couple of attractive hitch-hiking teen girls who end up moving in with him for a few days and attempting to ruin his life by 'screwing him to death'! It turns out one of the girls was sexually abused by her 'family' and she's out for 'payback' against the male gender in general while her friend is not quite so vindictive - she just wants to lose her virginity and try out every sex position known to man! (Gotta love the 70's!)  Between them they soon have their unwilling 'host' begging for mercy (and sleep).  As previously noted - there is a goodly amount of full female nudity in this flik but the sex scenes are soft core and seem sorta chopped up - nothing really arousing - but a quirky story with hot chicks.""Teenage Seductress"" plays like it was a bit of an 'excuse' for the film-maker to take a trip to Taos, New Mexico - where the action is situated. The 'seductress' in this rather improbable tale isn't actually 'teenage'  - as she states at one point that she has graduated w/ a college degree - which would put her in early 20's! Regardless ...This attractive young woman is searching for her father - who dumped both she and her mother when she was a child. Her bitter single mom warned the daughter repeatedly that: 'men only want one thing!""  SO she, apparently, sets out to give that 'THING' to her dad!! - thereby 'punishing' him for his abandonment with a shameful dose of incestuous behavior. A weird plot line to be sure! In the screenplay, the father is a successful writer in the art colony of Taos - the 'daughter' secretly worms her way into his life by becoming his 'secretary' and, ultimately, lover!  The ending is played enigmatically with two opposing realities (neither of which is particularly politically correct!) leaving a bit of a 'question mark' for both the 'father' and the audience! Precious little sex or nudity in this one - the lead actress gets naked briefly in the shower AND there's the artfully rendered 'climactic' incestuous love scene - but that's about it for sexploitation - much more time is spent with scenes of  local folk and locales in the picturesque New Mexico art community... an interesting juxtaposition to the rather creepy storyline!As usual for Vinegar Syndrome releases, the visual quality for both pictures is excellent.  The only extras are the original 'trailers' for both films.  As is often the case the 'trailers' make the 'actual' films look a lot better than they really are.  I found this to be an 'interesting' set of 'B' grade films - but not particularly 'hot'- if thatz what U R looking 4!","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R155O054BBRNH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U83MMYG#wasThisHelpful","R155O054BBRNH1","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is an old Zen parable about a sleeping man who dreams he is a butterfly but when he awakens he ponders - is he now a butterfly dreaming he is a man? This paradoxical question is sort of at the heart of the plot of ""Prison Girl"" wherein, sexually frustrated, young wife Ayaka (portrayed by Japanese AV action gurl ASAMI) is plagued by nightmares of sexual abuse in a woman's prison where she has been incarcerated after, apparently, she has killed her husband.  Ironically, the frightening dreams of torture and violent sex turn her on and she slips into a world where her dream life sexual fantasies and waking reality become increasingly difficult to distinguish.This particular approach to the WIP genre provides a rather unique take on the subject that I found produced sort of mixed results on the WIP 'satisfaction meter'. The Director (Naoyuki Tomomatsu) 'toys' with the audience by providing a series of 'classic' female prison abuse scenarios (a super humiliating initial strip search, lesbian hook-ups, even a DP rape by the prison guards!) BUT then sorta undercuts the action by intimating that it isn't 'real' - itz 'only a dream'. While, perhaps, offering a more 'interesting/sophisticated' plot it does tend to dis-engage the viewer from slipping into the nasty action that fans of the genre may look for.On the positive sexploitational side, however, ""Prison Girl"" DOES present some pretty bent scenes and a fair amount of nudity throughout its, typically, short Pinku run-time (61 min.). Mz Asami is very pleasing to behold, gets naked a lot, and carries the action nicely.  As is the case with many Japanese ero-ductions much of the aberrant sexual content is 'alluded to', rather than graphically depicted, and I noted that ""Prison Girl"" contained several scenes where it was the 'verbal'  descriptions of what was happening (via sub-titles of course) that made the scene hot. No digital censorship in this one - the camera angles keep everything at a relatively 'soft-core' level.The DVD contains some nice extras: a 'new' background piece on the ""Pinky Violence"" genre, a solid interview with Asami, some production stills, and a massive sampling of 'trailers' for other Pink-Eiga flix.

"Altho I originally purchased a copy of this flik back when it was first released in 2007 I'm just getting around to reviewing it now - because - I just watched it again and was reminded of my initial somewhat negative impressions of it - which I thot to share with other potential purchasers.This is an Italian effort starring Tiffany Shepis in the role of 'Sarah' - an American student who comes to an Italian nunnery looking to find God - but winds up undergoing a bunch of horrific tortures at the hands of the 'good sisters' (and their 'doctor') that are supposed to 'help' her in her 'spiritual quest'. These medical 'procedures' are designed to rid the novitiate of her 'troubling' senses of hearing, sight, touch, and speech. In Sarah's case the removal of her ear-drums, eyesight (via acid drops). hands (via scalding in boiling water), AND tongue! - actually have the effect of heightening her extra-sensory powers so that she becomes ultra-sensitive and clairvoyant to both her present surroundings and also to some ghostly flash-backs to previous evil-doings at the convent.This all might sound like a recipe for some good nasty nunsploitation style 'fun'. but in the hands of Director/writer/producer/cinematographer/editor: Ivan Zuccon it all becomes a confusing and, ultimately, un-engaging slog.I am personally not as familiar with the works of lead actress Tiffany Shepis as other reviewers appear to be so I have no other films to base a comparison on, but she is competent in this role, and has no aversion to removing her clothing when the plot so requires.The 'negatives' that struck me about the production were, unfortunately, abundant. For starters - it might be noted that the actual name of the character within the movie (that the title is based upon) is: 'Ninfa' NOT 'Nympha' per the box cover. This is an obvious ploy to attract viewers via the connotation to 'nymphomania' - a condition of female sexual insatiability that plays no role in this screenplay... but who is gonna be attracted to a movie called ""Ninfa""?! There are a LOT of pretty glaring incongruities within the film - perhaps the most annoying is the choice of the lead 'bad guy' actor who sports an English/Aussie? accent in the midst of all the Italian ambiance. The director also doesn't handle the injection of the tale of 'Ninfa' into the plot very well as it is 'revealed' through the extra-sensory perceptions of the tortured Sarah - it is very confusing as to the time line of events and the reality of what's happening in 'flash-backs v/s 'visions'. The visual quality of the 'film' is also a little compromised as this is a 'shot on hi-def' video product that occasionally looks as such and detracts from the general 'reality' of the piece.On the positive side of the equation, however, the production values are decent and the performances adequate. As previously noted - there is a fair amount of female flesh on display in various scenes of love-making of both the hetero and lesbo variety.But in the final analysis my over-all impression was one of 'annoyance' at the confusing quagmire of concepts and images that the director was foisting on the audience and I was sorta 'happy' when the end credits rolled - not a 'good thing' for an exploitation flik! Worth a look (mostly for Ms Shepis body) - but more of a renter than a keeper, in my opinion. On the technical side - a nice clean (digital) widescreen image - English lang. (mostly) there are numerous scenes where it is Italian w/ Eng. subs - a few light weight 'extras'.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKPDH4OWYYFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001C3YX7U#wasThisHelpful","RCKPDH4OWYYFH","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's likely no coincidence that many of my favorite fantasy films of all time share a common composer - Bernard Herrmann! The importance of a good film score cannot be underestimated in its' ability to pull the audience into the action and raise the level of the experience.  This collection provides key themes and passages from some of my childhoods most memorable film experiences and just hearing the music I can still picture the scenes they accompanied. The recording quality is excellent and there is a great booklet of info about the music that gives insights into Herrmann's techniques.

"After Hours Cinema is one of a group of DVD authoring outfits that appears to be making it their mission to re-acquaint the modern world with the 'joys' of 70's vintage sex flix.  While many of their releases are pretty esoteric in their appeal - THIS collection which purports to provide the viewer with 3 examples of hard-core smut by the legendary Ed Wood would likely garner broader attention simply because of Wood's name and reputation. Looking beyond how 'authentic' these Wood-works might be and/or how much one sees of Wood in the films - how does this package stack up as a work of porn artfulness?!Well, as one might expect from the Director of what is commonly acknowledged to be one of the 'worst movies ever made' - they're pretty awful. IF the ""Ed Wood' factor was removed from the equation this trio of low budget sex romps would not likely raise an eyebrow of interest from anyone other than those die-hard devotees of 70's period porno - endless examples of similar sinema 'trash' are to be found in the vaults of distributors such as 'Something Weird Cinema' and the ""Alpha Blue Archive"".Physically speaking - the quality of the film transfers is pretty good - considering the relatively horrible quality of the source material.  This IS classic grindhouse fare and features all the imperfections one has come to expect from that genre: degraded film stock - massive color shifts - poor sound - inexplicable editing... it's all there to be 'enjoyed'. What sorta sets these flix apart, and would seem to identify them as products of Ed Wood's fevered cinema genius, might be the 'scripting'.  One of the more endearing aspects of Wood's stylings is his earnestness in trying to deliver a 'meaningful' film experience - even when the base-line is just a bunch of XXX humping.  This collection contains some hilarious examples of Wood's tendency to 'purple prose' which does much to lift the product above the mundanity of countless other similar cheap sex flix.Of the 3 offerings, ""The Young Marrieds"" provides the most 'hard-core' XXX action. A simple tale about a guy and his wife - he wishes that his mate would be a little less inhibited (like the strippers he stops in to watch every day after work!) and, after a series of fairly low-key connubial sex scenes, he ultimately convinces his up-tight wife to attend a swingers party where things actually go a little beyond what the young husband is ready to accept into his own sexual realm!  Lotsa 'hair' (everywhere) and gynacological close-up action to be appreciated in this one - the opening and closing sequences of the 'eternal ocean' gives Wood an opportunity to wax philosophical about 'man's condition'- CLASSIC!""Nympho Cycler"" features a pretty cute girl who is being 'pimped out' by a photographer character (played by Wood himself) until she gets tired of that schtick, hops on her motorcyle, and heads off looking for fun & adventure.  What she finds are: some lesbian hook-ups and a roll in the grass with another bike-riding adventurer - a Nordic sailor whose 'ship is in' in L.A. - they form a bit of a union until meeting a rather abrupt and unexpectedly violent ending. While this is definitely a 'sex flik' - there is not as much XXX material and some poor camera angles suck much of the heat out of most of the carnal action. Again, there are some bits of amusing dialogue that are decidedly Wood-ian, and there's some cool 60's pop inspired jazz music in the soundtrak on this one.""Shot On Location"" has a bit of the 'film within a film' premise - as a nudey Western is being produced throughout the story line and 'we' follow the various participants as they become involved in the making of the movie (including a classic 'casting couch' scene w/ a '14 yr old' starlette wannabe). Wood appears minimally in a couple of scenes - acting as the Director of the bent cowboy drama.  The females in this film are all fairly attractive - a stand-out being 70's porn hottie Rene Bond - but Ms Bond never actually gets naked in this one! Lotsa nudity and enthusiastic simulated screwing by the other libidinous cast members, but (again) it doesn't provide much truly hard-core action.All in all - a pretty decent 3 film package.  Other reviewers have mentioned possible substantial 'cuts' to the films - but, for my money, they were plenty LONG enuf!  Personally, I enjoyed this little taste of X-Rated Ed Wood and would recommend it - knowing full well that itz gonna be pretty lame.Minimal 'extras' on the disk - but there is a nice little booklet of background info included in the box case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27IY43ZP1D2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MB6OSRW#wasThisHelpful","R27IY43ZP1D2S","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this DVD in tandem with its' partner cannibalistic flik: ""Mondo Cannibal"" - both films helmed by Italian director Bruno Mattei and apparently shot back 2 back in the Philippines (standing in for Amazonia) and originally released in 2003.The DVD box art makes ""In the Land of Cannibals"" look like a typical cannibal-fest replete with lotsa hideous primitive tortures and flesh eating - BUT - this particular movie actually has relatively little  'cannibalism' portrayed.The minimalist plot involves a group of US soldiers who have been dispatched to rescue a politician's daughter from a fate worse than death after she and her expeditionary party have disappeared in the recesses of the Amazon jungle.Several of the actors from ""Mondo Cannibal"" are back - but in different roles in this film.  The characterizations and action are generally more plausible in this film, but what it makes up for in general 'quality', it loses in terms of 'fun' and cannibal content.The plot basically follows the soldiers as they trek through the dense underbrush with their 'guide' and every time they have an encounter with hostile natives they just blow them away with their superior fire-power.  Mattei reprises one 'famous' scene from Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust"" where a native woman is brutally murdered for her adulteress activities by her jilted mate ( she is later eaten by her tribe) - but there are relatively few other flesh-eating scenes presented.When the mercenaries finally arrive at the camp where they find the object of their search they discover that the 'white' woman has been elevated to the status of a sex goddess by the local tribe ( they like her blond hair!) and is kept in a drugged state until she is forced to come forth to participate in dance rituals.  This is the only area of the flik where any skin is on display... mostly provided by some bare breasted 'natives' and the 'fun' is quickly ended when the rescuers torch the village's grass huts and try to make their escape.  The 'big question' in these type of flix is generally: ""who makes it out alive"" and I'll leave it to the viewer to discover that answer for themselves, if they deign to check out this trite bit of cannibalistic foolishness.Over-all what this film provides is a lot of 'tensions' between the soldiers and many scenes of indigenous tribal folk getting mowed down by automatic weapons. Although it was an OK watch - ultimately it proved disappointing due to its' lack of actual cannibal action.  If one wishes to invest in either of these two recent Mattei re-releases I'd recommend ""Mondo Cannibal"" - it's derivative and cheezy but at least itz amusing.  This film is presented in Full-Screen format with a good clear picture quality - the only extra is the original trailer for the film.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU7GLADE5A2GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYA0E7W#wasThisHelpful","RU7GLADE5A2GG","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sensationalist films which capitalize upon one of our most basic cultural taboos - against dining on our fellow humans - have been around for a while - perhaps the most notable examples being the '70's vintage Italian efforts: ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""Cannibal Ferox""... both of which certainly 'pushed the envelope' for transgressive imagery on the silver screen. The plot device of pitting modern man against primitive man presented a great vehicle for showing all manner of barbarism perpetuated upon both humans and animals within a tissue thin veneer of anthropological relevancy. One would imagine that the genre had been pretty well 'mined' over the years and all the horrific visions of mutilated turtles and impaled women could be safely filed away as vestiges of the 'Savage '70's' style of shock cinema.Thus it was with some surprise that I noted the relatively recent production date (2003) for the 2 just re-released cannibal atrocities from (the late) Italian schlock-meister Bruno Mattei.  ""Mondo Cannibal"" must be considered as either an 'homage' or blatant rip-off (depending on how benevolent one is feeling about the Director) of Ruggero Deodato's aforementioned 'classic': ""Cannibal Holocaust"".  It follows the same basic premise of a group of modern film-makers heading into some primordial jungle to capture the primitive (people-eating) life-style of the natives and how their abuse of 'Star Trek's' prime directive for: 'not messing with indigenous cultures' gets them into a heap of trouble, and ultimately the digestive systems of their documentary subjects!Not to be out-done in the gore realm - Mattei starts right off with a gut wrenching scene of an (adulteress!) pregnant native woman being killed & her unborn fetus ripped out of her belly while the film-crew just stands by happily filming away.  Where do you go from there?!? ""Where"" - is to the back-story of a failing TV network and female host who determine to reverse their fortunes by giving the jaded viewing public 'what they want' in the blood 'n gutz arena via some 'hot' cannibal action. A 'crew' is hastily assembled and they all hike off into the unknown Amazonian 'green hell' to get their story.  As if the entire premise isn't ridiculous enuf - the way in which the 'film crew' inject themselves into the environment and cannibalistic proceedings strains even the most stalwart 'suspension of disbelief' factors, and the whole show becomes ever more absurd as they witness, and film, mounting atrocities performed by cheaply made-up 'natives' chomping on piles of day-glo red intestines and the like.For cannibal film fans I'd say that 'all the elements' are definitely provided - nudity, brutality, & stupidity abound.  The obvious negative to the whole exercise is that is has all been done before, better, by others. BUT - if you just can't get enuf primitive flesh eating excitement in your life - this could be a good addition to the collection of Cannibal cinema mayhem.  Almost hate to say it - but I kinda enjoyed it.The film is presented in Full-Screen ratio - nice clear picture - the only 'extra' is the original trailer for the flik.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R137EWK9JK5HIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYA0EB8#wasThisHelpful","R137EWK9JK5HIP","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Grindhouse double bill from the After Hours Cinema crew really manages to capture just how bizarrely lame porn could be 'back in the day' - and yet it also provides a fairly entertaining viewing experience.The disc includes 2 'features' each about 60 minutes long - both are full screen and in color (albeit somewhat faded).  The first show entitled: ""House of Kinky Pleasures"" (1975) is the more creative of the duo. In it 'we' follow a slinky European madame wielding a long cigarette holder as she ushers the viewer into a series of 'rooms' at her bordello - each of which presents a vignette of purportedly perverse sexual action. Room #1 offers a femdom scene with a domme tormenting a bound dude in his boxers a bit B4 ultimately blowing him - Room #2 presents a mini hippy orgy featuring 2 guyz and 2 gurlz AND a box of KFC! - ""Ummm - finger lickin' good!"" - Room #3 contains a little inter-racial action as a pair of B&W studs 'pleasure' a white chick, and Room # 4 takes the political incorrectness to new heights by presenting a scenario where 2 'southern belles' get it on with a white guy in 'black face'. The 'archival' print from which this DVD was mastered is pretty ratch-ed out and displays a lot of 'classic' grindhouse ambiance via dancing scratches and un-edited drop-outs. XXX action (w/ cute girls) abounds, and it has a pretty cool eclectic grab-bag of music in itz sound-trak... very watch-able!The subsequent 60 minutes are devoted to: ""Pleasure Cruise"" (1974).  This is a relatively mono-dimensional XXXercise involving a houseboat on a lake in Tennessee with a guy and 3 girls (a blond, a brunette, AND a redhead!) basically having sex, and dancing around naked on the top deck.A minor plot twist is injected when a couple of other guys come paddling up in a kids inflatable swimming pool and horn in on the party for a while - BUT - the houseboat grrrls unleash their rampant libidos upon the interlopers and they run off with their 'tails' between their legs - while the houseboat sails on with its fornicating crew happily boogey-ing down to an amazing sound-trak of pilfered rock hits!

"""Killer Mermaid"" starts off promisingly enuf!... A young couple are making out on the Adriatic sea shore - the girl takes off her top and goes into the clinch with her BF - BUT - suddenly HE is lured into and under the water by a mysterious haunting melody and the shocked girl is simultaneously dispatched by an, unseen, on-shore psycho killer. This duel threat scenario of land-based AND water-based killer(s) is an interesting concept and sets the stage for all the subsequent action - wherein the usual group of young people with a variety of socio/sexual entanglements get picked off one by one as the plot progresses. At the same time this is indicative of the, sort of, schizoid approach that this film demonstrates, as it moves forward, that I found tended to detract from its' potential success.  Is it a slasher flik OR is it a killer mermaid flik?!?While there WERE a few original concepts & creepy moments - much of the movie seemed derivative & pretty 'by the numbers'.  For starters - it was hard not to make comparisons with Spielberg's JAWS as 'Killer Mermaid' utilized so many of its' sorta 'over-used' techniques in attempting to provide thrills & chills... such as: the numerous underwater scenes with pulsating music alluding to the unseen aquatic threat - the grizzled old 'Quint'-like mariner who spins a long-winded scary tale of doom, and the key characters who ultimately end up in a vulnerable little boat on the sea anticipating an attack from the deep! Personally, I found it a little disappointing that so much time was devoted to the land based murderer - I was expecting and hoping for more mermaid action!On the 'plus' side:  the cast was attractive (lotsa skimpy bikinis!) and the dialog, albeit banal, was delivered adequately - though there was a LOT of verbal exposition that sorta slowed things down on several occasions.  The 'mermaid' was pretty effectively realized AND had an unusual feature... a remarkably nice butt! - not the 'classic' asexual fishy lower extremities one typically sees in mer-creatures - this one has an attractive pink 'booty' B4 the tail begins! She was pretty gorgeous... when she wanted to be.  It was also nice to see x-ploitation alumnus Franco Nero resurrected to fulfill the role of 'Nikos' - the sage old salt who tries to warn the young folk away from danger. The locations were interesting and definitely added to the 'sinister' feel of the film.On the 'negative' side of the equation, however, I would again note the formulaic nature of many of the plot devices and the manner in which the story is told - not many surprises here! There are some fairly massive incongruities in the action and the, previously mentioned, tendency to try to 'explain' things in long winded soliloquy that generally slackened the pace and tension of the proceedings.  Also - for fans of such - there ultimately was very little 'skin' on display beyond the brief opening sequence - Heck! even the 'topless' mermaid hardly revealed her upper torso to much advantage... apparently relying more on her 'siren song' to lure the men into her deadly embrace.Over-all I found this eastern-European stab at horror to be OK - but with a little more originality and imagination it coulda been so much more... a bit more screen time for the titular mermaid wouldn't have hurt either.  Perhaps more of a 'renter' than 'a keeper'- in my opinion - BUT worth a look!  Widescreen format - English language - some nice extras.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LRASHHJUI2U7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L6AW1GY#wasThisHelpful","R1LRASHHJUI2U7","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A huge 'thank you' to Mondo Macabro for finding this rare bit of Italo ero-weirdness and making it available in a great package.  I initially became aware of this film waaay back in the late 60's, when it was first released, via some 'production promo stills' in a men's magazine. The pix included several hot fetish images of pony girl action and whipping scenes with (for the day) remarkably high production values and great looking women. It was noted in the article that the film was Italian and it was entitled: ""The Slave"" - that was the last I ever saw or heard of it back then and over the succeeding years I had searched the internet in vain looking for any trace of it - now: ""hallelujah!"" Mondo Macabro has 'found it' and given it a 1st class presentation!As is explained in the detailed extras included on both of the DVD & Bluray formatted disks - this film was made by the prolific Italian Writer/Director; Pasquale Festa Campanile - based upon a best selling erotic book of the day entitled ""Check To The Queen"" (in Europe) & ""The Slave"" (in N. America). The plot follows the story of a beautiful, bored, young, aristocratic woman with masochistic tendencies who becomes the willing servant/slave of a wealthy actress/mistress and the kinky games that they get up to, and where it all leads. Whereas the source novel followed in the footsteps of previously published  Euro erotic S/M tales, such as ""The Story of O"" and ""L'Image' - the film: 'The Slave'  pre-dated (by nearly a decade!) many like cinematic eroductions, such as, French director Just Jaekin's (1970's) movie  versions of ""The Story of O"", and the (John Willie B&D comics inspired) 'Perils of Gwendeline"" - both of which contained similar fetish elements. Perhaps director Campanile was a bit ahead of his time with the transgressive BDSM content of his film - it apparently flopped at the domestic (Italian) box office, was never given a theatrical release in N. America, and faded quickly into obscurity - engendering the, previously noted, difficulty in finding any reference or access to it.While somewhat 'quaint', by today's standards, in the 'perverse' sexual realm -  ""The Slave"" provides a very satisfactory viewing experience on multiple levels. Both of the principal actresses are gorgeous and Haydee Politoff (as Silvia, 'the slave') spends a fair portion of the film minus clothing and/or sporting 'outrageous' 60's style fashions or fetish garb. The sets are over the top 60's pop inspired masterpieces and there's even an amazing mechanical horse that has to be seen to be believed.  The musical score is also xlnt classic Italo-schmaltz.  The scenes of harnessed pony girls and chained whipping that I carried so long in my memory are to be found in several 'fantasy/dream' sequences within the story - ironically they are given a sort of fuzzy-lensed treatment and are not as clear as the 'printed' production stills I had seen - yet itz great to finally see them in 'context'. The film IS rich in fetish imagery! - but - may not be considered as particularly 'erotic' in its' presentation of those elements from our somewhat 'jaded' modern perspective.Ultimately ""The Slave' succeeds primarily as a slice of 60's pop culture - combining fashion, fetish, and flesh into an amalgam that is visually very satisfying - even if the 'story' is a bit nebulous in its' conclusions.  I really enjoyed it.  The print quality (for regular DVD format) is excellent - Italian lang. w/ English subs - widescreen letterbox - and there are some great 'extras' ( in English!) with 2 informative interviews and interactive cast bios.Apparently a 'limited edition' of only 3500 copes - grab one qwik B4 it vanishes again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AUDBNSL6WAII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KI5SH02#wasThisHelpful","R1AUDBNSL6WAII","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As this film ""Young & Beautiful' began to tell its' story of the sexual (mis)adventures of a lovely young (17 year old) French maiden ""Isabelle"" it (initially) reminded me of another recent French film that explored the world of young women and prostitution: ""Student Services""(see my review of same for more on that film). In both movies the, rather disaffected, heroine of the tale dabbles in the 'play 4 pay' lifestyle to earn a little spending cash and both are seemingly emotionally quite distant from the intimate acts they are performing and the people that they are performing them with. But, whereas the plot of ""Student Services' never went much beyond the rather mono-dimensional self loathing evinced by its' lead female ""Young & Beautiful"" takes some interesting twists and turns and presents a much more complex set of characters and circumstances and is ultimately, I feel, a more engaging and successful film because of that fact.Perhaps this is partially due to the purported 'age' of the lead character - who determines to lose her 'cherry' on her 17th BD (and does!) then sets out to market herself on the internet as an 'escort' - all this while she is still quite young and living at home with her family.  It is ultimately this interaction w/ the complexities of the various family members that gives the film its' soul and poignancy.  The Director does a fine job of revealing the various story elements and personalities slowly and providing just enough information about them to make them real without becoming moralistic or overindulgent about any of the proceedings.The gorgeous ingenue lead actress (Marine Vacth) effectively portrays the (typically teenage) rather self-centered young woman who is coming to grips with her own physical sexuality but doesn't have much of a handle on the emotional aspects of it yet. She makes a very convincing 17 year old and rewards the viewer with many scenes sans clothing as she plies her trade - all of the sex scenes are tastefully presented - nuthin' gratuitous or XXX!  Ultimately this is a film dealing with the complex nature of human sexuality and family relationships - I found it to be refreshingly candid and non-judgmental in addressing these topics (doubtless a Euro/French touch!) and would recommend it as an intriguing viewing experience for just about anyone.

"I don't know about you - BUT - I reckon itz generally hard for guys to not have some prurient thoughts when watching the amazingly flexible maneuvers that female gymnasts go thru in their routines.  Doubtless the folks at Japan's Nikkatsu Studios were thinking the same way when they made the 'RomanPorno' engagingly entitled: ""Female Gym Coach: Jump and Straddle""  Wish I could say that this little 'pink' eroduction delivered on the promise of some nasty nubile acrobatic action - but it fell a little short on the erotic scale for me.In the threadbare plot - the girl's gymnastic team at a big business corporation is shocked and saddened when they learn that the firm has decided to cancel their gymnastics program, just before a competition.But, it turns out that the executives aren't really totally axe-ing the squad - they just want to shift the focus to 'rhythmic gymnastics' because it provided a 'sexier' image to help promote the corporation.  As part of the change-over the 'female coach' is replaced by a male coach (so much for the film's title!?!) and, as it turns out, he and the female coach had a little affair back when she was a young high school girl with major gymnastic aspirations - their 'coupling' apparently un-nerved her and ruined her professional sports ambitions as well as doing a similar 'number' on the male coach's amorous ego, as 'we' later learn.Nevertheless - everyone decides to give the rhythmic gymnastics 'a go' and the girls start to develop new routines in anticipation of another competition.  The majority of the flik's short (67 min.) run-time is devoted to the various tensions (both athletic and erotic) that develop between the girls, the 'hot' new male coach, and some of the corporate executives.  There's a lot of leotard shedding and hula-hoop action to be enjoyed along with the obligatory soft-core sex scenes every few minutes.The little 'background' write-up by Jap. film expert Jasper Sharp that is included in the box states that the film's director: Koyu Ohara (who helmed over 50 RomanPornos for Nikkatsu!) was equally adept at directing heavy duty transgressive film's (such as the S&M vehicle ""Fairy In A Cage"") and the 'lighter' fare - such as 'Female Gym Coach'.  Over-all - this is a pretty 'light-weight' erotic production with a goodly amount of subtle humor throughout.  The 2 lead actresses are attractive enuf and they do their fair share of soft-core naked writhing in the sex scenes.  There is, happily, no digital 'fogging' censorship in this film, perhaps because the sex scenes are not particularly 'revealing'.  There are some amusing 'surprises' as the tale moves onward, but this one really seemed 'short' and ended just as it felt like things could heat up a little.Par usual - the DVD visual quality is xlnt - widescreen format - Jap. language w/ English subs - the film's original 'trailer' is the only 'extra'. A fun watch, but perhaps not the best of the Impulse/Nikkatsu releases.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIJ9DOZJW1GDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JH1E054#wasThisHelpful","RIJ9DOZJW1GDM","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Successive Slidings of Pleasure"" is another of the recently released DVDs of films written and directed by the French auteur Alain Robbe-Grillet.  For decades, Robbe-Grillet's works have been difficult to access - especially for N. American audiences - but a recent arrangement with the, deceased, film-maker's wife (Catherine Robbe-Grillet ) has now made 6 of his earliest films from the 1960-70's period available. Redemption DVD has issued 5 individual disks in N. America, and in England the British Film Institute (BFI) has produced a box set that includes all 6 features in a single package (note: the BFI set is a Region 2 PAL format & requires a 'region-free' DVD player to access).""Successive Slidings of Pleasure""  was made when Robbe'Grillet was in mid-career and it, arguably, might be said to represent the director at his peak - with all of his 'trademark' elements developed to their fullest. This is really an 'art film' with a capital 'A' and is full of enuf ambiguities and enigmatic images and plot twists to keep the viewer constantly perplexed.  In a sense, this is Robbe-Grillete's goal as he 'plays' with the conventional mechanisms of cinema in un-conventional ways to challenge the viewer's perceptions of the reality that his screenplays promulgate, and subsequently provides a very surreal viewing experience - somewhat reminiscent of Bunuel's early works. This movie has the barest of 'plots' based around the premise of 2 women (of 'easy virtue') living together - one of whom is mysteriously murdered - and the other is 'questioned' as a suspect.  While this may sound straight forward - the way in which the director presents the characters and situations is totally non-linear and ultimately provides no concrete conclusions.  Events and people are introduced from multiple perspectives and time frames as the film progresses and the director 'toys' with the audience's 'suspension of disbelief' by constantly altering the sense of the reality of what is occurring in the film.  After viewing several of Robbe-Grillet's works it becomes apparent that for this director the 'film' itself is the artistic 'experience' - not the 'story' that is being told.  Once one abandons the premise that anything is going to 'make sense' it is possible to slip into the film's lush visuals and go-along for the psychedelic ride. Robbe-Grillet utilizes many techniques to reinforce his surrealistic visions - including startling, incongruous sound effects in many scenes and an eerie frozen motion for the actors on occasion that makes them appear almost like mannequins within the action.  There are also many allusions to other 'contemporary' artists & art movements.BUT - what makes Robbe-Grillete's films stand out from many of the other New Wave-ish directors of his day was his particular fascination with erotica and especially the realm of 'dominance and submission' - aspects of which he and his wife practiced in their own personal life, and which found their way into many of his cinematic efforts.  ""Successive Slidings of Pleasure"" contains quite a bit of full female nudity throughout its content and many scenes that feature BDSM elements (as per the DVD box-cover image!). Robbe-Grillet presents most of his sadeo-erotic imagery in artful tableaux rather than graphic 'porn' style action - and it is all rather lyrical in its' depiction.  There is even a bit of 'nuns-ploitation' woven into the mix.  While relatively 'tame' by modern standards these transgressive erotic visions were off-putting, to some, back in the day of their initial screening, and helped contribute to the suppression, and resultant obscurity, of Robbe-Grillet's films.In the final analysis I found ""Successive Slidings of Pleasure"" to be an engaging and unique viewing experience - replete with very beautiful actresses shedding their cloths regularly - and many exquisitely photographed scenes.  Enigmatic in the extreme, perhaps a trifle tedious at times, but definitely worth watching.  This film is presented in color - pristine print quality - French language with English subtitles... and some nice extras.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EP7YEIV7YIBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H206P6Y#wasThisHelpful","R2EP7YEIV7YIBY","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""L'Immortelle"" is one of several recent releases of films written and directed by French writer and film-maker Alain Robb-Grillet.  In North America it appears that the Redemption DVD authoring group have secured the rights to distribute his works - while in England the British Film Institute (BFI) has the honor.  Redemption has issued 5 films/disks 'individually' while the BFI  has presented them in a nice 6 film retrospective box-set ( a format that is ultimately less expensive per film).  The BFI set is , however, in the Euro Region 2 PAL format and requires a 'region-free' DVD player to view.  Regardless of 'region code/format' these are films well worth checking out!The majority of Robb-Grillete's works have been generally un-available for 'home viewing' for decades. - this current collection presents some of his earliest works from the 1960-70's period when he was first trying his hand as a Director, after achieving his initial recognition for scripting the French art-house classic: ""Last Year At Marienbad"".  ""L'Immortelle"" was, in fact, his first solo directorial outing and it continues to feature many of the surreal and enigmatic elements that were explored in '...Marienbad"".After viewing a body of Robb-Grillete's works, and reading some analysis of his films by cinema scholars, a pattern begins to emerge that helps the viewer to appreciate where he was coming from and what he was trying to achieve.  Such background info is really helpful because, without it, his films may initially seem very disjointed and abstract - even by art-house standards.  Robb-Grillete enjoyed 'playing with' the peculiarities inherent in the format of cinema and using , and 'abusing' them, to his own ends to create a film experience that challenges the viewer's normal expectations for how a film should evolve.  He pretty much ignores the concept of a linear plot progression in most of his scenarios and his plots and characters constantly fold back in upon themselves providing multiple viewpoints and time frames that ultimately provide a very surreal experience.  One should not expect everything to wrap up tidily at the end of the show but one may expect the film to 'stick with them' for a while after viewing due to the provocative nature of the images and concepts presented - almost like a 'waking-dream'.Alain Robb-Grillete, & his 'partner' Catherine (who makes regular appearances in his films) were both noted for their ""outre' "" sexual preferences that leaned in the BDSM direction, and many of his films featured elements that portrayed this personal penchant for  S/M symbolism and lifestyle.  Not surprisingly - this flirtation with 'forbidden' sexual practices often drew the ire of film censors and some of his film's were 'banned' in certain countries for many years - contributing to his obscurity and the (previous) difficulty in accessing his works.  Ironically (and despite all the '50 Shades of Gray' allusions on the box cover)  ""L'Immortelle"" actually contains virtually no images or references to these themes of sexual dominance & submission!... nor any 'nudity' within its' contents - whereas later films ( such as 'Trans Europe Express', 'Successive Slidings of Pleasure"", and ""Gradiva' for example) provide a hefty dose of the aforementioned.That info notwithstanding - ""L'Immortelle"" is one of the 'spaciest' most intriguing movies I have seen in a long while and qualifies as a genuine surreal experience.  It is practically useless to try to describe its' 'plot' because it doesn't really have one, yet the film mesmerizes the viewer with a hypnotic quality that is quite unique. Beautifully filmed in B&W in exotic locales in Instanbul, Turkey - the 'place' becomes an integral part of Robbe-Grillete's 'vision' and alludes to fantasies of mysterious Eastern harems & slave girls as personified by the belly-dancer on the box cover who is featured in a brief dance segment - the characters, and audience, are caught up in Robb-Grillete's dream-like spell.  ""L'Immortelle"" is a great intro to this creative film-maker's work and a pretty psychedelic viewing experience.  Highly recommended!

"After seeing all the 5 star customer reviews of this film and reading the hype on the box that referred to it as an amalgam of such masters of weirdness as 'Cronenberg, Lynch, Romero, etc.'  I figured I'd give it a look - heck... I enjoy a neo-old-school gothic silent B&W horror flik as much as the next guy.... it sounded intriguing!In the aftermath of the viewing experience, however, I'd have to say that this 'indie' effort elicited mixed feelings as to its' (reviewer vaunted)  'brilliance'.  I would give high marks to the film's producers for intent of concept, and some of the photography was visually very artful - many beautifully composed shots, and itz hard for B&W films to not feel 'arty'. Unfortunately, working against these 'positives' was a hard to shake sense of the rather amateurish quality of the production... my 'suspension of disbelief' factor was constantly challenged by the obvious low budget aspect of everything... this really had the feel of a 'film school' projectNoting that the entire piece was filmed in Pittsburgh, PA - I would give the director and cameraman praise for conjuring up a vision that managed to evoke some measure of gothic ambiance, but the  obvious use of derelict buildings as sets and the unshakable sense that the 'actors' were likely non-professional 'friends' of the film-makers kept me from being 'immersed' in the proceedings.  The plot of the film was interesting, but certainly not original, ultimately emerging as sort of a blend between Frankenstein and Phantom of the Opera.  - all the elements were present for a poignant tale, but somehow I didn't find that the total package was very 'engaging'.  The film is listed as being presented in B&W AND color - the 'color' is actually found in certain 'flash-back' scenes that are presented in the 'tinted' (golden) technique that some old silent films employed to provide a 'sense' of color to the monochromatic images. I found the specially written and performed music track to be one of the more interesting aspects of the production - the film title does include the sub-text:  '...A Fugue in the Key of Flesh' and the music did much to help the film.  The 'flesh' element is provided by a few scenes of the (fully) naked 'Esmeralda'  - as her 'mad scientist/lover' 'Doctor Janick' attempts to resuscitate her plague ravaged dead body.Over-all - I felt 'Prometheus Triumphant'  was a filmic effort that succeeded in some of its' 'intent' and visual elements, but didn't really deliver an engagingly integrated  experience to the viewer.  With a little more budget and 'practice', however,  these could be some emerging film-makers to keep an eye out for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REJ2DQ6R3XLSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NH4CIU#wasThisHelpful","REJ2DQ6R3XLSN","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Switchblade DVD authoring have released a duo of Japanese 'women in prison'  flix - the first of which is entitled ""Hellhole-Inmate 611"".  One can only speculate that this release has been timed to 'capitalize' on the popularity of the WIP genre that the cable TV show ""Orange Is The New Black"" has recently engendered in the general population - even though the 'original production date' for ""Hellhole"" is listed as 2007 - pre-dating the Netflix produced feminine penal potboilerSadly, I would have to say that ""Hellhole - Inmate 611"" is a pretty lack-lustre affair that didn't really deliver much of what the 'fan' of WIP films generally looks for in the genre.  This premier offering in the 'series' is a 'shot-direct-to video' (full screen) production that focuses on a specific cell of 5 inmates at an all-female prison.  Each prisoner is 'introduced' with a bit of text denoting the crime that they were incarcerated for and the prison routine is described.  Into this mix a new prisoner is introduced - a beauteous 'pop celebrity' who was busted for assaulting a female rival for her boy friend's affections.  Things start off promisingly enough with the usual 'strip search' intro to the slammer and there is a tension created by the animosity towards the fallen  'celebrity' by one of the head female guards - but little of the 'nastiness' that usually provides the 'fun' in these prison based scenarios ever is developed to full potential.The plot sorta see-saws back and forth between un-exciting events transpiring within the prison and lengthy sequences devoted to flash-backs by the incarcerated 'pop star' as to how she was duped into a bogus relationship by her super-wealthy devious boyfriend and his 'real' GF - which led to her 'crime of passion' that landed her in the slammer.  There are disappointingly few flashes of flesh throughout the whole affair (heck - there's not even a 'shower' scene - the 'hallmark' of the WIP franchise!) and the principal actress never even gets naked.  I'd have to say that the 'sexually charged' description of the film's content is largely bogus and very little heat is generated within the walls of this particular prison.  The girls featured are all 'cute' , but they spend most of the flik dressed in drab gray prison garb and get up to very few 'activities' that might be considered worthy of note by fans of sex-ploitational cinema.At least the whole sad mess is relatively 'short' (75 min. playtime) so not too much of your time is 'wasted' - but allow me to save you even that brief slice of life and recommend taking a pass on this particular product (and its' sequential companion piece: ""Hellcage - Inmate 611 - Part 2"") - which is equally dismal.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E9DLG0ELX8RX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E688HG6#wasThisHelpful","R2E9DLG0ELX8RX","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Also, sadly, similar to the first film, the lead actress never gets naked in any of the proceedings - that 'honor' is left to some of the secondary characters in the tale.  This part of the story has a few soft core sex scenes scattered throughout its brief (77 min) run-time - most of which occur during the out of prison flash-backs - there are actually no sex scenes in the prison!  Nor is there 'full' female nudity to be enjoyed (tho breasts put in the occasional appearance) - but also no annoying digital censorship (in either movie)- mostly because the skin/sex scenes are so low key.Can't really recommend this (shot direct to video)  limp excursion into the WIP realm - true fans of the genre should perhaps look to the plethora of 'older' Japanese WIP offerings ( such as ""Female Prisoner Scorpion"" ) - many of which really did provide the 'perverse' action alluded to by the box-cover hype for 'Hellcage"" that it, unfortunately, did not truly deliver.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V31NVHFI38PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJX95J0#wasThisHelpful","R1V31NVHFI38PQ","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who enjoy the peculiar perversity that typifies certain genres of Japanese ero-cinema - this release of Nikattsu Studios: ""Sex Hunter: 1980"" from the Synapse/Impulse DVD authoring groups continually expanding collection of 'Roman-Porno' flix should be cause for celebration!The disk contains the usual, welcome, little  background write-up pamphlet by Japanese 'Pink' film scholar Jasper Sharp that gives some context to the piece.  ""Sex Hunter: 1980"" was directed by one of Nikkatsu's more transgressive directors: Toshiharu Ikeda whose hand was also at the tiller for the (relatively) well known horrorgorefest: ""Evil Dead Trap"", and the sexually charged ""Angel Guts-Red Porno"".  Sharp describes director Ikeda as a jovial individual and remarks on the contrast between his actual personality and the extremely bent visions that he manifested on the cinema screen!... and ""Sex Hunter: 1980"" is indeed a 'bent' tale.The screenplay was penned by Manga creator Masahiro Kakefuda and there is a decidedly manga-esque  feel to the film - it generally felt like a twisted Anime feature brought to life!  Japanese S/M anime plots often involve tales of the sexual corruption of 'innocent' girls - lured into a 'den of iniquity' at some sinister 'institute', and that is precisely the plot line of this flik... wherein the lovely aspiring ballerina 'Miki' is offered a spot in a prestigious dance school operated by the, older but still gorgeous, 'former' dancer 'Akiko' - who also just happens to be the sister of Miki's boyfriend - who has mysteriously disappeared.  It becomes rapidly apparent that the 'dance academy' features 'lessons' in 'arts' other than ballet as Miki stumbles upon a foursome of naked 'ballerinas' engaged in a lesbian orgy, and that Akiko has some particularly nasty plans in mind for her that center around an incestuous 'relationship'  she has been carrying on with her (own!) 'missing' brother.  Akiko has jealously determined to eliminate Miki from her siblings romantic life by reducing her virginal 'rival' to a sex starved slut - thus denigrating her in her brother's eyes.  The bulk of the film is devoted to chronicling 'how' this debauched transformation is accomplished and the ironic outcome of it all.It is a truism that many Japanese ero-flix rely as much on the perverse 'ideas' that they present to the viewer as they do on more conventional 'visual' nudity & copulation elements in their sexual scenarios, In this respect ""Sex Hunter"" must get an A+ for transgressive weirdness of 'ideas', and this is the reason that I would bestow a 5 star rating upon it.  IF 'you' enjoy the concept/depiction of sexual humiliation (of and by) beautiful women then this is a film that delivers the goods.  The two principle actresses are very pleasing to behold and the 'action' is non-stop. Lotsa nudity & extreme kinkiness (including one of the most bizarre 'product placements' ever!) - but be forewarned that there is a (brief) bit of the annoying digital censorship imposed by Japanese laws over the 'nasty' parts of the human anatomy in a couple of scenes.  Generally, however, this is tour d' force of transgressive mayhem that may be enjoyed by fans of such... personally - I loved it.It is interesting to note that the, so-called, Roman Porno movies actually played largely to a  female audience in Japan when they were first introduced.  One must wonder at the reaction that the kinky action portrayed in films like ""Sex Hunter"" engendered in this segment of the viewing public!?!  This film did go so 'over-the-top' in its' depictions of degradation that the film studio executives apparently admonished director Ikeda to 'tone it down' for his 'next' production.On the technical side - the film is presented in the typical Nikkatsu letter-box widescreen format with an exceptionally clear transfer image quality  - the English sub-titles are well done.  The only 'extra' on the disk is the original film 'trailer' - but the box does include the, aforementioned, informative background write-up booklet.  Highly recommended for aficionados of Japanese ero-weirdness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OO9LEA2B8BCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM0JY4K#wasThisHelpful","R3OO9LEA2B8BCW","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Full Moon DVD authoring group have re-re-released this 'infamous' Italian 'naziploitation' flik as part of their emerging ""Grindhouse Collection' of marginal movies. As other reviewers have noted - this trashy bit of exploitation began its' life under the Euro-title ""The Beast In Heat"" and gained more notoriety than it likely deserved by virtue of being one of the earliest of the films 'banned' in Britain by its' Board of Censors. Perhaps because of this early 'bad reputation' many cult cinema fanatics (such as myself) have, of course!, sought it out to see just what was SO horrific about it?! The sad truth is that, particularly by modern standards, the answer is: 'not much' - except possibly the acting & production values. That said - personally, I actually didn't find the film to be as 'bad' as many other reviewers seemed to... tho I CAN see why fans of the sick & twisted cinema might feel a tad 'let-down' by this one.When I was growing up back in the 60's - the magazine racks always had a bunch of 'Mens True Adventure' style mags that featured lurid cover art of various WWII 'war horror' type stories - most of which involved a semi-nekkid girl being terrorized in some fashion by the 'bad-guys'. Generally these stories were based around a plot that involved the 'good-guys' battling the bad guys and somewhere along the way there were some spicy scenes of torturous abuse of women to act as a story device to justify the vindictive retribution that usually formed the climax of the tale. ""SS Hell Camp"" is just like one of these magazine stories - 'brought to life' - on the screen. Thus it isn't really surprising that much of the plot is devoted to following the actions of the 'resistance fighters' as they confront the evil Nazi menace that is threatening their town. Maybe, back in the day, the scenes of the 'military' action would have been 'engaging' - but - now-a-days itz more the 'horror porn' factor that attracts. SO - what are the pros & cons of this seminal example of SS inspired nasti-ness?On the (s)exploitational PLUS side: 'SS Hell Camp' has full female (and male) nudity during the (relatively few) scenes involving either 'sex' &/or 'torments'. There is essentially one fairly lengthy scene in the 'interrogation room'  wherein both men & women are made to endure such 'stock' torments as: finger nail pulling, electric shocks to the privates, & whipping - as well as the more unusual: ravaging by the titular GMO 'beast' man/creature, AND the famously cheesy scene of guinea pigs 'standing-in' for rats as they ostensibly are 'clawing their way through' a victim's abdomen. Pretty horrific stuff!  Also a general 'plus' is the visual quality of the Full Moon DVD transfer - it provides a nice clean/sharp widescreen picture.On the less positive front: very little excitement is generated by any of the events pictured - not much empathy for any of the characters portrayed - laughable dubbing, and minimal productions values ALL work together to provide a remarkably 'flat' exploitation viewing experience... which IS sort of the antithesis of 'why' anyone watches these things in the first place. To top it all off - there's not even actually a concentration 'camp' in the film!SO - all in all - a relatively lack-lustre showing - one's time might be better spent re-watching similar fare such as the classic:  ""Ilsa - She Wolf of the SS"" or ""Love Camp 7""- flix that more deliver what one looks for in this particular genre - BUT, for archival and/or complete-ist purposes, naziploitation fans may (still) wish to 'check in' to the SS Hell Camp for a brief visit - especially if the 'price is right'.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PO70Q1FPIDGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8TN73K#wasThisHelpful","R2PO70Q1FPIDGO","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Night of the Cobra Woman"" is one of the more obscure of Roger Corman's low budget pot-boilers and it gets a nice reprise in this recent release onto DVD for the first time. There are a couple of good 'extras' on the disk: interviews with both the Afro-American serpentine star of the piece Marlene Clark, and Mr Corman himself - both recalling anecdotes about the film's original production.  Corman reveals that the Cobra Woman concept evolved from the fact that his company was shooting several pictures in the Phillipines back in the 1970's (mostly some of his infamous women in (jungle) prison flix) and things were going so well that he figured he should also try making a 'horror' film there.  Thus he flew a few American actors down to Manila and hooked them up with a bunch of cobras - resulting in the titular snake-woman vehicle.The film itself is typical low-budget Corman fare featuring minimal production values and relatively clunky performances by the ingenue cast members but it is sorta fun to watch none-the-less.  Much 'suspension of disbelief' is helpful in buying the plot line that involves the lead character being bitten by a magical cobra which somehow grants immortality (rather than death) but requires the bitten individual to 'infect' others with her 'venom' in order to remain youthful.  Into the cobra woman's realm stumble a cute young female student (played by the awkwardly named: Joy Bang) who is doing her thesis on (appropriately enuf) snake venom! and her boyfriend who is coming to visit her.  The boyfriend gets fanged by the mysterious 'snake lady' who lives in the mountains and he develops what appears to be sorta a bad case of acne unless his new snakey lover gives him another dose of her particular brand of 'love juice'.  The cobra woman herself must regularly put the bite on people in order to maintain her youthful beauty and she starts to develop some disturbingly scaley skin disorders until she gets her next 'fix'.In classic Corman fashion the film features a bit of nudity on the part of the cast's 2 female leads and there is new meaning given to the term 'skin-flick' as the snake-ish lead actress (literally!) sheds her skin a couple of times during the movie. Kinda creepy - but thatz all part of the fun and there are cobras-a-plenty slithering over everyone throughout.  The quality of the DVD transfer is excellent - despite the B&W box cover art the film is in color- and the run-time does match to the original 85 minutes (despite some conflicting info on the Amazon page).  Over-all I found this to be an amusingly quirky little flik with a nice DVD presentation... perhaps a good addition to one's Corman Collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RU86908Z1YKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV054CO#wasThisHelpful","R2RU86908Z1YKZ","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As fan of 'women in prison' flix I found the movie ""JAILBAIT"" to provide a very acceptable, albeit rather 'by the numbers', modern foray into the venerable WIP genre of exploitation movies. Pretty much all the 'stock' action that one has come to expect and enjoy from the incarcerated females scenario are present: a 'wrongfully accused' heroine, the de-rigeur humiliating body cavity search, lotsa communal showers, a despicable warden, inter-racial tensions, lesbian love-ins, bad cafeteria food, AND full nudity abound.The lead actress (Sara Malakul Lane) does a credible job as the sexually abused teenager (with outstanding cello playing skills!) who gets 'sent up the river' after accidentally killing her lecherous step dad while he is in mid molestation mode - though her purported 17 yr old persona is somewhat challenged when she removes her clothes (which she does A LOT!) to reveal a body that looks like it's got a few more years on it than advertised (but is VERY pleasing to behold, nonetheless!). She's got great freckles, and can even act - as her 'character' must come to grips with the brutal realities of prison life.The plot moves forward with a satisfying predictability and decent performances all around - nothing really 'new' here - but then why mess with a successful formula?!

"This compilation of the 'good parts' from dozens of 70's and 80's vintage mainstream movies presents a satisfying cavalcade of major actresses (American and European) revealing their bodies in steamy sequences lifted from their films.

The skin scene is then followed by an interesting follow-up photo and blurb as to 'what' the actress is currently doing with their life.The visual quality of the sequences from the various films depicted is somewhat variable but most are good and presented in whatever 'screen ratio' format the original picture was presented in.  The women are , of course, gorgeous & naked throughout. From a strictly economic standpoint this is a tremendous value as it would cost hundreds of dollars to assemble all of the full length movies that the clips were taken from.  For what it is - this is a well produced and presented package and a fun watch - highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E8213AS2TMCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006M3M5FM#wasThisHelpful","R1E8213AS2TMCX","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The common element in this 2 4 1 'Drive In' package from the Vinegar Syndrome authoring outfit appears to be the Directorial 'brilliance' of Eric Haims - a film-maker whose ambitious ineptitude would make the infamous Ed Wood proud!Both of these, wildly divergent, films are of a 70's vintage 'adult' variety but, sadly,  display relatively little skin or sex scenes of an arousing nature.""Jekyll & Hyde Portfolio"" appears to have taken its' inspiration from the Italian giallo genre that was emerging from Europe at the time of its' original conception. In the murky plot line - females at a nebulous 'institution' are being mysteriously murdered by an un-seen killer who often strikes when they are involved in having sex.  In giallo tradition, there is a brief tableaux of each murder victim. naked and covered with day-glo red blood as the body count rises. Unfortunately this action is presented with all the skill and sophistication of an amateur high school play making the long sequences of 'drama' between the nude scenes pretty unbearable.  In what can only be imagined to be a warped homage to the infamous animal killing sequences in Italian exploitation director Ruggero Deodato's 'Cannibal Holocaust' there are 2 extended scenes of frog dissection presented for no apparent reason other than to gross the audience out - it certainly made me cringe!  Little empathy is developed for virtually any of the characters so there's not a lot to engage the viewer as the confusing mess grinds towards its' enigmatic conclusion that alludes to a Jekyll & Hyde style split personality for the killer.Rene Bond is minimally featured - but neither she, nor any of the other bevy of young lovelies on the chopping block, show more than scant moments of skin.  Almost a 'so bad itz good' viewing experience - but not quite 'bad' enuf to be truly enjoyable even by that criteria.In 'Clockwork Blue""  director Haims tries his hand at 'comedy' and comes up equally limp.  After a baffling opening sequence that alludes to some 'heavenly intervention' by a black 'Uncle Tom' character who watches the plot progress on a (I kid you not!) watermelon television!... a bunch of time is wasted setting up the 'time travel' hypothesis that forms the basis for the plot.  A lame guy is catapulted into various 'famous' historic 'romances' via a magic watch.  Caesar & Cleopatra, Louis XVI & Marie Antoinette, John Smith & Pocahontas,  Henry VIII & Anne Boleyn (and others) are all included in brief vignettes as the befuddled time traveler pops into the scene.  Perhaps the director was shooting for a Mel Brooks style historic comedy (with tits)  but there wasn't enuf of either comedy nor breasts to make this one enjoyable.  The bright spots in the mess were provided by 70's adult luminaries Susanna Fields (as Marie Antoinette) and Rene Bond (as Anne Boleyn) who both get naked for a few moments.  There are tiny flashes of full female nudity in this flik but waaaay too much time is spent with everyone dressed in period garb spouting un-funny comedic lines.All in all - I found this to be one of Vinegar Syndromes more disappointing releases.  Quirky, to be sure, but not really delivering a very satisfactory viewing experience as a 'skin-flik'.  This one is definitely more of a 'renter' than a 'keeper', in my opinion.  On the 'technical' side, though, the visual transfer quality of both (widescreen) films is excellent.  No extras.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AFIHBRFD62T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INCVTYI#wasThisHelpful","R2AFIHBRFD62T4","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 'product description' included for this DVD pretty well sums up the essence of the film's storyline but I would add that I found this to be one of the most all around enjoyable movies produced by Czech fantasy film-maker Karel Zeman that I have seen.  People who are familiar with Zeman's work will find all of his trademark stylistic elements well represented in this imaginative tale which celebrates, and brings to life, the writings & visions of Victorian period SciFi  author Jules Verne. Live actors are blended with animated artworks to create an atmosphere reminiscent of the fanciful engravings that illustrated the books and magazines of Verne's day.  Zeman's artistry makes even the most fantastic inventions appear plausible and the story contains many examples of fabulous machinery... a 'Steampunk' lovers dream!Zeman often injects some sly political satire into his works and I found 'The Stolen Airship' to be one of the most 'amusing' of his pieces that I have viewed.  Visual puns abound and the sheer cleverness of some of his mechanical creations caused many a chuckle as the plot unfolded.  Zeman uses a subdued color palette that creates the feeling of old 'tinted' photographs and adds to the 'period' feeling of all the imagery.  This disk also has 3 additional short subjects included that are of an earlier vintage than Zeman's feature piece but have similar subject matter and show examples of some of the early fantasy film-makers works that influenced Zeman (such as George Melies).Zeman's films may be considered a bit 'quaint' by modern special effects standards but he represents a prime example of the vanishing breed of 'solo' visionaries who hand-crafted his filmic fantasies. The quality of the DVD transfer is very good.  The sound is in Czech language with English subtitles.  My only 'beef' with the product was that the (sole) 'distributor' would only ship to addresses within the U.S. which created a bit of a hassle in getting the disc to Canada.  Otherwise - a great film - highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KV7733XAF9SK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SYJDMW#wasThisHelpful","R1KV7733XAF9SK","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 2 disk compendium of some of the weirder 'loops' in 42nd Street Pete's vast collection of ancient erotica definitely fulfills the promise of:""Something To Offend Everyone!""Perhaps the first thing that's gonna 'offend' a lot of 'modern' viewers is the (relatively) horrible visual quality of, pretty much all, of these depraved little vignettes. Filmed & presented, as they were, in the diminutive 8mm format - and originally shot in generally less than professional circumstances - these short films are about as grainy and degenerated as possible while still conveying a visual image. It CAN be frustrating, with our modern expectation of digitally clear images, to strain the eyes to see details and facial features amidst the dancing scratches & bad lighting that characterized the 'grindhouse experience' - BUT - for those willing to give it a try - this double disk set of 'extreme sleaze' offers some perverse scenarios not likely to be found in modern day porn.Pete (accompanied by the comely, albeit silent, fetish diva: Lili St Claire) intros each of the brief loops with a bit of a synopsis of the action contained there-in. His info is (unfortunately) not particularly informative per any 'background' to the loop(s) on display - but he does call attention to some of the 'peculiarities' of the carnal action presented - which is a good thing! because some of it would, doubtless, elude the casual viewer. Pete has dug deep into his trove to find this batch of aberrant fun and the emphasis is on the 'rough' and 'strange' end of the erotic spectrum. Pretty much every 'popular' deviant fetish is represented by a loop or two - both in color and glorious B&W. While most of the 'actors' are nameless 'one shot wonders' - some 'classic adult stars' put in 'early career' appearance - including XXX 'Deep Throat' superstar (to be) Linda Lovelace who features prominently in 2 separate loops that are particularly 'bent'.The disk has an 'extra' with Pete talking about the 'bad old days' of under the counter porn - when many of the little 5 minute film loops sold for as much as $100.00 each! - which makes this (20+ !) 'loop' collection a heck of a deal! For real 'grindhouse' devotees I'd suggest that you: 'adjust your expectations accordingly' - sharpen up the 'old eyes', and prepare to be 'amazed' by some of the wild stuff that free-lovin' folks back in the 'sick 70's' were committing to celluloid.It should be noted that all of the actual 'loops' are presented (as per original release) without ANY sound - other than the superimposed film projector 'clatter' - no cheesy music or narration to distract from the 'experience'. There is a goodly helping of previews (on both disks) to lure one to further explorations into the degenerate(d) world of period porn. As Pete himself admonishes: ""Stay Sick!""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RUGHTUQGSWQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CXBRK0#wasThisHelpful","R1RUGHTUQGSWQX","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit that I got sucked into checking out this French film ""Tied"" based on the starring presence of the gorgeous Euro Model/Actress Laetitia Casta, and the premise/promise of some kinky sex play. This review is therefor skewed to reflect the Laetitia watching experience. As Laetitia-philes know... Ms. Casta made her initial North American splash, about a decade ago, as a model for the Victoria's Secret lingerie catalogs and has been generally touted as: 'one of the world's most beautiful women'. Thus it was with some enthusiasm that I anticipated viewing her in a filmic role as a dominatrix in, what sounded like, a potentially intriguing psychosexual-thriller.The film delivered by director Hlne Fillires, however, somehow managed to suck most of the potential sexiness out of the proceedings and, instead, provided a relatively confusing story-line revolving around a trio of enigmatic and un-engaging characters.  Virtually no attempt is made to offer any involving back-story to the participants, and ambitious, but flawed, time shifting editing techniques only add to the quandary of the: 'who, what, where, and when' of transpiring events - and why should we care!?!  Laetitia spends much of the film just looking intensely perplexed about the whole situation (I could sorta relate!) and there's not much 'chemistry' between her and either of the 2 neurotic men that the screenplay asserts she is attracted to.All of this vague-ness might have been forgiven if there was a little hot sex or a bit of skin to carry the show along, but even in that department ""Tied"" falls flat and contains neither.  You'd think that there would be an opportunity for the X-super model to don some fetish gear for a scene, but Laetitia spends much of the movie dressed in bland 'work-out' wear.  While this film does enjoy a slickly sophisticated production style and decent performances all around - the end result left me feeling flat.  Perhaps more of a 'renter' than 'a keeper'.  Worth a look for the lovely Laetitia, but it coulda' been so much more!  Technically speaking: a nice clean widescreen image - French language w/ English subs - no extras (other than some trailers).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G2UA13XTZ3TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CERJISC#wasThisHelpful","R3G2UA13XTZ3TW","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another of Vinegar Syndome's awesome ' Drive-In double features' - this duo disk offers a pair of 70's sexploitation flix wth markedly opposed 'vibes'.  The common denominator might appear to be the starring presence of the lovely Barbara Mills in both films - she has that 'tuff chick' 70's look with low slung bell bottom jeans, long straight brown hair, and a smokin' hot athletic style body she is not afraid to share with the audiance!""The Suckers"" represents the 'roughie' of the pair.  It is a blatant 'homage' to the classic 'Most Dangerous Game' theme of a rich, jaded, big game hunter turning his sights on human prey - first presented by 'King Kong' creator Merian C. Cooper waaay back in the 1930's.  Updated to 'present day' the story line follows a group of (VERY attractive)  fashion models & film crew who have been hired by a wealthy (you guessed it!)  big game hunter to do a photo shoot at his desolate & remote property in the desert... but (to their horror!!) they become the prey in his demented hunting ritual.  Vinegar Syndrome is generally noted for the xlnt visual quality of their product and this film is remarkably clear for its' age & obscurity - but - the original quality of THIS film is decidedly funky!  However, in this case, the archival imperfections actually work to the advantage of the viewing experience as this flik is quintessential 'grindhouse' fare - replete with: dancing scratches, massive color shifts within a scene, audio that is 'variable', at best, inexplicable scene cuts, and a few areas of degraded film stock that (if it wasn't a DVD) would lead you to think the movie was about to 'dissolve' in the projector.  In this way, the quality of the print really adds to the authentic grindhouse viewing experience.  The movie itself is sorta 'all over the map' in terms of its' plot and editing.  The early part of the story features a lot of pretty explicit sex scenes between the various characters involved - one would assume - to build a sympathetic rapport with them prior to 'the hunt'.  There is a goodly amount of full female/male nudity in the sex scenes but things stop (just) short of true hard-core XXX.  Ultimately, of course, the sexual frolics must end so that the hunter can get on with his business and the latter portion of the film focuses on the sadistic safari and includes many brutal scenes of sexual violence as the plot slogs forward to its' inevitable conclusion.  Over-all a 'wonderfully flawed' piece of 70's sinema!In the, somewhat, diametrically opposed plot-line of ""The Love Garden""  the film's 'sensitive' male protagonist (looking like a Gabe Kaplan wannabe from 'Welcome Back Kotter')  goes ga-ga over the lovely ""Claire"" who moves into his apartment complex.  Unfortunately for him the object of his lustful obsession is already involved in a lesbian relationship with her possessive dyke GF played by Barbara Mills.  Maintaining that hopeful male premise: that all lesbians are really hetero. but just haven't found a 'good man' yet - our, liberated new-age, hero staunchly sets about 'tricking' Claire into accepting HIM as her significant sexual other by being as sickeningly 'nice' as possible - which 'almost' works.  The high-light of this flik (por moi) was the 'discovery' of the 'too sweet for words'  actress Linda York (as Claire) - star of quite a list of 70's exploitative pot-boilers - but this was the first time that I've laid eyes on her fetching face and figure!  Thanks to the 'bi-sexual' nature of the plot ""The Love Garden"" provides a cornucopia of both girl/girl and girl/guy sex.  There is ample full female nakedness from both Ms Mills & York, and their sapphic scenes present some very intimate camera angles and some genuinely sexy lesbo action.  This film is, amazingly / refreshingly, well written, filmed, and acted - even the Art Nouveau inspired artwork for the 'poster' is classy!  A surprisingly enjoyable viewing experience - I found myself zipping over to the IMDb site to check out more of Linda York's filmography  The film transfer quality (for both flix) is excellent wide-screen format.  No extras on the disk.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQX00TW3728FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLQBQYQ#wasThisHelpful","RQX00TW3728FM","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Following in the footsteps of the popular ""Emmanuelle"" franchise (PARTICULARLY ""Emanuelle Around the World AKA 'The Degredation of Emanuelle"") - the Swedish production of ""Around the World With Fanny Hill"" (Jorden Runt Med Fanny Hill"") follows a similar globe trotting scenario, but has a markedly different (lighter) tone to its' plot-line.Updating the venerable pleasure seeking heroine 'Fanny Hill' to 'modern' 1970's times the film begins in Sweden where Fanny (played by the gorgeous blond Shirley Corrigan) is having a hard time in her marriage with her husband's philandering ways - he produces commercials and is constantly surrounded by beautiful models - not the least of which is the lovely Swedish sexpot, Christina Lindberg. Fanny orchestrates an act of infidelity for her hubby and uses that as an excuse to file for divorce and head off (accompanied by her best GF - played by Gaby Fuchs) to Hollywood. Once in tinsel-town Fanny is 'discovered' by an adult film production company and is hired to star in their next film - which gives the rational, via a series of 'location shoots', for the fun loving duo to travel to several picturesque cities around the world - including Hong Kong, Venice, & Munich.  Hot on her trail, however, is her 'husband' who is hoping for a reconciliation, and many sexy & comedic adventures ensue.As previously noted - the general tone of this movie is light-hearted - even in some of the steamy sex scenes - and it moves right along mixing equal doses of 'travelogue' and soft core adult fare. The principal female leads are very attractive and display a lot of flesh throughout (tho the over-all vibe is decidedly soft core) - BUT - there are a few bits of actual XXX action in some of the 'orgy' sequences - for those with really sharp eyes to detect!  A bit misleading is the prominent promotion of Christina Lindberg - she appears in only a couple of scenes as one of the 'models' that Fanny's husband is photographing - these ARE nude scenes, but her total screen time is only about 60 seconds!The version of the film that I was able to purchase (and review) is the Swedish release: ""Jorden Runt Med F.H."".  This disk offers an excellent quality widescreen image and English language option.  The 'extras' on the disk contain some major extra sex action.  The film 'feature' sorta 'climaxes' w/ a big orgy sequence in Munich - but - the extras section offers 'deleted scenes' comprised of 3 additional lengthy orgy sequences! AND there is XXX action contained there-in! One must assume that the 'cuts' were made for either 'rating' or 'timing' purposes -  as they present almost an additional 15 minutes of wall to wall skin. There's also a generous helping of 'trailers' included for other adult Swedish features... some of which look pretty crazed!I found this flik to be very enjoyable - with an engaging cast - good production values - lotsa skin - and even a few chuckles - as Fanny hops from bed to bed on her way around the globe. Good wholesome sexy fun -  Highly recommended for adult viewing - by both sexes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HA2L6AOBDXUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AXJA2W#wasThisHelpful","R2HA2L6AOBDXUJ","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This slim volume presents a bunch of black & white illustrations with a (decidedly light) bondage theme. The renderings are mostly a combination of pen and ink with pencil shading - the subject matter is 'damsels in distress' in a variety of full page vignettes - most with a coy caption below similar to those found on vintage pin-up art calendars. Reno's girls are all pretty wholesome looking and the situations are fairly 'stock' and 'soft-core'. There is actually relatively little nudity in the images - the odd bare breast - but no pubes - many of the pics are sort of costume theme oriented. I'm not real sure what the 'target market' for this book would be - given what is available on the web in terms of hard core BDSM art these days this offering seems somehow prosaic & tame. This is not to defame Mr Reno's artistic skills - which are considerable - perhaps back in the 50's this woulda been 'hot stuff' but I just didn't find his concepts particularly engaging or sexy.

"As is typical of many Troma releases ""Open 24/7"" features a healthy dose of black humor mixed in with its' over the top gore.  The first thing to note about this film is that you need to turn on the sub-title option at start-up because this twisted little flik was filmed in France w/ french language throughout (with the exception of a couple of songs sung in English)and some German! in the third segment.The format of the movie centers around an open-all-the-time diner wherein several of the patrons, and the waitress/owner, spin tales of a horrific nature to 'pass the time'. There are 3 vignettes included - all featuring. principally. female protagonists performing the dastardly deeds described & depicted.The first 'story' tells the tale of a pair of disaffected lesbian lovers who lure men into their realm to dine upon them as they are being 'hunted' by a police officer who was one of their 'victims' who survived, but lost his masculine member to one of them!  - the second, darkly comedic, yarn plays out like a demented fairy tale with a cannibalistic ogress who feeds on children - and the third chronicles a pair of sexually abused sisters from the provences who journey to the 'wicked' city in an attempt to 'follow their dream', with less than stellar results. There is a definite underlying tone of dark satirical humor throughout that is fun, but also a few attempts at blatant parody (such as Troma kingpin Lloyd Kaufman's gratuitous cameo) that fall a little flat.Over-all though, this film presents a rather unique combination of sex and horror that is perhaps more prevalent in Euro horror offerings.  It reminded me of a similar filmic trilogy of sex/horror I snagged recently via Amazon entitled ""Little Deaths"" - wherein 3 individual British horror directors teamed up to make a similar 3 part anthology. It is a niche genre potentially ripe for exploration!I found ""Open 24/7 to be an enjoyable (albeit BENT) viewing experience.  Due to the brevity of the segments, there was not a lot of detailed character development but the stories were engaging and moved right along to satisfying (if somewhat nebulous) shocking conclusions.  This is definitely 'adults only' fare - featuring extreme gore fx, some nudity, and salty language.  IF you enjoy the TROMA style of cinema I would rank this as one of their better pieces!  The disk contains the usual bunch of Troma-esque 'background' extras & trailers.

"Thanks to the folks at Vinegar Syndrome DVD authoring for dredging up a bunch of old exploitational weirdness and foisting it upon an unsuspecting public. They have released a series of 'double feature' DVDs in their ""Drive-In Collection""- presenting 2 films on a single disk.  This, Asian inspired, offering of ""Vixens of Kung Fu"" and ""Oriental Blue"" is actually the only one of their 2-fer packages that I've watched so far - but if it is any indication of their other products I may well be going back for more!I was initially intrigued by the write-up for these two flix - speaking as it did of vengeful kung-fu maidens and white slavery in Chinatown - it sounded like a formula for some good bent drama and a little skin to be on display.  What the film synopsis did NOT mention, however, is that both of these movies are fully hard core XXX '70's porn! A closer look at the cast should have given a clue - with the likes of porn legends C.J. Laing & Jamie Gillis prominently featured in both flix - this is more like 42nd Street fare than any drive-in features I was ever privileged to see - back in the day!""Vixens of Kung Fu"" doubtless was 'inspired' by the martial arts craze that Bruce Lee's films ignited in the 70's and it is un-abashedly satirical in its' premise and execution.  Somewhat in the vein of those 'naked yoga' features that display all the stuff guys wish they could see underneath the Lu Lu Lemon gear - this film's 'vixens' show you what naked kung fu could look like with all that high kicking & such - minus clothing.  The 'plot' is simplistic  and doesn't get in the way of plenty of sex action of various configurations. Some beautiful fall scenery & artful photography (on occasion) provide the minimal outdoor production values throughout. There is really not much actual martial arts action - most of the 'thrusting' is of the carnal variety. A favorite, typically surrealistic, scene featured all the kung fu gurlz doing yoga in the lotus position - channeling their energies downward until smoke starts pouring out of their 'nether regions'!  Generally, this one is brainless, goofy fun!""Oriental Blue"" is reminiscent of the old B&W 60's 'roughie' ""Olga's - White Slaves of Chinatown"" - with the addition of color and full of XXX scenery (but not as much S/M!). The Chinese Madame (Blue) in its' plot procures girls for wealthy clients by utilizing a mysterious herbal aphrodisiac beverage and the help of a series of pimp-ish studs to seduce and indoctrinate unwitting young women into a life of prostitution.  Once again, itz 'no holes barred' as the viewer is 'treated' to a series of vignettes picturing the aforementioned theme. The tone of this film is generally more 'serious' but there are some clever bits of satire and some pretty decent performances to be appreciated amidst the smut. The music tracks (on both) are eclectically bizarre - SciFi buffs, of a certain age, may note the use of Bernard Herrman's outstanding score for ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" as a, somewhat incongruous, choice for background music in parts of 'Oriental Blue'! In 'Vixens..."" the 'opening' rape sequence  becomes a strange parody of 'Deliverance' with the use of rousing Bluegrass 'dueling banjos' behind the boffing. Even the 'Beatles' get some play time - that I doubt they ever saw any royalties on!I really enjoyed both of these films for their quirky qualities and unexpected X-factor. You definitely don't want to put this one on the shelf next to the 'Kung Fu Kid' or you might have some 'explaining' to do if your 'kid' pops it in the player by mistake!  Recommended for mindless (adult) viewing pleasure.  Both of these films enjoy exceptionally clear transfers of their wide-screen images!

"Set on a beautiful tropical island this film had a lot to offer but was majorly flawed by the pathetic quality of the DVD transfer. It is evident from the tell-tale 'tracking' lines that flicker across the picture periodically that this is an old VHS tape that has been unceremoniously dubbed onto DVD without any attempts to improve the image quality. The result is a grainy fuzzy picture that doesn't really allow one to see the detail of the many scenes of attractive women prancing about in the all together. The plot is intriguing enough to hold one's interest and there is a lot of nudity to be enjoyed from the attractive females in the cast. I purchased it primarily to see more of Olivia Pascal - a young brunette German actress who made a bit of a name for herself in the 70's after her 'break-out' performance in the film 'Vanessa' - where she displayed her luscious body to the max. Alas - as is often the case - her subsequent movies typically offer way less flesh and more 'acting' while clothed. Olivia does have a few good scenes in the buff (including a brief torture segment with the bad guy white slavers) but generally she's covered up. The 'white slavery' aspect of the film is minimal - most of the plot revolves around 'family intrigue'. There are ample sex scenes (all are pretty soft core) - but the girls are gorgeous and full female nudity abounds! In the final analysis I'd say the flik was over-priced for the visual quality that you get. This was packaged as part of the 'David Hamilton Collection' - but I doubt if D.H. ever watched it or he would have had second thoughts about lending his name to it. Hopefully, some day, there will be a nice sharp version of it made available.NEW INFO ON IMPROVED QUALITY GERMAN (ONLY!) VERSION!I am pleased to report that, subsequent to the previous review, I discovered that there IS a copy of this (relatively obscure) film available with a markedly improved visual quality. This version is a DVD pressing from Germany released by the 'MCP - Sound & Media' authoring group under the title ""Die Insel der 1000 Freuden"". Ironically - I found this (Region 2 PAL format) disk on the American - Amazon.com site - available from a USA distributor in New York! The one (fairly large) negative factor (for anglophiles) is the fact that this version is only presented in German - no English vocals nor subtitles! In my case - I fortunately had the, previusly noted, English dubbed version to help guide me through the film's rather complex plot line so I was able to simply enjoy the much improved clarity of the product. It should be noted that a 'Region Free' DVD player is required to view this Region 2 PAL disc.All in all - I was happy with this (second) version of the film and would recommend it, principally, for its' attractive cast, and their willingness to shed their clothes -with or without English it's worth a look.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H20TCZCIQFZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TV4PWE#wasThisHelpful","R3H20TCZCIQFZD","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second copy of this (relatively obscure) German film that I've purchased - the first version was a print of the flik, with a dubbed English sound track, sold as part of 'The David Hamilton Collection'.  The transfer quality of this DVD was very poor - apparently duped from a VHS source - it was grainy & degenerated to the point that it detracted appreciably from the viewing experience - which was annoying because the film offered a lot of great looking women & nudity that just couldn't really be seen clearly - frustrating!!When I saw this German DVD become available I took a chance that it would offer a more 'original / better quality' image (in the past I've found many German DVDs to have great image quality !) and plunked down the rather hefty purchase price to check it out - even knowing that this version had NO English vocals or subtitles.  I'm happy to report that the Euro product provided a marked visual improvement and greatly enhanced my enjoyment of the movie.  It should be noted that this is a Euro - Region 2 PAL format DVD and requires a region-free player for N. American viewing.Fortunately I had the (previously purchased) English language version to guide me thru the rather complex plot-line that is involved with a lot of internal familial scheming and intrigue - plus a little bit of 'white slavery' action  on the side.  I was originally drawn to this flik by the presence of hot 80's German actress Olivia Pascal who was very impressively mostly naked in her premiere film effort 'Vanessa"" - hoping to see more of her physical charms on display. ""Island of 1000 Delights""  DID provide a nice sampliing of Ms Pascal sans clothing (as well as a couple of other blonde lovlies!) and I'd have to say that, from my perspective, it IS primarily the liberal doses of naked female flesh that make this film worth checking out.  There are numerous (simulated / soft core) sex scenes scattered throughout and Olivia even has a nice (albeit brief) 'topless torture' episode as her character is interrogated by the 'bad guys'... for those that enjoy such.All in all - I was happy with this (second) version of the film and would recommend it, principally, for its' attractive cast, and their willingness to shed their clothes -with or without English it's worth a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T4T3AMLQ4QRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O6D6D8#wasThisHelpful","R2T4T3AMLQ4QRW","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading a review of this strange little movie in an article about 'Vanity's' film career in one of Robin Bougie's excellent volumes of ""Cinema Sewer"" I sought out a copy of the flik to check it out. The meagre 'extras' on the disk included a filmography and brief bio of the lead actress (Denise Matthews-AKA 'Vanity"" and billed in this film as D.D. Winters!) that indicated this was one of her first filmic outings. 'Vanity' was apparently a pretty wild chick in her early days - living the 'sex, drugs, & rock & roll' life-style to the MAX, and the producers of ""Tanya's Island"" seemingly took advantage of her youthful willingness to get naked to float their bizarre 'Beauty & Beast' concept. I must admit that it was the promise of lotsa nudity that lured me to give it a watch - I found the viewing experience to be somewhat un-even in its' satisfaction level.The 'plot' focuses on Vanity's character - a frazzled young actress who is apparently on the verge of a nervous break-down after a break-up with her temperamental artist boyfriend 'Lobo'. Her angst causes her to 'pass out' and she has a dream of being transported to an uninhabited island where she and her (aforementioned) boyfriend are living a life of primitive passion. One day, while collecting fruit in the jungle, 'Tanya' feels she is being watched by 'something' and she ultimately runs away from her BF (who is mocking her fears) and discovers a humanoid gorilla-esque creature living in a seaside cavern whereupon they develop a 'relationship'. Her human mate doesn't take this bestial liaison very well and the majority of the latter part of the film is involved with a jealous battle between the two 'males' for Tanya's affections.. which all becomes a bit absurd as the action slogs onward.The 'negatives' that I would note include:The relatively poor quality of the DVD transfer. Other reviewers commented on this so I was prepared for the worst. The transfer was actually not as bad as some VHS to DVD dubs that I've seen, but it is certainly not a real crystal clear digital image. I'd rate it 'passable' - but just barely.The 'directing' and editing were a bit jumbled - the characters were not particularly engaging, the acting was pretty over-the-top - and there was not much 'heat' in any of the erotic elements.On the 'positive' side:Ms Vanity does (as promised) show a lot of skin throughout. The most revealing full body shots occur during the opening title sequence where D.D. artfully writhes around naked - superimposed over ocean waves & such. While on the island there are numerous skinny-dipping and making love in the ocean scenes and lotsa 'outfits' that reveal flashes of naked flesh beneath. Appropo to the primitive island setting, and to the director's credit, Vanity is generally portrayed sans make-up looking pretty 'natural' so she is not overly 'glamorous' looking - but is still plenty attractive to behold.A real nice surprise was the quality of the ape-man critter. I went in expecting it to be a cheesy man in a gorilla suit but the costume and facial expressions were quite good! When the final credits rolled it was revealed that the creature effects were handled by veteran monkey make-up masters: Rick Baker and Rob Bottin! In this area, at least, the producers spent their money wisely. Featured within the film there were also some clips from the classic Willis O'Brien / Ray Harryhausen giant gorilla film 'Mighty Joe Young' - used to 'set the tone' for Tanya's simian oriented dream adventures.In the final analysis I felt the film was worth viewing (mostly for Vanity's body & the ape-man suit!) but it also has its' annoying elements that kept it from really taking off to cult-classic levels. Perhaps worth a look IF U R a 'Vanity' (or Rick Baker!) fan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DVSI3615VDAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006Q93N8#wasThisHelpful","R2DVSI3615VDAB","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The description for this self indulgent little flik makes it sound pretty sexy - speaking, as it does, about ""blurring the line between art and pornography"" - BUT - there is nothing that I would call remotely 'pornographic' about its' content.The premise evolves around a group of 3 people who are professionally related as 'documentary film makers' and their 'mates' who all get together for a New Years Eve 'party' where things go generally 'wrong' as personal relationship issues are revealed and 'filmed' by the obsessive 'director' of the filmic trio.  Tensions are created by acts of marital infidelity, incestuous revelations, and a tiny bit of kinky D/S play between a couple of the female characters.I had to watch the movie twice to sort out who was who and what all the subtle interpersonal interactions were all about.  The sound quality was poor in many areas making it difficult to catch certain key lines of dialog that are crucial to understanding what is going on between the various characters.  The acting was generally passable but the characters themselves were somewhat unlikable and many of the situations presented were questionable in their plausibility as peoples lives spin out of control in an alcoholic daze and their angst is captured by the  obnoxiously intrusive lens of the documentarian.  Despite a fair amount of sexual 'tension' between all of the individuals there is virtually no sexual activity portrayed and no nudity.  Even after watching the film twice I was still perplexed as to where a weird red stain on several of the character's mouths came from and why no one bothered to wipe their face... one of many small annoyances that added up to a less than stellar viewing experience.I could sorta see what the director was shooting for in this flik - trying to grapple with intense sexually driven emotional themes with an ensemble cast - but (for me) it felt pretty contrived and ultimately un-engaging.  More of a 'rental' than a 'keeper'.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTYIGNTQF4WEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1FXN2A#wasThisHelpful","RTYIGNTQF4WEK","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a resident of British Columbia, Canada (where Sexcula was filmed back in 1974) I was intrigued to check out this bit of 'long lost' horror themed porn that Impulse/Synapse DVD authoring have ferreted out of a dark closet somewhere.Today - Vancouver, BC boasts a highly sophisticated and professional film industry, with many American films and TV series being produced there, and in the immediate environs.  Back in the 1970's such was not the case - yet a few ambitious film-makers struggled to realize their 'artistic visions' in 'Fog City' and a few VERY esoteric productions materialized ( like does anyone remember:  Marv Newland's ""Bambi Meets Godzilla"" or Tom Drake's ""The Keeper"" w/ Christopher Lee!)-  then, typically, faded immediately into oblivion.  ""Sexcula"" may be listed among these primitive efforts and its' obscurity was pretty much guaranteed, as it apparently received only a single screening before its' controversial 'adult' nature hastened its' disappearance from the public realm. It is also unusual that this film was purportedly funded partially by grants from the Canadian government's film industry incentive programs - giving it the added distinction of being, perhaps, one of the only porn movies ever made with Federal funding!  These may all be interesting bits of background information, but how does this piece of early Canuck sexploitation 'hold up' to modern scrutiny?!Having given it a watch I'd have to say that the over-all experience was sorta amusing but also suffered from many aspects typical of low-budget porn product from that period.  The actual film reminded me of much of the low end adult product that is offered (in bulk!) by the 'Something Weird' cult DVD authoring gang.  It is essentially a grainy, dimly lit, hastily constructed excuse to display some naked flesh and hardcore sex action - wrapped up in a goofy parody of classic Universal Studio horror movie themes.  The sex IS graphic - that is - what you can actually SEE of it - most of the copulation is hidden in dark shadow and hairy male butts - but 'oral' scenes are nice and sharp, and make up the bulk of the xxx quotient.On the plus side - the girls featured in the flik are are very attractive and there's lots of full nudity to be enjoyed as the 70's vintage guys make forays into some dense Canadian 'bush'. There's even a 'sasquatch' in a gorilla suit to liven things up - can't ask for much more than that, eh?! Generally it looked like everyone was, at least,  having fun during the shoot and the tongue in cheek attitude of the whole piece does much to lift it slightly above the quality of much similar product from the period.In the final analysis I'd have to say that the 'quirk' appeal of this flik relies heavily on its' unique Canadian roots - without which it would be judged more purely for what it actually is - a low budget piece of throw-away porn.  Credit and appreciation should be bestowed upon Impulse DVD for providing this lost oddity with a belated 'premiere' to a new audience. While the viewing experience may be less than stellar - at least I'm feeling like the Canadian tax-payer may finally be seeing a real return on their investment!","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R179M5M1ARXJ6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB0YYP0#wasThisHelpful","R179M5M1ARXJ6N","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is NOT a REVIEW of the film ""Schoolgirl Hitchhikers""-  the content of which has been ably covered by other reviewers - I am mostly writing to WARN other potential purchasers of this fine little piece of '70's Euro sexploitation that the quality of the DVD released by 'Desert Island Classics' is VERY POOR!This is the third product I have purchased that came from Desert Island Classics and the film transfer quality on all of them is bad!  They all appear to be hastily produced DVDR products - dubbed from low quality old VHS tape sources.  The picture is grainy and degraded, often w/ tracking lines showing up periodically.  IF - this was the only version of the film available - these Desert Island debacles might  be considered marginally acceptable - but (particularly in the case of 'Schoolgirl Hitch-hikers') - they just don't cut it and should be avoided. Not only is the transfer quality pathetic, but the play time for the DIC version is only 67 min. while other releases of the same film clock in at closer to 74 min. - alluding to some substantial cuts!I have been very disappointed in the 'quality' of the presentation of all the product I've received from this DVD authoring outfit and really cannot recommend them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J29TEREB487V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BOCCAE#wasThisHelpful","R3J29TEREB487V","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Call me 'sick & twisted', but I love the Ilsa films (well, at least 3 of the 4 in the franchise - 'Siberian Tigress' Sucks!)  AND ""Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks"" is actually my favorite of the bunch!In my pubescent years back in the 1960's I was fascinated by the genre of 'Men's Adventure Magazines' that always had a lurid cover painting of semi-naked 'damsels in distress' being menaced by a variety of evil doers. The favorite subject matter seemed to focus on 'war horror' tales with a Nazi or Asian atrocity theme - 'ripped from the headlines' of the war crimes purportedly perpetuated against humanity, and particularly attractive women! But, sometimes, the focus shifted to other realms of female 'exploitation' such as the 'white slave trade' and the mysterious eastern world of the 'Sheik & their harems' was a popular theme. The 'Ilsa"" films sort of 'brought these stories to life' on the cinema screen - and often managed to be even more outrageous than their literary counterparts!While the premiere offering of the franchise: ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS"" was a 'campy' paean to the Nazi war horrors genre - ""Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks"" covered the 'white slavery' territory with equal sex-ploitational glee! Released from the creepy references to the actual horrific abuses of the Nazis during WW II - Ilsa (the harem keeper) is much more of a tour de force of sexual perversions and excesses, and includes within its' prurient plot just about every provocative fantasy that has been ascribed to the nebulous world of middle eastern slavery and harems. Whippings, castrations, slave auctions, flesh eating ants, breast crushing torments, explosive devices hidden where 'the sun don't shine', chastity belts, sheep eyeball eating - this one has it all - and MORE! There's even some sly 'winks' at Kissinger era Middle East oil politics.Amazon-esque Dyanne Thorne once more lends her considerable presence to the affair and carries the day ( ably supported by her dual 'Nubian' hench-women 'Silk' and 'Velvet' who are oiled and topless throughout!). Together, they indoctrinate a trio of freshly kidnapped Euro 'slave girls' (including 'top-heavy' 60's sex icon Uschi Digard!) into the harem life, and the perverted sexual proclivities, of the delightfully slimy 'sheik'. Even tho she rules the seraglio with a firm hand - Ilsa's character is not quite as invulnerable as in 'She Wolf of the SS"" as she, again, succumbs to the charms of an American military attache and incurs the wrath of her 'sheik' which leads to some punishments & humiliations of her, generally, inviolate personage.These films are all literally awash in female nudity, transgressive and misogynistic imagery and are easy to criticize for those very reasons - but if viewed in the 'proper' frame of mind as 'trashy fun' they are hard to beat for sheer outrageous silliness. Highly recommended for lovers of '70's vintage' exploitational weirdness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13HNEOWFBJZUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PK9MTI#wasThisHelpful","R13HNEOWFBJZUU","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Viewed strictly in terms of time and money this is a pretty awesome looking 'deal' - ""Go West - Americas's Western Frontier"" provides over 26 hours of viewing for less than the price of a typical DVD movie feature.  But, as is often the case, you sorta 'get what you pay for' and in this instance my feeling was that the quality of the content was not all that exceptional.There are 3 separate DVD offerings in this 'box-set' package and each individual DVD case contains 2 discs. Two of the DVD sets focus primarily on famous personages of the 'wild west'.  All the well known 'outlaws' and 'lawmen' are covered, as well as, some of the prominent Native American figures of the period.  The series purports to be presenting 'new' more truthful depictions of what really went on back in the day - 'stripping away the myths' and providing a more actual/factual recounting of many of the Western legends.  The DVDs do live up to this promise, BUT - much of the more 'factual' data has certainly been  extensively covered previously in other venues and I doubt that western history buffs would find much surprising new information in this package.  There is a lot of good material presented, but the format is pretty static and production values low.  Most of the content is delivered via a voice-over format behind a mix of archival photographs and drawings, with some film clips from old Hollywood western movies and a few amateurish dramatic recreations.  The historic and pictorial material is quite interesting - it's just not presented in a very dynamic or creative fashion.Personally, I was drawn to the product by the third DVD set that, ostensibly, focuses on the role of railroading in the West.  Again, the actual product gets a 'mixed review'.  There are 36 separate train oriented (short) features on the 2 discs and all of them appear to be 'promo' or 'instructional' pieces produced by various major American railroads - covering a wide range of RR subject matter from the 1940's -60's period.  The majority of the films are in B&W and the visual quality is variable.  Many of these little vignettes must be 'public domain' items by now - and I have seen several of them included in other, similar, compilations.  Taken as a whole they represent a lot of interesting old images of vintage steam and diesel power on US railways, but they do not present any 'cohesive story' of the railroad's history in the development of the American West... as the write-up for the box set would imply. Regardless - railfans would likely find this a worthy addition to their collection.Given the 'cost to content' ratio I'm generally satisfied with the material provided in this ""Go West..."" package - but I have seen much of the same information better presented in other, similar, sets, and would thus caution other potential buyers as to what this product actually delivers within it's 1607 minutes!","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X9KQ85EO7N2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2XQTTQ#wasThisHelpful","R2X9KQ85EO7N2P","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As noted by the previous reviewer - the packaging of this release of ""I, Marquis De Sade"" (1967) is a bit deceptive.  The color images and modern fetish fotos on the front & back box cover make this appear to be a much slicker product than it actually is. The 'real' film is in B&W (a nice clear print!) and is a typical 1960's bit of soft core sexploitation product - alluding to 'shockingly daring' subject matter, but not really delivering on the hype.The plot concerns a guy (his last name is 'Marquis'!)  who is translating a work of the Marquis De Sade from French to English and he begins to be affected by the perverse philosophies of the 'father' of sadism.  Upon learning that he has terminal cancer he decides to live out his fantasies and embarks on a series of De Sade inspired 'adventures' - most of which involve the opposite sex.  Some of his 'fantasies' are literally fantasies and he dreams of tying women up and whipping them, flying through the air, and such.  He makes a gigolo style connection with a wealthy 'full figured' woman (who he despises) but uses for her money and seems to spend his illicit gains - 'picking up chicks' - one of whom ultimately proves to be his undoing.This is an 'interesting' - sometimes downright bizarre - little film that has it's 'pros and cons'.  On the positive side - there is decidedly some quirky appeal because itz just so darn lame, and the occasional attempt at 'artiness' provides a few inspired moments of surrealistic montage reminiscent of Bunuel. On the negative end of the scale (and I fear I felt the scale tipped deeply in this direction!) the movie is a washout in terms of 'sexiness'.  Most of the women featured in the film rate about a C- on the physical attractiveness meter and the sexual situations presented were just not sexy. The singular (attractive) exception in the female cast was Babette Bardot who portrays a hooker that Mr Marquis hires.  Babette would be right at home in a Russ Meyers flik - she is built like the proverbial brick 'pagoda' - and she does a nice striptease number - which, besides her allusions to the more famous 60's 'sex kitten' (Brigitte) Bardot, was HER professional 'claim to fame'.  But even her pulchritudinous presence can't rescue this one from mundanity. There is very little S&M action (if that's what one might be looking for) and the titular Marquis De Sade puts in only fleeting appearances during flash-backs to his time in prison as his 'words' are superimposed over the 'action' during certain parts of the film. The majority of the soundtrak features cheap-o voice-over style dialog.  Waaay too much time is spent tracking the banal movements of the lead male character - some of which are intended to be mildly comedic- when the film eventually reached its' 'shocking surprise' conclusion my gut response was: ""finally!'.The 'extras' on disk include one (really) short 'featurette' which is another 50's vintage piece of nudie silliness, and the original promo trailer for the feature.  ""I, Marquis De Sade"" IS a bit of a 'curiosity' and has some 'camp' value but not enuf to make it enjoyable... over-all I could have 'saved my money' on this one and not missed much - I'm sure the Marquis De Sade would agree!","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SLIC9RU581OD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3TFGWK#wasThisHelpful","R2SLIC9RU581OD","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Fairy In A Cage"" (1977) has just been given its' world DVD premiere by the Impulse/Synapse distributors as a continuation of their series of re-releases of the infamous Japanese 'Nikkatsu Studio's' line of 'Roman Porno' films. Based on a story/screenplay by the prolific Japanese fetish author: Oniroku Dan - ""Fairy In A Cage"" presents a pretty intense foray into S&M territory via a plot that focuses on the abuses of power and depravity purportedly perpetrated by the Japanese military  during WW II against its' own citizens. The principal players in the movie include the Military Police and a corrupt/depraved senior official who jointly take a little too much personal pleasure in the 'interrogations' that they contrive. in the name of national security. to supply their torture chamber with victims, and the victims (both male & female) who fall into their clutches.The action in this film is pretty harsh and may not be to everyone's taste - as it packs a lot of torture and bondage, brutality, & nudity into its' modest 71 min playtime. There is very little sex actually portrayed - the sexploitational elements in this one are decidedly S&M oriented. ""Fairy In A Cage"" is in many ways typical of other similar shocking 70's fare (such as the ""Illsa"" series). This genre of movies seemed to visualize the lurid stories that populated the 'Mens Magazines' of the post WW II era - that recounted tales of war atrocities (generally involving attractive women). white slavery, outlaw biker gangs, and the like. The difference between much of the sorta 'campy' USA and Euro sleaze product and the corresponding Japanese version is the grim nihilistic seriousness with which some of the Nipponese films unwind... including this one!There is a tradition of this stark sadistic style of exploitation cinema in Japan that gives some context to ""Fairy In A Cage"".  The so-called ""Tokugawa"" torture trilogy of films from the late 1960's all feature scenarios in ancient Japan of horrible abuse perpetrated by feudal rulers upon their subjects, with no restitution in sight! Innocent people get horrifically tortured to death... and that's it. Many Japanese exploitation plots end on a decidedly 'down' note - perhaps adding to their shock value. ""Fairy In A Cage"" follows this general precedent, but is unusual in that it depicts a more modern period of history, and atrocious acts that no government would be proud of. Given the general reticence that the Japanese political hierarchy has traditionally displayed about admitting to human rights violations during war-times - it is particularly intriguing that Nikkatsu Studios (often beleaguered by politically motivated legal actions) would choose such an audaciously revealing indictment of the Japanese military as subject matter for one of their ero-productions.Many Japanese Pink eroflix are awash in transgressive scenarios and fetish imagery and ""Fairy In A Cage"" certainly ranks high amongst them. A highlight of the film is the lovely Naomi Tani who portrays the central tormented heroine of the tale with amazing aplomb and endurance as she is subjected to rigorous bondage ties and humiliations - as only the Japanese can dream them up! Ms Tani is renowned for her numerous bondage films with Nikkatsu and in this, later career, filmic effort she again looks lovely, abundantly decorated with rope, but her 'character' does not get much of an opportunity to do much more than stoically 'suffer in silence'- making this 'not' one of her best performances. This film obeys the typical (70's vintage) Japanese censorship laws regarding (not) showing genitals or explicit sex acts, but it accomplishes this via 'creative' camera angles.  While this 'technique' may be a little 'maddening' to modern western viewers who are used to being able to 'see everything' (in great detail) - at least there is no. annoying. visual 'fogging' on this disk. Despite the lack of blatant graphic depictions - the 'inferred' acts are certainly 'bent' enuf to satisfy the connoisseur of same.  The image transfer quality (from an original 35mm film print) is excellent (widescreen) - the (removable) English subs are good - there are no extras on the disk... but the box has the usual informative write-up on the film's background by Japanerotic film expert: Jasper Sharp.Personally, I'm a fan of '70's-80's period' Japanese ero-weirdness and I enjoyed this movie - but would caution that it is very BDSM oriented - while not XXX it is certainly adults only material.  I backed off from a full 5 Star rating primarily because I felt that there was a bit of a lack in empathy producing character development, and it WAS just SO darn grim!  However, IF you (too) like such 'shocking' fare ""Fairy In A Cage"" is definitely worth checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10ETGHVFYIPWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AY60AZA#wasThisHelpful","R10ETGHVFYIPWL","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Profane"" is really an 'art film' with a capital 'A' - replete with psychedelic montages and a rapid-fire pseudo-documentary format - a fact that may lead some viewers to feel 'disappointed' by its' content and/or execution.  The plot synopsis references elements such as the lead female character's 'work' as a professional dominatrix and the conflict that this presents to her Islamic background, and the DVD box cover art even depicts a naked woman lolling on a bed while the back cover is also full of images of nudity - making the film appear to be loaded with eroticism and sex.  Indeed, the film IS loaded with sex and a fair amount of naked flesh but the 'tone' of the piece is decidedly 'thoughtful' rather that erotic and in this context the potentially erotic elements become more realistic and less titillating.The film focuses on a pair of young women who work together in the sex trade - dominating masochistic men - and there are some interesting parallels drawn between the extreme male chauvinism prevalent in the middle eastern world and the reversal of the roles in the female domination play. One of the girls has an Islamic background that she is 'wrestling' with, while the other is bed-rock American and seems to have substance abuse issues, but no religious interests to speak of.  A Muslim cab driver also figures prominently in the plot. He develops a relationship of sorts with the duo as he ferries the girls to and from their 'tricks' through wintry Chicago streets - they banter back and forth about religious issues & lifestyle choices, and he ultimately gets somewhat sucked into the girl's perverse realm.  The documentary style of the film lends an air of 'reality' to everything and the actors all do a fine job of reinforcing the sense of credibility.  There ARE a few pretty explicit S&M scenes of the girls 'at work' during their domination sessions - but these flash by rapidly in the qwik cut editing style that is prevalent throughout the movie. Thus, if one is purchasing this film thinking it is going to be an 'arousing' experience, they may be put-off. The closely personal approach that the director takes with his characters, ironically, removes much of the eroticism from the proceedings.  On the other hand - this is a very well done piece of art cinema that tackles an (admittedly esoteric) subject of human drama in a poignant and effective way.  Personally, I found it powerful and enjoyable, and would recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D37ZQJ3CS5T3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PK9N0Q#wasThisHelpful","R2D37ZQJ3CS5T3","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just purchased (and watched) the 'un-censored' version of ""A Serbian Film"" - had to get it thru US based Amazon.com as the, much talked about, additional 'minute or so' of excised footage is apparently 'too brutal for Canadian sensibilities' to handle - so Amazon.ca doesn't list it! Certainly didn't appreciate having to pay the stupidly exorbitant $12.95 postage for the US shipping - making this a $40.00 film by the time it arrived in my mailbox - those were some pretty expensive 'minutes' of un-censored action! Was it worth it??!!I have watched a lot of weird transgressive flix over the years - generally I like them - the 'quality' of that genre of film can certainly be 'all over the map'. ""A Serbian Film"" has excellent production values, acting, and gore FX and in many ways is not really any more shocking than numerous 'mainstream' gross-out horror works such as the 'Hostel' and ""Saw' franchises (despite reviewer's statements like: ""Makes 'Hostel' seem like a Disney film"" etc.) - though it DOES definitely have more overtly sexual elements included... which always seems to 'get people going'. as they say. The 'slickness' of the production decidedly helps to suck one in and as the 'atrocities' presented within the plot gain in momentum and outrageousness there are many 'uncomfortable' moments to be 'enjoyed' (or NOT!) by the viewer until the final scene of nihilistic perversity is played out. I found myself initially sorta 'aghast' in the immediate aftermath of viewing it and went back to look at what other reviewers of the film on Amazon.com had said about it. One of the most interesting 'comments' was the info that the film's director. purportedly, made the film as a 'blackly satirical statement on the condition of the people and government in post-war Serbia"" - IF that is the case it certainly puts a whole different spin on the film and would warrant a different set of criteria in assessing its' subject matter. With or without such a 'redeeming' political sub-text the over-the-top sexploitational aspects of this film certainly seem shocking at first, but (upon deeper reflection and comparison) are not all that different or MORE shocking than much similar fare that has been produced in the past. One of the notorious 'censored' scenes involves a woman who has been tortured by having her teeth knocked out B4 she is orally raped - grim stuff!, but then I remembered an identical scenario in the '70's ""Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Shieks"" where a girl was being sold at a 'sex slave auction' and her prospective 'buyer' demanded similar oral modifications. In another 'censored' scene the infamous 'new-born porn' is 'revealed' - a concept that actually went so 'over-the-top as to become ludicrously hilarious. Other previous 'underground' horror flix such as ""Deadgirl', ""Aftermath"", ""Guinea Pig"", ""Grotesque"" etc,. ad nauseum - ALL feature creepy concepts and buckets of gore that are at least as harrowing as the imagery contained in the 'Serbian' film!Personally, I feel there is actually something about the word ""Serbian"" in the title that imbues this film with more import and impact than it might otherwise garner. The fact that the real-life war atrocities in the, relatively recent, 'Serbian' conflict occurred lend a special nuance of creepy-ness to the production & viewing experience... without that 'connection' it becomes merely another sick-twisted fantasy to be 'enjoyed' by fans of the genre. One reviewer pointed to the recent film ""Whistleblower"" as an example of a movie that deals with some of the more 'actual' horrific events of human smuggling and sexual violence against women that are still happening in some parts of Eastern Europe (and elswhere!). I gave it a watch and can honestly say that I found it to be way more disturbing than 'A Serbian Film'. In the final analysis, I would say that ""A Serbian Film"" is an 'effective' and, surprisingly. well made bit of exploitation that 'appears' to push the boundaries of the genre - but REALLY doesn't offer much that hasn't been done elsewhere previously - just where DOES one go from here, and WHY?!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BWU5K5EFUAZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007WULJ5G#wasThisHelpful","R3BWU5K5EFUAZI","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After watching ""Little Deaths"" I was struck that it's three ero-horror vignettes were very reminiscent of a popular series of erotic horror book anthologies (initially) entitled ""Hot Blood"" that were first published in the 1990's and went on to include well over a dozen volumes of short story compilations that blend sex and terror elements to potent effect. The horror genre has certainly always had its' fair share of subliminal eroticism, particularly in the realm of movies dealing with vampire themes, but films that focus specifically on erotic horror are a rarer commodity and might be viewed as an area with much potential in the increasngly permissive world of cinematic themes. I have previously noted one of the sexy horror stories published in the ""Hot Blood"" series entitled ""Chocolate"" was included in the made for cable TV horror anthology : ""Masters of Horror"". I would suggest that the 'Masters of Horror' and the Scott's ""The Hunger"" series are perhaps the closest similar product to the concept of ""Little Deaths"" - but their content is not as overtly sexual in nature as 'Little Deaths'.Other reviewers have done a good job of describing the content of the three stories presented in ""Little Deaths"" so I will not reiterate them again....over-all I enjoyed the entire show and found that the ideas, acting, and direction (by the 3 seperate film-makers) were of consistently high quality and, generally, very engaging. All 3 of the stories contained a strong dose of black humor within their twisted little plots but also presented 'endings' that were truly demented and hinted at unrelenting & unending karmic retribution... recalling some of the writing of previous horror masters such as Robert Bloch and Harlan Ellison.Personally I would enjoy seeing more of this type of erotic-horror blend make its way to 'the screen' and I'd recommend ""Little Deaths"" to open minded individuals who enjoy a little ero-weirdness in their horror film viewing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UZIX0DXRLSN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NKIPTU#wasThisHelpful","R1UZIX0DXRLSN5","A2LFWRKGPW5PU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LFWRKGPW5PU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughter enjoys all things American Girl, and MY JOURNEY WITH KAYA is no exception.  Kaya is a Native American of the Nez Perce tribe living in the 1760s, and my 9 year old really liked learning about Nez Perce and Kaya's life.  She loved reading about all of her adventures.  She also really like that you never learn the name of the girl who is telling the story; that enabled her to imaging that SHE was the one telling the story and the one who became friends with Kaya.One fun thing about the American Girl Journey books, is that they allow to create your own story.  My daughter likened this to hunting for buried treasure.  At certain points in the book, it tells you to go to page x for one adventure or page y for a different adventure.  You can read the book several times, and get several different stories.

"I got the TURTLE BEACH EAR FORCE STEALTH WIRELESS HEADSET as review model prior to its release. For the life of me, I couldnt get it to work. I downloaded the software, which failed to recognize the headset, so I contacted Turtle Beach Customer support. Response time for most of my interactions with them was about 24 hours. The rep sent me some new drivers which also didnt work. Then he apologized and send new new drivers which did work. I was able to get the Turtle Beach Ear Hub to recognize the hardware and update the firmware. I could hear my iTunes wirelessly all over the house. It was really nice. But I still couldnt get my PC to recognize the microphone on the headset. I tried everything I could imagine and ended up contacting Turtle Beach again. Finally, they told me that this headset is strictly for Xbox One, despite the claims on the box that suggest otherwise. The rep told me that the USB port on the Xbox One was non-standard hence the mic not being recognized by the PC. But the wireless part works. And why didnt he tell me that in the first place?So I pulled out the included cable that allowed me to plug the headset into my laptop and operate like any other headset. That worked. But my friends on Ventrilo begged me to stop. They told me that the mic quality was awful. So I literally pulled the plug on my testing.Back on the PC, the sound was fine, if not on the soft side. In a vacuum, I would have been happy with it. The headset is paired with a broadcasting base unit that uses the USB port. Ill note again that Turtle Beach tells me that this unit is only for Xbox One, but at least the audio does work with PCs. I then connected the optical audio in to my Soundblaster Z optical audio out. That all worked, but now you have to deal with the interaction of the Turtle Beach software, the Creative Labs software, and the Windows sound control panel. Ill leave that to your imagination. Bottom line is that I did get it produce good sound.The headset has a very rugged feel to it. The ear cups and headband are textured and rough. They give the impression that they could take some manhandling.Now, I could end the review here, but I feel obligate to mention that at the same time as I was testing these headphones, I also received the new Siberia Prism Elite headphones from SteelSeries. Theyre in the same price range, but I like them much better. They feel luxurious to wear and the sound is significantly better that with the Turtle Beach unit. My Ventrilo friends love them, too. But again, despite being aimed at overlapping markets, the Turtle Beach unit is wireless and Xbox Only. The SteelSeries unit is wired.Ill close on this depressing note. While testing both headsets over Ventrilo, my friends had a clear favorite. As a palate cleanser, I also used the cheap, painful to wear headset that came with the Dragon Speaking Naturally software. Every time I switched to that one, they could tell and said it was the clearest, best audio quality of the three units. It makes me wonder how thats possibly. Clearly, Dragon wants a good mic to highlight their wonderful product, but dont the headset companies also want that? The Steelseries unit was wonderful, but they said it was edged out by the freebie.One last thought. Both of the headsets Ive mentioned are expensive. At the time of writing, over $200. SteelSeries has now discontinued their landmark Sibera v2 headset and theyre selling at record low prices. Ive seen them for $50. For that price, you cant go wrong.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7P8RLI2IZ43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSQACMM#wasThisHelpful","R7P8RLI2IZ43","A28OB1QLXN5BM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28OB1QLXN5BM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to preface my review by stating that I had occasion to interact with the customer service folks at Enitial Lab. They took care of my issue quickly and satisfactorily. They earn extra points for the painlessness of the transaction.The MILO BUFFET is what's called ""flat-pack"" furniture. It comes in two boxes and all assembly is required. The instructions encourage you to read them in order to avoid spending ""half a day"" assembling the unit, but even so, with the help of my 9-year-old, it still took me a couple of hours. And I've put together items from IKEA before, so I am no stranger to the process. About the only real complaint I have, and why it took me so long, is that the instructions are really iconographs and contain very few words. This is common for items that ship around the world and it works pretty well, but I really needed more detail. Despite careful examination, I sometimes couldn't tell which way the pieces went together and would end up backtracking. The only issue is that some of them are glued in. That's not really an issue if you fix your mistake before the glue dries. But it grates on my OCD.Other than that, the skill required to put the MILO BUFFET together is minimal. You mostly need patience. And a hammer. I think everything else is provided. I found a few small bubbles in the veneer, at the edges, but no one will ever see it. Overall, the unit is heavy and once finished, seems very sturdy. And its stylish. And I definitely like the way it turned out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J3324I902REC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XEW0ZI#wasThisHelpful","R3J3324I902REC","A28OB1QLXN5BM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28OB1QLXN5BM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My little one jumped up and down with excitement the first time she saw the BELKIN LEGO CASE FOR IPAD MINI.  She grabbed it out of my hands, snapped in her mini (yes, it was that easy), ran up stairs and started building with Legos on top of the pad.  She loved that she could turn on her music and listen (and sing) as she worked.  She makes her mini-figures dance on top of the bad.  She is smart enough to realize that she cannot build large structures on the case, because she will not be able to open and close it, so she, for the most part, restricts herself to small flatish structures that interfere less with opening the case.  She has even built a structure that allows her to prop her iPad up when the case is open.I think the BELKIN LEGO CASE FOR IPAD MINI is a huge success.  The Legos fit snugly and don't fall off easily.  She really enjoys playing with it, and she likes that she can take a few Legos along where ever she goes.  The BELKIN LEGO CASE FOR IPAD MINI is NOT the most protective or solid of cases (if you drop the hard plastic case, it is as likely to crack as the iPad), but that is not its purpose.  Its purpose is to inspire fun and creativity, and it does those things VERY well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLR3PRDP4JUSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKINI8M#wasThisHelpful","RLR3PRDP4JUSK","A28OB1QLXN5BM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28OB1QLXN5BM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My friends who know how much I love science fiction and fantasy have told me for YEARS that I must read Terry Pratchett.  And some how, until now, I have never quite gotten around to it.  So I was very excited when I received this copy of RAISING STEAM.  And even more excited about how much I liked it!Since this is my first foray into the worlds of Terry Pratchett, I cannot attest to whether this is or is not a typical Terry Pratchett novel.  What I can say is that RAISING STEAM is a good story, it stands on its own, and it made me smile.Terri Pratchett is clearly a master.  He imbues his fantastical characters with personality, humor, and realism; these folks are all fun to get to know, and you definitely care about them.  His world is full of detail and description, and you feel quite comfortable in it.  IMHO opinion, the world he describes in RAISING STEAM is a cross between steam punk and the best of fantasy, with a lot of offbeat humor thrown in.  I do not know if this offends any diehard TP fans, but I do know I enjoyed this world very much.RAISING STEAM is a comfortable read.  I would not consider it a page turner; rather is it comfortable story that I look forward to coming back to at the end of each day.  I do not feel compelled to stay up all night reading it all the way through, but rather relish the idea of falling asleep while reading.Overall, RAISING STEAM is a happy read.  One that I would happily recommend to others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BUAJ8X2MZYJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038553826X#wasThisHelpful","R2BUAJ8X2MZYJ9","A28OB1QLXN5BM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28OB1QLXN5BM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Turn it on, click a couple of buttons - one on the phone, one on the headset - and bang! Instantly paired.  And my Blackberry phone finds it every time.  Nice!The sound quality and sound cancellation are excellent, but I expect that in Jawbone headsets.  The kids can talk, I can get ice out of the fridge, and no on at work can hear anything but my mellifluous tones.  Does great in wind, too, when I am out walking.The fit is outstanding.  This is a new type of ear piece for me, and I am very excited about it.  I am a small person.  My ears are small.  Most headsets fall out of my ear if I don't mash them in perfectly or if I move around too much...SUCH A PAIN.  But this little beauty hooks easily into my ear, fits comfortably and snugly, and feels secure enough to do cartwheels or jumping jacks...Seriously, I tried! And I still love that the ERA style headset makes me look like Lt. Uhura!  (Yeah, that's me, queen of the geeks.)It comes with a charging case.  Wow!  Love this feature.  While this headset does not store as much talk time as previous models when fully charged, it does come with a neat little charging case.  When the case itself is fully charged, it can give your headset a significant amount of additional talk time.  This is especially nice when on the road.  Just let snap it in the charging case and keep on talking.My only issue with the ERA BLUETOOTH HEADSET WITH CHARGE CASE is that it loses any remaining charge it has if I forget to turn it off or plug it in over night.  If I had two hours of talk time left before bed, it is dead in the morning.  That can lead to some unpleasant surprises for early morning meetings. UGH!Overall, though, the ERA BLUETOOTH HEADSET WITH CHARGE CASE is a excellent product from an an excellent company, and I am very, very happy with this headset.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLI8MX3Y9KPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2RP9R8#wasThisHelpful","RTLI8MX3Y9KPP","A28OB1QLXN5BM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28OB1QLXN5BM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly, I have no idea if SKINNY CREAM does what it is supposed to do, although I highly doubt it (the claims being rather fantastical).  This stuff stinks to high Heaven! It is a really bad, rancid smell.  I am not sure I even have the words to describe it. I tried it twice a day for a week before my family and I couldn't stand it any more.  I put in on my legs and arms in my bathroom, and hours later I still stank, my bathroom still stank, and the smell was worming its way into the rest of the house.  My husband finally asked me to stop using it, and my little daughter refused to snuggle with me. (My 16 year old just laughed.)  That was the last straw.  I am done.I would not recommend SKINNY CREAM unless you really want to alienate your loved ones.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R65262A1VPJQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LOJ5MA#wasThisHelpful","R65262A1VPJQC","A28OB1QLXN5BM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28OB1QLXN5BM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wee one loves her ipad, but gets very frustrated when she can't do some of the detailed things she want to on it.  She is still a bit behind in fine motor skill development, and the ipad just won't respond the way she wants it to.  Enter the GREATSHIELD CHALKEE KID FRIENDLY STYLUS.  It really seems to have solved her problems!First, she loves it because it is pink. LOL.  Moving on.  She also likes it because it allows her to some of the more creative, artistic things she loves to do on the ipad with much more precision and delicacy.  The one thing she she would change about the GREATSHIELD CHALKEE KID FRIENDLY STYLUS is the size.  At her age, she would prefer a more slender stylus.  However, mom likes the size, because it makes the styles very hard to lose.  I am sure that we probably have about 10 thin styluses floating around this house somewhere, and we can't find a single one.Since my daughter is a bit older than the average user of the GREATSHIELD CHALKEE KID FRIENDLY STYLUS, she has not had the issue of the tip breaking; however, since she is a fiddler,  she does keep pulling the tip off.  I can get it back on, but it is not easy.  I would definitely recommend the maker of this stylus find a more permanent solution for the tip of this stylus.Overall, the GREATSHIELD CHALKEE KID FRIENDLY STYLUS is a very nice product, but it is not perfect.  Not yet, anyway.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FKXWLLYX15LP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LPWASU#wasThisHelpful","R3FKXWLLYX15LP","A28OB1QLXN5BM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28OB1QLXN5BM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...but exactly what I hoped for!I was very skeptical about the claims of this new cat litter.  But I do like Arm & Hammer products very much, so I decided give ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL CAT LITTER a try. And my family and I are absolutely thrilled with the results.  ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL CAT LITTER really is different, and it does exactly what it says!Seal in the odor?  Check.  I have one cat, who is elderly and very stinky.  My family used to complain about the litter box smell no matter what litter I used or how often I scooped.  Now there truly is no smell.  We don't even notice the litter box any more.Clumps that stay clumped and don't fall apart?  Check, again.  This one was a surpise, too.  There are always clumps that fall apart when you scoop, right?  WRONG.  Every single clump scooped over the past month has been a true and solid clump.  No little crumbly bits of smelliness left behind.  Awesome.Low dust and tracking?  Check, check, checkity-check!  This litter is finer, a lot finer, than other litters.  Less sticks to the cats paws, thus less is tracked around the house.  And almost no dust when pouring or scooping.  Which is great for those of use with allergies.Does the cat like it?  You betcha! My 17 year old cat had been using my bath mats as ancillary litter boxes.  I was doing a lot of extra washing each week, and it was driving me NUTS.  However, he has now stopped that behavior completely.  YAY!  This litter has definitely worked a miracle.ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL CAT LITTER truly is different, and I am a complete convert.  No question about it, ARM & HAMMER CLUMP & SEAL CAT LITTER will be the only litter in our house from now on.  MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX9I3KYKG21J6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8MDLUE#wasThisHelpful","RX9I3KYKG21J6","A28OB1QLXN5BM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28OB1QLXN5BM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ORECK ULTIMATE HANDHELD VACUUM is a wonderful device for getting to awkward locations. It has a shoulder strap, a long power cord, and several attachments that make reaching corners, ceiling fans, drapes, and the like a snap. The first thing I tried was to clean my oh-so-dusty ceiling fan blades. This was pretty straightforward, although I have high ceilings and needed a step ladder (a 2-stepper.) And it worked, but with caveats. First, ceiling fans move. That complicates things. It took a few minutes of trial and error to get a groove going whereby I could move the brush attachment along the length of the fan blade before the fan presented me with a new blade. (And NO! It was NOT turned on!) Even so, I felt like Lucy and was certain I could hear a laugh track.  The vacuum did a pretty good job with the fan blades, but there was still dust when I was finished (meaning, when my arms gave out and I gave up.)  To be fair, I have not cleaned our fan blades in a REALLY long time.The ORECK ULTIMATE HANDHELD VACUUM is really light weight and extremely easy to use, making it perfect for a host of other odd uses as well.  It did a fantastic job sucking up debris, dust, cat litter, fur, etc. from under the lip of the kitchen kitchen counter and around the base boards, both traditionally difficult places to get completely clean,  It easily knocked out the paces between the sofa cushions, and was much easier to use on the stair case than my upright vac.While I still hate to vacuum, the ORECK ULTIMATE HANDHELD VACUUM makes it all that much easier.  I definitely recommend the ORECK ULTIMATE HANDHELD VACUUM for all those hard to get places.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYCWYAA7PTWUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU1A0YW#wasThisHelpful","RYCWYAA7PTWUI","A28OB1QLXN5BM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28OB1QLXN5BM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something comforting about a well-designed product that really works and is a joy to possess. The CONTIGO AUTOSEAL WEST LOOP STAINLESS STEEL TRAVEL MUG is definitely one such products. Everything about it is soothing  the way it feels in your hand, how it fits with your lips, and of course, how it keeps hot things hot and cold things cold. The first two are visceral and subjective, I know, but for the third, I can tell you that I filled this baby up with hot chocolate (HOT hot chocolate) at 11am and it was still hot at 2pm and was very warm at 5pm, at which point I figured I had sacrificed enough for this review and drank the chocolate! Washing is easy and should be done by hand, at least for the container as opposed to the screw-on lid. The paint will eventually start to peel around the top edge if you put it in the dishwasher, but it is really simple to clean by hand. One other item of note is that you dont push a button with your thumb to drink. The button is on the side away from you, so you have to squeeze it with your fingers. Its no problem at all for me but it might be for some.Where was the CONTIGO AUTOSEAL WEST LOOP STAINLESS STEEL TRAVEL MUG when I was in elementary school, dreading the sound of broken glass in my Thermos? I like this travel mug so much that I have two and I have given some as gifts (to people who kept stealing mine!)

"JUST GRACE AND THE SUPER SLEEPOVER is an excellent addition to the Just Grace series.  I really can't say anything bad about this series.  My wee one has been reading these since the beginning of 1st grade and still loves them now that she is 1/2 way through 3rd grade.  She started reading this series on a recommendation from her wonderful school librarian.  My little one was a very early, precocious reader, and Just Grace was challenging enough while still containing age-appropriate material.  Now, my daughter reads these books just for fun...and fun she certainly has!JUST GRACE AND THE SUPER SLEEPOVER is written with the same formula as the rest of the Just Grace series:  Grace has a problem or a fear to conquer, and she does, with light-hearted fun, mischief, humor, and great charm.  There is a moral lesson to the story, imparted with gentleness and aplomb.  In JUST GRACE AND THE SUPER SLEEPOVER, Grace is invited to her first slumber party.  Not only is it her first slumber party, but it is a backyard camp out.  Even though Grace tells everyone how excited she is for the slumber party, she is secretly afraid and ends up spinning a web of lies.  But, with the help of her family and good friends, Grace overcomes her fears and learns the importance of telling truth.The Just Grace books are written in an almost stream-of-consciousness style.  When my daughter reads them out loud to me, they sound exactly like what is going on inside her head.  I can picture her thinking the same thinks that Grace does, word for word.  Charise Mericle Harper definitely gets the rhythm and tone of an elementary school girl just right.My daughter and I will continue to read the delightful Just Grace series for as long as she enjoys them.  JUST GRACE AND THE SUPER SLEEPOVER is MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RVNBAMCDNNOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054404584X#wasThisHelpful","R2RVNBAMCDNNOR","A28OB1QLXN5BM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28OB1QLXN5BM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The WORKSHOP WET/DRY VACS WS1625AM AIR MOVER WITH HANDLE AND WHEELS is a lightweight, highly maneuverable, easy-to-use shop blower that even my 8-year-old can operate. I first tested it by having her move it around the house. No problems. She was able to extend the handle, wheel the unit around, and stow the handle, all without my guidance. She was then able to unwind the long power cord and plug it in. All that was left was for her to figure out the 3-position switch, which she did with ease. But then the fun began.My daughter is a ham. Theres no other way to say it. Add that to being very creative, and youve got a dangerous combo. In this case, it was very entertaining! I wanted to test the strength of the blower at its different settings. All of them are impressively powerful, but my daughter decided to place objects in front of the unit, to see what could withstand its awesome recreation of natures fury. (Spoiler: not much!) Her pillow was like a marshmallow before it. Her American Girl dolls, were blown under the couch. Even the cat fled  okay, the cat doesnt count, but he *was* part of her test bed.But then a new use for all that wind came overcame her. She laid down on the floor, facing the blower and had me turn it on. Even on LOW, it was a wind-tunnel, but she laid there, striking a pose, with her hair being blown behind her like the old classic Memorex commercial. TAKE A PICTURE OF ME, MOMMY! she yelled over the howl of the category 3 onslaught. So I did. But she wanted it to go to 11  or in this case, 3. She loved it but I couldnt stop laughing. She was not quite light enough to be pushed backwards, but the blower tried!Suffice to say, this is a hearty device that I wish Id had when I overflowed the tub and we had to pay $4,000 to have professionals come in to dry everything out. I mean the tub? What was I thinking? Thats a Disney vacation or 1/3 of my property taxes! I should be flogged. Seriously. Im super cereal.

"I have been a huge fan of author Harry Dolan and his protagonist David Loogan ever since Mr. Dolan wrote Bad Things Happen.  I enjoyed Very Bad Men just as much, and I could not wait to dive into his latest novel THE LAST DEAD GIRL.  THE LAST DEAD GIRL is prequel to the first  two David Loogan books, and as always, Mr. Dolan's detailed plots and realistic characters immersed me deeply into the story.  I stayed up late into the night, turning the pages as fast as possible! His plotting is tight, complex, and thrilling and the pacing is spot on.  Mr. Dolan's characters are very accessible, and his descriptions are dark and atmospheric.  There is a delightful old noir feel to Mr. Dolan's stories, which is something that I really enjoy.

"I found EAT BRAINS LOVE to be a fun, fabulous piece of brain candy - a great mental vacation from the rest of the world.  EAT BRAINS LOVE won't change your life, but it will make you grin broadly and laugh out loud.  Irreverent, corny, and oddly romantic, EAT BRAINS LOVE is definitely worth a read.EAT BRAINS LOVE is a YA novel which begins in (you guessed it) a high school.  Jake, your average, random, teenage boy wakes up feeling sick and weirdly hungry at the same time.  The next thing he knows, he has eaten his best friend (and 1/2 senior class) and is on the run with Amanda, the super popular hot chick that every high school has.  It seems that there is a virus on the loose, and it is turning people into zombies.  Now they are running from certain death at the hands of the government, learning how to control their ""zombification,"" and trying figure out what is happening to them and the world.  There are rumors of a zombie sanctuary in Iowa.  But can they get there safely and without eating too many people?EAT BRAINS LOVE is a quick, light-hearted, easy-breezy read just perfect for a vacation or the beach.  The pacing is quick, the action is constant, and the romance is oddly appealing.  The ending is a cliff-hanger, but that just makes me eager for more.  I read the book cover to cover in about a day.  It was exactly what I needed to brighten my spirits.  EAT BRAINS LOVE is funny, quirky, and definitely unique.  I loved Warm Bodies, and EAT BRAINS LOVE definitely has the same appeal.

"I love my red TYLT BAND FLAT DUAL CAR APPLE/USB CAR CHARGER.  First of all it is RED, which means it is identifiable a MINE and NOT one of the kids.  Otherwise, all my charging cables ""mysteriously"" disappear.  Second, I love that it is wide and flat.  It comes right out of the glove box (does anyone actually use the glove box for gloves anymore?) straight, untangled, and ready to use - no attempting to untie knots while driving.  Also, it is easy to find by touch, so you are never taking your eyes off the road.  Next, it will charge either an ipad (we always need more charging capability on long trips!) by itself, or two smaller devices (iPhone, blackberries, etc) at the same time.  That is a really, really nice feature.The only note that I would point out here is that the built in ipad connector is the old style.  If you have an ipad mini or an iPhone gen 5, you will need to provide the correct cable and plug it into the USB port.  But that would not stop me from buying more TYLT BAND FLAT DUAL CAR APPLE/USB CAR CHARGERs.

"Yes, I said sexy. Its also sleek and strangely enough, exciting. The WD MY PASSPORT has 1TB of storage with a USB 3.0 interface that is only about  of an inch deep and easily fits in your pocket. The odd part is the transfer speed. I plugged it in to my husbands Windows 8.1 desktop machine where it was recognized immediately. It comes with a bunch of stuff on it from Western Digital, but I shouldnt need any of it to transfers files. So I dragged 600GB of files from his machine to the Passport. Thats 828 files, the majority of which were over 1GB. The transfer started off with a bang, once hitting 90 MB/s but over the course of 2 1.5GB files, averaging between 60-70 MB/s. But after those 2 files went over, the bang turned to a whimper, dropping to an astonishing 1 MB/s. Okaaaay. I waited. It was now transferring consistently under 10 MB/s. Finally, I stopped it. My husband checked his drivers, the connections, etc. All were current but Windows had discovered a new Western Digital driver available through the Windows Update, so he installed it, and I tried again.This time, I tried a 100GB transfer. This time, the performance was much more reasonable, but still uneven. For long stretches, the transfer speed ranged from 60-70 MB/s. Then it would drop to 40-50 MB/s. For one small stretch it was between 90 and 100 MB/s. Throughout, the source drive was not being used for anything else. I wasnt looking at pictures of cats who cant spell or updating my Facebook page. Nada. So I dont understand the inconsistency, especially since all of the files in the second batch were over 1GB. And I dont understand why a new driver was required, but it seems to have made a big difference.After the transfer was complete, the unit was warm to the touch, but barely. Throughout, the unit was silent, or at least didnt add to the ambient noise.Id like to understand why the transfer speeds are not consistently in the 100MB/s range (or consistently within any range!) but I still plan to use this drive when I travel. Large capacity, small footprint, low weight, fast transfer. Martha says, Its a good thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10N1P3M8VT1MU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO302SO#wasThisHelpful","R10N1P3M8VT1MU","A28OB1QLXN5BM6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28OB1QLXN5BM6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Occasional paragraphs of insight are buried in endless pages of links which are a real chore to wade through. Worse, about half-way through, the book turns into a random anti-government rant which has nothing to do with Thailand - just a random rant about governments in general. There are also long 'chapters' of text listing 'super-books' - presumably collections of other books by the author (It is unclear as there are no links or no explanations as to what these random 'super-books' are, where they can be acquired or what they are doing in the middle of a book on Thailand).Weird, because the few lines of text about Thailand are actually quite smart and on the money. But the formatting is a disaster, the ridiculously long listings of links are absurd and the anti-government rant which has been smuggled into this book is offensive and has nothing to do with Thailand.

"Review by: iTechWorld11 (YouTube Channel)I received this product, and expecting it to be a pile of junk like the other reviewers were saying, I was actually surprised at the quality of the case.For starters, it is extremely easy to put the case on your Nexus 7, and when you do, it is kinda snug. It isn't super tight, however it certainly won't come off on its own. However, if you pull at the sides, it may start to peel off, but it's not that bad.The material is also pretty nice: a soft, durable, and smooth TPU type case. It is this material for the whole case, so you shouldn't have any problems with it scratching your screen.The cutouts for all the ports are perfect, the only problem being that the volume buttons and power button can be a but mushy, but it really wasn't that bad. Overall, from a cutout standpoint, it excels.However, the reason this case does not get a 5/5 is because of this: NO MAGNETS! The Nexus 7 has magnets built in for the ability to lock/sleep/unlock your device (I know because I accidently turned off the Nexus 7 with an iPad smart cover), however this case does not have magnets built in. This also means that the front cover flap falls open while being picked up/moved around. And this case is made by ASUS!! Asus is the manufacturer of the Nexus 7! I just don't get it!However, that is my only complaint, and with nice colors, I don't think that your $20 is being wasted.If you want to see a video review of this, check out iTechWorld11 on YouTube for a video review and more reviews of New Nexus 7 cases.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WW5NJ0G48U2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DY3J966#wasThisHelpful","R2WW5NJ0G48U2X","AASY3BT1OGA6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AASY3BT1OGA6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Review by: iTechWorld11 (YouTube Channel)So I've been using this for over a week, and I have tested this out and drawn my final conclusions.SCREEN/CAMERA/DESIGNSo starting out with the screen, it has a 1920x1200 resolution full HD 1080p IPS display coming in at 323 pixels per inch, and man it's a beauty. The colors are vibrant, the viewing angles are fantastic, and everything about it screams high quality. This is the best screen I've seen on a tablet, including the Nexus 10 and iPad 3/4. The only problem about this screen is that few websites and apps support such a high quality display, so you'll have a diversity of clarity when using your New Nexus 7.On this Nexus 7 there is also a new rear-facing 5 MP camera with autofocus, and it's decent. It gets the job done, and for a tablet you can't ask for more. The front facing camera is decent, however the lack of autofocus can be a bit annoying.We also have a new backing to the Nexus 7. The old Nexus 7 (2012 Model) had a very nice back, but this one is even nicer. It is extremely smooth and slick looking. You have the Nexus and Asus logos, as well as your speakers and rear-facing camera. I'm a big fan of this polycarbonate-plastic back.Speaking of the speakers (get it?), they are fantastic. With stereo sound and Surround Sound built in, they sound fantastic no matter what you're listening to. They also get very loud, and you can just hear the great clarity with the new speakers.This tablet is also much thinner, at only 8.65mm thin, it is 1.8mm thinner than the original Nexus 7. Now, it is still thicker than the iPad Mini, but the Mini is scary thin. It is also very light, at .64 lbs (290 grams) it is 50 grams lighter than the 2012 Nexus 7. So obviously it is super portable, and part of the portability would be the new side bezels-or lack there of. Google has massively slimmed down the bezels and it makes holding it one hand a breeze for almost any hand type. However, sometimes it is hard to get a grip of the tablet without accidently touching the screen. But for some reason, Google made the top and bottom bezels much bigger, and it is pretty awkward to hold in landscape mode because your hands will be so far apart.SPEED:Google brought the 1.5 GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro CPU to this tablet, and it is super fast. Mixing it with 2 GB RAM, and you get a gaming powerhouse and performance screamer. Everything about this tablet is fast. (The only lag I found was in the web browser (Google Chrome, which is stock), which I found to be a very bad experience).The Wifi is also pretty fast, with Dual Band 2.4/5 GHz support, which is pretty much stander, but nonetheless still pretty fast. (Of course it mainly depends on the speed of your router)FINAL OPIONS/VALUE:So I am very impressed with this tablet.

" 1:39 MinsReview by: iTechWorld11 (YouTube Channel) youtube .com/itechworld11This is a fantastic little external charger. It is 5200mAh, so it should have enough power to charger your phone 1-2 times are your tablet 1 time. It is also dual-USB so you can charger multiple devices at once.Another great thing is that this is pretty small, especially for the 5200mAh size. You should be able to put it in your pocket and easily travel with it, no problems.Overall, a great buy: very affordable, very small, and very powerful.For my full review, go to youtube .com/itechworld11Thanks!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E53LS1EFCA2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIEGXKE#wasThisHelpful","R2E53LS1EFCA2Y","AASY3BT1OGA6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AASY3BT1OGA6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:41 MinsReview by iTechWorld11 YouTube Channel. Find my full review at YouTube .com/itechworld11To start this off, this keyboard is an excellent value. For less than $20, you get a very good looking bluetooth keyboard, that works with Macs, iPads, iPhones, and many tablets. However there are a few downsides.First off, this keyboard feels like a plastic keyboard. The keys feel ""plasticy"" when typing on it, and there is a little bit of flex in the keys-not too much, but some. Another bad thing is that this runs on batteries. It takes two AAA batteries (which don't come with the keyboard).So all-in-all, not a bad keyboard, but not the best I've seen.(Don't forget to check out my YouTube Channel: iTechWorld11 :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R266A2I30PHSDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJROAZS#wasThisHelpful","R266A2I30PHSDN","AASY3BT1OGA6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AASY3BT1OGA6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, for one, this product was lost in shipment and ended up coming two weeks late. That does not have anything to do with my review.Some of the side pieces did not fit on my phone, and when I put a case on they started to peel. The back protector is slightly small, and does not cover up a part of the very top and bottom of my phone.Apart from those three problems, it was also difficult to apply correctly.

"This case looked very good in the pictures, and I decided to get it because it was pretty cheap. I was a little disappointed when I first got the case. I used it for a little while than took it off. Inside the package is a very nice sized microfiber cleaning cloth, which was a very nice addition.I put the case back on recently, and I really like it now. I can see the Apple logo on my white iPhone (doesn't work on black) with the light shining at a certain angle. The plastic bumper fits on nice and snug without any problems. The camera cutout is fine, and doesn't effect the flash. The buttons are all covered, and they work VERY well. I really like the feeling when I press the power/volume buttons. The case also offers a nice lay-on-the-table design which is also very nice.Overall a very nice case, I have the black version (which is no longer available from Amazon). Definitely worth the price. I also have an Anker Glaze Screen Protector, which I love. You can't really go wrong with this case.You can check out a review and unboxing of this case on my YouTube channel: iTechWorld11 or youtube .com/iTechWorld11","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYX28DKNG72Z9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XUF7DY#wasThisHelpful","RYX28DKNG72Z9","AASY3BT1OGA6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AASY3BT1OGA6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this looking to be able to take my Macbook Pro around without worrying about it getting dirty or hurt. When I first got this, (you can watch my unboxing at my YouTube channel: iTechWorld11) it was very difficult to put on. It didn't fit on very well, and it felt that it wasn't carefully designed.  The bottom piece often came of my Mac, and it left the battery indicator unreachable. It does have little white foam pieces to cover up the four rubber bumps on the bottom of your Mac, which is nice.  The top of the case was also difficult to put on, and didn't stay on completely. I finally got it to fit, but not after a while. This does allow the Apple logo to glow through, but only when your Mac is turned on.  This is a matte black polycarbonate case, and you CANNOT get rid of any liquid, fingerprints, or smudges (well, it is very difficult). Once on, it's on. This is a little annoying. I actually had a little mark on it, so I licked my finger to try to remove it, and it left a streak on the case from my finger, I got it to minimize, but there is still a good amount of evidence that it was there.  The included keyboard cover is awful. Don't get excited about it. I know I was, because I wanted to protect my keyboard from finger oils, crumbs, water, etc. It makes it VERY difficult to type on, and it can peel off if you accidentally if your arm brushes against it.  This case also adds a lot of thickness and weight to your Mac. Which makes me even  more envious of the MacBook Air, with this bulky case on it.  Overall, a decent case, but I wouldn't recommend it.

"I have had enough time with this case to know it is a keeper. The iPad mini sits in the four corners snuggly and I'm not afraid to go around with it. The stand postions work perfectly, and you are not limited to the positions that are on the case. It fully protects the iPad, and the magnets work great and do not get in the way.

"I purchased this screen protector looking to protect my screen (duh) to keep it in perfect resale condition. I was never a big screen protector fan, because it took away from the screen's nice smooth feel, and would fade some of the retina display's coloring. Well, this screen protector shattered those feelings.This screen protector was very cheap, which is the first pro. It also came with a dust removal sticker, bubble remover, 3x screen protectors, and a large cleaning cloth, another pro. And then when I installed it, I had zero bubbles or dust under the screen protector.This screen protector is invisible, (I even had the matte version), I could not find any proof that the screen protector was actually installed (besides the fact that I can't see fingerprints :). My favorite part about this screen protector is that it feels like it isn't installed! The screen is still as smooth, still as sleek, but has less glare/reflection (hence the matte part). I absolutely love this, and I will eventually forget that it is installed!Overall a very nice screen protector, well worth the price, considering you get 3 and all the extras.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA7ZS78RB9NZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3L6I3E#wasThisHelpful","RA7ZS78RB9NZ1","AASY3BT1OGA6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AASY3BT1OGA6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had one of these squeeze balls a few years ago and I loved it. I lost it a have since been looking for something similar to it. And viola! I found this. I was willing to take the risk of buying this (not knowing if it was exactly what I was looking for) since it was pretty cheap ($4).This stress ball is harder to squeeze than most stress balls, but far away from a tennis ball (it is hard enough that I can feel my veins when I squeeze hard enough). It is a nice size that can easily fit in your hand. The description is accurate: The inside feels like gel. You will not be able to break/rip this just by squeezing it. It is kinda bouncy. If thrown against a solid surface hard enough could get ~4 feet in the air.Overall  a very nice product for a low price, and helps with by keeping me occupied/calmed down throughout the day.Hoped this helped.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WVTC8GEX0P1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006LA512#wasThisHelpful","R2WVTC8GEX0P1E","AASY3BT1OGA6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AASY3BT1OGA6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First let me tell you what I look for in a case: Something that protects the phone, without adding too much thickness or weight, something that adds or doesn't take away from the iPhone's great look, and something that is accessible with all the ports.This case isn't too bad for protection: has good sturdy sides with a clear plastic back. It also doesn't add too much thickness or weight.This case also looks nice..for the first five minutes. It smudges very easily, and the smudges don't want to get wiped off. The biggest problem, though, is the scratches. This thing scratches as much/more than a Speck Candyshell. It makes the iPhone looked scratched because of the clear back. It also shows scuffs very easily. The camera cutout doesn't interfere with the camera or flash, but I don't like how the cutout is below the glass on the back.The accessibility to the ports is fine, no problems with the buttons. The volume and power can be a little hard, but not a problem. The 30 pin to lightning connector normally works for me, but it doesn't feel like it would stay in forever.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this case to anyone, unless the price dips under $10, but for $20 (when I bought it), definitely not worth it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FEQDJ4H571S6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094CX4K8#wasThisHelpful","R3FEQDJ4H571S6","AASY3BT1OGA6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AASY3BT1OGA6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case is exactly what I was looking for. I have a white iPhone 5 and was looking for a case that had some protection, maintained most of the iPhone 5's thinness, and looked great. I got all of the things I was looking for.Protection:First of all, this is obviously no Otter Box or Speck Candyshell, but it's not meant to be. This case has a good lip on the front which allows you to put it face down without any problems. The back has the four raised orange parts, which will slightly elevate the back of your iPhone from the surface. This case will survive minor falls (from a few feet probably), but nothing drastic.Thinness/Size:Although you get okay protection from this case, it is pretty minimalistic. It is extremely thin and light, so you will barely remember it's there.Look:This case downright makes the iPhone 5 look gorgeous. It is not clear/orange like the case advertises, but a frost/orange. It adds a nice clean look to the back of the iPhone. You can very easily see the Apple logo and iPhone branding on the bottom. The orange also compliments the iPhone(both black and white). The front also looks nice with the orange border.Material: This case is a matte feeling polycarbonate case,with polyurethane borders(orange part). The back material is seemingly unscratchable. It also is anti-fingerprint. A great look and feel to the iPhone 5.Cons:I have three cons (only two big ones)1. The camera cutout does not in any way disrupt pictures taken on the device, but the cutout is a little big for my liking.(not big)2. Bottom piece below home button isn't supportive. It will sag with any amount of pressure. If you drop your phone and it hits the bottom, it will likely crack.3. EXTREMELY difficult to remove. Took me 5+ minutes, no exaggeration. If you are a person who changes cases a lot, I don't think I can recommend case for you.Overall, a very case. Would probably buy this case again if anything happened to it.Hope this helped.*Update* 11/13/12I have since stopped using this case for two reasons.1. The bottom piece has become very irritating.2. I don't feel safe enough with this case on my iPhone 5; not enough protection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NX9EYQB7XTHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009DW1TEM#wasThisHelpful","R2NX9EYQB7XTHM","AASY3BT1OGA6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AASY3BT1OGA6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This earphones are great..for the price.I have been using these for almost all of my listening, apart from when I use my over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones. These earphones provide great sound quality, good bass, and stay in my ear very well.The design of these earphones are a little different than normal earphones, but that is a very nice feature to these earphones. They allow you to have the earphones in your ear comfortably without them coming out. The rubber that goesin your ear is oval shape, and the plastic that is used to keep it in your earOverall a very good buy if you're in the search for even a sub $25 pair of earphones.

"We live in a cold climate and I have Reynaud's which means my hands and feet go white in the cold! These have been a complete lifesaver. They heat quickly and last for many hours. I often put them in my gloves about 30 minutes before heading outside to shovel or go for a walk, and by that point, they've warmed up the entire mittens ahead of time. You can just put them in when needed too, but I find that pre-heating the gloves works wonders for keeping the cold at bay.

"Works well once it's paired. But there are a few downsides:(1) You have to re-pair it each time you want to use it. I'm not sure how long it 'remembers' the bluetooth pairing but it's annoying to go into the phone settings and reconnect to it each time. I'm on an iPhone 6 with iOS 8 so maybe other folks have had a better experience with that.(2) It can only be paired with one device at a time. If you're used to a Sonos speaker, this will be more annoying because only one person's phone can be matched with it at the same time. In our house, we're always removing the connection or re-adding the connection.(3) Gives some new life to an older Bose sound system.

"I've had about 8 or 9 different high end headphones over the last 5 years. These are awesome for a few reasons:WEIGHT: Really lightweight. They are much much lighter than most of my other headphones. This means they are comfortable on your head for many hours, and don't add much weight to your bag when you're carrying them around. Cannot overemphasize how comfortable they are.SOUND: Very full and rich sound. They are not officially ""noise blocking"" but the earcups are very solidly built and I can barely hear any ambient sound when they're on. They might not be as nuanced as some $300+ headphones but they are absolutely great.COMFORT: Ear cup material is very soft and comfortable. They don't press into the side of your head, nor do they slip around. I cannot believe how comfortable they are.USABILITY: I'm always forgetting to charge my noise-cancelling headphones and never seem to have enough batteries. It's such a pain to have one more thing to charge and maintain, and these do not require anything of the sort. You never have to wonder if your headphones will die in the middle of a flight or during a workday.All in all: there are higher-end headphones out there, so if you're a huge audiophile geek, you might want to look around a bit. While I'm not an audiophile, I am very particular about sound and ambient noise, and these absolutely fit the bill. They are the most comfortable headphones I own and are -- HANDS DOWN -- my new favorites.These would also make a great gift!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P2KA5EE1XSGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUICOK8#wasThisHelpful","R2P2KA5EE1XSGF","A1FZ2I81RT0AUX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FZ2I81RT0AUX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great mask: - no velcro straps to get caught on your hair - ergonomically designed to prevent pressure on your eyes - extremely effective - very little light gets through - comfortable for wearing every nightUnfortunately, they do not last very long.

"We usually buy Musher's Secret, but at some point is stopped working as well. Maybe our tin was just dried up, or maybe it just wasn't working for our dog.This was featured in one of our local pet stores, and I picked it up as the material looked quite malleable compared to the stiffer Musher's Secret. This stuff is awesome - it's much softer and more ""mushy"" than Musher's Secret. This helps to really get it into the depths of the paw pads and saturate the fur around that area. It's not runny at all, just more like a thick paste rather than stiff wax.Highly recommended if you live in a snowy or cold environment. Our dog used to last a block before the salt and cold would start to hurt his paws and he'd do the whole ""lift a paw and whimper"" routine. After one paw was out, he'd hop along on three, but soon enough all of his paws would be too uncomfortable to continue. This stuff is truly ""magik"" and has allowed us to take wintery walks of up to an hour or more! In snow, on ice, on salted roads, etc.I'm not affiliated at all, just impressed with this product. It appears to be mostly natural ingredients such as beeswax, palm oil, almond oil, shea butter, coconut oil and a few others.We put it on right before a walk and so far haven't had any issues with it staining our floor or furniture.I'm purchasing another tub to have before this one runs out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVIP2UKZZZFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J81PFS#wasThisHelpful","R3DVIP2UKZZZFG","A1FZ2I81RT0AUX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FZ2I81RT0AUX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A truly delightful look at 123 varieties of apples: their strengths, their weaknesses, and their uses.This is a not boring recitation of information about apples. The author injects some humor and interest into all the descriptions. He also includes history and fun facts. For example, did you know that the character of Rambo by David Morrell was named after the Summer Rambo apple? That the apple that led Isaac Newton to ponder gravity was a Flower of Kent?Other fun comments about various varieties:Of the Blue Pearmain: ""This is the apple Elrond would have tended in his backyard in Rivendell, and it would have been off-limits to any dwarf or hobbit.""Of the Knobbed Russet (a very ugly apple): ""Uses: Terrify your children.""Of the Dabinett: ""Use: Don't eat fresh, unless sucking on tea bags is your idea of fun.""Of the Red Delicious: ""Texture: Both good and bad examples have that horrible leathery skin that likes to slide between your teeth and lacerate your gums....Use: Makes a great logo.""Definitely recommended for foodies and lovers of apples.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SJBW4QUH9H5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620402270#wasThisHelpful","R1SJBW4QUH9H5E","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5 starsMystic is a thoroughly unexceptional coming of age story. There is some promise to the plot and characters of Mystic, but the writing can be quite clunky, and for the most part it is derivative and formulaic.For example, Sim is the childhood friend of the young heroine Pomella, and Quentin the attractive newcomer. If Quentin was a fine, noble feast, Sim was comforting stew beside a warm fire. (P. 107 of the advance reader copy.) Regarding the High Mystic: Her slippered feet left no discernible footprints, as if she walked above the ground and not on it. (P. 112 of the advance reader copy.)There are no plot surprises, and I couldnt really picture any of the characters except Pomella. She is of color, which is a plus. Her nervous habit consisting of picking at her fingernails however  ugh.In an attempt to build his fantasy world, the author has the characters say yah instead of yes or yeah and use phrases like skivering luckn. I found the alternative spelling of common words like fathir and grandmhathir jarring and wondered why the author didnt just use English, as these words pulled me out of the story instead of in to it.It does not seem like this book is being marketed for kids or even young adults, but I found the plot and narrative to read quite young.

But what really goes on inside Slade House? For those who find out, its already too late. . . . .""That's the premise behind the newest offering from bestselling author David Mitchell. This fall, nine public libraries in Central Illinois partnered to celebrate reading through a program called Central Illinois Reads. Penguin Random House generously donated 100 advance reader copies of Slade House for us to distribute, and discussions took place in October before the book was officially released.I've never read Mitchell's Cloud Atlas or The Bone Clocks, but I don't think that affected my reading of Slade House too much. While Slade House does not bristle with originality, I was pulled in to the story after a slow start, and it is a very quick read. The language is rich and playful, and I was even surprised by some English phrases I didn't recognize. If you are looking for a short, spooky, seasonal novella to creep you out, look no further than Slade House. It's like a sweet but insubstantial Halloween treat.Bonus points for mention of the abbey on the Hebridean Isle of Iona (which I have visited and is suitably spooky) are slightly reduced by an eye-rolling mention of Hotel California (which I've been singing on and off since I first read the description of Slade House).Thank you to Penguin Random House and netgalley.com for advance reader copies of Slade House.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D3R2YPHH24Z1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812998685#wasThisHelpful","R3D3R2YPHH24Z1","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Haunted Season is the fifth book in G.M. Malliets Max Tudor series. Max is a former MI5 agent who left after his partner was killed in front of him. Now an Anglican priest in the quaint village of Nether Monkslip, he is married to his soulmate Awena, a pagan and owner of the local New Age shop. They have come to terms with their different beliefs and have a new baby, Owen.Much to the chagrin of his bishop, Max keeps getting involved in murders. This is a textbook cozy mystery series, full of quirky side characters, coincidences, and the occasional dead body to cause gossip and give the vicar an excuse to show off his deduction skills and intelligence.None of the books have lived up to the first, but this one was pretty enjoyable. Life seems a little too perfect for Max, and Owen is the most ridiculously well behaved and intelligent baby. There is a nice nod about halfway (p. 183 in the digital advance reader copy) to Agatha Christie, the master of the cozy mystery:I was just thinking that the genius of Agatha Christie was not that she saw the universal traits of mankind, like Shakespeare, but that she saw we are all quite different people, with differing motivations.The book has some flaws. The murder itself  decapitation by a trip wire while the victim was riding a horse  seems unlikely to come off so seamlessly or to take off a head entirely. The author relies a little too heavily on coincidence (the new curate overhears two of the main players in the crime discussing it miles from Nether Monkslip, for example), and there is a long, long (too long) section in which details of the crime are explained by Max and Cotton to Awena. A scene in which Max runs towards danger while carrying his baby is ridiculous. I cant believe Max wouldnt have thought first of the babys safety. But I have these kinds of minor complaints about many cozy mysteries.The book ended strongly, with the last line catching me off guard and piquing my interest about the next book in the series.I read an advance reader copy of The Haunted Season.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K50OD7BG15OE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250021448#wasThisHelpful","R3K50OD7BG15OE","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shadow Mountain Publishing has a line of books called Proper Romance. They are clean romantic reads without sex, violence, and bad language. I've read quite a few Proper Romances and find the line a welcome addition to the world of romance novels.The newest is Lord Fenton's Folly by Josi S. Kilpack, which has a gorgeous cover. I really enjoyed A Heart Revealed, Kilpack's previous Proper Romance, which concerned a woman during the Regency period suffering from profound hair loss.Lord Fenton's Folly also addresses an issue of the times - what to do with a child with mental impairment - but it's a minor side plot this time around. Lord Fenton does not respect his father and tried to embarrass him by playing the foppish fool and adopting macaroni fashion. His father, fed up with the behavior, lays down some ultimatums that Fenton must agree to or be disinherited. One of the conditions is that Fenton must marry. On his mother's advice, he proposed to Alice, a young woman he knew as a child. She has had a crush on him for ten years and thinks he feels the same. She is angered and hurt when she finds out otherwise.They marry all the same, and the novel watches them deal with personal crises, learn family secrets, and gradually come to rely on and love each other.I did not enjoy Lord Fenton's Folly quite as much as A Heart Revealed. It was very slow moving, and I would have liked more character development during the long period in which the young married couple was estranged. Lord Fenton in his foppish persona annoyed me as much as he annoyed his father. There are frequent references to witty banter, and yet there isn't much witty banter in the dialog. I was definitely ready for the ""falling in love"" stage of the marriage before it finally happened.Still, I am happy to have this category of romance to recommend to readers who want a clean love story, to lovers of Regency romances, and to Jane Austen fans. I read a digital copy of Lord Fenton's Folly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q91GM7U1F75N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629720666#wasThisHelpful","R3Q91GM7U1F75N","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is more of a 3.5 star book than a 4 star book, but since Amazon doesnt allow half stars, Ill go with 4.The narrative of An Inheritance of Ashes grabbed me right away. It is hard to figure out whats going on, but still I wanted to KNOW. Hallie is 16. She and her older sister Marthe are trying to hold on to the family farm. Marthe is pregnant with her first child, and her husband has not returned from the far-off war he travelled to fight. Marthe and Hallie have an angry, uncommunicative relationship. Their father forced his own younger brother off the farm years ago, and now Hallie is afraid her sister will do the same to her.The world building is, frankly, odd. Its dystopian, but whatever returned civilization to a more primitive time happened decades ago. Now, strange, twisted creatures that burn whatever they touch have come into our world from another. A hero named John Balsam ended the war against them by tearing a hole through the other world, but the twisted things are still showing up on the farm. Hallie, her neighbors, and a mysterious veteran who arrived at the farm seeking work and shelter for the winter must band together to figure out what is happening and save not only the farm but their entire community.I found the twisted creatures on top of the dystopia a bit much. It seems unlikely that both scenarios would happen  the twisted things are never connected to whatever events crashed civilization in the first place. It might have been more effective to set the story in an unnamed primitive society rather than a fallen civilization. It just really didnt make sense to me, but it  also didnt bother me *that* much. I still enjoyed the story.I liked some of the overwritten but unusual language, such as Heron stood before me, stiff and unshaken, his peculiar grace bleeding into the very air. It wasnt just northern manner, it was his sense of calling: the way a person held themselves high when they were devoted, without compromise, to something greater than themselves. (p. 45 of the advance reader copy) There is some cringe-worthy dialog, especially between Hallie and the young man who wants to court her, to balance out the nice stuff.The relentless negative relationship between Marthe and Hallie was hard to take at times, and the identity of the mysterious veteran is likely to be obvious to every reader even though it is not to the characters in the book. But I raced through this book and recommend it to readers who like dystopian coming-of-age stories.

"Hundreds of years in the future, Earth is run by an artificial intelligence. Originally human, turned into an AI in a quest for immortality, Talis took advantage of access given to him by people at the UN and forced the people of Earth to stop fighting wars. First, he blew up cities to get their attention. Then he took the children of all the leaders  the Children of Peace  to hold hostage against their good behavior. If there is war, the children of the leaders die.Greta, the narrator of Erin Bows book The Scorpion Rules, is one of those children. Canada is now the Pan Polar Confederacy, and she is the daughter of their Queen. If the Children make it to the age of 18, they are sent home and new hostages are taken. If their countries go to war, the Children disappear to some unspeakable end.We see Greta and the other Children her age studying in their classroom and doing chores on the farm. The characters are not particularly well drawn or memorable. Greta takes great pride in maintaining calm and control. The new boy, Elian, does not. He takes pride in defiance and anger, no matter how he is punished. There is much punishment in this book, and torture. The torture is not graphic but it is extremely evocative, and I found it hard to read.For the most part, the narrative engaged me. Despite my intense dislike of torture scenes, I did feel compelled to keep reading. I often enjoyed the authors way with words, like in this passage: Elian reached up and took one of my wrists, stopping the motion, looking me up and down. Im sure he was trying for as a man looks at a woman, but it came off rather more as an engineer looks at a bridge pylon. (p. 63 of the advance reader copy). At other times, the language was a bit overwrought (I closed my fingers around the gun, and rose to my feet like the Lady of the Lake. (p. 173))The ending of The Scorpion Rules surprised me, and the plot took a few turns I did not expect. There is a love triangle of sorts. Granted, it is an unusual triangle  a girl with feelings for a boy and a girl  but still, cant we be done with love triangles? That aspect of the plot was so, so tired. Greta also develops strong feelings of some sort for Elian almost immediately  not quite insta-love, but insta-something.Some cultural references fell flat, like a bad football joke and mentions of the Road Runner.  In his Utterances, Talis actually says, Resistance is futile. (p. 26 of the advance reader copy). Also, some scenes were a little too reminiscent of The Hunger Games series. For example, Greta is to be tortured, with coverage sent to her mother by video. The producer, Burr, paces about checking camera angles and noting things on a clipboard. He wants the other Children nearby for reaction shots. This scene reminded me very strongly of The Hunger Games (as did the repeated use of the words Tick Tock Clock Drop). But I guess it is hard to write a dystopian teen novel and not be compared to The Hunger Games.The Scorpion Rules is a first book in a series. It does not stand alone. This is a good thing if you really enjoy it and want more. The ending really left a lot of room for exploration in the next book. I would recommend The Scorpion Rules for readers of young adult literature who arent yet tired of dystopian works and also for questioning teens, as Greta is also questioning.I read an advance reader copy of The Scorpion Rules.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZWQRC6HYWP3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481442716#wasThisHelpful","R1ZWQRC6HYWP3M","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kitchens of the Great Midwest is a series of short stories set in the Midwest all loosely connected to one main character and to food. I dont normally care for this kind of narrative, but at least Kitchens of the Great Midwest moves forward chronologically instead of jumping around in time.I found it slow starting but really enjoyed it once I got into it. Chapters are set in Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, and South Dakota. Sad things happen, and touching things, but there is joy as well. We see inside the heads of a variety of Midwesterners, all of whom have a deep connection to food. Some recipes are included, and the plot is very up to date with the latest foodie trends.I was left wondering what happened to some of the characters we met in various chapters and heard little or nothing more about, but thats a sign of a well written short story. I do wish the book had a character chart, because Im sure I missed some of the connections in the final chapter (which brings many of the characters together).The book serves as a sort of recipe itself  a recipe for the life of one child born in the Midwest to Midwesterners whose life is focused on food.I recommend Kitchens of the Great Midwest most for foodies from the Midwest, but other lovers of quirky literary fiction should also give it a try.I read an advance reader copy of Kitchens of the Great Midwest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HIMCJ87MUUOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052542914X#wasThisHelpful","R3HIMCJ87MUUOW","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"M.C. Beaton has been publishing books about Agatha Raisin since 1992. I am a loyal Agatha Raisin fan and have read all 26 books in this cozy mystery series. There hasnt been much new in recent titles, but a new entry is still a fun read. I enjoyed Dishing the Dirt more than the last three books. It seemed a little more light-hearted.Having said that, the thing that intrigued me the most as I read Dishing the Dirt was the body count. Three dead bodies by page 34. Four dead bodies by page 57. Five dead bodies by page 70. Six dead bodies by page 96. Seven dead bodies by page 124. This is not a plot that takes itself too seriously! And weaving in and out amid the carnage is Agatha and her normal crew  James, Charles, Bill, Toni, Phil, Mrs. Bloxby. Mrs. Bloxby even gets a fun plot development of her own! (About time.)This is a great read for a plane ride, an afternoon at the beach, or other circumstances where total concentration is not necessary or possible. Its verra silly, as Beatons other series character, Hamish Macbeth, might say. And as has happened before, there is practically a whole other book in the Epilogue, with a teaser for the next book in the series.Dishing the Dirt is a definite recommend for die-hard Agatha fans.

"""Mischievous adult bear, No matter how hard it bites, scratches, or how far he goes, I have faith that its a gesture of Love!!!""I collect all the Dals dolls ever produced, and Gloomy Bear Dal was the first I seriously considered not buying. However, I'm glad I did. She is utterly ridiculous in her massive bear suit, and her little under-outfit is very odd (but based on a character). However, she actually has a very clean, pretty face. Her lips look odd in photos but are much cuter in real life. She has gorgeous dark brown eyes. Her wig is of normal quality - not fabulous, not terrible. She has as much appeal as a novelty as Gloomy Bear does, but her faceup also makes her a unique and interesting Dal.If you are a fan of Gloomy Bear, I recommend her. If you are a fan of Dal doll, she's an interesting addition to a collection (especially as long as she is priced below $40 - way below her original price).Dal dolls are not for small children.

"The Perilous Sea is not quite as good as The Burning Sky, but I still enjoyed it tremendously.With no explanation, the narrative switches back and forth between two timelines involving Titus and Fairfax. In one, they have no memories of themselves or each other but are in grave danger in the Sahara Desert. In the other, they are back at Eton with their classmates.There is a lot more romance in this book than in the first in the series. Minor characters are fleshed out and secrets are revealed. The plot definitely moves forward and ends with a grand set-up for book three. A well-built world, interesting characters, and a twisty plot - what more could I ask for? Looking forward to the third book. Now I'm going to get my hands on the audio version so I can hear it again to pick up what I missed the first time through.I recommend the series for Harry Potter and other fantasy fans who enjoy alternative looks at our own world and don't mind a bit of romance.

"In The Mathematicians Shiva by Stuart Rojstaczer, Rachela Karnokovitch, a ground-breaking woman mathematician, has died. A large cast of eccentric mathematicians and family members gather to honor her, mourn her, remember her  and try to find her notes on solving the Navier-Stokes problem, one of the most important (and real) problems of the math world.I picked up this book because of the presence of an African Grey parrot (spelled Gray throughout the book but not on the cover; youd think an editor would have caught and fixed that), but the parrot does not have a large role in the plot. The parrot speaks only Polish, and some of the mathematicians think the parrot might unknowingly provide clues to Rachela Karnokovitchs work on that math problem.A Pole who escaped to Russia with her father during World War II, she eventually immigrated to the United States and settled in Wisconsin. The book is narrated by Sasha, her one son.I found this novel a bit of a slog. I knew a book called The Mathematicians Shiva would mention math, but I did not expect it to contain actual math problems! And diagrams!  What a nightmare!If you understand, agree with or are amused by this quotation, you might enjoy this book: Maybe the most insulting thing you can say to a mathematician is something to the effect that math is all about numbers. Arithmetic is all about numbers and none of the people in the room gave a damn about arithmetic. (p. 195 of the ebook)The book is filled with words and phrases in Polish, Russian, Hebrew, and Yiddish (at least, I think there are words from all those languages), which made the reading slow going for me. The words are not always translated, and understanding them from context was work. The many references to traditions of the Jewish faith and culture that are unfamiliar to me also slowed down my reading.The Mathematicians Shiva is well written, it was just hard for me to relate to. The book ends very strongly, if you can make it that far. I recommend this book for readers of fiction set in Wisconsin, stories about trailblazing women, and books about math. (Not arithmetic.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QQJ2QJRTXKMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143126318#wasThisHelpful","R2QQJ2QJRTXKMO","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Youve heard of the Marshmallow Test. A child is presented with a desirable treat and given a choice  eat one now, or wait a bit and get two later. Versions of this test have been in use for over 50 years. In his book The Marshmallow Test: Mastering Self-Control, Walter Mischel talks about the test and also about its implications for behavior later in life.The ability to delay gratification, it turns out, is critical for a successful life, and reading this book made me think about my own behavior, goals, and self-control. Its not a fast read but contains thought-provoking statements like this:To resist a temptation we have to cool it, distance it from the self, and make it abstract. To take the future into account, we have to heat it, make it imminent and vivid. To plan for the future, it helps to pre-live it at least briefly, to imagine the alternative possible scenarios as if they were unfolding in the present. This allows us to anticipate the consequences of our choices, letting ourselves both feel hot and think cool. And then hope for the best. (p. 108 in the ebook)And this:The traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you either have a lot of or you dont (but cannot do much about it either way) is false. Instead, self-control skills, both cognitive and emotional, can be learned, enhanced, and harnessed so that they become automatically activated when you need them. (p. 171 in the ebook)I am not a scientist, and some of the text was a little too scientific for me. But there are plenty of fascinating stories about the techniques kids use to resist the treats to balance things out a bit. The text seems very well researched. I wasnt riveted, but I found The Marshmallow Test well worth reading. I recommend it for fans of Freakonomics, Mindless Eating, Stuff, and Quiet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VJSLBKE52YE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316230871#wasThisHelpful","R3VJSLBKE52YE5","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Death Comes to London is the second book in the Kurland St. Mary mystery series by Catherine Lloyd. The series is set during the Regency.  The second book isnt quite as good as the first, Death Comes to the Village, but it was still a four-star book for me.The growing romance between the independent Lucy Harrington, attempting to find her beautiful sister a husband during Londons season, and Major Robert Kurland, still recovering from a war wound and now being offered a baronetcy by the Prince Regent for his heroism, is slow but steady.  Some of the science seemed a little modern for the time, but on the whole the historical details seemed true. The mystery is a bit over the top, with too many plot details and too many deaths, but the book was still an entertaining and diverting read. I recommend the series to cozy mystery and fans and lovers of Regency novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9NGU9WHE6607/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758287356#wasThisHelpful","R9NGU9WHE6607","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally, a Dal with freckles! They seem randomly scattered too, so I wonder if each Chenille will look a little different. Her hair has a nice silky feel to it, and her faceup is adorable. I'm not a big fan of the animal suits, but I have to admit I like Chenille's just because she is so ridiculous, and because she is an Alice character, and also because the backside is easily removeable. She is a cute character and a cute Dal - I'm sure she will be lovely out of her caterpillar suit. And she is a normal priced release!

"Under a Silent Moon is the first in a new series. I love a good British police procedural, and this is a good one. The main character is Louisa Smith, a new Detective Chief Inspector. She had a brief relationship with one of her now subordinates, before she knew he was married. Shes attracted to the geeky Canadian analyst.The author is a police intelligence analyst, and it shows. The investigation and language feels authentic. Lou is an interesting character, and a number of supporting characters were well drawn with room to grow.The mystery was okay; I find the whole BDSM angle a little overdone these days but it was fine.

"Imogen Rockford is a normal American teenager with a secret  she is part of the British Rockford Dynasty. Her grandfather was the Duke of Wickersham  a title just below royalty. Although she never expected to inherit the title and the manor, as her father was the second son, she finds herself with both. Her grandfather is dead, his two sons and their wives are dead, and her cousin Lucia is dead. Imogen is all that remains of her family.When Imogen leaves New York for England, she does so under a mysterious warning that came in an anonymous letter. She is filled with questions about how her cousin died, whether she is in danger, whether she herself is quite normal -- and how that cute boy she had a crush on as a child will react to her return.The attempt at gothic suspense is a bit over the top at times. (Lucias hairbrush, perfume, and makeup are arranged in orderly fashion on her vanity, and its then that I recognize the jasmine scent that has been wafting in and out of my bedroom over the past weeks. The scent is HER PERFUME. (p. 157 in the advance reader copy))Suspicion is competently written and is sure to delight any teen who would enjoy a slightly spooky paranormal mystery with a likable heroine and a touch of romance (despite the completely unbelievable plot twist at the end). The book cover is breathtaking and it alone will convince many a teen to give this book a try.Although not presented as such, Suspicion is surely meant to be the first book in a series, and I see more adventure (and much more romance) for Imogen in future books.I read a digital advance reader copy from Netgalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28F9DAAZCWCEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385743890#wasThisHelpful","R28F9DAAZCWCEW","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read What Makes This Book So Great by Jo Walton for a couple of reasons. First, I love Jo Walton. Her book Among Others inspired me to start a science fiction/fantasy book discussion group at my library. That brings me to my second reason  I was hoping to get some good titles from this book for my group to read.Jo Walton has read a lot more science fiction books than I have. Wow, has she ever. Reading What Makes This Book So Great was so similar to Among Others in some ways that I started to wonder if Among Others is not a novel but a memoir, and there really ARE fairies in Wales. In both books Walton throws out a lot of titles and authors for the science fiction readers consideration.I enjoyed the book overall because it was like chatting with someone I dont know well but like. The book is made up of a series of blog essays that were no doubt meant to prompt online discussion. The online discussions are not included. Some of the essays were fairly meaningless to me because I have not read the books or authors being discussed. However, I was definitely able to glean enough information about many works to decide whether or not to add them to my potential book club titles list. (Whether I can get my hands on enough copies of out of print books is another question.) By the time I finished What Makes This Book So Great, it was filled with little pieces of paper on pages I wanted to go back to.Some of my favorite musings from this book:There are two kinds of people in the world, those who re-read and those who dont. No, dont be silly, there are far more than two kinds of people in the world. There are even people who dont read at all. (What DO they think about on buses? (p. 17)Fantasy, post-Tolkien, has been largely involved with retelling Tolkien, or revolting against Tolkien. (p. 342  too true, but I like the way she said it)The Suck Fairy is an artefact of re-reading. If you read a book for the first time and it sucks, thats nothing to do with her. It just sucks. Some books do. The Suck Fairy comes in when you come back to a book that you liked when you read it before, and on re-reading  well, it sucks.  Suck Fairies travel in battalions. Her biggest siblings are the Racism Fairy, the Sexism Fairy, and the Homophobia Fairy.  Then theres the Message Fairy. The lovely story you remember as being a bit like The Phantom Tollbooth has been replaced by a heavy-handed Christian allegory! (pp. 420-422)If you are a hard core science fiction reader, or want to be, I definitely recommend What Makes This Book So Great. Even if I cant choose some of these titles for book club, I will add them to my own to-read list!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLE266GZUGSNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765331934#wasThisHelpful","RLE266GZUGSNW","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike some of my friends and coworkers, I was not a huge Laura Ingalls Wilder fan growing up. I read the Little House books, but I dont remember them having a big impact on my childhood reading. Laura Ingalls Wilder is woven into the literary mystery that is the plot of Bich Minh Nguyens novel Pioneer Girl.Narrator Lee Lien is the daughter of two Vietnamese immigrants. Her father is dead; her mother and grandfather run a restaurant in the Chicago suburbs. Lee has disappointed her mother by getting a PhD in literature instead of something more practical. She continues to disappoint her mother by searching for work in her field, instead of resigning herself to the family business.Lee is jealous of her older brother, who she sees as her mothers favorite, and complains about her mother constantly. The family has an heirloom and a story. In 1965 a woman named Rose visited her grandfathers caf in Saigon and left behind a small gold pin. The pin sounds like a gift given to Laura Ingalls Wilder by her fianc and described in one Wilders books. Lee becomes obsessed with trying to discover whether the Rose from the family story was Wilders daughter Rose.There are some great passages in Pioneer Girl. There is a spot-on description of American Chinese buffets at the start of Chapter Three and this musing on small towns in the Midwest:""Mansfield, Missouri reminded me of how the past will not be banished. So many small, dying, basically dead towns in the Midwest looked like this. Where once-graceful, ornate courthouses and libraries  back when libraries meant something important, something civic  had been, if not torn down or boarded up, converted dozens of times over into shops and offices and apartments and barely surviving historical societies. There might even be the remains of an ambitious opera house. The nicest building in town was likely to be a funeral home.Main Street had been built broad, to accommodate horses, buggies, and hitching posts. And surely local efforts tried to preserve the historic downtown area. Surely there were sad little parades on Memorial Day or the Fourth of July. In Mansfield a few local shoppes offered olde-fashioned ice cream and sewing notions, but it looked like most of the money was flowing in and out of the paycheck advance and pawn shops."" (p. 140)Still, I had some issues with the novel. The narrator is not very likable. In addition to being a whiner, she is a thief. While doing research, she steals a photograph, a letter and a book. She talks about racism, ignorance about Asian culture, and stereotyping, but she herself stereotypes, and not in a self-aware manner.""A small band of researchers squinted over Hoovers notes and newspapers, setting up cameras on tabletop tripods to record their findings. They were a standard lot  frumpy and frowning, pallid and disheveled."" (p. 76)At times I felt that the author was judging the Midwest and finding it wanting (and once the narrator refers to the University of Illinois as UI, something no true U of I graduate would ever do). There is a random, out-the-blue sex scene between Lee and someone she just met that seemed pointless.However, especially in light of recent high profile cases in the U.S. of unarmed black men being killed by white police officers, the themes of this book are quite timely, and I loved the books cover. If you are a fan of literary mysteries or novels dealing with stereotyping and race in America, you may find Pioneer Girl an interesting read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMGXU56F44VDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025097#wasThisHelpful","RMGXU56F44VDC","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a big fan of the film The Princess Bride, so I eagerly anticipated As You Wish, a book about filming the movie written by Dread Pirate Roberts actor Cary Elwes.The making of The Princess Bride was clearly one of the highlights of his career and life. If you are looking for dirt, don't look to As You Wish. Elwes is effusive in his praise of his costars and the crew behind the movie. Everyone was beautiful, talented, and perfect for their roles.The sugary sweetness of the narrative was a little hard to take at times, but I thoroughly enjoyed As You Wish all the same. Elwes spends a lot of time talking about what he and Mandy Patinkin went through to create what Goldman described in The Princess Bride script as the ""second-best"" swordfighting sequence on film (according to Goldman, the ""best"" comes later in the movie). The fight and the training were very interesting to read about. The only part of the fight not filmed by the two leads were the flips - wow! That had to be a lot of hard work.I definitely got the impression that Elwes is trying to give his career a shot in the arm by publishing this book. However, his true affection for The Princess Bride and its cast and crew came through.As soon as I finished the book, I was ready to run off and rewatch The Princess Bride. If you are a fan, that alone is a good reason to read As You Wish. I definitely recommend it for all Princess Bride fans.I read an advance reader copy from Netgalley of As You Wish.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FADJ8V7IKQBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476764026#wasThisHelpful","R1FADJ8V7IKQBD","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vendettina is the second Dal to be released in 2014. She was made for San Diego Comic Con and is a Tokidoki collaboration superhero with a limited edition of 250. So far as I can find, she does not have a Feel Like So.The box is adorable, covered in Tokidoki artwork.Vendettina has a gorgeous faceup, with blue and purple accents. Her hair is a bit kinky out of the box, but soft and lovely with streaks of neon yellow and pink. Mine has a nice stiff body.Her outfit is mostly pleather. It will likely stain over time. The inside of her cape also sports Tokidoki artwork. She comes with a mask, a staff, and a hair accessory. She does not come with a collector card.

"In 1932, a man named Harm Drenth (also known as Harry Powers) was executed. He had been convicted of killing a woman named Dorothy Pressler Lemke in his home of Quiet Dell, West Virginia, but it is thought that he killed dozens if not hundreds of other women. The bodies of Asta Eicher, a widow from Park Ridge, Illinois, and her three children were found in the same grave as Dorothy Lemke.Author Jayne Anne Phillips was told the story of what happened in Quiet Dell by her mother, who was six years old when her own mother walked her past the scene of the murders. Jayne Anne Phillips was inspired by this family connection to write her novel Quiet Dell.Quiet Dell is well researched and contains many known facts about Drenth and his crimes. It contains a few black and white photos and quotations from newspapers of the time. But it is not true crime nonfiction. It is a fictional retelling.The book begins in December 1930, focusing on the Eicher family. The narrative is gripping; I was pulled into the story from the start. Asta and her three children prepare for Christmas dinner with their friend and former boarder, Charles OBoyle. Asta is in desperate financial straits, and although he is gay, Charles wants to marry her and help raise her children. He already considers their family his family and dreams of changing his ways. Asta dreams of the letters she keeps hidden upstairs and of the man who wrote them. The correspondence began through a lonely hearts ad; she hopes to meet him in person in the spring.The Christmas celebrated in Quiet Dell is a charming look at a loving family. The children put on a play. They enjoy a fine meal and go sledding. The beloved family dog, Duty, participates in most aspects of family life, including the Christmas play. But the sad thread of what the future holds for the family runs underneath the narrative.Although the narrative is fictional, it is mostly based on real people. That changes after first Asta and then the children are taken away by a man known as Cornelius Pierson. Fictional characters are introduced. One of them is a modern professional woman, a journalist who covers the trial. She forms a very sudden and lasting attachment to one of the real people depicted in the book, which was a bit jarring. Another fictional character becomes friends with Charles OBoyle. I wondered whether any relatives of the real people are still alive and what theyd think of the liberties the author takes.I was very interested in the coverage of the trial, but found the romance heavy-handed and distracting. It reminded me of how I feel about the movie Titanic. There is so much real drama in these stories that the added fictional drama feels unnecessary.The novel is also a bit fanciful. We are set up from the beginning to know that Annabel, the youngest Eicher child, is special. You are not like others, her (fictional) grandmother tells her. Your dreams see past us. (p. 8) Indeed, after Annabel is murdered, her spirit remains and narrates some chapters of the story.This book is well written but will not be to everyones taste. I enjoyed it as an alternative to reading a nonfiction retelling, but theres much speculation, and its hard to know what is real and what is made up. I recommend Quiet Dell to people who like books that meld fact and fiction and who enjoy imagining what real people in a sensational event thought and how they felt.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJHCZATCW055/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439172544#wasThisHelpful","R3AJHCZATCW055","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wish I could give this book 4 and a half stars, but since Amazon won't let me, I'll give it four. I explain why at the end. It's a great book - a long tale that you just want to keep going. The world building is excellent. I'm looking forward to the last book in the Kingkiller Chronicle.The main character, Kvothe, is fascinating. Flawed, likeable, mysterious, proud, with a grim and terrible sense of right and wrong. He is intelligent and talented but does not always know his own limits. And what has brought him to his current situation, an innkeeper unable to defend himself against two robbers and waiting to die?Some passages in this book were an absolute delight. One of my favorite sections was the end of chapter 123, when Kvothe is tested by the Adem. His solution is novel and clever. ""You are one great gaudy showboating bastard, you know that?"" asks his teacher afterwards. ""Seriously, it's like you stepped out of a storybook.""I loved the Adem and their hand language. I would have liked Tempi to leave with Kvothe so we could see more of him.Another intriguing character is Master Elodin. A kook, but one of great depth and power, with a method to his madness. I wanted to know more after Kvothe idly asked him (thinking of his friend Denna), ""What would you think of someone who kept changing their own name?""""What?"" [Elodin] sat up suddenly, his eyes wild and panicked. ""What have you done?"" ... ""Oh, CALLING names. God's bones, boy, I thought...."" (p. 978) We know names are important and give you power, but can one really change one's name? I hope this is explored more in the last book.Anyway, Rothfuss is a great writer, and if you like a good long adventurous fantasy tale, you definitely should read The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear (and get in line for book 3).I give this book four stars instead of five because of the endless, meandering, boring interlude with Felurian in the world of the Fae that interrupted the fascinating story of Kvothe and his team of bandit hunters and ground the narrative to a halt. It runs 11 chapters and felt three times that. OK, we needed to know a few things that occur during this period but a chapter or two would have done the trick. I hope Felurian does NOT make an appearance in book 3.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO0LFO8UW3D2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756404738#wasThisHelpful","RO0LFO8UW3D2L","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A Beautiful Blue Death is set in Victorian London. Charles Lenox is a gentleman with an interest in solving crimes. Lady Jane Grey is his good friend from childhood, now a widow.This book reminded me of Anne Perry's mysteries and of the stereotypical perception of Sherlock Holmes. However, I never felt I got to know Lenox or Lady Jane very well. There are extremely subtle hints of a possible romance, but nothing of note happens in this book.The book is very readable, but I found it a bit slow, and the mystery convoluted but not clever.  In particular, the last chapters after the climax felt  well, anti-climactic. The historical details seem well researched. I had a hard time believing Lenox's familiar relationship with his butler. Lenox's good friend Thomas McConnell is somewhat of a cardboard cut-out of a doctor who drinks. We are told that McConnells marriage to his wife Toto is pretty much over, but that's not how it comes across the rest of the book. The police inspector of course is not clever enough to solve anything without Lenox's help. The book feels like a cookie-cutter Victorian mystery. (Also, seriously, the main character has the same first name as the author?)My favorite character was Sir Edmund, Lenox's brother and a baronet, but also an eager partner in investigating with Charles.This series is now up to eight books, so it must be popular and fairly well received. I'm not sure whether I will give the second book a shot or not. I might, for Edmunds sake.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4GHV5PZ7DQBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312386079#wasThisHelpful","R4GHV5PZ7DQBX","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Absolutely delightful, the best Georgette Heyer I've read. There is a romance reminiscent of Colonel Brandon and Marianne's, and the main couple is patterned after Darcy and Elizabeth. And the main character has a penchant for meddling like Emma. The historical elements feel accurate, and the exchanges are witty and endearing. The language throughout is a treat.Sir Horace is a large, loud widower who is travelling more than he is at home. He has one daughter, Sophy. When he becomes engaged to a woman who does not wish to be seen as Sophy's stepmother, Sir Horace arranges to leave Sophy at the home of his sister, Lady Ombersley, in hopes that she can get Sophy married off.All is not well at Lady Ombersley's home. Her husband is a gambler who has endangered their home and lifestyle. Her son Charles has come into enough money of his own to take control from his father, but this role has turned him into a stodgy and humorless fellow. His many younger brothers and sisters don't feel they can confide their troubles to him. His oldest sister is determined to marry a dull and clueless poet instead of the fine gentleman who is in love with her, and Charles hasn't the sense to let the romance run its course, instead taking steps that make her all the more determined. Charles is engaged to an intolerable and dreary young woman his family cannot abide.Sophy arrives at the Ombersley home in all her glory - in a chaise drawn by four horses, with a greyhound, a parrot, and a monkey - and turns the lives of the family upside down. She interferes right and left until all are engaged to the right people and she has found love as well.If you are a fan of Jane Austen style romances and haven't read The Grand Sophy, I recommend putting it at the top of your To Read list.One note: there is an offensive racial stereotype of a money lender that somewhat mars this otherwise delightful novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ZDJH1GGS2J7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140221894X#wasThisHelpful","R33ZDJH1GGS2J7","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I give this book five stars because (1) it's Beowulf, (2) it's Tolkien, and (3) it has a lovely cover. I confess to being thoroughly lost much of the time, both while reading the poem and while reading the commentary. But how fabulous it would have been to attend a Tolkien lecture! At least I got some sense of that. I most enjoyed finding little items in the commentary that resonated with my knowledge of The Lord of the Rings.The most readable part of the book for me was Sellic Spell. Tolkien wrote:This version is a (emphasized) story, not the (emphasized) story. It is only to a limited extent an attempt to reconstruct the Anglo-Saxon tale that lies behind the folk-tale element in Beowulf .... Its principal object is to exhibit the difference of style, tone and atmosphere if the particular heroic or historical (emphasis) is cut out. ... And by making it timeless I have followed a common habit of folk-tales as received."" (p. 355)Whatever its principal object, Sellic Spell was very readable and understandable compared to Beowulf itself.My absolute most favorite part of the book is this line from Christopher Tolkien about including the Old English version of Sellic Spell. ""[T]he interest of this text lies chiefly, in my view, in its demonstration of my father's fluency in the ancient tongue."" [p. 407] It's touching that Christopher Tolkien is so fiercely proud of his father's accomplishments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GJKBF4TJLSTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544442784#wasThisHelpful","R3GJKBF4TJLSTS","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh Agatha, Agatha - will you never learn? Apparently not, and perhaps that's why we love her, but it would be nice to see some emotional growth in our beloved Agatha Raisin.The Blood of an Englishman is the 25th book in the Agatha Raisin series, and it is for the die-hard Agatha fan only, not someone new to the series. This is a typical Agatha Raisin novel - mildly amusing narrative, outrageous plot, Agatha on the prowl for a husband and jealous of her young assistant Toni. This book requires no effort to read.If you like cozy mysteries set somewhere in the United Kingdom - this series is set in the Cotswolds - I do recommend the Agatha Raisin series. Agatha is a middle-aged detective who is ferocious in her pursuit of a crime's resolution. She is insecure, and her gruff exterior hides a good heart. She is an unashamed smoker who adores her cats. Her surprising best friend is the vicar's wife. The first book is Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death.I read a Netgalley advance copy of The Blood of an Englishman.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM20E1WUEIKJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312616260#wasThisHelpful","RM20E1WUEIKJ8","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of fantasy novels and have had friends tell me I should read Outlander. I've seen it on ""best of"" lists for both novels and science fiction-fantasy. With the new Starz TV show, I chose it as this month's selection for my science fiction-fantasy discussion group.It's well written, and I had no trouble finishing it. The historical details seemed accurate to me, and I didn't get bored. However, I didn't love it.Outlander is a historical romance. At least in this book in the series, the only ""fantastical"" thing that happens is that the main character, Claire, falls through time from 1945 to 1743. Don't get me wrong, I like a good romance, but I had an issue with this one. Jamie, Claire's 1743 husband and apparently her True Love, whips her because she deserves it. He forces her to have sex and reminds her multiple times that she has promised to obey him. This may be 100% accurate for a man of his time, but these are not qualities I'm looking for in a husband. At least as presented in this book, I found Claire's 1945 husband Frank much more attractive than Jamie, and this is probably why I had trouble really being engaged by Outlander.I'm glad I've finally read Outlander so now I know what the story is about, but I won't be reading more books in the series. If you like historical fiction, romance novels involving Scotland or Scots, and fish-out-of-water romance plots and don't mind bawdy references and detailed sex including rape, I recommend Outlander for you. I don't recommend it for fantasy fans unless they also like historical romance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DYWROJ2ZEWNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440212561#wasThisHelpful","R2DYWROJ2ZEWNZ","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just listened to the audio version of the American edition again. I first read this book when it came out and have read and listened to it many times since. I rate this sixth of the Harry Potter books, but they are all brilliant in their own ways and critical to the series. This one feels like it was rushed to print and needed another round with a good editor.I have a particularly hard time with how stupid Harry is in this one, although it's not really his fault given his complex connection to the soul-shattered Dark Lord. Also, reading it always makes me wonder what J.K. Rowling has against librarians.  The only other sound was the slight squeaking of one of Madam Pinces shoes as the librarian prowled the aisles menacingly, breathing down the necks of those touching her precious books. (ch. 24)""Madame Pince was swooping down upon them, her shriveled face contorted with rage. 'Chocolate in the library!' she screamed. 'Out  out  OUT!' And whipping out her wand, she caused Harrys books, bag, and ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran."" (ch. 29)Two of my favorite parts of book 5:Percy sends Ron a letter to warn him off Harry, part of which reads:""I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Potter. I must tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of losing your badge more than continued fraternization with that boy.It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter  I know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent""Ron gives the letter to Harry to read, and when Harry finishes it, he looks up: Well, he said, trying to sound as though he found the whole thing a joke, if you want to  er  what is it? . Oh yeah,  sever ties with me, I swear I wont get violent.Give it back, said Ron, holding out his hand. He is   Ron said jerkily, tearing Percys letter in half, the worlds  he tore it into quarters  biggest  he tore it into eighths  git. He threw the pieces into the fire.Its a poignant reflection on Harrys personality that he tries to make a joke to Ron, while no doubt secretly fearing that a brothers opinion is more important than his own friendship. Its also a touching reflection on Ron that he immediately lets Harry reads the letter and tears it up and burns it without giving it a seconds thought. And its also a glimpse into Hermiones feelings for Ron, as after this episode she agrees to correct their homework when she had been refusing and scolding them about falling behind.Another favorite passage is when the advance guard from the order come to Privet Drive:Harry descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring at him, stowing his wand into the back pocket of his jeans as he came.Dont put your wand there, boy! roared Moody. What if it ignited? Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know!Who dyou know whos lost a buttock? the violet-haired woman asked Mad Eye interestedly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKYJFWUY0YJ5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0439358078#wasThisHelpful","RKYJFWUY0YJ5R","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Calico Joe is a lovely and lyrical short novel, a bit sentimental at times but very nicely done. I am a Cubs fan and particularly enjoyed that one of the main characters is a Cubs player in the early 1970s. I remember so many of the real players who are mixed in with the fictional ones.This is my first John Grisham novel, so far as I remember, and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the audio version.

"Im a huge fan of Jane Caseys Maeve Kerrigan series, so I was quite interested to read How to Fall, her first young adult thriller/mystery.I wouldnt call How to Falls plot terribly original (identical cousins, anyone?), but the writing kept me thoroughly engaged. The author gets points from me for having her main character read the novel Cold Comfort Farm. While How to Fall is not as good as her adult mysteries, it is well written. Jess, the main character has dimension. I think young adults will tear through this book.How to Fall might have been more suspenseful if not written in the first person, and I felt a bit let down after the climax. The ending is abrupt, but oh wait, thats because its the first in a series. I did not see THAT coming. I will definitely watch for and read the second book in the series. The Jess Tennant series could develop into something really good.I recommend How to Fall to readers who already like Jane Caseys Maeve Kerrigan and to anyone who enjoys well written young adult thrillers with okay plots but interesting characters and settings.I read an advance reader copy of How to Fall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZABLZ9KSKVD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250040655#wasThisHelpful","RZABLZ9KSKVD3","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoyed The Silkworm, although not as much as The Cuckoos Calling. I dont mind a gritty mystery, but the level of gruesomeness and depravity around the murder in this book was higher than I care for.Cormoran and Robin are very well drawn, and I liked the character development that continued for them and even Matthew (to my surprise). I found the plot a bit convoluted. There were so many new characters that I had a very hard time keeping them straight. Still, I did not guess the resolution of the mystery. The oh-so-literate quotations before each chapter did nothing for me.I enjoy J.K. Rowlings style and sense of humor, and her use of British words and phrases.

"Fin & Lady by Cathleen Schine is a sweet novel about half siblings in New York in the turbulent 1960s.Fin is 11 when his mother dies, leaving him an orphan. His father, also dead, had a daughter by a previous marriage, and Lady is the only family Fin has left. Lady is 23, and not exactly the model guardian. She retrieves Fin and his dog Gus from the Connecticut farm where he grew up and takes him back to New York City with her.Lady is a wild child, a glamorous figure Fin hardly knows. Shes seeking something, and even she is not sure what. Fin is seeking a family, and he finds it, awkwardly, in Lady and her black maid Mabel.Lady is the kind of person everyone falls in love with. She has multiple suitors and three in particular. Fin has a favorite, a Hungarian named Biffi, and Fin adds Biffi to his family as well, although Lady is reluctant to settle down with any of them.The dialog in Fin & Lady is smart, a little too smart sometimes, but enjoyable. Information about the 1960s is woven into the plot in a believable way for the most part. Fin is always reading, various real books that also reflect on the times and Fins life with Lady.I liked spending time with Fin and Lady, and I enjoyed Cathleen Schines writing style. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a nice character-driven novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ95C0JS53MMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250050057#wasThisHelpful","RJ95C0JS53MMI","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive never read any Joe Abercrombie but was intrigued by the cover on the advance reader copy of Half a King. What a great story! I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The main character, Prince Yarvi, is sympathetic, believable, and imperfect. Although some characters, like the ships captain, are stock, Yarvis closest companions are well drawn. It was easy to tell them apart.After about 40 pages of world building and otherwise setting up the story, the action begins in earnest and doesnt let up. Yarvi is cast into the wild world friendless and alone, and he makes his own new family. The plot took a number of turns I didnt expect, and there was one twist at the end that both surprised and delighted me.I enjoyed the dialog, especially when the mysterious man called Nothing was involved.  If you have a plan, hissed Sumael from the corner of her mouth, now would be the time.  I have a plan, said Nothing.  Does it involve a sword? asked Jaud.  A pause. All my plans do.  Do you have a sword?  Another. No.  How will your plan work without one? muttered Sumael.  A third. Death waits for us all.I fell into this book and just wanted to stay there. I look forward to the next book in the series. I recommend Half a King for any lovers of high fantasy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26JQ0HM5MAYLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178321#wasThisHelpful","R26JQ0HM5MAYLX","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Allison Brennan is the bestselling author of a number of series. Notorious is the first book in a new series. It stars Max Revere, the investigative reporter on a cold case television series.Ive never read any Brennan before but I enjoyed this book. Once I started I was engrossed and wanted to keep reading to see what would happen next. I didnt guess where the plot was going or the resolution of the mysteries. The beginning was excellent, the middle was mostly good if a little draggy, and the end was and intense and terrific (*see spoiler below). For the most part, the information about the police and the investigations seemed well researched and realistic (*again, see spoiler below).I did have a little trouble connecting with Max. Abandoned by her mother as a child, she doesnt know who her father is but inherited millions from her great-grandmother upon her death. However, there is a lot of room for character development of both Max and her new love interest in future titles in the series.This is a fine start to a new series. If you like an investigative mystery, I recommend Notorious.Spoiler alert:*Aside from the too Hollywood climax involving a dangerous stunt on a car for the heroine and a cop shooting out the tires of a car with small children inside.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O3KGNLEMGRF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250035058#wasThisHelpful","R2O3KGNLEMGRF4","A22WMN0DVWE2OJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22WMN0DVWE2OJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The writer of this book makes a good comparison between the people of Noah's time and  of people today.  Sin was rampant as Noah tried to tell everyone of God's coming judgement.  As always, God offered them salvation, safety from the coming flood.  Just as today, Noah was ignored exactly the way we ignore today's prophets.  God is a patient God but eventually follows through with His judgement.  Think of this.  It took Noah 120 years to build the ark.  During that time, God delayed judgement and Noah preached, but no one listened.  Sin is again abounding on planet earth.  God is again exercising patience, but in due time the door of (today's) ark will close, the righteous will be saved and the lost will be just that---""lost""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YB6W5TG0PK7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2YDB6G#wasThisHelpful","R2YB6W5TG0PK7S","A2WUF2RV65T3Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WUF2RV65T3Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are so many facts and prophesies contained in this small but significant work.

"I wonder how it felt to be called 'A friend of God'?  Abraham was just that.  Not because of something he did;  Not because of who he was; But because of God's grace.The life of Abraham is a life that is not necessarily any different than our own.  Yet God called him His Friend.  He was Gods' friend when he was weak, when he was strong, when he did right and when he did wrong.  Why?  He had faith in God and exercised that faith in his daily life.  Abraham's life was not always pleasant but his faith was among the strongest of Old Testament and New Testamentcharacters.  The author brilliantly compares the parallel of the Old Testament to the New, while taking you along on a journey that leads to promises.  Promises only God could fulfill.  What a delight when, at times I could see myself in Abraham's shoes.  And I could see my 'Friend' standing next to me.  If you could only read one book of faith and love this year, I would hope it would be this one.One clear message I received from this book is that, ""If you want God to be your friend, be careful where you pitch your tent.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CAY794F7PWVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DL0PQ6#wasThisHelpful","R1CAY794F7PWVL","A2WUF2RV65T3Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WUF2RV65T3Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was an enjoyable read.  The unusual twist by having the narrative done by Christ Himself was, in itself rather compelling.  I would say this book is a combination of 'The Passion of the Christ' and 'Pilgrim's Progress.'  It is well worth the read, but as in any book of this type the author does take 'liberties' with some of his conclusions.  Just over half way through, it is as though another book was written as you read a narrative of the combination of all the Gospels.  I think the book would have been better if it had concluded without the addition of the, rather redundant telling of the story again.  Before some of you go off on me, I must affirm that the Gospels are the authority of the Passion of Christ and are not, in any way 'redundant.'  It's just that in this format it was like reading the same book twice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HOWQJZH527BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085XKLBC#wasThisHelpful","R1HOWQJZH527BE","A2WUF2RV65T3Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WUF2RV65T3Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just like you, I read, read, then read some more.  I'm picky about what I read.  I research  before I choose what to read next.  For that reason, I usually like what I read.  However sometimes I pick up a book that goes way beyond my expectations.  A read that grabs me and won't let go.  A Masterpiece.  This is one of those masterpieces.  What is the purpose of a true story?  What is the purpose of a 'not so true' story.  If it's done in the right way, what does it matter?  Tim O'Brien, a Vietnam Veteran himself, takes you along into that terrible time when men went off to fight in a distant place for a somewhat distant purpose.  The things the foot soldiers carried with them into the jungles were both tangible and secret.  Never have I read a more difficult but brilliant expose' on the horrors of war.  Do soldiers kill so they won't be killed?  Do they kill because they are told to?  Do they kill because of a personal ghost, or fear that drives them beyond any moral or religious feelings?  Reality hides itself way back in the soldier's mind while it also screams at him with another reality.  He must do what he must do.  Many fine warriors carried a lot more out of Vietnam than they carried in.  Many continue to carry it today.  The weight of their rifles, knives and other killing tools have been lifted from their shoulders. The internal demons, thoughts and dreams they continue to carry.  The burden is overwhelming.

"Before starting my review, I strongly suggest reading 'The Harbinger' by the same author. It will help prepare you for the explanations given in ""The Mystery of the Shemitah.""  ""The Mystery of the Shemitah"" is probably the most exciting, deep, thorough and informative of any prophetic book I have ever had the pleasure to read.  I must warn you that this is not an easy read.  The facts and figures contained are absolutely mind boggling.  You must read this with no distractions.  You must concentrate on every word.  This work will also lead you back to your Bible.  Jonathon Cahn has done an incredible study of ancient Israel and its relationship to God.  The overwhelming theme is that of a nation blessed by God, and then turning away from Him. The Shemitah is a series of Sabbath Years that begin in 586 BC and continue up to the time we are now living in.  Some have asked, ""Where is the United States in bible prophecy?""  No one knows for sure but this book will give you some direction toward that question.  The author compares the U.S today with the nation of Israel throughout ancient history, up to modern times and how the Shemitah appears in these time periods.  Are we as a nation still following the One that has blessed us so much or have we turned our back on Him?  What might we expect in the future?  Blessings, judgement, pride, redemption and restoration are all covered here.  Where does the Shemitah fit in?  Can we change our destiny?  Only if you are serious about the condition of the world and the United states,  should you read this very, very important work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GD528YOVU96N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LKBSAZA#wasThisHelpful","R1GD528YOVU96N","A2WUF2RV65T3Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WUF2RV65T3Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this one.  We study about the Disciples all the time, but how much do we really know about them?  This question is skillfully answered by this author.  About one third of the book is primarily about Peter.  That shouldn't surprise anyone as Peter was the most outspoken and was generally at the forefront of all that was taking place.  It's impossible to know 'all' about each of Christ's closest followers but what is known (and more) is well covered.  I personally enjoyed trying to identify which of these men I was most like.  I picked two.  One was the person I definitely identify with and the other was the person I would rather identify with.  Whether you are a relatively new Christian or have been a Christian all of your life, you will find this book very informative, interesting and easy to read.  Your Sunday School class or small group could easily use this as a study.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6UOHLHRYI720/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000S1LXSY#wasThisHelpful","R6UOHLHRYI720","A2WUF2RV65T3Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WUF2RV65T3Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this mouse in return for my review.  When I first opened the package, my first reaction was ""What""?  Its design is really unique.  It was an easy install (plug and play) so no issues there.  It is a bit contrary at times and you may have to left click if it stops working, thus the 4 star review.

"I see that I am going against the grain in giving this book only 2 stars, but as in all my reviews I give my honest opinion as I see it.  The 'editorial' comment was that it is ""The most important story of the Christian faith.""  I don't know what that comment is based on.  I read historical fiction on a daily basis.  This book is a novel.  An author can and does take certain liberties and embellishments when writing a novel.  Wangerin took this to a new level as he attempts to introduce you to Christ.  He portrays Jesus as a somewhat rude, self centered taskmasterthat comes off with an almost abrasive personality at times.  To his credit, this author is a good story teller.  I just find it unfortunate that he chose to alter the person of the 'real' Jesus to a point that in my opinion could do a lot of harm to someone that reads this book.  Please get a Bible and read the book of John in order to find Jesus.  It is much smaller than this novel and is filled only with truth.  You will see a vast difference between a 'novel' and the true 'Word of God.'","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24D9MI8PSXPKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MAHCJK#wasThisHelpful","R24D9MI8PSXPKX","A2WUF2RV65T3Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WUF2RV65T3Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a tremendous book.  By using David As a boy with a stone for a backdrop the author takes us along a rather unusual trip with a man that was truly a man in God's favor.  But a man is what he was, with all his strengths and weaknesses.  As you take this venture you will find yourself and your life in comparison with that of a man that would be King.As always, God's plan will be be worked out in His way and in His time.  That way is not always easy and sometimes not even easily understood.  One thing that really stands out in this book is the fact that God can and will use us in spite of ourselves.David starts out as a young boy with a great love for God.  It is his faith in God that removes his fear and challenges Goliath.  We all know in this age old story that Goliath is defeated and falls.  However Goliath is not the only 'giant' David will meet throughout his life.The author puts us in the 'shoes' of David not only in his spiritual life but also in times of defeat, doubt and mistakes that weave through his life when he becomes complacent or shall we say lazy due to his own ego and agenda.David's life in many ways can be compared to today's church and today's Christians.  The book is a page turner and the lessons learned will be a great asset to your walk with God.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z66X3L74954K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QHFWWA#wasThisHelpful","R2Z66X3L74954K","A2WUF2RV65T3Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WUF2RV65T3Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes I read a book and then wonder ""Why?""  This story fits into that category quite well.  Take an undertaker, sheriff and preacher (same guy).  Add a devastating fire and a deadly contagious disease.  Put all this into a small town.  Add a large portion of madness, and confusion.  There you have it.  A book that basically has no beginning, no end and not much in between.  Right up to the last page, I searched for a plot but alas, it eluded me.

Nathan Ford is not totally dogmatic in his interpretations, but actually delves into others' thoughts also.

"This was a much smaller book than I had expected because just over half way through it ended.  The rest of it was commercials of his other books and then portions of the Bible that one could have read in their own.  The examples he used of Flawed but Faithful characters were not really anything new as the characters he used and their stories are so familiar to most of us.  I believe his personal notes were at times questionable.  As an example, he stated that Lincoln was a Christian.  Abraham Lincoln never made a public  profession of his faith, and although a good man was somewhat 'wishy-washy about religion in general.

"Just like C.G Richardsons' ""The Cellar"", this book is written with great imagination.  Malchus was the servant of the High Priest, Caiaphas during the time of Christ's Crucifixion.  He is only mentioned once in the Bible.  He is the one that lost an ear to the sword of Peter.  The author takes you on a trip seen through the eyes of Malchus as he follows Christ.  This method of story telling was brilliant as it  is used to tell the 'real, true Biblical story of the trial, crucifixion and resurrection of the long awaited Messiah.  We don't know what happened to Malchus, but it would be nice if we could imagine his life as it is told here.  I would highly recommend this read for the believer as well as the non-believer.  The author shows great depth and understanding of the Bible and presents this story in a manner that is both fact and fictional.  I really liked the way Malchus was developed into a story of what he may have seen and how it impacted his life.  This book is a wonderful example of how one can be led to Christ through the avenues of fiction along side of fact.I have just started Richardson's third and final book with great expectations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D5PX8XC8NNV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IX57A1G#wasThisHelpful","R1D5PX8XC8NNV9","A2WUF2RV65T3Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WUF2RV65T3Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just a quick review here:  I have seen most of Mike Leigh's films and really enjoyed them, but this one unfortunately didn't work for me.  It's very slow, very dull, and most of the time I couldn't understand what the actors were saying.  There's very little insight into what made Mr. Turner the artist he was, and I just didn't care about the characters at all.  I usually am a fan of Timothy Spall and the other Leigh regulars, but it seemed like they weren't given much to work with.  I can't recommend this movie except for the lovely cinematography and the set designs/decoration, which were excellent.  It's sad, because I really wanted to like this movie.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0IYQWHUEF0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBFMCW8#wasThisHelpful","R2I0IYQWHUEF0A","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4/5 stars.  This is a really interesting book.  I enjoy books that explore legal/ethical questions and this one does that and then some.The book is structured like a novel.  We are introduced to Eric Blair (real name of British author George Orwell), a fictional district officer and police magistrate in 1920s Burma.  He's in his mid-twenties, inexperienced, not a lawyer - yet is expected by his superiors to deal with some fairly knotty legal issues in the town of Moulmein, with little help from said superiors.  Through Blair's interactions with both the local people and the British officers and civilians living in the area, we are shown various criminal, legal, social, cultural, moral and ethical problems to mull over.  Blair is sometimes more of a social worker than a police officer or magistrate; he's a bit of an odd duck and doesn't really fit in with the ""Raj"" type of English officer.  He doesn't have the sort of automatic prejudice that seems built into the British attitude towards the ""natives"" (meaning that their problems or needs are automatically assumed to be somehow less than white people's problems).  He also isn't able to deal with things by the book - he tends to look at things on a case-by-case basis, and sometimes gets in trouble for it.  He befriends a local Indian doctor, Dr. Veraswami, and they have many discussions about how Eric is going to deal with the problems that crop up.Some of the issues include rape/murder, child abuse, domestic violence, murder committed in a fugue state, attempted murder by a mentally disturbed person, illegal drugs given to a dying patient, and the question of whether a child should be left with a parent or adopted by a family that can give him a better (more prosperous) life.  Given that Blair is not a lawyer, he naturally struggles with what must be done in each case, and he often feels inadequate to the task and very bothered by the aftermath.The style of the storytelling is very leisurely, sometimes a little too much so, but I liked that each story is given time to develop the background so the issue or crime is fully understood.  I also liked the way the author used Blair and Veraswami's discussions to show all the possible ways to look at the ramifications of each case and its possible conclusion.  The questions raised in each case are fascinating and could be very useful in an ethics or philosophy class, as well as the obvious use it could be in a law class.The only reason I'm taking off half a star is that the book falls apart a bit at the end.  The author has Blair participating in an sexual affair with a married woman and this part didn't really work for me.  It's too melodramatic and didn't fit in with the rest of the book and seemed to be just filler, plus a way for the author to get Blair to leave Burma (because of the ""scandal"" of the affair).  I would have left this part out and ended the book in a different way.Overall, I would highly recommend this book for students of the law, and as a useful book in philosophy or ethics classes.  It will stimulate a lot of discussion.  And it will stay with you for a long time after you read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VNLTBFW92SYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195093860#wasThisHelpful","R3VNLTBFW92SYG","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found this book brutally hard to read, but it's so good, and so important a topic, I had to say so in a review.  Author Katy Butler's experience with her aging parents and their final years is so close to what my family went through with my parents that at times I had to turn away from the book,because it stirred up so many emotions and memories.  I wish I had been able to read the book before my parents left the world; it would have made it a little easier to feel that someone else has had these experiences and got through them, and maybe I wouldn't have felt so inadequate.  People caring for elderly relatives often feel completely alone, and it can be very frustrating to try to figure out what may be the best course of action in a given situation.  Butler perfectly captures this feeling and honestly explores her relationship with her often-difficult parents and siblings while navigating the medical system during her parents' last years and illnesses.I highly, highly recommend this book to everyone.  If you haven't yet gone through your parents' final years, you will.  If you've already gone through them and you have children, buy them a copy, because they will be going through it with you in the future.  Yes, it's that important.  Butler spells out everything you need to know for yourself or a loved one, emotionally and about things like advance directives, DNR, nursing home/assisted living vs. keeping an elderly person at home, and hospice services.  It's very hard to read, and it's hard to think about, but we're all going to be there at some point.  Our medical system is not set up to help people deal with end-of-life issues; doctors want to preserve life at all costs, and sometimes people are better off not going through heroic medical procedures at age 80+.  Read this beautifully-written, extremely moving book, and talk with your family about it.  It may be the most important discussion you ever have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HGMEPL9UFFJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451641982#wasThisHelpful","R3HGMEPL9UFFJD","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently finished watching the 6-hour television documentary based on this book, so it's hard not to compare them as I was reading the book.  I thought the documentary sometimes veered into ""weepy backstory"" territory (my term for the unfortunate practice of reality shows' pulling viewers' heartstrings by having a participant tell about a family member with cancer or disability), but overall I thought the filmmakers did a good job with the book's material.  Oncologist Dr. Mukherjee is an engaging writer (and an engaging presence in the film) and I think he does justice to the sometimes dry facts he has to work with.  The first 150 pages or so are the best.  The history/biography of cancer is very interesting and the early treatments seem either ridiculous or brutal, as well as nearly always ineffective, as seen through modern hindsight.  Where the book sort of fell apart for me, and where I had to take a break from reading, was in the endless chapters about chemotherapy drug trials.  This material gets a little repetitious.  I wish Mukherjee had included more of his own patients' stories in these sections rather than reciting endless facts about chemotherapy trials.  I think it could have made this material a little more accessible.  (There are some patient's stories included, but I would have liked a little more.)I learned quite a bit about how the U.S. ""war on cancer"" came to be: through doctors and through philanthropic individuals who felt strongly about making the fight to beat cancer a priority, and pressuring the government to fund research.  We have a lot to thank these people for, and we also owe a huge debt to both the patients (many of them small children) and their families for being willing to go through often-futile treatments in search of the ""one cure"" that always eluded them.  These people were incredibly brave.This book highlights the fact that we still sometimes view cancer as a forbidden subject and that doctors sometimes still don't tell patients all the information they need once they're diagnosed.  However, books like this one, and films like the one based on it, will definitely help open up discussions and help both patients and doctors communicate effectively about how to treat this disease.  I highly recommend this book for those with an interest in medicine and the history of medicine, and especially for potential medical students.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NHNPLA8RIQD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439170916#wasThisHelpful","R1NHNPLA8RIQD6","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me say right off the bat that Dietland's humor and attitude won't appeal to everyone, but I loved it.  Author Sarai Walker says she was influenced by Chuck Palahniuk's Fight Club, which probably would have been enough to get my interest in her book, but she's done a great job of creating her own crazy world.Main character Plum is a plus-size woman who has always had a problem with her weight.  She's considering bariatric surgery as a last resort, having tried the usual barrage of diets without success.  She buys clothes for her future thin self and imagines the day when she'll be able to walk down the street and be noticed for her attractiveness (Walker calls it something that is unprintable here) rather than her size.  She works for a popular magazine aimed at young girls, but remotely, since her employer apparently doesn't think it would be good for business if anyone saw a less-than-perfect (read: not thin) woman working at the magazine's office.  Plum answers readers' questions for an ""Ann Landers"" type column.  It's mind-numbing work, but she's happy to be employed.  She spends a lot of time at a local coffee house, where one day she notices a young woman who appears to be following her.  Wondering why anyone would do so, she investigates and finds a sort of underground community of women who refuse to live by what they consider the standards of men.A subplot of the novel involves a strange guerrilla group begins to commit terrorist acts against those who mistreat women.  As repugnant as their acts would be in real life, in the fictional world, I applauded them.  Sometimes I have wished the same fate on men in groups like ISIS or other extremist organizations who want to keep women under their thumbs (or under burkas).Plum eventually is accepted into the underground community, and begins to examine her own views on sexuality, appearance, size and her place in the world, with empowering results.As I said above, I really enjoyed this book.  As a plus-size woman who has also tried many diets and given up, I can vouch for Walker's depiction of Plum's journey from young girl on her first diet to her realization that size may not matter that much, and that it's important to live in the now rather than the nebulous future.  Walker also accurately skewers the diet industry with her very funny sendup called the ""New Baptist Plan"".  I loved her dark, dark humor and honesty about what it's really like to be on the fringes of ""normal"" (thin) society and never really fit in anywhere.  She's got a great writing style.  The book flows well and never gets dull or caught up in preachiness.  There's just enough of an angry edge to keep it away from being a pity party for Plum.  There are many memorable characters.  This is a first novel, but it reads like it was written by someone with a lot of experience under her belt.  It really spoke to me on a lot of different levels, and I look forward to more by Walker.  Very highly recommended, with the caveat that it's not a light, fizzy book - but it IS a very satisfying one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAMT5M3TFZK3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054437343X#wasThisHelpful","RAMT5M3TFZK3H","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this book!  Author Ellen McCarthy has taken the many interviews and stories she has written as a wedding reporter and boiled them down into a sort of relationship guide book that includes a lot of dating and wedding do's and don'ts.  The short pieces are arranged by subject - dating, commitment, breakups, weddings and ""making it last"".  Some of the pieces are funny, some touching, others smart-alecky, but all contain a lot of truth (especially about marriage - I've been married almost 31 years and can vouch for what she says about long-time commitment) and are very enjoyable to read.  It's one of those books you can pick up and put down and skip around reading various sections.  I particularly liked ""Good on Paper (But Not Good Enough for You)"", ""Online Dates to Avoid"", ""Planning Hell"", and ""Be Nice"".  But almost all the pieces are very good, and, as I said, filled with truth and real wisdom about relationships.  This is a book I would love to give to a young person who is starting out in the dating scene, along with ""He's Just Not That Into You"", which for all its snarkiness also contains a ton of good information about the dating world and relationships in general.I recommend reading this book even if you're not dating or heading towards a wedding, just because it's is so heartfelt and enjoyable.  It would make a great gift, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XL3PRRRIFAY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345549694#wasThisHelpful","R2XL3PRRRIFAY0","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bad Doctor is a graphic novel that chronicles the experiences of a small-town general practitioner called Dr. Iwan James, in Wales.  Dr. James has some issues of his own, which help him to understand some of his patients and help them.I liked the graphic novel format.  I don't have a lot of experience reading graphic novels and often think of them as being only about superheroes or supernatural type stories, and it's nice to discover that there are other types of stories available.  The illustrations here are black-white-gray, which I also like.  I have problems with the highly colored, densely packed kind of graphic novel; my visual issues don't allow me to easily read them.  This one was very pleasant and enjoyable to read.  The illustrations also suit the text perfectly.The story is darkly humorous - Dr. James sometimes fantasizes about shooting himself after seeing certain patients, and he has a history of OCD.  His patients are sometimes easy to help and sometimes almost too complicated, and he spends a lot of time trying to figure them out.  For relaxation, he goes on long bike rides with a friend.  He has an understanding wife and some good colleagues.  So why isn't he happy?  Why doesn't he think he's a good doctor?  The novel explores all this in a funny and entertaining way.  The author makes the point that although doctors are often thought of as exalted beings, they're really just people like their patients, sometimes with the same weaknesses and problems.This book would be a great gift for a medical student, but I would recommend it to almost anyone, because it's both thought-provoking and enjoyable to read.  I would like to read more from this author/illustrator.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EOSQ79T3J96D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0271067543#wasThisHelpful","R3EOSQ79T3J96D","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, I can't tell you how shocked I am that this awful, awful book got so many 5-star ratings.  I have no idea what people see in it.  It was highly recommended to me by two good friends who both ""loved"" it and read the whole series.  I had a very hard time getting through it; I kept putting it aside to read other books, because it wasn't enjoyable.  I am getting rid of this book as soon as possible and have no interest in reading any more by this author.I'm not going to bother with a synopsis; there are plenty of them here for you to read.  Although the book is billed as a time-travel historical romance, I have to say I found it extremely unromantic and the time travel element was merely a device to get the heroine to where she needed to be for the storyline.  As for the historical part - the book didn't seem well-researched to me.  The author focused so much on sex and violence that the daily lives of the characters were given short shrift.  Such a shame, because part of why I expected to like it was because of the historical context.  Claire seemed to take about five minutes to easily adapt to her altered life.  I'd have expected a little more difficult adjustment period.The book is not well-paced and should have been edited down to half its 600-page length.  There are many stretches that are extremely dull and I kept wondering how long it was going to take me to slog through it.As to the characters, I don't feel they're well-developed or sympathetic and I don't feel Jamie and Claire have any chemistry as lovers.  Having a lot of sex doesn't constitute a relationship, and they both come across as stupid.  Most of the other characters are uninteresting.  The depiction of the bad guy as gay or bisexual and the implication that he was evil-because-gay was disturbing.I tend to agree with those reviewers who say the author needs therapy.  I really don't know what is going on in her head either.  The constant scenes of rape, torture, beatings and more rape were sickening.  I don't find that sort of thing sexy or romantic, and I am by no means a prude.  I also understand that life in the past could be brutal.  But that doesn't mean an author needs to constantly and disgustingly describe such scenes.  There are ways that a more competent author could have implied that things happened to a character without spending 5 pages lovingly describing them.  I don't think she's that great of a writer or stylist anyway; this story could have easily been told in many fewer pages and with a lot more charm and verve.  It's much closer to torture porn than romance novel.  And I have read a LOT of romance novels in the past.  Even the bodice-rippers of the 70s and 80s were nothing like this.  I also agree with the reviewer who said she's read all the Game of Thrones books and didn't find them as creepy as this book.It's just not a good book, folks.  I know I'm going to get dinged by all the Outlander-Lovers out there.  I don't care.  I don't recommend it to anyone.Now I have to figure out what I'm going to say to my two friends when they want to know how I liked it....","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UHTREIGI8XMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440212561#wasThisHelpful","R1UHTREIGI8XMV","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm sorry to say that I wasn't overly impressed with this book.  In brief, it's the story of two neighbors who live in a somewhat remote area where theirs are the only two houses.  Emily grew up in her grandfather's house, Howie lived in the other house with his wife and daughter.  They've never spoken; they only know each other by sight.  Howie is sort of a hermit and fairly uncommunicative in general.  Emily has night terrors as a child and something called ""sleep paralysis"" as an adult.  She manages to function, but barely.  Both are what I would call dysfunctional on a number of levels.The book gives Howie's backstory, then Emily's, and then transitions to present day, where Emily has returned to her grandfather's house after he is taken ill.  He dies, she stays, but is so unable to take care of herself that Howie ends up being sort of a caregiver for her, in his own house, which turns out to be beneficial for both.Part of why this book didn't appeal to me is that Howie is so affectless that he's sort of annoying to read about.  There just isn't much to him.  He has an equally annoying daughter, Harriet, who comes in and out of the story and also isn't very interesting.  I found Emily's medical/mental issues interesting but overall she, too, is not a compelling character.  I just didn't feel any emotional connection to any of the characters or to the story.  The blurb on the back of the book states that the book is ""powerful, poignant and bighearted"" but I did not feel that way at all.I think the book needed to be a lot weirder or more offbeat.  There isn't much to the story, and although author Wodicka has a nice writing style, without a really strong story to pull me in, I can't get into a book.  I can't recommend this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHLVBX9VJBTMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307377059#wasThisHelpful","RHLVBX9VJBTMU","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently read Corban Addison's debut novel, A Walk Across the Sun, a novel about human trafficking, and enjoyed it.  Addison is a lawyer and activist who writes about human rights issues.  This new book concerns crimes against women in Africa, and attempts to honestly depict the corrupt police force and legal system of that country, along with explaining some of the cultural/societal reasons for their behavior.This novel's main character is Zoe Fleming, a well-connected American human rights lawyer working in Zambia.  When a young girl with Down's syndrome is sexually assaulted, Zoe teams up with police officers and social workers to find the perpetrator and bring him to justice.  They are constantly thwarted by an unethical police department and a legal system that does not seem to care about the most vulnerable members of society.  Zoe has personal reasons to take this case to heart and see it through to its end.  She also has problems making inroads with the people she meets, since many of them distrust whites.  In addition to the crime of child rape, the book addresses the continuing issue of AIDS and the stigma attached to the disease.I didn't find this book to be as compelling as the previous one.  It's not badly written; I wouldn't call Addison a great stylist, but he keeps the story moving along fairly well.  I think part of it is that although I have great sympathy for the women and children who are being victimized, the story got a little bogged down with Zoe's personal angst (directed mostly at her father, a bigwig in American politics).  Another problem is that Kuyeya, the rape victim, is essentially a symbol for disabled children in Africa, who are victimized and mistreated simply because they're disabled.  African society apparently views them as a curse and according to the author, four in five of these children die before their fifth birthday.  This is tragic, but the problem with this character is that she's not very compelling to read about; she's more of a catalyst than a real character.I also had a problem with the fact that in almost every instance, the bad guys in the story were able to steal evidence or threaten Zoe and her team.  This often happens in television shows (Orphan Black, I'm looking at you), where, for the convenience of the story, doors are easy to jimmy or a window is somehow left unlocked.  I would think, if this story were happening in real life, that these people would have better security, check their doors and windows, make sure whoever is guarding the entrance gate can't be paid off!  It just makes the story less believable for me when the writer needs his characters to be stupid or careless in order to make the story work.However, having said this, I think these issues are very important and I appreciate Addison shedding light on them.  We may not be able to change laws or cultural views overnight, but making more people aware of them is a good thing.  I recommend this book to those who, like me, have an interest in global humanitarian causes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWJUKXXBKPYVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623651298#wasThisHelpful","RWJUKXXBKPYVX","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Small Mercies isn't a bad book, it just isn't what I would call a great one.  It's a portrait of grief.  The story of a blue-collar Irish-Italian family in Staten Island, some ten years after 9/11, it covers a week in the family's various lives and goes into their history through flashbacks.  Gail and Michael Amendola have three grown sons, two living, one dead in the wreckage of the Twin Towers, and the family is still grieving, including dead son Bobby's widow, Tina.  Tina is finally trying to move on and has a new boyfriend, the news of which causes the rest of the family fresh pain.  Living sons Peter and Franky have a multitude of problems of their own.  Peter may lose his job and is estranged from his own family due to a major indiscretion at work.  Franky is a raging alcoholic with anger management issues, who can't hold a job.I liked some of the characters - Gail and Tina particularly, and in flashback, Michael's immigrant parents Maria and Enzo.  Franky is pretty hard to like, and Peter I found annoying because his problems are really due to his own foolishness.  Gail will probably never move on from Bobby's death - she keeps his room as he left it, and won't consider moving to another state because she would have to leave his grave behind.  Tina's brave attempt at having a fresh start is admirable.  I think the author did a good job depicting both the problems and the deep attachments of a multi-generational family, and I found parts of the book to be very moving.Some of the things that didn't work for me in the book were the overly graphic sex descriptions, which didn't seem necessary.  Maybe it's because I'm getting older, but this kind of writing seems more like filler to me than actual content.  I also found some of Franky's behavior in one of the last chapters disgusting.  He's a violent, racist thug and it's easy to imagine him dying from alcohol poisoning after his nightly drink-to-blackout benders. (The author makes brief reference to Gail's father Sean being the same type of drinker.)  I think these things brought the book down a few notches in quality.  It's also a fairly depressing book.  Yes, it's about grief, but I think it would have benefitted from a little humor or levity at times.I also wasn't crazy about the back-and-forth in time during the same chapter.  Some authors are more adept at this than others.  I was often confused about the time period in this book.Overall, I liked, but didn't love the book.  I think parts of it are well done, with the caveats above.  I would cautiously recommend it for book clubs as long as you don't mind some vulgar language and sex.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E4UKHL715GF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525427295#wasThisHelpful","R3E4UKHL715GF4","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book effectively depicts the horrific practice of human trafficking by giving it a face - that of Indian teenage sisters Sita and Ahalya, orphaned by a tsunami and picked up by opportunistic traffickers on their way to another town where they have relatives.  The plot of the novel could be taken from any one of a number of trafficking cases: the girls are sold into prostitution and slavery, treated about as horribly as you'd imagine.  Added into the mix is American lawyer Thomas Clarke, on leave from his high-powered law firm in Washington, he ends up working in India for an anti-trafficking organization while trying to get his estranged Indian wife back.  Soon he's on the case of tracking down Sita, who has been taken from India to parts unknown.The novel is a good, quick read - you'll want to read quickly to find out what happens, and Addison is adept at getting the reader from A to B to C in a page-turning fashion, without a lot of fuss.  I wouldn't call him a great stylist by any means, but he gets his point across well.  This subject needs light shed on it in any way possible, and I think books like this are an effective means.  I didn't find the novel overly preachy, and it's also not overly zealous in depicting what the trafficking victims go through - we know what's going on, we don't need the graphic details.I liked the book and I recommend it for anyone interested in the topic of human trafficking - hopefully it may inspire people to take up the cause.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDBLHPW2PSGWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623651514#wasThisHelpful","RDBLHPW2PSGWG","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Did You Ever Have a Family is one of those rare books where storytelling, characterization, and a beautiful writing style come together to create an emotionally authentic literary experience that will stay with you for a long time.  I haven't read any of Bill Clegg's other writings - this is his first novel - but if his previous work is anything like this, I'll be reading all of it.The story takes place in a small Connecticut town where June Reid is planning for her daughter's wedding.  Through a terrible accident, her daughter, future son-in-law, ex-husband and current boyfriend are killed.  In the aftermath of this unimaginable loss, June takes a road trip to the other side of the country, where she holes up in a beachside motel.  Each chapter of the novel is told from the point of view of a different character - first person narrative for some, third person for others - and so we get to know both the Connecticut townspeople and various people in the beach town where June is staying, and gradually understand their connections to one another.  Clegg is very adept at giving each character a distinct voice.  I particularly liked Edith, the flower shop owner who was supposed to provide the wedding flowers, and Rebecca, the co-owner of the motel.  The depiction of the town, through the eyes of its long-term inhabitants, is great - it's one of those tourist towns mostly populated by weekenders and renters, where the ""have-nots"" serve the ""haves"".I really like how Clegg is able to get to the emotional heart of the story without being maudlin or wallowing.  That's rare.  I need the emotional connection to be invested in a story and characters, but I hate fake or cheap sentiment.  I also like the ""shoulda, coulda, woulda"" aspect of the story, where various characters are either sorry or grateful for the fact that they did or did not take a certain path in life.Although the book will certainly sound like a depressing journey, I found it very balanced because Clegg provides enough instances of past or present happiness to counteract the sad scenario that drives June on her road trip.  I also think the emotional honesty and sincerity, plus the wonderful characters and beautiful, almost poetic writing, make the story so appealing that even those who normally shun ""sad"" books will find this one worth their time.Very highly recommended.  It's definitely a keeper for me.  I look forward to more from Mr. Clegg.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K2O5DMZ5UU34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476798176#wasThisHelpful","R1K2O5DMZ5UU34","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hyacinth Girls is a terrific exploration of teenage behavior and emotions.  It tells the story of Callie, a 13-year-old girl accused of bullying a schoolmate to the point of the other girl withdrawing from school.  Callie's guardian, Rebecca, can't believe that the girl she knows is capable of such behavior and jumps to her defense, but gradually finds that things in Callie's life may not be quite the way she thought.  Along the way, author Frankel explores Rebecca's past and her relationship with Callie's parents Joyce and Curtis, both of whom she knew since childhood, and the reason Callie lives with her.  It's a strong and affecting narrative, and I read it very quickly over the course of a day.The bullying angle in the book reminded me strongly of two other novels, one from the past (Margaret Atwood's Cat's Eye) and one I finished a week ago (Ruth Ozeki's Tale for the Time Being), both of which feature severe bullying of a young girl mostly by other girls.  It's a difficult subject to read about, since no parent ever wants to believe that their child is either being bullied or actually is a bully.  It's hard to imagine that your child might have driven another person to the brink of suicide.  But since this scenario seems to play out daily in America, despite anti-bullying school campaigns and schools being declared ""no bullying zones"", it's obvious that Frankel thinks we need to continue to discuss and shed light on this societal problem, and I agree with her.  I would highly recommend that anyone with a young teen in the house read this, and that the teens read it too.  As Frankel points out toward the end of the story, getting parents and children talking about bullying - hopefully leading to a real solution to the problem - should be encouraged.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PRIB2BZKMMTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055341805X#wasThisHelpful","R2PRIB2BZKMMTP","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't an easy book to review.  Kate Bolick's Spinster is part memoir, part sociology, and she gives the reader quite a bit to think about.  Why are so many women single these days?  Can a woman make a life for herself that is satisfying without marriage?  Although I found it slow in the beginning (after the all-over-the-place first chapter I was ready to rate it at two stars) it really picks up after a while and creates a lot of food for thought, so much so that it's hard to boil it down in a brief review.  Sometimes I felt the memoir part could have been cut down a bit - Bolick sometimes veers into navel-gazing territory, and her prose is occasionally over-flowery.  I'm from the ""get to the point already"" school of thought, so I found it a little irritating.But it gets better.  Bolick examines various stages in her own life - she's in her 40s - by weaving in stories about several women from the past, including social reformer Charlotte Perkins Gilman and poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, who either remained single or lived as if they were.  The life stories of these ""spirit guides"" were often a lot more interesting to me than Bolick's own stories.  Bolick uses their example as a starting point to examine how modern women can choose to forge a life without marriage and not be viewed by society as either ""failures"" or ""lacking"" because they choose to live alone (or to live separately from a partner).  She also brings in her mother's story of having been a working mother who never realized her potential as a writer because she never had the time, assuming she'd have time once her children were grown, only to die early.  Bolick's mother's early death seems to have heavily influenced her self-examination and decision not to lightly enter into marriage and child-bearing just because others she knew were doing so.  The book shows that our modern idea of ""having it all"" has been around a lot longer than we realize, and that we are still far from an easy solution.Spinster isn't so much about single women as it is about women living life on their own terms, and realizing that not having a partner or spouse might actually end up being an advantage in some ways.  It's also a brief history of working women in America and workplace problems that women still face, such as pay disparities and not being taken as seriously as men.  It raises issues that all parents should discuss with their daughters, granddaughters, nieces, daughters-in-law...about developing their own resources, career, and personality independent of a partner or spouse first, rather than dreaming of the prince who will take them away.  Our society's seeming obsession with dream weddings tends to overlook the fact that we still have a pretty high divorce rate, so obviously those princes aren't the answer to women's prayers after all.I really enjoyed the ""spirit guide"" stories, especially that of journalist Neith Boyce.  And navel-gazing aside, Bolick makes so many good observations and points that I found myself underlining and making margin notes all over this book.  I highly recommend it as both a book to savor by yourself and one to share with any young woman of your acquaintance (and having that discussion I mentioned above).  And you know, it really wouldn't hurt for men to read it, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB66KRTFYT7CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385347138#wasThisHelpful","RB66KRTFYT7CH","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very pleased with the results after using these print-yourself business cards.  We needed a few cards for my husband to occasionally hand out because we own rental property and sometimes deal with repair people who ask for a business card.  Since we only need a few, it was more convenient to print them ourselves than to have to order a large number from Staples or another store.As to the process itself:  It's not difficult to start; you go to Avery's website and enter the number of the product, then start looking at the templates available.  There are quite a few choices so it takes a while to find just the right one.  They're grouped by type of business.  Some are extremely specific, others more applicable to various types of businesses.  Some designs I found too busy-looking, others too boring, but eventually I narrowed it down to two and got to work inputting my information into the first template, which I eventually rejected because I couldn't find an ink color for the font that looked good with the colors on the card's design.  This was a problem with a number of the cards - oddball colors and ""busy"" designs taking up way too much room on the card.  The second choice ended up working much better and after a lot of fiddling around with the text boxes (with quite a bit of help from my husband), it came out quite well.I will point out that I'm not experienced in doing this kind of project, so I definitely needed more help than someone who is experienced.  I got a little frustrated at times and it took me longer to get the cards done than it would for someone who knows what they're doing.The quality of the cards is pretty good.  They punch out of the perforations well, if not always perfectly, and the colors look good.  We experimented with both ""standard"" and ""best"" quality settings on the printer and did not notice a great difference between the two.  Using the ""standard"" setting saves some ink, always a good thing.  I also made a sheet of cards for my jewelry instruction business, and I like the homemade cards better than the ones I got made at Staples a while back.  I had more design choices on the Avery website, and the colors and layout are more attractive.Another plus about making your own cards is being able to save your template for future use and being able to make changes, such as if you need to change a phone number or email address.  You can add text boxes to the designs if you need to (which we did on my card).  There are a lot of color choices for the fonts and lots of font choices as well.  Once I got used to playing around with the text boxes, I had fun with the colors and fonts.Overall I would highly recommend these cards: they look great, they're enjoyable to make, easy and convenient to print out as many as you need, and you can save the template for future use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KM62VVJS669J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008BOV5#wasThisHelpful","R1KM62VVJS669J","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I have not read the first book in Jane Smiley's ambitious 100-years-in-America trilogy, I didn't have much trouble following the events in this second book.  And I loved it!  Smiley's books have always been hit or miss with me - I loved Good Faith, hated Lidie Newton, loved Duplicate Keys, Moo was OK.  I think she's at her best here, chronicling and observing the everyday events of a large family in mid-century America.  This book's narrative runs from 1953 to 1986.  Each chapter is a year, and each year is depicted as a sort of snapshot of various family members and whatever they are doing at that time.  Judging from the first book's reviews, I would guess that this second installment will enthrall some readers and totally bore others.It should be noted that there is a large cast of characters.  The Langdon family is pretty big, but Smiley helps out by providing a family tree at the beginning of the book, which I referred to often for about 50 pages or so, until people started to fall into place.  Those who have read the first book, Some Luck, will find it easier to follow the narrative and it's probably a richer experience to know the people who came before, but I didn't have a problem getting to know and care about all the various characters.  Like Forest Gump or Zelig, her characters sometimes appear in the context of larger world events, such as the Vietnam war or the infamous People's Temple.  And some just go about their lives more anonymously, like many of us.  I liked watching some of the characters grow up throughout this book; Smiley does a masterful job of depicting a person's life through the years, often with just a quick scene here and there.  She has the gift of knowing what to include and what to leave out, often giving a complete look at a person's character with a very quick scene or two.People may complain that nothing much ""happens"" in these books - a complaint about many authors who write about everyday people going about their lives.  I find it fascinating that Smiley can take mundane events that we all take for granted - going to college, marriage and children being born and growing up, working - and make me want to keep turning the pages to see what happens next.  This book is about us.  I see my own family in it.  I hated to put this book down and I didn't want it to end, because I grew to love the Langdon family, even though some of them aren't very lovable, and I'm so glad there will be another book.  It's a beautiful book and a great achievement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R87UTRB8PNT67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307700321#wasThisHelpful","R87UTRB8PNT67","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I had to use only one word to describe this book it would be ""true"" -  my mother died in 2013 and my experience with her decline, move to a ""Place"", and eventual death - the feelings, the problems, the hassles, the pain - is almost exactly mirrored in Roz Chast's wonderful graphic novel/memoir about her own parents.  It's both laugh-out-loud hilarious (on almost every page) and very emotional, bringing me to tears more than once.  Chast vividly captures what it's like to deal with aging parents and deal with the never-ending issues that come with it.  Her honesty about her own feelings is admirable - I remember wishing I could be that ""perfect daughter"" who selflessly takes care of her parents while simultaneously wishing myself anywhere else in the world.  It would have been great to have had this book back when we were going through my mom's last two years because it would have really helped put things in perspective.  I loved it, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has aging parents.  It's the kind of book I want to buy multiple copies of and pass around to everyone I know.  I've enjoyed Chast's work in the New Yorker for many years, but this is a huge cut above, and very well worth your time.

"These binders are perfect for organizing my many knitting and beadwork patterns.  They look great and are durable.  The rings are heavy-duty and hold a lot.  I'd say they're a little stiff when opening, but they stay shut; some binders' rings don't and then you have papers everywhere.  There is a plastic sleeve on the spine so you can make a label and slide it in, or do as I do and make a label with a label-maker and stick it on.

"A little bit of Hitchcock, a dash of Gaslight, a little Ripley, some Gone Girl...that's The Girl on the Train, and please believe me when I say that in this case, being somewhat derivative is NOT a bad thing.  I loved this book and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good character study with some twists and turns into a darker place.  It's very well-written and the characters are sharply drawn.  I won't say these characters are exactly likeable - I don't think I would want to spend much time with Rachel, a jobless alcoholic who spends a lot of time gazing out train windows on her way in and out of London; she imagines lives for all the people she sees, two in particular, who turn out to be nothing like the ideal couple she fashioned in her mind.  They happen to live near her ex-husband Tom, who is now married to Anna, with whom he has a baby.  All of these characters end up interacting through Rachel and the result is a very compelling story that will keep you up late to finish it.The book makes an interesting commentary on the shifting qualities of memory and how it can be difficult to pin down what actually happened in a given situation.  It's also a cautionary tale about not seeing people for who they really are or discrepancies in their behavior, because you love them or you don't want to see the truth about a relationship.  There's a lot to think about after the novel is over.  I finished it last week and I'm still thinking about it.  It's very, very good.  Definitely recommended for fans of Gone Girl, and for anyone who likes a riveting story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NCT5WJY8HRUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633665#wasThisHelpful","R3NCT5WJY8HRUC","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before reading this current entry, I'd read only the first two novels in the Maisie Dobbs series.  I enjoyed them but I wasn't bowled over, and I feel similarly about this new entry.  I've been struggling to figure out why these books don't wow me - I'm also including Winspear's last book which was NOT a Dobbs novel - and I think it's partly that Winspear doesn't seem to be able to vary the mood in any of her books.  They're all kind of depressing or sad throughout and there's no apparent effort to add any joy or humor to balance things out.  I think Winspear is a good stylist, but compared to some other mystery authors, I think she falls a little short.  Her books are almost too low-key and well-mannered.  It's not that I'm looking for violence or bloodshed, but a little more emotion, warmth and occasional humor wouldn't be a bad thing.The action in this book takes place in Gibraltar in 1937 during the Spanish civil war, where Maisie has ended up after a tragic accident takes the life of her husband.  Winspear quickly catches up readers on events in Maisie's life and then gets on with her story.  Maisie doesn't intend to stay in Gibraltar for long, but after stumbling over the body of a local photographer, she decides to remain there to investigate, resurrecting her old detective skills.  It turns out that work is a good healer.  Maisie finds a new outlet for her nursing skills and helps out a field hospital in Spain before heading home.Gibraltar is an interesting location and Winspear creates a nice sense of place in her story.  I know very little about the Spanish civil war, so I took the author's word for the events depicted that had to do with it.  The characters are well-drawn and I liked Mr. Salazar the caf owner very much.  As I said above, I just wasn't blown away; the central story about the photographer isn't that compelling.  This is the kind of book I want to like more than I actually like.I would recommend this book to Maisie fans and for fans of well-mannered British mystery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5U8OUQH6CSJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062220551#wasThisHelpful","R5U8OUQH6CSJP","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a great interest in medical, legal and social issues in modern society, which this book explores in detail through the perspective of Brendan Reilly, M.D., one of a dying breed: the general practitioner.  Reilly discusses many of the problems of modern health care, such as lack of continuity of care (leading to many mistakes in treatment), too many doctors going into specialty practice due to the high cost of medical school, end-of-life issues and the question of how medical care should be managed in the elderly, affordability of health care, and many others, all through presenting real case histories.  Reilly's clear, flowing writing style make the book a pleasure to read; I found it more riveting than many novels.  His cases are fascinating, and his obvious compassion for his many patients is touching and seemingly rare in today's hurry-up medical environment.  Reilly is very open about his own mistakes in treating some memorable patients (I think he's too hard on himself, though) and, in hindsight, discusses how he might have better served them.I didn't find Reilly's views on modern medicine preachy, probably because I totally agree with him on most points.  Our current system does not work and does not serve us well, and we need doctors like Reilly to help us reform it.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in current medical practices and our failing health-care system, and I would especially recommend it to anyone considering medical school.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B5AYLPOCI6S2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476726353#wasThisHelpful","R2B5AYLPOCI6S2","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little heater is perfect for under the desk either at home or in an office cubicle.  It heats up quickly and gives off a nice warmth with a low-noise fan pushing the air out.  I didn't notice a lot of difference between the ""low"" (170 W) and ""high"" (250 W).  The fan does not blow any harder on the higher setting, the unit just pushes out slightly more heat.  It has a ""cool housing"" - the red part - but the front is pretty hot and would probably burn if you left a hand there too long.A nice feature is that it turns off the heat if you knock it over.  The red ""on"" light remains lit to let you know to turn it off.I would not use it around small curious children or animals because of the front grill being hot to the touch.Overall, I recommend it and plan to use it whenever we have some cold weather.

"Sisters of Heart and Snow is a good family saga and I found it an enjoyable read.  There's a lot of emotion and it's sometimes a little melodramatic.The book is composed of two narratives.  The main story, about Rachel and Drew Snow, daughters of a Japanese mother and Caucasian father,  takes place in modern-day California and traces their troubled upbringing by their emotionally distant parents.  In the present day, Rachel is a wife and mother in San Diego and Drew, a musical prodigy, is struggling to make a living and has no close ties to anyone.  Their mother, Haruki, has been diagnosed with dementia and Rachel and her father Killian are butting heads over her care.  The other story is from an old book about ancient Japan, featuring a real-life female samurai named Tomoe Gozen.Haruki was sort of a mail-order bride and for whatever reason, Killian has always treated her like a servant and she accepted it.  Both their daughters have had issues with their parents' behavior and Rachel was kicked out of the family as a teenager because of her unacceptable, if natural, rebelliousness.  She eventually married and had children.  Drew, on the other hand, became somewhat of a drifter, without real relationships or a career.It's hard to have much sympathy for the parents.  Killian reminds me a lot of one of my grandfathers, who likewise looked at all women as servants and wasn't a person anyone wanted to spend much time around.  As I was reading, I wished the author had spent more time exploring his background and less time with the ancient samurai story, which frankly wasn't very interesting and didn't really inform the modern story that much.  Haruki is a sad character.  I can understand her behavior a little better, since she was a stranger in a strange land and had no means of support other than her husband.The book really shines with the stories of Rachel and Drew.  I loved them and their efforts to overcome their emotionally stunted childhood.  They are the kind of people you root for.My only quibbles with the book were the samurai story not being that interesting, and I didn't like the way the author tended to use present and past tense in the same paragraph, and switched from first person to third person in the narrative.  I found it jarring and wasn't always sure if she was talking about the past or the present.  Overall, though, I enjoyed the book and I recommend it.  It reminded me somewhat of some of Lisa See's Chinese family saga novels and would most likely appeal to readers who like her books.  It would also make a good book club choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39VP5A623H2E8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399170804#wasThisHelpful","R39VP5A623H2E8","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a long-time Law & Order junkie, so The Job was right up my alley.  A collection of short pieces depicting life on the job from the perspective of a New York City police officer, The Job is by turns funny, touching, weird, and scary.  We all think we know what cops go through in the course of their days, but this book really makes you think hard about what it's really like to deal with death and crime on a regular basis.  I particularly enjoyed the stories ""Mug Shot"", ""Growing Pains"" and ""Big Day"".While the style is not literary and the stories are liberally sprinkled with profanities, The Job is a very entertaining mix of the personal and the professional.  Author Osborne started writing down his tales shortly after retiring and then got a spot on a storytelling show called The Moth.  All of the stories feel like you're sitting in the audience listening to him, or as one reviewer noted, like you're sitting next to him in a bar.  The down-to-earth style makes the book more appealing than it would be if it had been ""told to"" a professional writer, IMO.  The only downside to the writing is that it sometimes gets a little repetitive, but I can't really hold that against him.If you're interested in real police stories or considering police work as a profession, I think you'll enjoy this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V48QSO2ZHDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539622#wasThisHelpful","R3V48QSO2ZHDH","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to agree with reviewers who couldn't finish this book because of the author's extremely irritating writing style.  I couldn't either.  Both her writing style and slow, dull narrative really turned me off.  I had high hopes for this book's interesting premise - tracking down an eccentric underground filmmaker whose daughter has died - but it got so bogged down with unnecessary detail and annoying italics that I stopped reading about 100 pages in.This book bears some resemblance to the imaginative and flawed House of Leaves (a much better book IMO), in that it uses made-up emails, photos, illustrations, Facebook posts, and so on, to help tell the story.  I admire that creativity and I would be completely behind a WELL-WRITTEN book that uses those devices, but here: not so much.  This book got a lot of press when it came out, and that is beginning to be a red flag for me that I need to wait a while and read a lot of reader comments before committing to it.

"The Furies is a very good character study and psychological drama set in what Americans would call a ""continuation school"", or a school for kids who have issues with drugs, crime, bullying, or other problems that have caused them to be removed from the regular school system.  This school is in Edinburgh, Scotland and main character Alex, a teacher and theater director, is hired by her friend Robert to come and work with the students at ""the Unit"" after her fianc Luke is killed.  Although Alex is barely functioning, she rises to the occasion and tries to engage her charges by having them read Greek plays.  The teens are, as one would expect in their situation, difficult to communicate with, but Alex eventually forms a bond with them, and things seem to be going well until one of the girls, Mel, begins to stalk Alex and finds out more than she needs to know about her life and past.  Mel makes a terrible decision which results in a tragic outcome.I thought author Haynes did a great job with both the story's setting and with her characters.  You can feel the cold in the winding streets of the city. The teens - Carly, Mel, Jono, Ricky and Annika - are very well done and realistic.  Like a Greek tragedy, the story unfolds in a way that seems inevitable, even though you want to shout ""No!  Don't do it!"".  I also liked the character of one of the lawyers, Lisa Meyer, and Alex's friend Robert, the kind of friend everyone would love to have.As well as a character study, this book is also a very realistic portrait of grief and how everyone deals with grief in a different way.I would recommend this book to fans of Tana French or Kate Atkinson.  It's a page-turner that will stay with you for a while after you finish it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YA0MQKCH3GH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250048001#wasThisHelpful","R2YA0MQKCH3GH9","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to like this book more than I did.  A wedding story set in Provence sounds like such a nice idea, but the execution didn't work for me.  I haven't read any of Sussman's novels before, so I don't know if this is her usual style, but I guess I was expecting something a little more genteel or classy (more about this below).The novel's story concerns older bride Olivia and fianc Brody traveling to France to be married at Olivia's friend Emily's (and husband Sebastien) inn.  Olivia's grown daughters Carly and Nell join them.  Everyone seems to be at a crossroads - whether in a relationship that isn't working, one that is prematurely over, work issues, infidelity, you name it, it's here.  That's part of what didn't work for me.  It seemed like there was just too much angst and not enough of anything else to balance it.  There was no joy or levity or happy feelings that I would associate with a wedding, and the wedding itself is a tiny part of the book, which is mostly an exploration of every character's issues.  The story also seemed too focused on everyone's sex life, which for me became rather boring.  Given the location, I was hoping for a happier sort of story, but the author apparently wanted to make the novel more dark or edgy and it really put me off.  I'm not sure who she was trying to appeal to in writing this book the way she did.  As other reviewers have noted, the use of constant f-bombs seemed unnecessary.  It was almost like she took characters out of another story and stuck them in this one, with dissonant results.I would not call this a beach or vacation book; it's too dark for that.  (I'm wondering what book some of the other reviewers read - this isn't a happy light read.)  I would recommend it for those looking for a family drama.  It's a quick read and one that probably won't stay with you for long.

"I found this book to be a refreshing, unsentimental and honest look at the way Americans deal with death - which is to say, not very effectively.  Author Doughty spent time working in a crematory and later went through mortuary school, and her memoir is by turns darkly funny, fascinating, disgusting, and touching.  I have a lot of admiration for anyone who works in a crematory, does embalming, or deals with mourning relatives - it's very challenging work and I couldn't do it.In addition to her own story, Doughty skillfully weaves in a history of embalming, American funeral traditions, other cultures' funeral rites and beliefs about death, and how the mortuary industry works, and it's all quite interesting, if sometimes a little difficult to read.  If you're squeamish, it might be best to steer clear, as Doughty spares no description in her quest to open the reader's eyes to what really happens to our bodies after we die and how we can best understand and deal with death more honestly and directly than we currently do.I don't know if I should say I ""enjoyed"" this book the way I would enjoy a novel, but I certainly appreciated it, especially since I have gone through the deaths of family members and am getting on in years myself, and I feel it's important to explore and be able to talk about our own ends openly, rather than tiptoeing around the subject.I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the mortuary/funeral industry, medical students (doctors in this country don't deal with death very well), and anyone who, like me, wants to understand more about death and how to plan for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JILG2FXWSW9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393240231#wasThisHelpful","R2JILG2FXWSW9Z","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me say that I can understand some of the negative reviews of this book.  Much of it is not cheery or sweet and it's not what I would call a light summer read, which it sounds like some reviewers were expecting given the book's cover and blurb.  The characters, a large and varied Catholic family, aren't the most charming people in the world, and their matriarch, Alice, is downright unlikeable most of the time.  However, I loved the Kellehers' family saga, and I thought author Sullivan did a magnificent job of handling a large number of characters and a story line that did some back-and-forth in time.  I found the book very involving and really couldn't put it down.  (I felt the same way about Sullivan's The Engagements.)  I think she has a real gift for creating believable characters and conflicts and I admire her for not tying everything up neatly - real life never works that way and real families can be just this difficult and heartbreaking.  I also admire her clear-eyed view and refusal to become soapy or sentimental.  Women's fiction sometimes really irritates me, with its emphasis on happy endings and sentimental wallowing.Some readers may be put off by each chapter being from a different character's point of view - I got used to it and it didn't bother me.  In fact, I grew to like it, since some events end up being shown from varying viewpoints, and it's interesting to see how the different people see things each in their own way.Overall, I thought Maine was great and I highly recommend it as a very well-written family saga with the caveat that those who are looking for a light, breezy read might want to steer clear.  However, if you're game, this one will stay with you for a long time after you finish it.  I look forward to more from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRBYMT4SKQHU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004G60CCU#wasThisHelpful","RRBYMT4SKQHU0","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is interesting and involving, but I felt the title was a misnomer.  It's not so much about the actual ""death class"" as it is a biography of the instructor, Norma Bowe.  I'm not saying this is a bad thing - Ms. Bowe's extraordinary resilience in overcoming a horrific childhood and becoming a nurse and teacher is very compelling reading.  She is apparently an extremely giving person and much beloved by those who know her.  I admired her very much.  Where it sort of fell down for me was in the other stories of her various students and their ordeals.  It became a little like a soap opera and that is not what I was expecting from a book entitled ""The Death Class"".  I was hoping for insight into how people feel about death, cope with deaths of loved ones, prepare for it, etc.  So, because I felt somewhat misled, I can't give it the highest mark.  However, I do recommend it for Ms. Bowe's story; it's very inspirational.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A0DYVRUE4QSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSAZ4N4#wasThisHelpful","R1A0DYVRUE4QSB","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely LOVED this book.  The first chapter alone is so brilliantly, edge-of-your-seat dramatic and involving that you can't help being drawn in, and Turner's beautiful prose and great pacing make this long book seem too short.  I never wanted it to end.  If you love historical fiction and are interested in early America, you can't miss with this one.  Be aware there is some violence (I'd say it's hard to write a book involving pirates without some violence).  The story never flags and Resolute Talbot is an unforgettable heroine.  Highly recommended.  Can't wait to read more from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBIQ0T9LO7PML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FCRBBZE#wasThisHelpful","RBIQ0T9LO7PML","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed Liane Moriarty's Big Little Lies (could have had a better title, though).  Taking place in the suburb of Pirriwee in Australia, the story follows the lives of a group of ""kindy mums"" - mothers of kindergarteners - as they prepare for a school fundraiser.  Madeline (mom to Chloe and teenager Abigail from her first marriage), just turned 40 and on her second marriage, meets Jane (mom to Ziggy), a younger single mom, and they form an immediate bond - Madeline is sort of a rescuer type and she sees quickly that Jane needs a helping hand.  Madeline's wealthy friend Celeste (mom to Max and Josh) rounds out the group.  They're pitted against the ""Blond Bobs"" - the school's alpha moms, along with the many other types of parents that will be immediately recognizable to anyone who's had a child in kindergarten.Each of the three women is at a difficult point in her life.  Celeste's Facebook-perfect marriage is showing some cracks.  Madeline, although happy in her second marriage, is smarting over the fact that her ex-husband and his new hippie wife are living in the neighborhood and seemingly luring her teenage daughter into living with them by offering more freedom.  Jane suffers from a past sexual trauma and can't seem to get past it, but her bond with son Ziggy is strong and she has good family ties.I liked the depiction of the three women's friendship - especially as opposed to the gossipy, mean-girl behavior of many of the other parents at the school.  Friendships like theirs can be such a refuge and Montgomery did a great job of making the women and their relationships real.  The other parents were by turns hilarious and frightening.  The power of gossip and the menace of bullying (both in children and adults) is very much a theme in this book - the destructive behaviors kids learn early and many adults never seem to outgrow is shown here in all its ugliness.  As I said above, anyone who has had a child in a public school - whether in America, Australia, or another country - will be reminded of how hurtful it is when your child is the only one who doesn't receive a birthday party invitation (given out in front of everyone, to make it worse) or when your child is accused of doing something without any proof.  There is also a great divide between the haves and have-nots in the school, also a subject I'm sure many people can relate to.The funnier parts involved ""helicopter"" parents who seem to need to micromanage every aspect of their children's lives, and parents who give their kids oddball names (one character observes ""that kid is going to spend her whole life correcting people about her name""), in this case ""Amabelle"" instead of ""Annabelle"".  Although these parents may be somewhat stereotyped, they're very entertaining at times.This book is a real page-turner - I had a very hard time putting it down.  If I have a quibble, it would be that some aspects of the plot are a bit of a stretch, it's a little soapy sometimes, and the book in general has a bit of an agenda regarding domestic violence, but that isn't enough to take any stars away.  The characters are wonderful, I enjoyed the story from beginning to end, and I loved the ending.  I can't really say much more than that.  Highly recommended for book clubs and summer reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HTLBZVD5I6I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167064#wasThisHelpful","R3HTLBZVD5I6I5","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the blurb for this book makes it sound like it's going to be about Diane Berg, a Swiss psychiatrist who's just taken a job at a remotely-located criminal asylum in France, Diane is actually a minor character and something of a plot device in this bloated and fairly boring mystery-thriller from Bernard Minier.The actual main character is Martin Servaz, a police investigator who is called in when a body is found suspended from the edge of a frozen cliff a few miles from the asylum.  However, the ""body"" is a horse...yes, a horse, belonging to a local master of the universe, Eric Lombard.  The plot also involves an old case of a series of teenagers who committed suicide, a local man being killed, a dangerous serial killer in the asylum, a few red herrings, and a lot of needless description of the female characters' attributes and clothing.  Sadly, all this doesn't add up to a very entertaining book.  It takes quite a long time for anything much to happen (and the book is almost 500 pages long) and it's very slow-paced, which didn't work for me - a mystery-thriller should be fast-paced and keep me turning the pages.  I had to force myself to finish this one.  It didn't seem like the author was able to bring all the story lines together in a satisfying way.I agree with the reviewer who said the translation of this book from the French is partly at fault.  It seems like all the slang and idiom have been taken out of the dialogue.  I would also recommend a good editor - the book is easily 150 pages too long.I can't recommend this book even as a summer read - it's just not good enough.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GSL7M75D1OEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250045533#wasThisHelpful","R3GSL7M75D1OEF","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Debbie Macomber's work has always been predictable - in a good way, like McDonald's - but it seems to be getting more and more formulaic as time goes by.  This latest book is fairly soapy and weepy, which may appeal to some readers but it didn't do much for me.  I've also noticed that the various series (Blossom Street, Rose Harbor, Cedar Cove) are becoming hard to distinguish from one another: melodramatic situations, one character always inconveniently pregnant or running away from a difficult situation, a relationship on the rocks, but always a happy resolution.  If that is what you crave in a book, you will be happy with this one.Plotwise, we have innkeeper Jo Marie continually musing over her dead husband Paul; mysterious handyman Mark always around but never giving anything away about his life; guests Ellie (in town to meet, in person, a man she met online) and couple Roy and Maggie (the requisite couple on the rocks).  The subplot about Ellie and her cyber swain strains credulity even for women's fiction.  I give Macomber credit for bringing her somewhat time-warped fiction into modern times by internet and Facebook references, but I just didn't buy this story.  Ellie has an annoying helicopter mother who is always texting her regarding her worries about meeting someone she found online, which is understandable, but the character is such a control freak it's hard to feel sympathy for her.Roy and Maggie's story is more conventional: sexting/emotionally cheating husband, unhappy wife, possible divorce on the horizon, you do the math.  Lots of tears.Jo Marie's constant inquiries (as she plies him with cookies and muffins) about the private life of her handyman, Mark, get old fast.  I wanted to slap her upside the head and say ""leave the poor man alone!""  They have an odd relationship, which looks like it may be kicked up a notch in the inevitable sequel.The ""letters"" premise is somewhat thin and doesn't really enter into the story as much as one might expect from the blurb.  This is mostly a soap opera in book form.  It wouldn't be that important if the book weren't called ""love letters"".A couple of other quibbles regarding language use and format: the use of first person in Jo Marie's chapters and third person in the others bugged me.  And when people use phrases like ""couple dollars"" or ""couple dozen"", it bugs me, because it sounds lazy or uneducated to my ear.Do I recommend this book?  Only to die-hard Macomber fans, fans of this series (this is the third book), or for those wanting an easy beach or vacation read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38P44DG5EZTVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391135#wasThisHelpful","R38P44DG5EZTVC","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to view this recording of Balanchine's Nutcracker ballet because of a book I've owned for a long time called A Very Young Dancer, a photo essay documenting a young ballet student's participation in this production, back in the 70s.The production and filming of it are overall good - the DVD picture is fine and the photography is good - it's not easy to capture dance on film - some productions edit too much or don't focus on the whole dancer.  Some reviewers have noted that the production looks a little dated, but for me that's part of its charm.  It's true that the costumes and sets haven't changed much over the years, judging by photos I have seen, but I like that it has that continuity.I don't like the narration, but I think it's good to have it for first-time viewers and kids so they understand the story line.I wouldn't have cast Macauley Culkin, but I realize they probably did it because he was well-known at the time and I imagine the filmmakers were thinking that a ""name"" would bring in people who don't normally watch ballet.  I'd have preferred an anonymous young dancer, the way it would be in the actual stage production.As far as the performances, the child dancers sometimes look nervous or stiff - understandable because they're kids and if one were watching the performance on stage, their faces would be too far away to see the expressions.  I like the fact that Balanchine used children in his productions when it was appropriate, rather than short dancers impersonating children.  As for the adults - WOW!  The ""Coffee"" dance and the Sugar Plum Fairy/Cavalier pas de deux are worth the price of the DVD alone.  Both are absolutely breathtaking.  The ""tree angels"" were great - I loved how they looked like they were floating across the stage.  The rest of the cast are across-the-board very good too.If watching this with kids, bear in mind that the first part is mostly the party scene and there isn't much dance.  I got a little bored and I can see kids losing interest quickly.  It really picks up in the ""land of sweets"" second act.  While I was watching, I kept thinking that I prefer the first act of Baryshnikov's Nutcracker and the second act of this one.  It's probably better live - most things like this are - but as I said, I think it's worth watching for the performances of the adult dancers alone.I think this recording is valuable because we need to preserve performance - whether dance, music, or theater - as a cultural reference for the future.  I would highly recommend watching this if you are a ballet fan or if you have an aspiring dancer in the house.  It's also fun to watch the other well-known version starring Baryshnikov and Gelsey Kirkland and compare the two, as I was doing in my head while watching this one.  They're both quite worthwhile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYX37RFVX4TW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CW802A#wasThisHelpful","RYX37RFVX4TW0","A308QC9XPFHFGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A308QC9XPFHFGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The plot has me glued to my seat, I never guessed how it all panned out in the end.  1840s New York is a fascinating setting and the plot revolving around the inhuman treatment of the Blacks is honestly insightful, at times  heart wrenching.

Below was my review then:""This book is so good that I finished it in one sitting. There is not one wasted word and I was in for a thrilling ride once I started. The mystery is taut, intense and captivating, the entangled romance sensitive and touching. The hero, Kyle, with a weak heart, is immensely likable and well potrayed. It is a rarity that a character could stand up so well in short mystery novel but Kyle does. Kyle finally accepting the loss of his father and the revelation of a half brother he would never have a chance to acknowledge gives a touch of melancholy to the story.

This has to be my favorite from this writer and one which I will reread, which is very rare for me as I have such a lot to get through. Deeply emotional and touching, Jimmy and Shane characters are so beautifully written and have me rooting for them till the last page. So glad for the last chapter which gives such a satisfying ending to these two men who have gone through so much and finally found a home with each other. Especially Jimmy who got under my skin right from the beginning and have me all teary eyed in parts. The story is told from Jimmy's view but in no way is Shane's character sidelined which is what fine story telling is all about. I also enjoy the town itself with its solid cast of characters.

"When I read that this one will also focus on a hetero sexual couple I decided to skip this and went straight to the Mako Shark series. Nothing against bella and casey but I prefer my MM to solely stick to the gay couple. But I did so miss Vincent and Frank when they appeared in Mako Sharp 2 so have to pick up this second one in the Chance Assassin series. Very glad I did as the unique and fascinating plot and characters kept me entertained throughout. Not for the squeamish but if you want something completely different in this deluge of MM books like I do after reading so many stereotypes, there is nothing better than these 2 series (Chance Assassin and Mako Shark) about a group of sociopathic gay assassins with their romance and murders. it was wonderful to watch how the relationship between Vincent and Frank played out in this second book. I get to understand Frank more who somehow come across more humane. Vincent is of course his delicious bratty self and I just love him. I can't get enough of these two and wish that the writer has not interrupted their story with that of casey and bella.

Mako  could not be more different from Frank and Vincent but Mako is just as distinct and fascinating as a character. He is a damaged child who never got to grow up. The revelation of what happened to him when he was eight and thus moulded his young life was quite a punch to the guts. I love that the writer held nothing back in these stories of assassins both in plot, their victims but most of all in the study of these characters including the supporting ones, which in this case we have Nasai who is just as intriguing. In the romance angle I really enjoy how different Mako was from sweet Toby and I look forward to the just released book 2 because I so want my poor and damaged Mako to be happy.

"I enjoyed the first 45% of the book as it was entertaining, light with lots of fun as Davo navigated his attraction for Lee. But after the two guys got together it was just meh. Too much distractions which did not contribute to the romance or the  plot. The situation with baby Maxine was funny at first but it soon wore thin. So did that childish thing with that Mr Magic 8 Ball. All the talks about Australian soccer and cricket was boring as were the talks with troubled gays in the centre which Lee worked in - what was the purpose with introducing all those small characters? The romance side was under developed except for the sex. No angst. The only excitement was when Lee was handcuffed by a crazy female and even then I question the purpose of that scene and found it stupid and how the heck did Lee get himself into such a position. At the end I even question if there was any plot. The only thing going for it was the writing but even that had a limit as I got more and more bored and could not finish it fast enough.

"I love this idea of the pilot and his wing walker, theirs was a sweet, at times touching romance, the beginning a tad sad. But one can always be assured of a happy end with this writer. I like both MCs especially Charlie. Took a bit of time to warm up to Nick as the man was pretty nasty in the beginning. There were parts which really goes for the heart.

"The beginning of the story was promising as Titus ""talent/problem"" was revealed. I like where the plot was heading with the 5 ghosts united in death haunting Titus to get the justice due them. However Titus and Charlie as characters just felt a tad flat and sometimes it was as if the writer could not make up her mind as to their personalities. Especially Charlie. Charlie was a mid thirties closeted detective who had his share of death and crime. But his interaction with Titus was like a besotted teen. And Titus was Charlie's 1st man, really?! Then towards the last 1/3 or so, part of the story was bogged down by scientific info overload. And as for the killer identity it was so obvious to this reader and when his motives were revealed it was just the same old same old. I also have problem with the way the story was told, with Titus as 1st person alternating with Charlie as 3rd person. Titus' narration got me absorbed into the story but when the story switched to Charlie's 3rd person viewpoint, I was just less engaged as a reader. And of course the romance was the usual instant thing but that I could overlook as this was foremost a crime mystery. The writer hinted a sequel. As I like my ghosts, murders and mysteries I might follow the series but not a must.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RESQJH5SXDICU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010KZ3KC4#wasThisHelpful","RESQJH5SXDICU","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one book I am not about to forget anytime soon, if at all, and that is saying a lot since I say the same about my favorite books. It is however not a story I will reread because of the revelation of the murderer and the ending which I found so tragically sad and wished it wasn't so. But please do not let this point from deterring you from reading it. Very well done murder mystery with a heartwarming romance weaved in. The reverend has a wonderful and engaging voice and all the supporting characters are equally wonderfully depicted. If you have read this writer 's works you will know he is great at comedies even if I did not enjoy some of his humor.

"Too much sex, the writer just overdid it. The story was too darn long with too  much rambling to and fro. Too much on the relations side and not enough plot to keep this reader interested. And some self indulgence by the writer naturally. I love May December relationship but this one was just unconvincing. Forget about the BDSM aspect as it is laughable that the needs of an experienced sub like Laurie could really be fulfilled by a spring chicken like Toby. Theirs was really a romance with some kinks kicked in.  Believe me Toby was no Dom! The beginning was promising but the characters soon started to unravel with Laurie behaving nothing like a jaded and world weary doctor he was suppose to be.  Laurie came across like a young fool who just got dumped by his first love as the story progressed. Toby was fine until the last part. Guess the writer was trying to give us non stereotype Dom/Sub roles but this reader was far from convinced. And now to dig into my pile of MMs for a normal Dom/sub couple to satisfy my sudden craving for a true BDSM relation.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12OP3PLDXDTVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPNRL00#wasThisHelpful","R12OP3PLDXDTVG","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The writer could not have ended this series in a better way. Dave and Nicholas have come a long way as this 3rd book revisit them 7 years later. No 7-year-itch for this married couple. They remain totally devoted to each other and could not be more in love. Nicholas' brain aneurysm remains a shadow but they never allow it to overshadow their lives as they live every day to the fullest. The writer has done a marvelous job expressing their love. The feelings and emotions  when Nicholas health turned for the worse is just excellent writing. I also love Robin's character. This eighteen year old is adorable as he remains adamant in his own kind of love for his precious uncle Nicholas. Ah.. the innocence and purity of youth!Of course the writer has to focus on the couple's beloved waterhole, filled with mystique and magic. After all the waterhole, with its enchanted pool, wattle and blue butterflies, was where it all started for Dave and Nicholas. A sense of urgency permeats the plot when the discovery of iron threatens its survival. There is a touch of mysticism and enchantment in the story as the song lines worked its magic to deliver a fitting resolution to the fate of their beloved waterhole. But most importantly Dave and Nicholas have their love which is even more precious and irreplaceable. Love the writing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BXN9H4OIAH4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OWX7NLU#wasThisHelpful","R1BXN9H4OIAH4F","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoy this series even if I favor this one less than the last three. This one does evoke a lot of mixed feelings. The main problem is the murdered victim Ivan Holmes. It is easy to get engrossed with this character as the crime mystery centered around this controversial character. I started off feeling for this character. This turned to dislike when his perversions surfaced, then turned to sympathy again as Ivan's tragic pasts were revealed. David's investigation works were just as detailed and interesting but there were times when I questioned how easy it was for David to secure his interviews. Surely it is harder for private investigators to get strangers to talk to them! I like the plot as David dwelt into the mystery that was Ivan and in the process discovered much more than he could handle. However towards the end I have to say the twists and turns and the action got to be too much. And some questions were answered too briefly just to wrap up the story.As for the characters David remained his true likable self. However there were one or two instances when I disliked him because of the way he approached his case. A bit of empathy on his part would have been nice because the David I knew from the last three books was a better person than that. I also would have preferred to ""see"" more of Jamie. One way was of course for Jamie to be more involved in David's investigation like in the 3rd book. The romance was secondary as these guys were already in a committed relationship and this one is foremost a crime mystery but I still felt the love between these two. There was a little family drama on Jamie's side to keep their private lives interesting.Lastly one thing really bugs me. A heinous action, more like a crime, committed over twenty years ago with devastating consequences was never punished. This really frustrated me. Life is not fair but I at least want it to be fair in my fiction. Another enjoyable addition which kept me reading till the end so please do not end the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VZ40UULQ1H2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OM72AVO#wasThisHelpful","R1VZ40UULQ1H2","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This may be less than a two hours read but this little story is just beautifully done. Quiet, gentle, tender, kind and honest it left a lasting impact long after I finished it. It may be a short story but there is nothing short about the slow burning romance as these guys learn about each other to finally accept and love each other. I love Jesse's patience as he slowly draws Con out of his shell. I love Con's care for Jesse who will always come first. And I thought the impact of Con's PTSD on their relationship is so well portrayed. There is no miracle cure but to be accepted and lived with and as a result become stronger in their love for each other.

"How to put this. As a mild gay romance this one reads fine. The beginning of the story is interesting as we get to understand both guys and what they have been through.

"I do declare this second book is even better than the 1st one Death by Silver (Julian Lynes and Ned Mathey series Book 1) in this series. As in the 1st book, I enjoy the well crafted setting of Victorian London. I love that the writers have taken the guys' British reserved romance, restrained by the times,  to a more realistic level where they are forced to examine their feelings if what they have is to survive. Both guys are such charming characters, Julian the more rebellious one with less regard for the law and Ned the more restrained one but no less valiant. The mystery part of the plot with its magic and supernatural aspect is most intriguing as layers are revealed with each death, the last part have me riveted to my seat even if I know our heroes will make it! The new development with Ned's permanent engagement by the police certainly adds more depth to the guys' investigation.What really stands out in this book is how well the writers examined the gay community during that time. The dangers if discovered, who could protect them, not only from hostile outside forces but from their ""own kind"", the malice within the gay community itself where the vulnerable ones are abused, and yet the need to preserve the community and its clubs because it is so vital for their sanity. All these is seamlessly weaved into the story which at its core is a supernatural mystery permeated by a sense of urgency as the number of bodies piled up. This second book with its quality writing is such a pleasure to read and I hope there is much more to come, Please!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRILJGDF2ZJ9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OM34RZA#wasThisHelpful","RRILJGDF2ZJ9B","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one kept me thoroughly entertained, laughing aloud (and that is right weird with people around) for close to 2 hours. Jay and Simon are such a cute pair. You already have an idea from the cover. I enjoy the tongue in cheek humor and numerous parts are downright hilarious. My favorite is Jay (in his bird form) preening, shimmying, proudly performing his mating dance in front of a clueless and stunned Simon. This is so original and hysterically funny. Then there are the birds puns which are just crazily funny. A most unique avian shifter story. Some may complain about the instant attraction/love but it fits the story because it is a comedy. My only niggle is its length but no complaint about the price because it is worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FGQ2W4R4E33Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LAAGORM#wasThisHelpful","R1FGQ2W4R4E33Q","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoy this one. I was on holiday in New Zealand for two weeks and really love this beautiful and peaceful country. So the setting of the story in NZ with the wonderful descriptions is such a pleasure to read. I especially enjoy the camaraderie among the sheep shearers and the writer has certainly done her research, including the slangs. I like both the MCs and their slow burning romance. Sex only starts about 60%+ into the story which is just fine by me! Some maybe frustrated with the guys not having a heart-to-heart talk to sort out their problems but given the time they knew each other I thought it was realistic. Also there was a 15 years difference between Shane and Lachie. This is not a May-December romance but I could understand Shane's hesitation and the impression Lachie gave, before the earthquake forced him to man up, was really of a carefree bloke. Also these are real men with a blue collar job so sitting down and chat about their emotions is probably hard to do.What made this story special was the Christchurch earthquake and its impact, which I thought the writer has done a great job weaving it into her story. Those pages were such touching scenes. However I do have a few niggles. The brief epilogue is rather disappointing, as if it was just an after though. It sort of created a gap to the story line. It would not ""kill"" the writer to give us more details on what had transpired to lead to that point which was obviously years later. It is also a pity the writer did not give us more emotional connection between the guys once the major misunderstanding was cleared. The leapt straight to the brief epilogue after they understood each other was such a let down, as if something missing in the flow of the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T5L7331CQTLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O92Q3CO#wasThisHelpful","R2T5L7331CQTLN","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read this straight afterThe Picture of Cool (Trager Family Secrets Book 1)as I was interested in how it will pan out for Charlie and Joshua. I have to say The Picture of Cool ended very awkwardly even if it was meant to continue, something which a good writer should not do even if it was to tempt the reader to read the sequel. I do not think I miss much in skipping Book 2, nothing essential to Book 3, anyway.Back to book 3. The writing held my attention as the plot raced on at a good speed but never rushed. Charlie's work as a TV producer of a live talk show is interesting. His keeping his divas in line is a fun read. We also get glimpses of Joshua's round the world preparation to run for Congress . I was never bored but as a relationship and romance between two guys, much more could have been explored. I never got the connection between Charlie and Joshua. I am not talking about the lack of graphic sex because I am all for no graphic sex in my gay romance. There is just not enough focus on their romance or relationship development. I can count the number of times these two were physically together. There were more scenes on Charlie hanging out with his best friend! Is it because this is the writer's first full blown MM novel and she really does not know how to write a gay relationship adequately? Joshua's asking for space and time, Charlie wanting to be patient, illicit meetings, phone conversations over distance, misunderstandings then all is forgiven as the major problem hanging over Joshua's custody of his kids was miraculously and conveniently resolved. That about sum up their relationship. There was no heart-to-heart emotional exchanges between the two. I could not find the love between them and I still do not understand what Charlie saw in Joshua. Another major issue was that these guys' relationship was a result of an illicit affair. This is never an easy subject in a story and the writer has really not handle it well. Too conveniently and easily resolved. I recommend the writer to read the excellent In His Secret Life to get a lesson on weaving this taboo subject in a gay relationship/romance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HI0Z8DKAVBRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQ6MDWY#wasThisHelpful","R2HI0Z8DKAVBRB","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First this is not a YA story. It is a touching love story so well expressed, spanning years, from the time the guys were teens until in their twenties. I especially love Cooper. Cooper's love for rocks is such a fascinating aspect of the story. A sensitive child, Cooper's need for rocks to ground him and soothe his pain just moves me.  So many different types of rocks, with the writer giving details on their meanings and even some of their origins. How the meaning of each rock is woven into the story is a marvel, even magical. But it is not only a love story. It is also about families, a family born into and a family made not by choice but forced by circumstances but ultimately just as important.The beginning of the story really pulls me in. A twelve years old Cooper forced to face betrayal by the most important person in this young life, forced to choose sides, except that it was not even possible to choose. How he and his sister grew to accept and love their two ""new"" families is such an integral part of the story, at times heart breaking.How Cooper met Jace for the first time is an unforgettable scene because it was such a betrayal at the same time. These two boys were really tested through the years as their relationship grew from Cooper at first wishing only to hate this boy who broke his family, to grudging acceptance, to friendship, to brothers and finally to love. But a love with a shadow hanging over it, an unrequited love, slow burn, aching and so much yearnings. There were a lot of times when I wish to shake Jace because my Cooper was suffering so. But the story is told with Cooper's voice. I soon realize Jace was suffering too. And the years as these two boys yearned for each other only strengthen their love. The day when they came to an important crossroad, when the answer to ""that question"" is no longer needed or even mattered is such a beautiful moment in their love.I also have to say something on the secondary characters and their impact on Cooper's live. Cooper's two best friends support during Cooper's coming out was wonderful. Cooper's headstrong sister is such a credible character and their sibling love is so real. Last but not least are the parents. These ""adults"" are so well portrayed, their love for their sons, the pain they went through palpable and real.This is such a gem of a story, filled with emotions and love. Love the writing and highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29WS7RQ62Q87X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAHCZQC#wasThisHelpful","R29WS7RQ62Q87X","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one really taxed the highlight function in my kindle as I kept highlighting sentences, phases which I wish to reread and reread. Josh is really in top form here. His writing is amazing. A great mystery which kept me interested and guessing, witty dialogue, interesting secondary characters, cameo appearances of my number one favorite couple and most of all Kit and JX as they enter the most emotional phase of their relationship. I love Kit's character. I love his directness, self deprecating, irony, self absorption and anti social behavior. His inner monologue is just so crazily lovable, whacky, funny, self absorbed and involving. It is just amazing how Josh intersperses the serious aspects of the plot with witty, at times hilarious, and memorable smart lines.The mystery itself with a lot of thrilling moments (my favorite is that creepy motel) is top notch as I never could have guessed how it all enfolded. The stalker aspect is really good as it adds creepiness to the plot and somehow managed not to sidetrack the main plot. What I appreciate most is that the romance is as much the focus as the mystery, if not more. It is such the perfect balance. There are real issues in their relationship as they struggle to make it work. I love that Kit is finally willing to take that leap of faith. I love that JX is not as cool as he seems when the guy just hurts when the insecure side of Kit explodes in his face. This two is so great together and I love that most of the book have them together. Really it is like having the pleasure of observing a favorite couple living a real life except that their life is filled with love, excitement and suspense.Now I just have to say something about that cameo. No fiction couple can replace Adrien and Jake who remain affixed in my brain because I frequently reread these two. I am certainly in the majority of Josh's fans who want more of them. To see them from the outside which is through Kit's eyes is quite something. So this cameo really ""comforted"" me because I ""see"" that my favorite couple is living well together.  OK I sound crazy but hey! So thank you Josh. I love this cross overs of couples from other books by Josh and this is the second time. I hope he continues to do that because I savor a ""ah-ha"" moment.I realize I am gushing a bit but this one is so worth the wait. It is a definite winner to be reread and reread. And those Ms Butterwith's titles are hilarious!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CF3UL76DMYEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3GYA1S#wasThisHelpful","R3CF3UL76DMYEN","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love well written young adults books featuring gay protagonist and this one is just that and more because it is also a great fantasy. I was glued to the book until the last sentence because I just could not tear myself away. It is easy to make comparison to Harry Potter series but this is not Harry Porter. Fay, Sam and Tyler are older characters with their problems. The guys have sexuality and relationship to deal with while Sam never got over the death of her mother. I love the friendship between Fay and ""kick-ass"" Sam and the romance between the boys is sweet. It is not really a coming out story but I like that the writer treat bisexuality as if it is just a norm. The contrasting personalities between the boys and Sam provides a lot of fun in these three friends' bantering. But this is foremost a fantasy and the plot is really exciting with lots of suspense, action and magics. The battle scenes are captivating and vivid and handled so well. Winter is my favorite season and so Fay's magical abilities is just so cool! Even if this is Book 1, I did not see the final pages coming and therefore the ending really resonates. If this is the writer's debut it is very impressive and bravo indeed. My only problem is when is the next book. As Book 1 ends with ""..Behind me, the stones on the beach were covered in a thin layer of frost.."", I can't wait to read more of Fay's fate and such a lot of questions to be answered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D21TXTJ1GHVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMQYKFG#wasThisHelpful","R3D21TXTJ1GHVN","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story is filled with so much honest and genuine  emotions and feelings. What Travis had with his dead wife, the developing love between Travis and Wesley, the love between man and his dog, the strong bond among Travis's three children, the love between Travis and his kids, all are convincingly and movingly expressed. Travis, Wesley, the children, Wendy and even Shannon are such well developed and likable characters. Shannon may be dead but it seems she is still alive as she lived through Travis' love for her.The story is told from the two guys' viewpoints, interrupted by a viewpoint each from six important secondary characters and it works because we get to know and appreciate these secondary characters more. I especially love the children's views which give such a refreshing tone to the story. The writer really gets how a child feels. Quiet little Mason is just adorable, Caleb is such a great young man and little Avery acting out her favorite disney characters at the expense of her twin yet protective of her twin is sweet.This  is no girly fluffy romance between Travis and Wesley. Theirs is a credible and touching journey as one man could never cease loving his dead wife and the other has to take a leap of faith and believe he will not come second for the man and the family he has grown to love. There are no pages of filler sex, but real, moving and true emotions. I also like the small town setting and I though the writer has done a great job on the reaction of this small town to one of their own men falling for the gay vet, new in town. Over 360 pages, this book is so worth it and it has definitely earned a place in the best contemporary romances in the mm genre. Actually I will say gay romance fiction which gives this book more credibility. Highly recommended. And now to look up other books by this writer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT2RHSAOG6LOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUFACHS#wasThisHelpful","RT2RHSAOG6LOF","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a fan of Claimings, Tails, and Other Alien Artifacts you must read this continuation. This second book is even better. The writer really excels in her world building skills and her two characters. Ondry and Liam are just fascinating. I love this couple. Theirs is not the normal romance. So if you are looking for the boring pages of typical MM sex then look elsewhere. But then you are probably not a sci-fi fan because this is one of the best sci-fi fictions I have read in a while. This is not to say there is no romance. If anything the bond, love and trust between Ondry and Liam are so well expressed in their actions and between the lines, so subtle but absolutely convincing and touching. This has to be the best interpretation of a human and alien interspecies relationship and their dom/sub dynamics only make it more interesting and memorable. Ondry has to be the best Dom I have read. He is totally in control and never waver in his protection, love (as a Rownt knows it) and nurturing of his ""palteia."" There is no emotional breakdown or sudden role reversal like a human Dom, which MM BDSM romances loves to explore and often ends up annoyingly pathetic. But then Ondry is not a human, lol.What I love about this sequel is the story is told from both Ondry's and Liam's view points. It is just fascinating how Ondry perceive the humans. Time and again I have to pause and marvel at the writer's analysis of human's emotions, weirdness, societal values, culture and so call norms, agreeing with Ondry's view of how unwarranted and pointless human's certain behaviors are. Liam's viewpoints is just as absorbing as he finds himself losing his human traits and instead thinking, feeling and responding like a Rownt. Not that this is a loss as Liam prosper as a human being as a result.The plot itself is intelligent, intricate, multi-layered, deep and at times invoke some ""aha"" response from this reader. There is no dull page even if there is only one action scene. It is the writer's use of words, her amazing imagination, the exchanges between alien and human, among aliens and among humans which is just captivating, totally capturing this reader's attention. The writer has really created a truly credible and likable, even enviable, alien race. So much so that I found myself siding with the Rownt and wishing ills on the humans, (my own kind!) when a confrontation seems inevitable.This is such a fitting continuation of the series and I hope fervently it is a series. It ends satisfactorily but left me with a hunger for much more of this universe Lyn Gala has created. The writer has really excel with this one. This should be read by all sci-fi fans and to sum it up, brilliant is the word.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5TGCUVQMQZ9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUGAIT4#wasThisHelpful","R5TGCUVQMQZ9Z","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do like this one and practically read it straight through. Michael is a lovely character with his big giving heart and kindness. James is likable too and I really feel for this guy. The writer shows her brilliance as a writer when she relates James' sad childhood and his suicidal state at one point, which have me in tears. I enjoy their developing romance but I feel there is not enough focus on it. I want more time for them to be together and less time given to Michael's interaction with his patients, in particular one patient named Lem. Another little niggle is that even if it says 237 pages, I am sure there are less word count for a novel. Maybe it is because this writer started off giving us shorts and novellas and has yet to get the feel for a true novel. That said I do enjoy every bit of this story (minus that long interaction with Lem) and I love those little excerpts on James' Sentimental Cyanide. I would love it if the writer is to give us a story out of it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ4H0QDO0ID7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEU49FW#wasThisHelpful","RJ4H0QDO0ID7P","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one is so different from the usual cheesy MM romances out there. This writer can write! Ben and Nikolas are no vanilla characters. Call them special forces, secret agents, black-ops, soldiers for hire, even a little of James Bond, there is no doubt the complexity of these two guys including their very dark pasts. Equally complex is their very convoluted relationship which as a reader I never know what to expect. As the plot progresses there are a lot of twists and turns on the true identities of these two especially the so enigmatic Nikolas. I was just totally caught up in these two complex characters and the growing depth of their bond. Most of all I love that there is no girly fluff in their romance. Then there is the thrilling plot with its drawn out tension, filled with suspense which have me sometimes breathless because I was waiting for something bad to happen to either of them. The story does end somewhat in a cliff hanger when Nikolas twisted past caught up with them. But fortunately their relationship is not in a limbo because there is no doubt the desperate need one has for the other. Oh I have to mention their dog who is quite a character himself, lol. And of course the sex which I thought was well done, graphic but never chessy or gratuitous. And I did not skip any scene, which for me is a rare thing so many MM romances later. I am so glad the 2nd and 3rd book are already out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSTN8JH00WRUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDQZI3U#wasThisHelpful","RSTN8JH00WRUV","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well written coming out YA story with a little mystery featuring two seventeen years old. The contrasting personalities, one openly gay and the other fearfully in the closet but came out eventually because of their love has all been told countless times. But I am never tired of it if well told as it is the case here. Also there are the extras in this one which I really like.  The close and heartwarming relationships which Tristant has with his mother and grandmother is just wonderful to read. Their reaction to Tristant first date with his first boy friend is so lovely and refreshing in that it is what you will read if a daughter is to go out with her boyfriend. Then there is that little mystery on Tristant's great grand uncle. Narrated in the great grand uncle's journal, this is a story within a story, the only difference is that it is just so sad. I admit I got all teary eyed when all the truths are revealed. Back to the boys story, it is easy to immerse in it because the writing is so  fluid, without unwanted angst and therefore credible. The ending is quite nicely done as our two boys held hands and start an important phase in their journey. My only niggle is that the story is a tad short for a novel. Will be watching out for this writer as I really enjoy her style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10HJOEI72HRW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTFG1NK#wasThisHelpful","R10HJOEI72HRW7","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love the dystopian plot, the revelations towards the last 30% stunning. I like the Children characters a lot but somehow felt cheated because of the writing which seemed to lack just that extra. Piri  and Niko could have been so much more if the writing has dug deeper into their characters. That said I could not stop reading because I need to know what happen next. Piri's fate and that of the Children's held me captive.At the heart are three absolutely contrasting societies so alien from each other but connected in such a dark and twisted way, the themes gripping if one is to dwell deeper into the meanings.There are such a lot to love about this story. Piri's emotional growth and discovery of what it mean to be a real human being as he lived with the Children. How he helped them with his inventions even if he is physically weaker. The fact that same sex love is the norm in this dystopian society. A society living in such extreme difficulty conditions but never losing the capacity to enjoy simple things whenever they are able. How this society ultimately triumphs against all odds is a riveting part of the story.But at last the writing which I felt let down such a brilliant plot. it would have been a great novel if supported by stronger writing, even if English is not my mother's tongue. On the other hand maybe it is meant to cater to younger readers even if the themes do not. It really does come across as a simplified version meant for easier reading. However there is no doubt I love the story till the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M1VOGV91K5S4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOX4V2W#wasThisHelpful","R2M1VOGV91K5S4","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This medieval period piece is a gem of a little story. It says 49 pages but it reads much longer because it has so much story in it and the two MCs are so well developed and likable. I love Bertie, the cross dressing effeminate brother of a king, who rose to the occasion when wars demanded it. Bertie's openness is delightful and his public  declaration of his love for the great General Godric is funny yet touching. Godric is quite a character. Stoic like a rock it is wonderful when he finally gave in to his heart desire. This is a fantastic short.

"Ok after this one I think I have enough of this writer. The MCs interaction is too typical Mary Calmes and after a while I was just bored with them. Their sexual roles was kind of silly which I ended up skipping. As for the action parts there were so many names involved. Miro getting hurt as he hurled himself into action was just inconsistent with this character we were told in the beginning (a little bit of Jory here, huh). And of course Miro with his 4 female best friends is rather formulaic Calmes. The only two parts I like were glimpses of Sam Kage and  when one of Miro's 4 female best friends insisted on keeping one loveable wolf like dog named Chickie.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX32NOGARJRT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LILB7F2#wasThisHelpful","RX32NOGARJRT5","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

All I have to add is that  TJ Klune is one extraordinary writer, his style unique. There is no other writer who writes like him. It is just crazily astounding and engrossing, his characters completely captivating and so alive that their dialogues, musings resonate long after I finish the book.

"This steam punk fantasy adventure is so well written. The world this writer has created is just remarkable and amazing, the description so vivid and interesting that it is so easy to visualize it in my head. Practically another world floating on top of another one! Class distinction like the Victorian time. The working of magic told from a very refreshing angle. Then there are the boys made to slave away beneath really rotten and cruel scoundrels, so reminiscent of the classic Oliver Twist. There are times when my heart is in my throat because I do not want anything bad to happen to any of these poor boys. And right in the center is Neil, a very likable hero. I love Neil's character. He may have lost nearly everything, stripped off a wealthy environment he knew so well, forced to adapt to a life without any luxury but not once did he mop in self pity. He quickly accepted his misfortunes and tried to be the best teacher to his boys. I love his compassion towards his young charges and his love for his half sister. I also like the gruff Leofa and their slow burning romance is so fitting to the story itself. As for the plot, it is seamless, the thrilling parts have me at the edge of my seat. The little twist at the end, on Leofa's identify is a nice one. Gay love is frowned upon in this Victorian-like society and I like how the writer make it work for these guys. While I am most satisfied with the ending I would love to visit this fantasy world again. Great stuff. If this is a debut, this writer has blown me away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5KJ0W9QDK2O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KF0LDAG#wasThisHelpful","R5KJ0W9QDK2O7","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Four distinct stories here with alternating chapters. They are pretty good but like all short stories one is left wanting towards the end. The weakest story is the one involving two co-workers which I guess is meant to be a comedy. The romance between a kindergarten teacher and one of the kids' high school brother is the longest and has a wistful tone to it. My favorite is the one of the same title where two friends met 10 years later and rekindled their relationship. The one about brotherly love (not the romantic type) is quite good too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MEDMJ2YBW7Q8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0Z1A0Y#wasThisHelpful","R1MEDMJ2YBW7Q8","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A day after, I am still thinking about the story, the two guys and their ending. There is such a lot of depth and emotions in the story. The plot flows seamlessly and of course the lovely artwork. Both Togame and Yorozu are such well defined and complex characters. I love their slowly developing relationship and when they finally came together in Volume 2 it is just so convincing and beautiful.

"Of course I have been looking forward to this one and finished it on the same day it was downloaded. Totally satisfied and happy as I come to the end because it has been such a reading pleasure after a lot of sub standard books in this MM genre. Yet wistful too as it would be another long wait for the next Lanyon's book and the almost listless running through my huge pile of what to read next. But back to Josh's latest. Reviews before me have voiced out pretty much how I feel about this book. The cover and the title from a 1961 released melancholic and nostalgic music piece could not be more fitting for the story. I love the wonderful atmosphere, the at times melancholic tone, the at times dreamy setting, the detailed descriptions that make it so easy to ""live"" in the story as I follow Griff's journey. I love Griff and Pierce, their bantering,  Griff's reaction to the man that is Pierce, their enemies to lovers romance so well done. I enjoy the pacing of the mystery, the twists and turns as the plot unfolds, the family drama of the almost other worldly rich seamlessly weaved into the story and the final revelation took me by surprise and a bit angry too as justice could not be really served. As with a great story I just wish there is more but really Josh does not need to pen another word. Yet I am greedy for a short on this couple with their families. Definitely a reread for me and as I always say, kudos to you Josh Lanyon and thank you. And finally I have to say I have been playing that soulful clarinet music piece for the past few days..","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R65HVCLMUGI8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I15VL86#wasThisHelpful","R65HVCLMUGI8S","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this young adult fantasy starting in a contemporary setting but ending in the ancient fantasy world of Greek mythology itself is very well written. The plot is action packed, filled with danger and romance, fun, entertaining yet highly relevant with surprising depth. As the narrator of the story, young Jamie's voice is very engaging. He comes across a very credible and likable young hero. Small for his age but handling himself as best as he could, with his doubts as he deals with his personal relationships and showing unexpected courage as he is forced to fulfill a prophecy. Like other reviewers have mentioned I really like that parents and adults play solid and relevant roles in the plot. All the secondary characters are well fleshed out and drive the story as much as Jamie even if this is Jamie's narration. The romance is the usual bully turned lover but this is the type of love story which works. Billy complements Jamie nicely and I enjoy the development of their relationship from ""enemies"" to friends and to lovers. Females play important supporting roles in this story whether they are mothers, enemy, best friend or even a goddess lending a guiding hand and I like that. And finally what stands out in this story making it memorable for me is the unexpected, touching, amazing yet bittersweet ending. I have to say I shed some tears even if it is not really sad tears. I do not think I will forget this story because of the ending. Such a great read and highly recommended. Definitely will watch out for more from this writer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MD0G93U40BZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1U47UO#wasThisHelpful","R2MD0G93U40BZA","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoy this historical suspense novel. The plot is intriguing and suspenseful as our hero searched for his long lost brother after receiving a 1918 dated letter in 1933. The setting of the story is most unusual and such vivid descriptions. Imagine an abandoned hill resort with its cabins linked together by underground tunnels fed by a sulphur spring. Tunnels or canals which men can get lost in or used for their own innocent or nefarious ends. The plot is tightly paced with many thrilling scenes as layers of mysteries are peeled away and I thought the flashbacks are well done and interesting as so much of Aiden's tragic family background is revealed. The focus is on the mystery shrouding the ruins and Aiden's missing brother who is somehow ensnarled in it. There is really not much time given to the romance between Aiden and Sebastian which is rather instant. But the lack of romantic development is more than made up by the very original and suspenseful plot. And I really like the feeling of the Great Depression after WWI and the years before WWII in the story. The writer did make up for the lack of romance in the last few chapters after the climax which had me at the edge of my seat. Speaking of the climax I still feel sad by what happened to two of the secondary characters. I wish the writer could have been kinder. On the other hand it is not something I would forget any time soon. As for Aiden and Sebastian they certainly deserve their lives together. Great read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WPOUHK2OX6EU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBNOIPU#wasThisHelpful","R1WPOUHK2OX6EU","A1ARJBC8VD5P8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ARJBC8VD5P8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes there is just too much sweetness in the mm romance genre and I am glad a friend brought this one up in the mm romance thread. In the perfect romantic world  of mm romance Ryan and Joseph are improper characters, yet I find myself completely engrossed with their improper behaviour, no small reason due to the absorbing writing. There is just something darkly fascinating with the way Joseph seduced and ensnarled Ryan. Theirs is more like obsession than love even when the writer decided to inject the love word towards the end, which I find rather unfitting and disappointing that the writer feels the necessity to revert to the usual formula. Another little niggle is the revelation of Joseph's past which I thought is unnecessary drama and again the typical formula. But the writing, the flow of the plot just kept me reading from start to finish because I just need to find out what happen next. There is no dull moment in the plot. This is definitely not the last of these characters. However I am fine with the story ending the way it did. Recommended for those of us fed up with the usual corny sweetness and want a break in our favourite genre.

"Scotts has always worked well as our choice of grass seed and care. We have used their turf builder grass seed many times. This blend is their heat tolerant blue mix and is my least favorite.It come sin 3, 7 or 20 lb bags. Its 99.99% weed free, we had no issues growing weeds with it. It has the water smart plus coating so it absorbs water and protects the seedlings. Like with anything you plant or try to grow, proper care is Always needed. I can't stress that enough. Just because a product has some form of ""aid"" to help you doesn't mean you do any less for its care- especially while its a seedling and early stages.We used ours to patch an area in full sun light here in CT. It is ticker and at first I thought it wasn't going to blend well but it did.  This blend recovers well from any heat or drought and it spreads to repair wear and tear. We only just had the pleasure of trying this and going into the colder season now but I can say it did grow fast and fill our gaps nicely. I look forward to spring to see how it comes back in and how well it does over the summer here. We also have more patchwork in the spring- I will make an update over the summer of 2016 based on how well this product does then during the real test periods.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A82037FGOEAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZSINMY#wasThisHelpful","R2A82037FGOEAX","A226GFM0Q9L37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226GFM0Q9L37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are all natural breath drops for cats and dogs. You basically give them 3 drops a day to help keep that fresh brush - no brushing required. You just add it to their water 3 drops per 16 ounces and that it- the product does the rest. It takes about a week (for our trial 5 days) and we notice better breath. However this should not be a replacement for not brushing. Just like our teeth can have problems if we don't brush dog's teeth are the same. Some pets do have bad breath from past history, adoptions, sickness, etc. One of our rescues has bad teeth, many removed = bad breath too. She was eager to try this for us, no issues with tasting it in the water and you could smell the difference but it did not last the 12 hours either. We estimated it around 8 hours before smelling that bad breathe again. So it works, but not as long as it claimed to for our dog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R717HPKW65DLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHU4644#wasThisHelpful","R717HPKW65DLN","A226GFM0Q9L37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226GFM0Q9L37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seeds of beauty is a dietary supplement to promote younger looking skin. It aids in preventing those deep wrinkles. One box has 21 pineapple flavor drink mix packets. They are convenient as you can take them with you and add to a water bottle anywhere. They contain pep tan collagen which is something clinically proven to show enhance skin hydration.You need to first like the taste of these which I dislike personally. Yes, its a good supplement, your hair, nails and skin will all thank you. But I think pill form is better specially from the artificial taste. It also has high fructose corn syrup.  They are gluten free, but the corn syrup and taste kill it for me. I'd rather something with out that additive and something that tastes good if I have to drink it. Or - have the vitamin in a pill form instead.

"This is a 12 mg, 30 count bottle of Jarrow Formulas ""Astaxanthin"" It promotes a healthy inflammatory response - supporting skin during sun exposure and joint and eye health. I have tried a few of Jarrow Formulas and I either loved them or hated them (they worked great or didn't work at all for us)This was one of the formula's I love. This supports your whole body. It reduced my muscle and joint pain. I had more energy and less fatigue too. I will keep on purchasing this. I've tried other stuff in the past including medication and hated the side affects. If this keeps on working, with no side affects I will be very happy.Abit more on Astaxanthin - It is a natural antioxidant carotenoid derived from the fermentation of the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis. Clinical studies have demonstrated that Astaxanthin may promote a healthy inflammatory response, supports skin during exposure to a normal amount of sunlight and supports joint and eye health. It has no wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, and no peanuts/tree nuts. It should be stored in a cool, dry place but do not refrigerate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FN4KBMUQDCM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JV8F8S#wasThisHelpful","R1FN4KBMUQDCM4","A226GFM0Q9L37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226GFM0Q9L37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being I have a high stress life I thought these may be a good trial to see if they have any affect. They are non gmo and support brain and memory support. They are meant to support a healthy stress response by moderating the release of cortisol, a catabolic stress hormone.They do contain Soy. The capsule consists of gelatin as well. You take 1 capsule 3x a day with meals. 1 bottle has 90 capsules. So you get enough for 1 month for $30- bit pricey. However I think they are worth the try for a month to see if they help you or help your treatment program. If you have adrenal fatigue from prolonged stress or even from a long illness these may help. I have 3 kids, one being special needs and requires alot of 1:1. So my days are beyond stressful. I feel like these helped reduce it but not sure it had positive effects on focus, etc..

"My son tried these for his gas pains and the way his gut works (or doesn't work) after eating. As it is he is mostly dairy free and wheat free. These are suitable for vegetarians/vegans and they have no wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, and no peanuts/tree nuts. So it is a plus finding a vegan supplement. Sometimes with nuts, tofu and others he has issues digesting. He eats a higher protein diet and he said he had some relief mostly when he ate stuff in the bean family. Overall I wasn't completely satisfied as it was a hit / miss over the pass month. Whether they were trying to help or it was a fluke and he just had less that day it's hard to really say. We are going to concentrate more on his diet over supplements for now since we haven't had much luck with them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SQXW6P1VOHJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OA57LI#wasThisHelpful","R2SQXW6P1VOHJT","A226GFM0Q9L37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226GFM0Q9L37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well I tried these out the past 30 days in hopes to support appetite and weight management with my son. He complained about the size and texture of them but got them down. In 30 day's absolutely no change. You take them half hour - 2 hours before a mean which we did but they again had no affect. We tried another in the past that worked alittle but only suppressed it so much so I was hoping to find another that worked better but our search is still on.

"I have tried this gentle facial cleansing powder a few months ago after seeing it in one of our stores. It's a water activated powder. So it activates when you mix with water and wash your face. It has camellia and ginkgo biloba in it to unclog pores and soften your skin. It exfoliates well but I dislike the powder form. When you open it - it smells good but your sometimes hit with powder that comes out of the top hole. That easily goes into your nose and sometimes eyes and I end up sneezing a bunch. You have to be really careful, and half the times I grab it and open it like a normal bottle and powder goes all over.Besides that, it also made my skin to dry if I used it too often. It would get dry and flaky if I used it every day. I ended up not using it and then didn't want to be bothered by having powder all over. So for me its just OK.

"If you have a few of those stack-able patio chaise lounges on your patio or deck and are seeking a cover you have just found the right one. If your stacking 2 high, you can choose the 2 high option, or if more you can choose the 6 high stack option for up to 6 lounge's. It will fit the stacks 75"" long and 27"" wide so you can measure before in case your's are oversize. They fit my stack of 5 great.The cover has a waterproof backing and elastic hem cords. It has reinforced padded handles making removal very easy. It's all double stitched- very durable. We have a fire pit cover too and a few other covers we got a few month's back for our patio furniture and all have been awesome. I love the black color - always my favorite, looks elegant and hides any dirt. This also has the vents to prevent any wind lofting and keep mildew away.

"These are super soft underwear that fit. They stretch to fit 2 sizes - current and one up so if you gain etc, the idea is they will still stretch to fit, yet when you loose they will still be perfect. Perhaps thats why they are big however they feel big. They do move with you but pending what you wear on top of them they are not comfy with so much extra material.They are mid rise briefs but on me come up super high, past my belly button ! They are the size I take so they are accurate in size / my body size however they did not fit well at all. The colors are nice and they washed well (didnt shrink) - in a way I wanted them to so they could fit better !

"If you have the space for this beautiful art table you and your kids or daycare will love it. It measures 58.6 x 30.4 x 4.9 inches and weighs about 60lbs. Alex Toys super art table comes complete with an 18x100 foot paper roll. It also has a child safe paper cutter so kids of age can easily cut their own paper when they finish their projects. My daughter is 5 and has no trouble doing this.  She draws, colors, paints, - anything can go on this paper its heavy duty white bond paper.The table itself has 3 removable storage cups. It also has a storage canvas bin. Their is plenty of room for crayons paper, supplies and more. Instead of chairs, this art table comes with not one but two benches! Everything is solid wood and assembles very easily. I did it myself and had no issues. It even came with the assembly tool. The surface of the table is actually a chalkboard, so your kids can just drawn away on it and then you can wipe it away easily. It's great if your preparing paints and they are waiting (using chalk to draw) as my daughter does.We have a 14 month old too and once she hits 2 1/2 - 3 she will be of age to sit at the bench nicely and use it. For now, we sit with her or bring over her chair.I love the style of the table, its already so colorful so even if you get paint or markers on it- it won't look any different. Most stuff washes off anyhow easily.. but it won't stain it like some tables stain (wooden ones with no color)The paper roll is underneath and easy to change when the time comes. I also like that the paper reaches both sides so you can have a kid or few on each side drawing or such on the same piece of paper - great for sharing and making things together on one sheet. If you need to separate you can use construction paper etc and every kid will have their own sheet. It works out really nicely. A refil roll of paper is about 9$ so not bad at all for all the fun that comes with this art table.If you don't need both benches you can push one under the table - we have part of the table up against the wall, so we are only using one bench until our youngest gets bigger. Great art table. Looks great in the room too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NLGTBICKP5KX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006GUY0Y#wasThisHelpful","R3NLGTBICKP5KX","A226GFM0Q9L37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226GFM0Q9L37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just received my Zoe stroller and I am hoping it holds up to my expectations. I am in need of a very lightweight, portable, easily collapsible stroller. So far my expectations have been met. I can't wait to test this out on an upcoming trip- at that point I will update my review further.For now its a 10lb stroller! Very light. It collapses with 1 hand, EASILY. I can't stress that enough, and it close's so it won't keep opening up on you. To open, just unlatch and pop open, it clicks into place and ready for use. I love the adult cup holder and options it comes with for the child. You can have a cup holder, a snack holder or both.. or a bar- ALL are included. The basket underneath is a very good size for such a small stroller. The footrest is smaller then others but it does it's job just as well as the others.Canary is a decent size, in a way I wish it had another flip out but it may just be perfect - I'll know on our trip as were going to be in a sunny location (Florida).The seat straps are nice, they adjust and its a 5 point harness. The wheels lock or swivel pending your terrain. Breaks are easy to do and lock this baby in place. I also noticed its nicely grounded / made. Most lightweight strollers you tap on the back and they start to tilt. Not this one. You really have to ""push"" to get it to slightly wanna tilt. It's a big difference. I can't wait to use this in just a few more weeks, for now we will uses it out and about and I will again update in a few weeks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS4K4BNVINBAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0134NC8AO#wasThisHelpful","RS4K4BNVINBAA","A226GFM0Q9L37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226GFM0Q9L37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a family accountant who is quite familiar with Sage 50 as well as QuickBooks and others. This is the newest version 2016.Sage 50 Premium Accounting 2016 is perfect if your an accountant or even if you have your own business but its not a beginner program. It's more for the experienced or one willing to learn it inside and out. It's fairly easy to use software but just takes time to learn all the in's and out's of it as it does contain many powerful tools.This is a very expensive program as the rate you pay right now is for 1 (yes one) year. After that you have to repay. You do get 3-users on the one we have, and can opt to get just a 1 user or a 5 user per disk or even opt for digital users- so you have a lot of options their. You also get 1 year of support and any upgrades included.The program is vast, you can manage costs, employees, even security and of course accounting, inventory management and even reporting for strategic growth. Their are many budget and analysis tools. You can even compare multiple budges or create custom reports. It really will keep your business on tract.Sage Premium contains more features then their cheaper Pro version. Premium version includes audit trail, change order processing, departmentalized financial statements, inventory and services management center and job costing - phase and cost level features to name a few. If you don't need any of that their Pro version may work better or you.You can export alot right to Excel too, its  a breeze. For some quick books may work good,. but if you can use all the features, Safe 50 may be your best option. It's very well suited for those working and training in accounting. If your in a small firm or such I would say Safe 50 is perfect for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F7O3JWXKQ0DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011I737WG#wasThisHelpful","R3F7O3JWXKQ0DN","A226GFM0Q9L37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226GFM0Q9L37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an adorable little game that you play right from the box! I like games like that as they are compact and the board or parts stay where they belong and don't venture to far away... which can lead to them getting lost. This game is great for motor skills, dexterity and color matching. It's perfect for kids around age 4. Their are small parts, but not super small but still can be a chocking hazard due to their size.Basically you move the apples around the tree, or try to pop the apples out on the first try. If you land it in the basket you get extra points. The apples are different colors. You need to get different color apples and that's where the challenge is.

You can create unlimited combinations. Loads of imaginative play. All the battle gear is compatible with other 6 inch figure's. The kids really seem to like creating their own combo, we have a few of these.They do snap together easily, we had one other that kept falling apart but we come to learn it was a fluke and the part itself. If you ever have that issue just email the company they will replace it!

"This is a solid armor shell case for your Galaxy S6 Edge Plus Only. It will only fit that model. It meets military drop test standards.. and household with pets and kids standards.

"Smart idea these Poo-Pourri before you go toilet sprays. Simply gives a spritz before you go, and thats it. Its made of essential oils in a variety of  scents to fight those stinky smells! One bottle will last a LONG time, up to 200 uses in the little 4 ounce bottle. We have a few of these and have one in each of our bathrooms and I honestly have to say they do work. It's getting the men to remember to spritz! But when they remember I can go in right after them- and no not picking men over woman but in my household the men do rule when it comes to the bathroom.

"Now I know every baby is so different with teething. Some get fevers, some cranky, some are perfectly fine. I have had 3 children and each were different with their teething. In the past I tried a few other brands and it made no difference. I gave this all natural Hyland's brand a try which temporarily relieves the pain from babies cutting teeth. It helps to reduce the redness and inflammation of the gums. In all honestly I couldn't see any difference. She made alot of strange faces and went back to being cranky.From my experience, just waiting it out has been the best option, you will get a few days here a few days there. But even though I saw no difference, every baby is different so yours may just find this enough to cut the edge off.

"You pay for what you get.... that's the only way to sum up these awesome soccer cleats. They come with that price tag but are so worth it for a serious soccer player. They are so lightweight. They provide as close as a touch to the ball as you can get. It's Puma's lightest cleat yet. It's super strong and supportive, and so comfortable. It's flexible giving you the perfect cleat for your soccer playing. Puma put speed and precision into these cleats and it shows in their performance.The upper material of the clean it ultra thin textile. The lightweight support has the speedframe in the middle. And for excellent visibility, the form stripe works perfect. Their are conical studs underneath for those quick turns and traction stud for the better ground penetration and stability. With the traction stud you get more forward acceleration.If you are upgraded from a cheaper pair you will completely see the difference in how they feel, how you run and how you kick... and of course how you play.

"Both myself and my 15 year old son have used Proactiv products in the past and were pleased with the results. This re-texturing toner helps to improve and smooth out your skin texture. It has an alcohol free, fragrance free, paraben free and oil free formula. It's also non-comedogenic, and dermatologist tested. The kit includes a 6 ounce with 90 pads. It's suitable for all skin types, my skin and my son's are totally different but for each of us it worked well smoothing out my skin and improving his. You can apply it twice a day - however we only do it once a day because twice a day makes our skin to tight / dry. We have seen this in past products too so we apply less and have good results. If we apply to much we do get very tight red skin which is not fun- so keep that in mind that perhaps your skin can only tolerate once a day.The pads you go through fast, even at 90 and two people using them.. and sometimes we double up as they are quite thin. But overall the product made our skin feel brighter, nicer texture.

"Quinny Zapp has a very nice travel system for anyone expecting a new baby. This is a great system for 1 baby. You can use the car seat until 22 lbs *which is typically around a year old* -  and the stroller part until 50 pounds. The thing that stood out the most was the maneuverability of the stroller system. It's so flexible, so easy to push and turn and move. The stroller folds compactly. You have two choices for the seat too, it can face rear or forward facing. This set is all about options.The stroller is awesome. It fully reclines and you can adjust it to face two ways. You literally can go just about anywhere with it. It folds with the seat on it *unlike the prior model* and its such a small compact fold- one of the best. It is the only buggy around that is compatible with a baby car seat by Maxi -Cosi to use it from birth on up. Speaking of the car seat - your baby can use it up until 22lbs (from 5 - 22lbs, or basically birth to 12 months about / up to 29"") It has advance air protect side impact protection. The car seat is very very light. It's the lightest infant car seat on the market (compared to seats as of Jan 2014) It's very light. It has ergonomic handle so its comfortable when holding it alone or with your little turkey- as they turn into those butterballs real fast! A lighter car seat is nice when your growing baby adds up the pounds. The car seat has some nice features. It has self-wicking fabric that actually deodorizes and draws liquids away from the skin to keep baby dry and comfy - in case the seat gets wet / spit on etc. Of course it is still machine washable and dryer safe if you need. The base is very nice, it was easy to install, I got it nice and tight. You can get accessories for this too, a bug net or a weather shield are available separately. The car seat also features infant support for smaller babies and a flip out visor on the canopy for added sun protection.Back to the stroller... it also has a very nice shopping basket below, easy access and holds up to 11lbs of stuff. The seat cover is water repellent... any spills, just wipe clean, its that easy. The foot rest is fully adjustable - great for those growing kids allowing them to relax when napping. The wheels are so nice. Whether your in the city or on rough terrain, you have the option to keep them swivel or lock into straight position for that rougher area. The sun canopy is very nice, open and closes with easy. The handle bars are so comfortable - and the height is perfect.Quinny has many accessories sold separately too for this stroller / seat set. You can get a cup holder, foot-muff, weather-shield, even a parasol. This is a very nice travel system. It arrives in a few parts, but 20 minutes later it was easily put together. I love how smooth the stroller rides and handles. Excellent quality. Everything is comfortable, I even had my 5 year old test out the stroller to see how easy it was to push her in it over her little sister. You would never know the weight difference. Excellent safe investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UJ5TC8YB7YPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKPV2GW#wasThisHelpful","R3UJ5TC8YB7YPP","A226GFM0Q9L37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226GFM0Q9L37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The polyester side has a teddy bear pattern - cute.It's nice and absorbent too, my daughter did pee on this nicely for us to test out during a diaper change.. and she did alot, and it absorbed very nicely - she was nice and dry and none of it leaked off or threw. Great pad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R336EI277DI0BF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FWC048#wasThisHelpful","R336EI277DI0BF","A226GFM0Q9L37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226GFM0Q9L37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are nice size packets of dried baby food. You add breast milk, formula or even water to prepare it. They are organic, non GMO and kosher. The drying preserves the freshness of the food and flavor. This blend is squash, green kale and bananas. My daughter likes this blend. We have tried the other flavors as well including sweet potatoes, oatmeal and bananas, peas, quiona and apples and the carrots, raisins and sweet potato. I like the fact that there is no added salt, sugar or artificial flavors. You get 8 packages for about 16 $.. they are a little costly at $2 or so each thats the only downside.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM2TY07613IZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3L4AS2#wasThisHelpful","RM2TY07613IZ2","A226GFM0Q9L37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226GFM0Q9L37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have mixed options about this seat, it's not for everyone yet perfect for some. My tester is a year old, 22 lbs. The seat is very very comfortable. It has so much padding you kid won't want to get out of the seat. Even my 5 year old says its so soft. So technically I have two testers here. The car seat has a removable body pillow you can take in and or out. It's very easy to adjust the harness. I really like the removable storage pockets and cup holder. You can put it on either side of the car seat or not use them at all depending the age of your child or space in your car. The expiration date is 10 years from now - which is nice and long for your child to use until they grow out of it.It is rear-facing 9-40 pounds; forward-facing 22-65 pounds. So if you have a baby who is 5, 6,or 7 lbs.. even 8 lbs, you can't use this to take them home, so you need an infant seat (2nd car seat) for those first month.. or months (1-2) at most. You can always use that infant seat longer and then use this in the future as another option. But if your seeking that all in one car seat start to finish this is shy a few pounds. Not all babies are 9lbs to start. All 3 of my children were small ranging 5lbs 3oz - 5lbs 14oz. I do prefer an infant seat anyhow as it's just easier for parent and baby rather then a car seat like this that stays put.It is convertible meaning that rear facing and forward facing. It has side impact protection. I like that the pad removes with snaps - easy to machine wash as well as dry in the dryer. The infant insert is nice to hold that baby but again 9lbs and up. It does recline, 3 positions. I found it a little harder to tighten the harness compared to my other models Britax and Radon. Overall nice seat, not my favorite, but I do like the comfortableness of the seat, its very well padded.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQL98QKMR3TA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OU9CKTG#wasThisHelpful","R2AQL98QKMR3TA","A226GFM0Q9L37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A226GFM0Q9L37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have the ipad, iphone (or ipod) and the iwatch this docking stand is 100% for you. I own all three and prior to receiving this stand for free for my honest unbiased review I had each device separate sitting on my desk or my nightstand. Wires were scattered, and each had to connect and lay flat taking up more space.Now... its honestly perfect. The docking stands holds each device. I have the bamboo wood one and its a great natural color stand- would go with any decor. It does come in rose wood as well for other color choices which is also a nice color by the looks of it. It holds all the cords out of the way and discreetly. You can charge each device, all on the one stand. I love it, very convenient and holds everything nicely.

"I wish they made better Inside Out Playsets. I have yet to find one that we like. This is suppose to be the headquarters. It comes with 3 memory spheres and a Joy figure. It also has the projector and furniture pieces.Your suppose to watch the memory spheres roll down the path of the short term memory. You place the spheres in the projector to watch them on the screen of the consciousness. This is an awesome idea for one awesome movie....However, sadly its poorly constructed and poorly works. In order to see the memory spheres on the screen you need a dark dark room.... IF you get that far. They are so tricky to sit in the unit. Very very frustrating if you don't get them in correctly, they won't work. The projector for us didnt snap right, the whole toy just isn't stable. It's so... junky for lack of words.

"Wow - say goodbye to that oily face skin and hello to my new smooth and nourished face skin. I waited a while before posting my review to ensure my results lasted while using the product. It has become part of my morning routine, or sometimes my evening routine- depends how busy my day is to be honest.But whichever time you choose, after you wash your face its as easy as a mist. No more clogged pores, my skin is is hydrated and not oily - that was my biggest issue- and that leads to more breakouts. I have tried prescription creams for that in the past and still had trouble with oily skin. But after using this I am very very pleased. I am looking into their other products now because I see the results and feel the results. Its 100% natural too, and organic ingredients. They back their products up 100% as well.

"I must admit I was a little too excited to get these high top USB charging LED sport shoes.  I love lights and being able to have them on my shoes was a cool thought.  I pulled them out of the box and had to check them out right away.  I was so happy that they lit up straight from the box.  I will also admit that I didn't completely read the listing so when I pulled the double charge USB cord out of the box I had to go look for where to charge them.  I like that the charger and power button are inside the shoes.  It suggests turning them on and letting them stay on until they stop lighting up and charge them for 3 hours.  My family and I all loved seeing all the lights as it is surrounded by lights on the sole.  I also like that I can change it to have one solid color, there are 7 color choices, or have it change colors consistently.  I put the shoes on and was pleasantly surprised at just how comfortable they are.  They fit pretty well although there was a little extra room at the back.  They didn't hurt my feet to wear and I have issues with a lot of shoes doing that.  The sole is pretty thick too, thicker than most shoes I have purchased.  I would recommend these shoes to people who love lights or just want something cool to wear.

"This crunchy chocolate roasted peanut chew gift tray was so good.  It comes wrapped in a gold box with a beautiful ribbon wrapped on top.  It also is wrapped with plastic wrap to preserve the freshness.  There are 25 delicious treats per pack.  When I first received it my first thought was it looks like fudge from the top as it has chocolate and peanut butter icing on top.  I opened it up and we all tried one.  The first thing that popped in our heads was that it tasted like a Rice Krispy treat without being quite as sticky.  The icing on top doesn't overwhelm the taste of the bottom layer of peanut crisp texture on the bottom.  This would make a great gift for anyone at any time.  Need a gift for the hostess of a party, your kids teachers, your significant other or anyone else?  This would be perfect.  You can give it for Christmas, birthdays, or just because days.

"My son has the worst luck with his car battery.  He has been in several situations where he needed a jump start and I have even had to call for help.  With this mini portable car jump starter power bank I don't have to worry about him anymore.  He can keep this in the trunk of his car and be able to jump start it at any time.  This charger can actually hold enough charge for 20 jump starts when fully charged.  He will just have to remember to charge it every so often.  I think one of the things I like the most about this is the carrying case.  It comes in a hard plastic case which will protect it from damage and the weather.  It is so compact it doesn't take much room either.  The other bonuses are that it has a flashlight that can be turned on as a regular flashlight, a strobe light, or an SOS light and it has a dual USB port to charge your phone.  It even comes with a cable to charge different phones, like the older and newer iPhones and android phones.  This is a must have in all cars because most of the time people don't want to help others anymore.  I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.

"This paracord survival bracelet is great to have on hand.  Whether you hike, camp out, or just around the house you could use it.  There are so many things it could be used for, a rope, to help build a shelter, etc.  This bracelet is thicker than most I have seen but that is due to the fact that it  is a 13 foot paracord tightly wound to a small bracelet.  The clasp is heavy duty and will not just come undone unless you take it off.  It has 3 holes to secure it in.  The weight limit is up to 500 pounds which is about two to three times what the average person weighs therefore you could use it to help rescue someone.  Who knew that a little cord like this could do so much and hold that much weight.  The bracelet will not slide off your wrist either so there is no worry about losing it in the wilderness or water.  This bracelet is a great accessory for anyone to have when they are out and about.  You may never need to use it but it is better safe than sorry.  The bracelet isn't atrocious looking either which is always a plus.  The fact that it is black means even hunters can wear it and not draw attention to themselves.  It would have come in handy when my son had to drag his deer so far, he could have just tied the deer legs together and pulled it easier.  I think this is a great item to have at all times.

"My dad likes to watch different shows on his bedroom tv but needed a way to do something besides a plug in device that only played limited items like Netflix or just the satellite.

You can do so much with this, even access Facebook and the internet.  We are so happy with this we are looking at getting another one.

"I have grown very fond of silicone cookware.  These non-stick mat pads are a perfect addition to my collection.  They are 9.5 inches in diameter so they fit in most pie pans.  They keep the pies, cakes, cookies or anything else I bake in them from burning.  They are so easy to use, wash, put in the pan, put the food on, cook, and clean.  They are dishwasher safe or they can be washed with soap and water.  They withstand high temperatures so I can always use them as I don't cook over 450 degrees anyway.  I really like that I can roll them up after they dry and store them away without taking up much room.  The mats keep the food from sticking which really helps when baking a cake, especially since mine almost always wanted to stick on the bottom.

The kitchen isn't large so I needed another set of measuring spoons and cups that would be small enough to store easily.  This professional set of plastic measuring spoons and cups were just what I needed.  The only problem is that when my granddaughter saw them she thought they were toys and took off with them.

They are made of durable plastic and have the measurements carved in to them instead of raised or printed.  That fact makes them worth having alone because I have had some cups and spoons that it would wear off of and it became a guessing game.

I filled it with hot water and wrapped it in a towel then I placed it next to the part of his body where he was complaining of pain.  He actually stopped complaining of the pain.  I like that this water bottle can be filled with hot tap water or boiling water and will still work.  The mouth of it is large enough that I can fill it without spilling the water all over my hand.  The top is snug so there is no water leaking around it.  The bottle is thicker than a lot I have seen in the past.  There is no hole in the bottom to hang it from but I have been able to situate it just right to drain it completely.  I haven't noticed a smell when using it but I haven't held it up to my face.  It doesn't come with a cover but one could be purchased for it if so desired.  The bottle is transparent so it is so much easier to see how much water I have in it.  I don't typically fill it all the way up because it bulges when completely full.  This bottle would be good for cold water too even with ice mixed in for when you need an ice pack.

The light isn't very bright so if you put it in your bedroom it won't disturb your sleep which is a bonus.  I am glad I received this to combat the flies and the moths that seem to want to come around all the time.  I may just buy more to put in the rest of the house to keep spiders that sneak in away.

It is a glass top burner so it would be a little more likely to get broke if dropped but it is still made strong.  It looks very nice so it wouldn't be so bad if I leave it on the countertop.  I love the fact that it has a child safety lock because my 3 year old granddaughter is always messing with things.  I don't have to worry about her messing with this and getting hurt by accidentally turning it on.  The fact that it has 10 temperature settings makes it so much better than a regular stove top.  The temperature can go up to 460 degrees Fahrenheit so it will cook anything.  While it can go up to that temperature it also prevents overheating.  I like the safety feature of not having to worry about it being hot anywhere but where the pan is too so we won't get burned by the burner.  It has a timer on it which is great for those foods that we want to cook for a certain time.  We won't have to use our phones to keep up with the time anymore.  The timer can be set for 5 minutes up to 180 minutes.  We have a variety of different cast iron cookware and this works great with it.  I no longer have to worry about my food taking as long to cook either because this takes about half the time to cook it.  I may just use this for every day cooking and forget about the stove.  I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.  It would make a great gift.  This would even be a perfect gift for yourself, especially for those times when you are in a hotel and want to cook.

" 2:03 MinsI love headphones as does my children.  These bluetooth headphones are one of my new favorites.  I am going to have to keep them hidden from my children though.  The fit is perfect.  I love the way they have the curve to go in my ear snug but not too tight.  The over the ear piece helps ensure that they aren't going to fall out.  It is so comfortable I can forget I have them in sometimes.  It even comes with extra pieces to get just the right fit for my ear canal.  They are lightweight so my ears don't feel weighed down.  Set up was extra easy, I charged the headphones, turned them on and chose them on my phone.  They work well with my iPhone 6, my iPad and even my kids android phones.  I like that I can have up to 7 hours of play time on it before the next charge.  It comes with a mesh bag to carry them in as well.  It came with a charge cord but if I lose it I can use any other android cord to charge it with which is convenient so I am always losing cords.  I like that I can use it for phone calls and people don't complain that they can't hear me clearly.  The music plays great, I don't even have to have it on full volume to hear it.  This is one of the best headphones I have ever used and I am highly satisfied with it.  I would highly recommend this set of headphones.

"My son has an older car, 2002 Pontiac Grandam, that has high mileage and sometimes the check engine light will come on.  There have been times that it was something simple, he didn't turn the gas cap enough so that gas was escaping, other times it has been more serious.  He didn't like going to the parts store to get the light checked especially since now most of them won't turn it off.  This mini wifi wireless auto diagnostic scanner will save him from doing that now.I will admit that at first it took me a few minutes to figure it all out.  The instructions that came with it weren't overly detailed but the CD does have a demo on it.  I just downloaded the app and went out to the car.  Next I had to figure out where to plug it in (yea I am a woman who doesn't know all this stuff) but my son-in-law told me it is usually under the steering wheel.  I looked and bam there it was.  Well then I felt kind of dumb lol.  So I plugged it in there, connected to it as the Wi-Fi then opened the app.  The app has so much information that I haven't even looked at all of it yet.  It tells the gas mileage, temperature, RPM, fuel system status, speed, and so much more.  There is also an option to upgrade to a subscription that keeps the logs for you.  You can also turn the check engine light off with this scanner which makes it even better.  This will definitely be great for my son.  I would recommend this to anyone who has an older car that gives trouble.  This is a great investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R96P4NJOIP5P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014MV03OK#wasThisHelpful","R96P4NJOIP5P8","A38KK3YAP7S6IC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38KK3YAP7S6IC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:46 MinsMy dad decided it was time for a new grill this year.  We love to have family cook outs and well the little round one we had took forever to cook on.  So he got a bigger one that looks more like a smoker.  He wanted a good cover to protect it from the elements, rain, the sun, etc.  This grill cover fits it perfect and will protect it.  It is waterproof so the rain can't rust it.  There is a tie down that makes it perfect to keep it on even in windy conditions.  The cover is thicker than others I have seen in the store that cost way more than this one.  The air vents allow air to flow so that it doesn't get all musty smelling.  A big bonus is that it can be washed with a water hose.  We can just pull it right off and spray it off.  Of course we will let it air dry well and then fold it up after for storage.  It also comes in a bag to store it.  This is perfect.  My dad now wants to find a cover for his smoker because this one does such a great job and will make the grill look new for longer and protect it so well.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to protect their grill.

" 0:50 MinsThis roving yarn slouch beanie with pompom is very pretty.  It is made of acrylic which is very soft.  It has a cute pompom on top that is soft and fluffy.  I ordered the ivory color so that it would match everything I wear even more.  The threading is a light grey color which matches the ivory color perfect.  The bottom that goes around the head is all ivory and more tightly knit to keep it in place.  The beanie fit me well, it stretches to fit most heads which is a big plus.  It can cover my ears if I pull it down a little more which is great because I hate cold ears.  It slouches a little in the back which is what gives it the name and a better look for an adult.  I live in the south where it doesn't get finger numbing cold but sometimes I need something to keep my head a little warmer and this works.  The way it is made will keep my head from getting too hot or sweaty.  This is a very nice beanie and looks fashionable.  I do wish there was no tag in it.  This beanie should be dry cleaned to keep it new looking due to the way it is made and the materials.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves beanies.

" 1:49 MinsMy daughter has been wanting a camera for a while now.  This underwater shockproof digital and video camera is perfect.  She was so thrilled when she saw it.  It is made well and won't just shatter or break when it is dropped.  It is compact enough that she can carry it in her pocket or purse.  The best thing about it I believe, other than being waterproof, is that she can take selfies (what teenager doesn't love selfies).  It takes AAA batteries which isn't hard to get, although I wish it was rechargeable.  The battery compartment does pretty much need two hands to open as you have to push the button down while pushing the door to the side.  The camera has buttons for deleting or scrolling through pictures, turning the flash on or off, and turning the camera to the front or back.  The only other issue I had was that it doesn't come with a MicroSD card but those are easy to access too.  It does come with the USB cord so you can transfer the pictures to your computer.  I am well satisfied with this camera and my daughter was thrilled.

"My brother's immune system is fragile due to his brain injury so I am always looking for a way to help him stay healthy.  This immune balance will help him stay healthier though.  I also take it due to the stress I am under at all times.  I was not sure what to expect as far as taste when I tried this.  I was pleasantly surprised that it tastes good and it doesn't leave a bitter after taste.  The recommended dosage is 1-2 tablespoons daily.  We are starting with 1 tablespoon daily.  I have heard taking liquid vitamins and supplements are better for you as they absorb faster.  Honestly I would rather take liquids anyway because they are easier to swallow for me.  This supplement contains aloe vera juice which is great for healing any stomach issues, elderberry juice, agave cactus nectar and prebiotics amongst other ingredients.  Prebiotics are good for helping the good bacteria in the body be stronger which helps prevent other issues like yeast.  I am very satisfied with this supplement.  I would highly recommend it for anyone, as always speak with your doctor first though.

"Due to the stress of life in the last year and a half I have had a horrible time going to sleep.  These NaturaSleep pills help me.  I have tried prescription medicine before and it kept me awake all night and the next day.  I took one of these 30 minutes before I wanted to go to sleep and actually fell asleep quickly.  I was surprised and happy.  I like that the ingredients are natural.  It contains Magnesium 200mg, Calcium 100mg, Melatonin 3mg, 5htp 50mg, Vitamins B1 10 mg, B2 10mg, B6 10mg, B12 50mcg & Herbal Sleep Blend: Valerian Root, Chamomile, Passion Flower, Lemon Balm, Skullcap Herb, Hops Flowers.  The vitamin B12 has helped I believe because I was a little sluggish all day before and now due to it and the sleep I finally was able to get has improved my energy levels too.  The pills aren't so big that I choke on them and I haven't noticed a taste during or after taking the pill either.  I will only use these as needed, although they are not habit forming, I am just not big on taking pills.  I like that I can take it only as needed too because I am bad about forgetting to take anything every day.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a hard time falling asleep.

"L-Arginine is good for people with heart issues so I thought my dad could use it.  He has a lot of angina along with high cholesterol and a long history of heart attacks.  L-arginine contains nitric oxide which is said to help prevent issues such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and angina.  He has been taking this for a few days and we are looking forward to when he goes to the doctor again to see if his numbers have improved.  Considering the front part of his heart has no blood flow he has the angina pains.  We are waiting to see if it helps with that as well.  The prescription medications have made him dizzy and not feel so great so this would be a godsend if it helps.  The pills are not too large and he hasn't complained of a taste during or after use.  He started off with one pill a day to see if he notices a difference.  He has said it did give him a little more energy so that is a great start.

"My brother has prostate issues.  They said his is slightly enlarged.  That along with the bladder issues he has due to the brain injury sometimes makes urinating harder on him.  Saw palmetto is touted to be great for helping with prostate issues along with urinary issues that accompany it.  I have been giving him these pills to see if it will help him in those areas.  I have noticed that he doesn't have the sense of urgency he had before.  He is also not using the restroom in the middle of the night like he had been.  Saw palmetto has no known drug interactions so after discussing with his doctor I felt this would be good to try.  The pills aren't too hard for him to swallow which is a bonus.

"These premium lacrosse and spiky massage balls have been a real lifesaver for me.  I occasionally get stiff muscles and pains but these balls have helped me fix them.  I have a bad problem with getting foot pains and now when that happens I can just roll the balls with my feet.  There are 2 blue balls so I can have one under each foot.  I have also used them on my back when I get sore from lifting my brother, cleaning, or sitting for too long.  I like that I can control just how much pressure I apply with them.  I have tried it with just laying on them but prefer to be sitting and rolling it around my back against the chair.  The spiky massage ball was scary looking to start with but it works wonders.  When my neck and shoulders get stiff and sore I rub it around with a little pressure and can feel the pain dissipating.  The balls are all stiff with little give so they give more pressure than others I have tried.  I like the fact that it comes with a carrying bag so I can keep them with me at all times.  They are easy to clean too so if my granddaughter gets hold of them and plays with them I don't have to worry about germs.

"This genuine leather pro weight lifting belt is of high quality.  It is made of leather which is, to me, a much better alternative than nylon.  The fact that it is real leather means it won't tear like imitation leather.  The buckle makes it so much easier to stay on than velcro.  No matter what position you get in the belt isn't going to come apart on you.  It has holes around every inch so you can adjust it to fit you just right.  The black and red look of it is nice and will match anything you wear.  I have used this belt while doing squats and have not had the problem of it digging in to my body.  The 4 inch size gives it better coverage than others I have seen.  I was surprised at how much better my back felt while doing squats.  It didn't put as much stress on my back but I could still feel the effects on my stomach.  This belt is a great addition to any weight lifting or exercise program and will help prevent injury.

"This getaway insulated neoprene lunch meal tote is so practical yet pretty.  I love the outer design on it.  It is a well made bag that is made of neoprene.  The handles are not sewn on so they won't come apart.  There is a plastic zipper so there will be no rust.  The zipper is sewn on well and doesn't snag or get stuck.  It holds a good amount so there is room for a meal, makeup, insulin, or anything else you want to put in it.  Sometimes when I am out and about I like to take a drink with me but don't want it right that moment so I needed something to keep it cold.  This bag keeps it cold for up to 4 hours.  It comes in handy when I take my brother to the doctor too because then I can take him a drink for after the appointment.  It would be great for someone who has insulin because it will keep the insulin cool for a few hours if they are going on a trip.  I wish I had this when I had to go pick up my mother in law because we didn't have a safe way to carry her insulin.  The bag is easily cleaned, just wipe it down with a wet rag and let it air dry.

"I have a little pup and when we changed his food he got gas so bad that it made me sick to my stomach.  I sprayed this probiotics for dogs on his food, the recommended 4 sprays and WOW, his gas went away.  He seemed to feel better too once I did that.  Our older dog seemed to start having a little more energy when I started spraying it on the food too.  They ate the food without any problems too.  I have tried to sneak medicine in the food for the older dog before, she is a chow and will be 10 this year, and she refused to eat it.  This supplement has helped them both and I was so happy that it didn't affect their eating.  This is the best supplement I have seen for dogs as far as helping their bowels, gas, energy level and health.  I would highly recommend it to everyone with an animal.

Some of the sayings are so true though.  One I wish they all would truly learn that even says it is vital - don't forget to put the toilet seat back down.  The saying about complimenting her daily is a gentle reminder that women love to be complimented.  The advice on the mug is actually great for married men, men in a relationship or young men who need to learn but it is put on a cup that can be considered to be a joke.  This paired with the women's mug would make great presents for any couple.  The cup is white on the outside and blue on the inside.

"While I do have dogs and wanted this for detecting where they have made a mess I have used it for other things too.  This ultra violet urine detector works great for the glow in the dark body paint that I have.  On Halloween we got painted then went outside to glow.  This light was great for showing the paint we had on us.  This light packs a good bit of power to be so small.  It is well made and even when dropped doesn't break.  The light can be used for detecting if money is real, seeing pet stains, finding insects, and so much more.  The light is small enough to fit in a purse or pocket so you can take it with you when you visit a hotel or anywhere to determine the cleanliness of it.  I think I will be using this light more for the body paint with my granddaughter.  She loved painting everyone's face and seeing it glow in the dark.

"Children are a load of fun but they can also be a load of fuss when they try to get in everything.  These multi use adjustable child safety straps help eliminate a lot of fuss.  They are easy to use and have strong 3M tape to secure them on whatever you need to close up.  The instructions are easy to follow and installation takes just a few minutes.  You must have to measure how long you want them, cut it off at the appropriate length, tape them to the surface, and they are ready to go.  They are convenient for refrigerators, freezers, stoves, cabinets, doors, pretty much anything you want to keep children out of.  Once you choose the size and lock the one side you can't unlock it so make sure you have the correct size from the beginning.  The other side has a push button that you push to unlock it for access.  Children would have a harder time figuring it out and accessing it but it is always best to not let them see how you did it.  If they are like my granddaughter they absorb the information and then turn around and mimic you.  These could also be used to close anything else you want to keep closed such as toolboxes.

"This matcha green tea powder is pretty good.  I use it to fix smoothies because I don't like hot tea but wanted the benefits of the tea.  I also like to give it to my brother for the benefits.  It has increased my energy and my concentration levels.  It is also good for detoxifying the body which we both needed.  My brother really needed the extra fiber that it contains.  He doesn't like taking the fiber pills or drinking the fiber drinks but will drink this with the smoothie or if I make the tea then pour it over ice.  This is also good for the heart due to it lowering cholesterol.  My brother has been prescribed cholesterol medication to prevent anything so I figure this can only help with that too.  This tea is better than a lot of other brands because it is finely ground and has the brighter green color.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes matcha green tea or just wants an extra boost in their life.

"This bamboo memory foam pillow has been the best pillow I have ever owned.  Most pillows are too thick or too thin, this one is just right.  The pillow is a great width and length also.  I love the way when I lay on it my head kind of sinks down into it and the other parts surround the rest of my head.  The pillow comes rolled up in a small roll, when it arrived I was shocked at how small it was.  I unrolled it and let it sit for about 24 hours then puffed it up with my hands.  Then I laid down and it seems like for the first time in forever I passed right out.  I read that you can throw the pillow in the dryer on NO heat and let it fluff up also.  The cover can be removed if need be to wash and dry it which makes it very convenient.  Also if the pillow ever needs to be fluffed again I can put it right in the dryer on air only to freshen it back up.  I am so happy with this pillow.

" 1:10 MinsThese waterproof dog shoes with reflective velcro and rugged anti-slip soles are not only cute they work.  I have a pup that is about 5 months old and loves to run outside and play.  When it has rained it was horrible to have to clean his white feet but not anymore.  I can slip these on his feet and his feet will stay clean and dry.  It is great for when we go off too because they save his paws from the hot pavement.  We don't get much snow where we live but it has rained for a solid week in the past and these have come in handy.  I bought a size larger than what he actually needed because he is still growing and I wanted them to fit for a while.  They are easy to put on once he stopped fighting me.  The velcro strap makes it easy to keep them on his feet.  The reflective band makes it easy to see him in the dark.

"Sometimes it is hard to get my brother in the shower before an appointment so this volume reviving dry shampoo and conditioner bundle comes in handy.  I have tried other dry shampoos for him but none seemed to really work.  This one makes his hair look freshly washed and feel clean.  I just spray a little in and rub it in.  It doesn't leave a white look like others have either.  It does take away the oiliness he sometimes has.  The conditioner sprays on just as easily and leaves his hair softer.  He has curly hair so not all shampoos and conditioners work great either but this does.  It helps keep his hair from flying all over the place.  He is happy with it and I am too.  The slight scent of lavender is a bonus.  Lavender is calming and sometimes he needs that before going to the doctor also.  The cans are not too small so it will last him for a while.

"My hair is halfway down my back and can be unruly.  This coconut milk shampoo and conditioner has helped it immensely.  Usually I have to spend a long time washing shampoo out but this shampoo rinses out quickly.  The conditioner has made my hair so much softer and more manageable.  I love the smell of it too.  It reminds me of the beach and pina coladas every time I use it.  My hair keeps a little of the smell after I am done too.  I think one of my favorite things about this is that my hair isn't as tangly when I get out of the shower.  I also have noticed it isn't nearly as frizzy as it was.

"My granddaughter loves robots so I knew she would love this kids plate and bowl melamine dinnerware.  It comes with 5 pieces, the plate, bowl, cup, fork and spoon.  It is made of melamine so it won't easily break and can be used continuously without problems.  It is dishwasher safe but it is recommended to hand wash to preserve the color longer.  It is also not safe to put in the microwave.  The whole set is made of melamine and plastic, even the fork and spoon.  I believe it is better for children not to have metal utensils as they can hurt their teeth with it.  The fork does not have sharp pointy tines so there is no worry that she will poke and hurt herself.  She loves this set.  I love that it made her smile. The artwork is beautiful and bright.

There are times in his life when he just has to wear one though.  He said he does like this shirt.  He said it is very comfortable.  It is made of cotton so he won't get too hot in it either.  The collar, the sleeve cuffs and the pocket have a plaid design on them which gives the shirt a little more flair.  The shirt is a little long but the sleeves fit him well.  The neck wasn't too tight which is great because he is like me, can't stand anything too tight around there.  I didn't notice any loose threading and the buttons were securely attached.

"My brother can't do too much exercise as he is in a wheelchair or bed all the time.  These exercise resistance bands are perfect for him.  I personally love the colors and that there is an animal name on all of them.  The animal names correspond to the strength along with a dot on each.  I had to start him off on the flamingo because he doesn't have a lot of strength.  These bands help him work out his upper body and his lower body.  I have even used them to help my strength, although I can use the starfish and the butterfly for it.  We are both working on becoming dragons.  I also like that I can sit around at the table, on the couch, or anywhere else and use these.  I can even take them with us when he has an appointment and let him work out.

"It is hard to find a good ring that can be worn at all times.  These silicone wedding ring bands are perfect for that.  I actually have decided to wear these myself.  I feel naked without a ring and sometimes wearing my regular rings isn't good, like when I am messing with the pool or cleaning in the yard.  These make me not feel naked and they are comfortable.  I received three rings of varying sizes which is great because then I can wear one on any finger.  I also like that I can wear them even if I am retaining water.  The rings don't cut into my fingers at all.  They are soft silicone so they feel good against my skin.  I like that it came in a nice little bag too.  This would be a great gift for the guys in your life as they could wear these no matter what they are doing.

"My brother has a lot of issues with yeast infections.  He frequently gets them in his urine, part of having issues with his urinary system due to a traumatic brain injury.  I thought this best candida cleanse would help him.  I had looked up natural home remedies prior to finding this and saw that oregano oil, which is one of the ingredients was highly touted for helping with yeast.  I started giving him two a day in the morning with food.  I noticed that after a few doses he seemed to have more discharge which seemed to be a good thing because it was getting out.  He seems to feel better since he started taking it and his urine looks better than it did before.  I would rather give him a natural remedy than a prescription because the prescriptions have many more side effects.  His whole body seems to be reacting to the supplement.

"This is a book that I have not been able to put down, the way David Seamands writes is easy to understand, relate to and read. This was a very inspirational book that motivated me to try and understand why I hold some grudgy feelings towards people in my life and it also has shown me why I shouldn't. With ways to help you cope with damaged emotions and advice on how to handle past situations that may be preventing you from moving on I would highly recommend this book to everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTRLF730Y4N5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSL1WL4#wasThisHelpful","RTRLF730Y4N5L","AA4LBPHV06QTG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA4LBPHV06QTG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a wonderful set and perfect for gift giving to that special coffee lover on your list. This set comes with 2 very nice and heavy green coffee mugs, a frother, coffee scoop, and 2 bags of hard candies. I enjoyed my first cup of coffee in one of the new mugs this morning and it was bliss. My kids stole the candies and well, I didn't get to try those out but if they kids like them then they have to be delicious! I am really in love with the coffee scoop the most. The one end has a bag clip, which doesn't really help me since I buy the canisters but the scoop itself is wonderful, a stainless steel scoop that helps measure coffee grounds without causing a mess.

"Obviously being 31 weeks pregnant I opted to use my wine glasses with some iced tea. With 3 children, 2 of which are 3 and 18 months cups tend to get spilled which is why I was thrilled to get these, although I will say I think the silicone makes these extremely flimsy and not something I would trust not to spill or collapse. Maybe they would be different if I were drinking actual wine out of them, although I can't see how but whatever.

"Lovely Set, of dress up rings. You can wear these alone or together for a really elegant and classy look. Your set will arrive in a velour draw string bag.

Unlike traditional ""fake"" jewelry these have not turned my skin green or irritated it in any way.

"We have a mini van of course and our back windows are factory tinted which I thought would be enough to keep the sun off the kids, and while it works for the most part there have been times one of the kids complains that the sun is in their eyes. I never thought about buying these sunshades before but since reviewing these awesome ones from Drive I now will not have a car without them!These were really easy to install and use. I was a bit worried to be honest since the only directions were three pictures printed on the side of the box, but I will say the company personally sent me an email with an updated directions file attached! How awesome is that, that this company cares enough to take the time to send me directions without me even asking them? That right there screams wonderful customer service to me.Besides being really easy to install, you basically slide the suction cups onto the shades, clean your windows really good and apply the suction cups. These are also very easy to use and when you are not using them they roll up into their holders or you can even take them down with as much ease as you put them up.There is a black side and a white side to the mesh shade the white side goes on the outside of the window to help keep the UV rays and heat outside and off your little one. I have seen these things cost a pretty penny at our local stores which I think is why I never purchased them before, but this set of two window shades comes at a really affordable price tag of less than $20 for the set!

"Stephen Hawking wrote a very...interesting book when he wrote ""A Brief History of Time."" While I am not sure I believe all the hype about atoms and the big bang and gravitational pull and what not, I will say Hawking brings up many good points, at least from what I can tell from this brief summary of his full book.Some of the key take aways that I found most interesting include...* The universe began with an explosion know as the big bang* Scientists are searching for a unified theory on how the universe works.* There are 3 arrows of time in the universe that flow in the same direction.I am a firm believer the universe did not begin with the big bang or explosion, instead it was created by God's own hand, however, this is a debate that has been going on for centuries and will continue long after we have left this Earth. The main point is this book seems to be well written and semi-researched, neither of the ""issues"" I have with this book belong being labeled as Instaread issues but instead the author himself is the one I blame. Instareads did a wonderful job putting this summary together and I am thankful they did so that I did not waste my money purchasing the full version of this book.

"This is super cute and colorful. I love the silicone beads that can help with teething as chewing on them helps sooth the gums. My little man is 18 months old and a total binkie baby, so I was excited to get this new binkie leash,  I only had 2 issues with this product and neither of which would cause me to give this less than a 5 star review.#1. The star that acts as the clip opener and closing mechanism is a big large and heavy. While this is great for older kids I think you would want to hold off using this particular binkie clip on a younger baby.#2. My open and close mechanism seemed to be a bit too loose, it would open easily which is nice because some of those clips can be a royal pain, but it also made it easier for my 18 month old to not only pull the clip off his shirt but also open the clip.Overall, I am very happy with this product and my 18 month old loves it as well, the two issues I had aren't really anything major but I wanted to share for anyone thinking about this product. The one other thing I really liked about this, typical binkie clips have the elastic or ribbon binkie ribbon, and you have to loop it around and secure the binkie, but with this you have a lovely satin ribbon that can be opened and closed with a high quality KAM snap and let me say the snap itself is sturdy, it took me a minute to even open it, so you know that binkie is safe on this clip.Overall, this binkie leash comes highly recommended for style, durability, and functionality.*Disclaimer: I received this product at no cost to me in order to facilitate this honest review.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGUMARIBQUYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016VJ2KHE#wasThisHelpful","R2GGUMARIBQUYT","AA4LBPHV06QTG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA4LBPHV06QTG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I always have had a rough time getting my oldest to read any book without pictures and as he gets older that is a little less acceptable, I never understood his lack of desire to read both his father and I and his siblings love to read, but I keep trying to show him  how fun it can be by getting books of all genres. For this one specific reason I was thrilled when given the chance to review this book, ""Ripley's Believe It or Not! Eye-Popping Oddities!""Landon was super excited when I gave him this book, he immediately sat down to flip through it (after I made him take some pictures obviously, haha) The funny thing was Maverick also sat down to read this new book, although I think he enjoyed the pictures more. Ever since Landon got this book he has utilized all of the 256 pages worth of unique and off the wall facts and has shared every one with his father and I. This would normally drive me nuts but the fact he is reading and even more so excited to be reading I am thrilled!This book is a hard cover with holographic eyes on the front, I admit those eyes creep me out, I can't look at the front cover of this book without being creeped out, but the kids enjoy it and that's the important thing.The book itself is filled with facts and unique information only Ripley's can bring to you, the easy to read and understand wording helps give kids confidence in their reading abilities if you ask me.

"When I was growing up the ""ultimate love story"" was Romeo and Juliet, you know the forbidden love of two families that are fighting, and ends in the tragic death of a very young couple. This book reminds me of that story in many ways. This story written by Gad Shimron is the modern day love story if you ask me. You have two different cultures fighting and in the midst of all that you have two young people who have fallen in love. During the time period this was written (1930'-40's) German and Jewish people did not intermix on a casual basis let alone a romantic one and yet these two people fell in love despite the societal norms, it just goes to show you how powerful and strong real love is.If you are looking for a wonderful and inspiring love story than I highly recommend this eBook.*Disclaimer: I received this product at no cost to me in order to facilitate this honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZWY688YGDUAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1517691443#wasThisHelpful","R2ZWY688YGDUAZ","AA4LBPHV06QTG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA4LBPHV06QTG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After giving this to my 10 year old who hates to read and have him sit down and read it, and then talk about it for weeks D.S. Venetta is not a favorite author in my book! This is a well written, adventure, educational and thrilling book for children. While older children might enjoy it more simply because they can read it themselves there is also no reason why you couldn't read this to a child of any age. As  a parent I think reading to children and encouraging reading is very important and books like this that keep their interest are a huge help.

" 2:06 Mins This is a fabulous concept but I do have two issues...#1. when my can arrived the side was indented pretty bad, I was able to push the dent out by hand thankfully. I would think this was caused by poor shipping. Maybe the company could add some packaging bubble wrap or something to ensure the garbage cans arrive in tip top shape. Mine was in a flimsy white box then a brown packing box with not type of padding. and #2. the lid on mine does not fit flush on the top like it should. You can see both issues in my video below. Overall, the foot lever kinda seems flimsy as well, like when you press on it (and I used my hand) it is going to break.I think the concept of this smaller sized trash can is wonderful, in fact I will be either using this for my cat litter (when I scoop the litter before garbage day) or as a pail for my cloth diapers until laundry day.

" 2:44 Mins I have always wanted an alkaline water filter, but most times they are over priced for what they are. This one is priced very reasonably if you ask me and it is super easy to install. When you first use it I recommend letting the water run for about 5 minutes or so because from being brand new and never used the water will be black, but after about 4-5 minutes it runs clear and is good to drink. I didn't notice any flavor difference between this or regular tap water though, not sure if there is suppose to be a noticeable taste difference or not.

" 2:49 Mins I was a little nervous about trying this product at first, the thought of electronic pulses helping my pain was a little...far fetched and unnerving at the same time for me. I am glad I did try this though, it has really been helping my hip pain (associated with pregnancy) I am 28 weeks along and typically suffer some form of pain whether it be back or hip pain throughout my pregnancies, I usually go to the chiropractor once a month to stay aligned and that does help with the pain but there is always that one spot that never seems to be pain free. With this unit I am able to target that spot (in this case my right hip) and get relief from the pain without the need of medications.I did speak to my midwife BEFORE trying this out since I am pregnant and she said she would be ok with it as long as it does not cause me to cramp, she stated if it caused cramps to discontinue the use of it. So far we are ok and it is helping with no cramps or other ""side effects."" So, I would say this should be in every home where a pregnant woman is because it can help with pain both during pregnancy, after pregnancy, and even during labor.*Disclaimer: I received this product at no cost to me in order to facilitate this honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS3DBDHIZVGZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQIKEAE#wasThisHelpful","RS3DBDHIZVGZF","AA4LBPHV06QTG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA4LBPHV06QTG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A stinky fridge is probably one of the most common issues in households today, we always have something in our fridge that puts off an odor, I am guilty of onions and hard boiled eggs and when those two smell mix it can be quite nauseating. This activated charcoal odor absorber worked great to eliminate the stinks from my fridge and without any chemicals or other nasty things having to be around my food.

"A word of caution.  Be sure the one you order is for your Kindle.  I made mistake of ordering the one for the 2013 model and had to reorder the 2012 model.  Case seems very well constructed.  Does not have instructions so took a minute or two to figure out that the recessed area on back is to pull the flap and insert the cover to make a stand for the device to sit horizontally.  This does not have a feature that lets you do the same in the vertical (book reading) mode.  It does have a place for pen, pencil or stylus which is nice feature.  The wake/autosleep feature works well.  I bought the Kindle Fire HD to go with my earlier Kindle Fire and I Pad.  Wanted a device mostly for book reading and found my I Pad just too heavy with its cover to read in bed.  The Kindle Fire HD with case is still light weight and easy to use for reading.  Overall this is a great case for a good price.

"A further update.  After about six weeks weeks using the program I find it is highly successful for me.  I am now into correcting a muscle imbalance in one of the three categories they describe and already notice some positive change.  For me the exercises are relatively simple and the pain exercises took me about five minutes twice a day and the corrective exercises about 10 minutes once a day.  Have made list so do not have to listen to the instructions which shortens the time period.  I will probably not post further updates unless I find that there is something significant to share.  I have no idea whether the program would work for a large population of those of us with back issues but it certainly has worked for me so far.This is an update of my earlier review.  I have now been using the system for three weeks.  The first two weeks I used the pain relief program and it did help considerably in easing what remained of the pain I was having.  I decided to try this based on a review where the reviewer could not stand for any period or walk any distance without having to sit down.  That was my case for six weeks.  While the pain was finally easing I do think these exercises helped to eliminate it.  I have now gone to the third disc to address a hip imbalance. Of the three muscle imbalances the discs identify this was only one I appeared to have.  Have just started the series of exercises to address this  and will come back and update further.Here is my earlier review:First, I have no relationship to these folks and have numerous Amazon reviews of products.  With something like this I am always uneasy when I do not know who or what is behind a product. And it is not inexpensive.  But if it works!  Their lifetime return guarantee helped me decide to give it a try or at least pay shipping both ways to see if it might be useful.I am just getting started with it and will be back to revise this after using it for a few weeks and can give more details.  For now I have had a sharp pain in rear and down one leg to ankle with some effects in other leg after taking a fall on ice this winter. Started before but aggravated by the fall.  Has gone on for some 6 weeks and while it is now easing for most of that time  could not stand at kitchen counter or walk my dog usual half mile without sitting down.  Even moved chair into kitchen and bought cane chair to take when walking more than 100 feet.  When sitting or lying down no issue.  Going through the first disc it seems likely my problem is piriformis syndrome.  Have done the exercises for this and also the universal exercises  found a couple of exercises clearly  did affect the muscle that is likely my main problem.  My primary care doctor basically has me on NSAIDs which while helping were not nearly this helpful.  X ray showed no hip issue and various tests run showed no other issues involved. Exercises seemed to make the most sense to try and resolve my issues.I have not gotten to disc 3 for the maintenance program but will look it over here shortly.  For now while first time through certainly did not give me complete relief it was encouraging enough to keep at it and see.  I have had too many friends going the invasive route of either injections or surgery to go that route without trying all other techniques first.When I started watching the presenter is sitting in a chair against blank wall and since there was no information on the background of those involved in the Sciatica Institute will say I had my doubts.  But the more I listened and looked at the workbook and based on research I have done through University of Maryland, Mayo etc. the advice seems both consistent and sound.  As do the exercises.  Since my pain had eased considerably before doing the exercises I cannot tell how they would have felt were I in the thros of a major back issue but for now they seem sensible.I will return and add to this review once I have been doing the exercises on regular basis.  If before then I run into any particular problems will return sooner.  All of us who suffer from these problems are looking for solutions and while I hesitate to do a review before using product for some time thought it might be useful to give my first impressions especially for those who might be considering but, as I was, are uneasy not knowing the credentials behind the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ZD374X4T4W1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF48I9Y#wasThisHelpful","R33ZD374X4T4W1","A1XYJ3UXLWO082","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XYJ3UXLWO082?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years back I ordered a bath mat which sheds terribly.  Great mat otherwise.  But the strands that stick to feet getting into the shower have over time clogged the cover to the drain.

"Bought two of these for birthday gifts for my adult children who are golfers.  Think they will get a lot out of it.  Tested it on arrival as birthdays a few weeks off.  Now not sure they will get both of them!  As with most electronic gadgets this has a few things to learn and while they do not have a toll free (or paid ) phone to talk to them they are very very prompt and responsive to e mails.  Turned out had a problem with one as the strap was loose on the back and they are replacing.  Their user guide on line is ok and their support very helpful.  Asked lot of questions and in the end feel very comfortable now with the device.  One thing I am going to suggest to my children is that they dedicate a golf glove to this device so they do not have to keep putting on and taking off the device on the glove.  Also suggested to company things to add to their user guide to help people get best use of device.  Took me a while for example to find how I could compare my swing to other swings and a pro.  Turns out you go to history then bring up a past swing and then at bottom are three dots which you touch to get the drop down to get to these items.  User guide not clear on that.  Likewise setting up multiple accounts, something I am sure a golf pro will want but also families with more than one golfer, says to touch the arrow but found touching the name brings up that screen. Also the device is only a transmitter and does not save any information, that is saved on the I Phone or I Pad application.  Little things but annoying until you find out how best to work with this.  But once you do it works great.  Have only tried it out in the back yard so far but itching to get to the range and give it a real work out.  Well may be one of those kids will not get this one after all!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IIKZUJFXL2BH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A7MLY2Y#wasThisHelpful","R1IIKZUJFXL2BH","A1XYJ3UXLWO082","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XYJ3UXLWO082?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this as I have a sciatic nerve issue I am dealing with and when I walk any distance get pain from spine down my right leg.  Painful enough I need to sit down if shopping or walking my dog.  I am just under 6 feel and 195 lbs and this works just great for me.  As with any three legged stool have to be careful not to tip over and the seat is somewhat small but works just fine.  You sit facing the handle.  It is not light, however, at 3 lbs but I would trade the weight for its solid steel construction.  Only thing I wish it had was a strap so I could carry it on my shoulder.  Will try to find one that will work with it.  I don't need it as a cane but do need it handy to quickly set up and sit for a minute or two after which I am good to go.

"Live in area where we get ice frequently in winter.  In last several years have gone down three times while walking my dog.  Fortunately did not break anything but only by luck I did not.  Never good to fall!  These cleats are strong and best I have seen.  Size matters as they say they fit 5-10 US size shoe.  I wear 9.5 and have a boot I use in winter.  It fit but was was struggle to get on.  No instructions with them but they are marked (somewhat faintly) with ""front"".  Took a bit to figure out how to get them on and hoping that with use they will stretch.  Probably could have used something like a crowbar to get them on if needed to.  Anyone older with bit of arthritis might find this even more a struggle.  But worth having something that will prevent falls on ice.  Have not actually used these on ice yet but if do and find any issues will come back and add to this review.  Meanwhile happy to have these for next storm.Update on above review.  Thought I bought these too late in season to try them....but I was wrong!  Another ice storm so had chance to try them the last two days.  A couple of comments.  First these are not all that easy to install but once on the shoe they are great.  I decided to put them on an older pair of buckskin shoes from LL Bean and the rubber was so stiff that it curled the toes of the shoes.  So I put in a pair of shoe trees and that worked great.  My plan is to just leave them on these shoes with shoe trees in place and change from non cleated to cleated pair of shoes as needed. It would be a real pain to have to put on and take off the cleats.  I wondered how these would be when walked on dry area and did not notice any problem.  Of course would not want to do that much as could wear down the spikes.  Overall these were great cleats for icy conditions and felt confident on even black ice conditions. Give them very high marks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19T0J11K9HF5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TJEA8Q#wasThisHelpful","R19T0J11K9HF5H","A1XYJ3UXLWO082","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XYJ3UXLWO082?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a book about Keynes the economist although it does discuss his work as an economist.  It is rather about his life as an investor.  There is much to be learned from his history as an investor, both what worked for him and the lessons he learned from mistakes.  As we face another difficult period in our economic history it is useful to see how he handled both the Great Depression and World War II.  As for Forward by John Bogle points out much of Keynes experience translates to the world today.  There are significant insights in this book that even after 50 years of successful investing myself I found worthwhile.  For example, the fact that using opposed risks (stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.) while working well in general fails miserably in conditions like 1929 or 2008.  What does seem to work well is focus on high quality dividend stocks with a mix of bonds for periods when stocks nosedive.  And buying and holding during bad times as well as good.  Something I have tried to instill in my adult children as they save and invest.  While much of this book covers things as investors we already know it never hurts to repeat good advice!  This is a short book and a quick read but a nice addition to my investing library and hopefully yours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UR1KBX291ENH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071815473#wasThisHelpful","R1UR1KBX291ENH","A1XYJ3UXLWO082","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XYJ3UXLWO082?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Was not sure about this as wanted to use as glove liner.  Also only in large size but turned out to fit just fine.  I usually wear a medium men's glove.  Early this season I bought a pair of Smith work thermal underwear in poly and found them thin, lightweight and much more comfortable than the cotton I used to wear.  Use them when sailing in winter and those have worked great.  But found that while I have good gloves that my hand get cold when walking my dog at temperatures under 20 so wanted glove liner that was think and light. These do the trick.  Fit inside my leather gloves nicely and give me that extra warmth.  Would not have thought that poly would work well as thermal layer but seems to work extremely well.  Have friend who grew up on NE farm and tells me he always wears double layers of gloves like he did as a kid and it helps with the cold.

"Have used this under its various names for many years and always found it making the tax season much easier.  Started using it when moved from Turbo Tax in the days of dial up internet (shudder) because Turbo Tax took forever to download updates.  Also Tax Cut (as it was known then) gave you all states free (alas, no longer now you get one and have to buy others you may need).  Updates with Tax Cut (now H and R Block Tax Software) downloaded quickly and still does even with faster download speeds.  You need the Deluxe edition if you need to file a state return (how lucky can you Texans be!) as it includes one state return although not in e filing format.  Does include up to 5 free e files of Federal returns.  Overall it is excellent value and does the job well.

Except that is for the business applications.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X8AF3CIY46VV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYH912C#wasThisHelpful","R1X8AF3CIY46VV","A1XYJ3UXLWO082","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XYJ3UXLWO082?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started shaving....well it was many decades ago!  Started with a Norelco shaver.  Never did seem to give me a really close shave.  Over the years have gone back and forth between blade and electric hoping that one day an electric would give me a shave that is close to that of a blade.  Must say that my first shave with this razor impressed me.  First it was gentle and quiet especially compared to my Remington foil shaver.  And while it is not entirely as close a shave as a blade it is very, very close.  Alas, I have lost most of the hair on top of head and finally gave up with the comb overs.  Between barber trips every two weeks get a bit of stubble on top and neither my blade nor my electric would take that done.  But this razor does.  Of course to keep it giving me a good shave I will need to replace the head every year or so and that is not cheap.  But then neither are razor blades.  An electric is so convenient and I am pleased to have finally found one that actually seems to come close to a blade shave.  We will see as the months progress and should it decline in performance I will be back to add to this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DT7TXBOTDESJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GQYSC8#wasThisHelpful","R2DT7TXBOTDESJ","A1XYJ3UXLWO082","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XYJ3UXLWO082?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Extremely useful especially with my induction cooktop.  Those will not work with aluminum or ceramic pots or pans and the Lodge pans are quite heavy.  But by putting this griddle on the induction cooktop I can use my lightweight aluminum pans and ceramics too.  True, I lose a bit of heat efficiency but not enough to make a difference.  The low lip on this griddle lets me use my pans with handles easily.  I have larger Lodge cast iron pans that will not let me do this.

"This is update to prior review.  I liked the eTrek 20 a lot but a question from Amazon got me looking at the Oregon 650t as well. Got question on review saying was comparing to Oregon. My kids ended up getting me that for Christmas.  It IS more expensive (a lot!) but the t model includes the 1:100K map preloaded so I can have that for travel while keeping my 1:24K map inside for use locally.  Also has a camera with flash that I can use to geocashe and general use.  Nice when sailing and do not want to take regular camera.  The Oregon 650t has a touch screen and its screen is quite a bit larger (3 inch diagonal vs 2.2) and only slightly larger overall(.3 width and .5 length with same depth).  But it is more expensive so if price a factor (and when isn't it!) then the e Trek 20 is a great choice. At the moment Oregon 650t is 4 times as expensive as the e Trek 20 on Amazon so you have to really want those added features (or get as a gift!) to choose the Oregon 650t over the e Trek 20. On other hand it does include the 1:100K topo which goes for $80-100 but even so it ends up more than double the cost.  But for those of us with Kindle Fire and I Pad (have both) and used to touch screen having that is very nice.  Writing this before Christmas so have not tried the Oregon yet as it is sitting under the tree.  Will repost after using a while and give comparisons.  As mentioned below I found the toggle on the e Trek 20 bit awkward and I kept hitting the menu button when wanting to zoom in or out (same side) but once you get used to it works great. Manuals are not great but if you are adept at all with equipment like this you will eventually figure it all out. I suspect manual issues will be same with Oregon.  For less than a third the cost of the Oregon (half if you want the 1:100K topo of US) it is a great device.Old review:  Use this while hiking and sailing.  Took a bit of getting used to with toggle vs touch screen.  Kept wanting to touch the screen.  Also menu can be bit confusing until you figure it out.  Lots of features did not plan on using such as the area calculation (useful in measuring grass area of yard for fertilizer) etc.  Bought with both 1/100K topo of entire US which is nice while traveling.  1:24K nice for my particular area.  Did find installing the maps in the micro SD bit of a challenge.  Overall extremely pleased and would buy again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYWQEOZ25LHP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00542NVDW#wasThisHelpful","RYWQEOZ25LHP0","A1XYJ3UXLWO082","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XYJ3UXLWO082?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Buying anything with suction cups is always a gamble, and one with low odds of success. But I got this anyway because I couldn't find any other alternatives for a bathtub hoop. Well, the suction cups are a total failure. Even on smooth wet tiles, they won't stay on for more than a couple of minutes, and that's if you don't touch them. So, impossible with a baby/toddler in the tub. Luckily we have one of those old ceramic soap holders with a handle built into the tiles on the wall, at just the right height, so I was able to tie the hoop to it. It's the only way it will not fall. It droops down now, but whatever... Better than nothing. My daughter loves it anyway, and loves putting all her bath toys through the hoop. I ended up cutting the bottom of the net to make it a true basketball basket so things could fall through. I don't understand the people complaining about that. All you need is scissors. The balls from this set have become my daughter's absolute bath-time favorite. No matter what other toys she has in the tub that day, she always asks for the balls, too. She has to hold them while I'm putting her pajamas on, too. She's obsessed with balls in general, and these are definitely her favorite, for some reason. I wish they didn't have holes (I'm always suspicious of mold), but on the other hand, she loves that they squish down pretty flat when she bites them, which wouldn't have been possible without the holes. No mold yet so we're happy. I just wish the damn suction cups would actually work!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PDX4HGBC9FZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009NQQO#wasThisHelpful","R3PDX4HGBC9FZP","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this when my daughter was about 15 months old. It was an instant favorite! She had a lot of fun putting the rings on the tentacles and taking them off again. We've had it for over 3 months now and it's still one of her all-time favorites. She likes pointing out his facial features and all the dots on his head. She likes playing with the rings separately, too - like looping them around her fingers or toes, or around mine. The octopus has a hilariously goofy expression, slightly cross-eyed. I love that none of the pieces have any holes in them to collect water and mold. Basically, the perfect bath toy. I don't know if it can serve as an actual ring toss - haven't tried it - but it works great as is for now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R288SI03OJQ5QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CDR7LW#wasThisHelpful","R288SI03OJQ5QR","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice, soft, comfy set. It's well made and the material is very pleasant to touch. It fits as expected for the size. However, there are no buttons or anything on the neck, and the seam isn't even stretchy - it's a rigid set size that has no give, which is very surprising for baby clothes. Usually they have at least a lap shoulder or something. The shirt on this set is VERY hard to get over the head of the child, and requires a lot of pulling and tears. My daughter is very average-sized in every way except for her head. She's in the 82% for head circumference and it's a torture to get this shirt on her. But that's why you make baby clothes with extra room or a button on the neck! Babies have big heads and they vary in size! I'm so very disappointed with this design, especially because I otherwise love the outfit and don't want to have to toss it or cut it, but I'll have to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REU9YL46XEWEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBFURNW#wasThisHelpful","REU9YL46XEWEG","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this car seat because of its great reviews elsewhere, its new system of easier latching, and the fact that it will last us a long time before being outgrown. I got it after my daughter outgrew her first car seat (the bucket). After almost half a year of use, I can say that its definitely easy to install and secure once installed. The cushioning is plentiful and comfortable, and the seat looks well made and reliable. Its big enough to accommodate a growing child, but not so big that it wont fit in a small car. We have a small Nissan Sentra and it fits perfectly, taking up only the middle seat in the back with plenty of room for a passenger on either side. It doesnt obstruct the rear window or anything. Basically, a quality car seat.However Theres one big drawback, which is so infuriating that I couldnt help but drop two stars for it. The harness SUCKS!!!!!!!! This is the most annoying harness of anything Ive ever used, and having a toddler, Ive used a bunch of harnessed contraptions. Its absolutely infuriating. First off, the left and right belts are not anchored to the seat anywhere - its all one long belt loop, so if you pull on one side, it gets too loose and the other gets too tight. Then when you pull the tab to tighten the harness, it gets tightened unevenly on all 4 sides (left shoulder, left hip, right shoulder, right hip) so with EVERY single use you have to do this balancing act of pulling on the 4 parts separately until theyre even in length, or else the harness is not secure! To make matters even worse, the belts love to get twisted up behind the back of the seat and then get stuck in the slit they come out from on the front. But you cant see around the back It took me forever to figure out why the belts were so hard to pull, until one day they stopped pulling out altogether, and after some thorough checking of everything, I realized one of the sides was twisted up on itself at the back and wouldnt slide through the slit anymore. Now at least I know to look for it, but it does still get twisted up every couple of days, so I have to grope around the back to untwist it. Not what I want to do with a squirming toddler whos trying to jump out of her seat! The chest clip that holds the two shoulder straps together doesnt slide easily up and down the straps, so thats another point of frustration - more pulling on things that dont want to cooperate and get stuck. Also, the straps have no padding whatsoever and cut horribly into my poor daughters neck, especially in the summer when she doesnt have a lot of clothing to go between the edge of the strap and her skin. So in the summer, she has near perpetual friction burns on the sides of her neck from the damn belts. I sometimes try to tuck something under the belts, like burp cloths or napkins, but she wont let them stay there because shes 18 months old and ooh look whats that on my shoulders!!!If Id known about all those issues, I wouldve gotten a different car seat. There are plenty of options out there that are still safe and comfortable, but that dont make you miserable every day. We drive our daughter to daycare every day, so this is something I have to deal with daily, not like a minor flaw I can just neglect. Frustration is my main experience with this car seat. Im sure its great in every possible way, but with our next kid, Ill be getting a different model.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22YEQD5ZAQRMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3Y6JPK#wasThisHelpful","R22YEQD5ZAQRMO","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Weve had this stroller combo for a year and a half now, and havent had any problems yet. I really like it! Its lightweight, maneuverable, well padded and comfortable for the baby, gives a smooth ride and is easy to use. The car seat lasted about 14 months before my very average-sized daughter got too tall for it. She was about 20 lbs at the time. The car seats weight limit is 35 lbs, but most kids will outgrow it in height way before they reach the weight limit. So I dont see the big deal with the new model Graco car seats being 35 vs. 30 lbs and the same size Seems like an unnecessary bragging point. Unless you have a REALLY fat baby, I guess.The best feature of the stroller is that the back of the seat reclines all the way down to form a bed. Its very spacious. My daughter is 18 months old now and still loves sleeping in the stroller when we go for walks. She fits comfortably, with only her feet sticking out. The car seat clicks onto the stroller (and onto its base) very easily, but the setup is very temporary. I only rolled her around in the carseat+stroller combo maybe for the first month or two, when she was really tiny, but after that she really wanted her space so I ditched the cramped car seat and put her in the reclined stroller seat-bed, and she loved it! And the stroller is so much lighter and easier to manage without the car seat. The two together are a good deal in terms of price, but with this particular stroller, the fact that the car seat fits onto the stroller isnt as big of a perk as I thought it would be. With the next baby I might just put him/her straight into the reclined seat bed from the start.The basket under the stroller is HUGE. It can easily fit the equivalent of 3 full diaper bags, plus a couple of adult jackets stacked on top. Its a bit hard to get things in and out when the stroller is in bed mode, but thats not really a big deal. There are two parent cup holders and a wallet/phone holder in the parent tray. The baby tray has a wide area, a cup holder and a bowl thing. It swings open to let the kid out, which is nice. The stroller folds easily and stands upright when folded, but it can fall over easily if you bump into it, so I have mine clipped to the staircase at home (we dont have a closet on the first floor of the house). Its not the most compact stroller out there, but its not meant to be. Its our nice stroller - we have a compact bare bones one for travel. This one still fits in the trunk of our very small Nissan Sentra though, with room to spare, so it's definitely not too big for small cars.The stroller has a 5-point harness, and I really like that you have the option of not using the shoulder straps. Thats not the case for all strollers. I find the shoulder straps unnecessary in a stroller. You're not going at high speeds so you don't need the poor kid tied down completely (unless you have a Houdini who climbs out despite the rest of the harness, I guess). 5-point stroller harnesses immobilize my daughter unnecessarily, gluing her to the back of the seat. That way its hard for her to reach and use the tray, or to lean forward to look around. She likes her freedom of movement, but hasnt tried to climb out yet, so just using the hip and crotch part of the harness is perfect (by comparison, our travel stroller has a fixed harness and she hates not being able to lean forward!).There is only one thing I dont like about this stroller. The front wheels are too close to the wheel brackets that hold them and go over the top, so in the fall, after a rain, wet leaves and debris that stick to the wheels gets rolled up and stuck in the small space, jamming the wheels. You can dislodge the debris by rolling the stroller back and forth a few times, or by poking the stuff out with a stick. Its kind of a pain But it only happens if you roll over wet leaves, which only happens in the fall, so its not a deal breaker, and not enough to drop a whole star. I hope in future models they leave a bigger space above the wheels.After a year and a half of use, the stroller is still going strong with no signs of wear and tear, and no malfunctions. Weve long moved onto a bigger car seat, but for the time we used this one, it was fine - no complaints. I would definitely recommend the combo, and especially the stroller. Great features and comfort for a great price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R360EMB1OL3CXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W1J3J24#wasThisHelpful","R360EMB1OL3CXV","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This conditioner has been working better for my daughter's fine 3b/3c biracial hair than the Mixed Chicks one. I use it as a leave-in. It reduces the frizz to an impressive minimum, and with an older child it would probably eliminate it altogether. My daughter is 18 months old so she can neither sleep on a satin pillow yet, nor with a bonnet, and her hair isn't long enough to tie up or braid for bed; plus, she's very active and rolls around and messes up her hair all the time, day and night. So this is basically the worst set of conditions for maintaining curls, and yet, this product keeps them impressively contained! Her hair stays in shiny ringlets all day, with only minimal frizz by the end of the day, but if I occasionally pet it with wet hands to ""awaken"" the conditioner, it resets the curls and extends their life. Our regimen is to shampoo her hair once a week and use ""Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie"" for regular rinse-off conditioner, then apply ""Ouidad Krly Kids No More Knots"" as a leave-in. On non-shampoo days, I pet her hair with wet hands in the morning to revive the curls and get rid of the (minor) morning frizz, and then before bed I spray her hair with a little bit of ""Ouidad Krly Kids No More Knots"" dissolved in water, enough to get her hair damp and slippery enough to comb through it. Since I can't tie it yet, I have to comb through it every night or else it gets knotted. It still gets a couple of knots despite the daily combing, but they're pretty minor and easy to untangle. With Mixed Chicks she never got knots, but her hair got very frizzy during the day. While it's still short and easy to comb through, I prefer 2 minutes of combing every night but beautiful, shiny curls all day, to less combing but more frizz. Right now this has been working out well for us. The conditioner itself is pleasant to work with (Mixed Chicks was very sticky and hard to wash off of my hands afterwards), has a pleasant faint smell, and doesn't get crusty when it dries. It's expensive, but at this point we need very little of it so it's not a big deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R386YVZ1KDU43Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ARHPI0#wasThisHelpful","R386YVZ1KDU43Y","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had this top when I was a kid, almost 30 years ago in Europe. I still remember the circles whose colors would blend and change when it spun! I was looking for a pump top for my toddler, and when I saw this, my heart melted with nostalgia. I was so excited, that I didn't pay attention to the handle's design, and now I regret it. Even though the bottom part of the top is the same as back in the day, the handle has been redesigned and made WORSE, like so many things nowadays! Why can't they keep the old design and construction?!? These old toys worked, and they were built to last generations!!! My childhood top's handle was easy to pump, moved smoothly, and if I could pull it out of whatever storage it's in right now, I bet it would still pump smoothly. This thing, on the other hand, has a cheap, flimsy design that falls apart quickly. The core of the pump is a metal spiral thing, and by the sound of it, when you pump it, there's metal grinding on plastic, so a lot of friction and resistance. As you can imagine, when metal meets plastic in a battle of friction, the plastic won't last long. I'd bought another similar top by another company recently, and it was literally spewing plastic shavings when I pumped it. Needless to say, the plastic got shaved down enough that eventually the top stopped spinning altogether, within a few weeks of occasional use. Now that I'm looking more closely, all pump tops that I can find have this same design! That's ridiculous! This particular model spun okay for a few days, but within a week of occasional use it was already grinding down and hard to push. Right now it's very hard to push it down and there's a lot of resistance inside, with the plastic starting to shave off. This is the most ridiculous design and I'm heartbroken that 1) the design has taken over pump tops and I can't find anything else, and 2) that they've ruined a beloved childhood toy which worked just fine as it was!!!! After two spectacular failures, I'm done buying tops with this design and will be looking closely at the handle of anything else I buy. I do NOT recommend tops with this type of handle!","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MJYJZGMZ0CSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000IRYI#wasThisHelpful","R2MJYJZGMZ0CSI","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really fun book! The story is cute, and the tabs are engaging. We've had this book since my daughter was 15 months old (she's 17 months old now). She was never scared of the eyes. In fact, she loves them! She loves all the tabs, but especially the dog's ears going up and down. Overall, this is a great, engaging, fun and funny book. My only problem with it is that the tabs are really hard to pull, even for me! They take a lot of force for the pop-up parts to really pop all the way and not just sort of crack halfway through. Add to that the little hands which are pulling on the eyeballs and other moving pieces, and it's a bit of a struggle to go through the book. It will be a long while before she can pull the tabs herself! So, that I don't like.

"This is a great book for young toddlers (or even babies). It's very well designed and packs a lot, but without feeling too busy. I got it when my daughter was 12 months old, and she loved looking at all the babies. Around 14 months she became obsessed with babies, and would enjoy any image of a baby - in books, on the packet of diapers, on the wet wipes, in a magazine, just anywhere she saw babies! So she also became obsessed with this book, and has been since then (she's 17 months old now). She flips through it or brings it to me every day. I don't think it's too busy at all, at least not for her. She loves finding all the babies and looking at what they're doing. It's great how the book also shows actions, not just body parts or objects, and it has a lot of daily activities, like playing with different toys, sleeping, eating, sitting on a chair, clapping hands, etc. She loves imitating what the babies are doing, or their facial expressions, and naming the toys they're playing with (and showing me which ones she has, too). All in all, this is one of the best executed books for this age that I've seen, and it has been tremendously successful with my daughter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CWCXJ5UWXCZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0756602793#wasThisHelpful","R3CWCXJ5UWXCZP","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter loves this little book! It's one of her favorites (she's 17 months old). I can't remember when exactly she started opening the flaps on her own... Maybe around 12 months? She's dextrous though, so flaps are not a problem for her. At first she enjoyed me lifting them for her, and then she enjoyed lifting them herself, and acting surprised when she found the animal underneath. The illustrations are bright and cute, and the placement of the flaps within the illustration is very smart. The flaps close very tightly though, and need some fingernail work to get them open even for me, so that might be an issue with less dextrous children. I keep my daughter's nails juuuust a bit longer than ideal, specifically to help her work her flap books, and that helps a lot. She learned to use her nails, and can get them open on her own. She also seems to really like the size of the book. This is our only book of this size, and she loves handling it, flipping through it, hugging it and just carrying it around the house.One thing I specifically love about the illustrations is how rich they are, and how much stuff is packed in them, without making them look too busy. In a lot of baby books, the background is pretty plain, with emphasis on one or two things per page. In this book, without feeling overwhelming, you can find a lot of little things on each page. For example, there's a chicken or two somewhere on most of the pages, so we play ""find the chicken"". Or the kittens are in a basket in the closet, so you can also see shoes, slippers, a coat, etc. My daughter loves identifying the random surrounding objects on each page, like the shoes.

"This is a good, solidly made toy. I like that it's made of wood and the dyes are safe. All the parts are sanded smooth and feel safe to touch and mouth. They have a nice weight to them. The toy is quite small, but it fits my 10-month-old's hands perfectly, so I think it's the right size for her. I don't trust her not to poke her eye out on the base, so I only gave her the rings and ball for now. She absolutely loves this toy, even though she can't stack it yet. She loves handling, chewing and rolling the pieces, putting them inside containers, poking her fingers through the holes. And the red ball... Ah, the red ball. It's her most favorite toy of all time. I would've never thought she'd get so attached to a plain wooden ball!!! She carries it around everywhere, and will only give it to trusted people, and only for about 3 seconds max. She looks hilarious trying to crawl on 3 limbs because she has to hold the ball in one hand.All in all, the toy has been a total success so far. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is the price. Come oooooon... It doesn't get much simpler than this. What could possibly be worth $17.69 on this thing?!?UPDATE: My daughter is 12 months old now and the red ball from this toy is still her favorite toy ever. I don't know what kind of crack they put in it. We just celebrated her first birthday, and all the new toys ain't got nothing on the red ball! I had to hide it so she would look at the new toys. I think my baby likes the simple things in life.UPDATE #2: At 15 months she's an expert at stacking the rings on the pole. The red ball still holds a special place in her heart, though it has recently given way to a baby doll. The biggest ring fits juuuuust barely in her palm, and she insists on holding the rings in her palm and not by the edge, so I can totally see why this stacker is the size it is. I don't understand why people whine about its size. It's made for babies, after all, and needs to fit them, not you! The size is perfect. My daughter loooooves ringing this thing, dumping the rings, and then again and again. Great toy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23LRKA2KEJZ8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FZND4K#wasThisHelpful","R23LRKA2KEJZ8Y","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These overalls are adorable, soft, and generally well made. However, they're useless if the baby crawls, sits, stands or walks. In other words, if the baby is being a typical baby for the 9-12 month range. The crotch and leg buttons keep unsnapping all the way whenever the baby moves, until the pants are flapping wide open with the butt hanging out. It's really frustrating chasing the baby around the room to keep re-snapping those buttons. I really love the overalls otherwise and wish they were more appropriately designed! Zipper maybe, or regular buttons?","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQW0A5MFC560O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8GMABO#wasThisHelpful","RQW0A5MFC560O","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These booties are very soft and fluffy, and convenient to put on and take off. I was skeptical about the magnets at first, but surprisingly, the booties do stay on! I think that's more to do with the fact that my daughter doesn't pull on them though. If she really wanted to, she could take them right off, and they do occasionally come undone and slip off, so with a more active baby I don't think they'd work as well.I got the 6-12 month size when my daughter was 7 months old (average size) and the fit was fine. Roomy, but not too big. Then, when she was 10 months old, even though they still fit, I got the next size up so I could put them on top of her shoes when we go out in the winter (in the stroller or car). She was standing and trying to walk and needed soft shoes to keep her socks on, but it was too much of a hassle to put the shoes on and off to go out in the cold, so having the large booties to slip on top of the shoes has been a great solution.I wash them on cold and air dry, but still, after the first wash, they are never this soft again. Which is a shame, because they are so unbelievably soft when they're new! That's not such a big deal though. What I actually don't like about them, and the reason why I dropped one star, is because they collect dust, dirt and all kinds of grime that gets caught and balled up in the fleece and won't come out in the wash. I can't even pluck it by hand! Because of the light color, they end up looking REALLY dirty, even after being washed! It's quite gross. So I ordered them in dark brown, because I do like them, but at least the brown ones won't show when they have this non-dirty dirt on them...I also have the matching mittens (same applies to them - soft but not as soft after a wash, otherwise good mittens, light color sucks).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VMZ011U72X4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EHO4O4#wasThisHelpful","R1VMZ011U72X4D","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice light. Does the job. It's bright enough for my 15-gallon tank. The light is pretty neutral in color. Maybe a bit blue-ish, but not too much. Unlike other reviewers, I don't care that it has no switch, since I have it on a timer. My biggest problem with it is that the suction cups don't work!! I had it underwater suctioned to the wall of the tank, but it kept coming off and floating awkwardly. Then I suctioned it to the wall above the water line. Again, same problem. Though I have to say, one suction cup comes undone more often than the other. It looks pretty smooth on the inside, but maybe it does have a defect somewhere. It's incredibly frustrating that I seem to have no way of anchoring it anywhere, and it keeps floating at weird angles and illuminating the lid instead of the tank, or shining blindingly into my eyes instead.Another problem is that when I have it underwater, it's like steroids for the algae! I get ridiculous green beards on everything in the vicinity of the light! This is the first time I've ever used an underwater light, and the first time I've ever seen beardy algae of such proportions, so I'm going to assume it was the light. No algae problems when I have it up above the water line. WTF?I love the idea of an underwater light, but this just isn't working out for me. I don't mind using it above the water - I just needed something that's water safe and won't rust. But the damn thing just won't stay on!","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MMOSFFAWLD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHV8MW2#wasThisHelpful","R1MMOSFFAWLD4","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These were my baby's first shoes. She started standing when she was 8 months old and needed shoes, because her socks were constantly sliding off (and footies moved and slid around too much). I wanted the softest shoes possible, so they wouldn't limit her range of movement. For that purpose, these shoes are great! They are very soft, with a soft fabric sole that's completely flexible. They look cute and comfortable. They are very easy to put on and take off (for me... the baby hasn't figured that out yet, thanks to the ties). They even have grips on the bottom.My only complaint is that, with less than a month of wear, the grips on the bottom are already falling off, and the shoes look very worn. And that's a baby who isn't even walking yet, just standing and crawling! So, not very durable, but inexpensive enough that I ordered a couple more pairs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T9I8DSR5MY34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RV8FXGK#wasThisHelpful","R3T9I8DSR5MY34","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an awesome baby book, both in terms of content and presentation. It's my favorite, and one that I recommend to all my pregnant friends. The information is reliable and scientifically backed (something that's very important to me), but written by parents in an accessible way. It covers all the basics. I absolutely love the format, too! After some general descriptions of what's going on, it breaks down the first year into months, and each month follows the same pattern of layout - baby's physical development, emotional, social, feeding, sleep, play, etc. I love that it has a ""toys and games"" section with suggestions for age-appropriate fun. I read the whole book cover to cover while I was pregnant, to familiarize myself with what's coming, and then after the baby was born, at the end of each month I read the chapter on the upcoming month, to refresh my memory of what's immediately forthcoming.I have both the physical book and the Kindle version (there's a nice discount on one if you already have the other - I appreciate that!) I have an older Kindle model (with e-ink) and agree that the book looks pretty crappy on it. However, it's perfectly fine on the Kindle reader on the iPhone, so I just read it there when I don't have the physical book with me. No big deal, and definitely not worth dropping stars on such an otherwise awesome book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7DKT8DFO3OU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561487503#wasThisHelpful","R7DKT8DFO3OU5","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did a lot of looking, reading and comparing before settling on a baby carrier. There are so many options out there, and each lacks something. This one seemed to combine the best of all of them. And it does! I LOVE this carrier, and so do my husband and the baby! It's been one of our best investments in terms of baby gear. It's pretty much perfect. We used it daily for the first 6 months of our daughter's life. Then winter came and her bulky coat was just awkward to stuff into a carrier, and we just didn't go out for walks as much. And she got heavy. I'm looking forward to using it again in the back carry position when the weather warms up again.Here's a breakdown of what I love about it:- The baby loves it! Really, that's the most important thing :-) She'd fall asleep as soon as I put her in it, even if she started off crying. We'd call it The Magic Backpack.- The original bjorn's crotch issues have been resolved in this model. The baby is actually sitting, not just dangling.- It's very easy to use. Can be clipped/unclipped with one hand. I never unclipped the bottom pair of buckles though - it was easy enough just to undo the top ones and slide the baby in and out from the top. I could do that myself, no need for another person's help (unlike with some other carriers).- Very easy to adjust, so both my husband and I can use it with just a tug on the straps.- Safe. There's no way that it can slide off of you or that the baby can slide out while you're loading or unloading them.- Comfortable on the parent. The wide waist band is awesome! I have a bad back but this carrier was very comfortable. I could walk around for hours with the baby in it. Until she started getting heavy, then it was more like an hour... But still, given my back issues, better than expected!- Easy to wash. Just throw it in the washer, hang dry overnight.- Multiple carrying positions possible - front facing in, front facing out (!), and back.- Newborn and up, without the need of a special insert.I'm trying to think of anything I don't like about it, and I can't really... The fabric tends to attract dust and pet hair, but it's not too bad. The buckles take some finagling until you figure out how they work. I hadn't seen this kind of buckle system before. But once you figure them out, they're fine. That's it... I really really love this carrier!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB77XB561N37U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNQS6PO#wasThisHelpful","RB77XB561N37U","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this stroller. I used it almost daily all spring, summer and fall of last year, and it has held up great. It's very well built, sturdy and comfortable. It's extremely easy to steer, and moves very smoothly. Very lightweight, too, and easy to fold and unfold, though it looks smaller in the pictures when folded than in real life. I haven't had problems with the black fabric showing dust or stains. My baby has never spit up on it, so I guess it just hasn't been an issue for us. We have a cat and her white hairs are a fact of life in our house, but I haven't noticed them on the stroller (unlike the Bjorn, which attracts them like a magnet!)My favorite feature of the stroller is the fact that it reclines all the way back, creating a spacious bassinet! My daughter rode in this bassinet from birth until she could sit up, and even after that, she preferred to take her naps in the stroller with the back all the way down. She could sleep for hours like that. Now I'm looking for a more portable travel stroller, and the full recline is a must have. I don't think I'll ever buy a stroller that doesn't have that feature.We have the Graco click connect car seat that goes with this stroller. It clicks easily into the frame (the back of the stroller does not have to be reclined for that). However, we've used the car seat into the stroller maybe once or twice total. The two are too bulky together, and the car seat is unnecessary as an addition to this particular stroller, because the stroller reclines all the way back. Our baby preferred the spacious bassinet of the stroller to the cramped car seat, in which shes forced into a sitting position. Even with the car seat tilted back the way it fits into the stroller, her upper body is flat but then her feet are up in the air.I have taken the stroller out both on pavement and off-road. It's obviously not as smooth of a ride as tires, but it's not bad. My baby actually quite liked the bumpy rides, so almost all of our walks were on trails in the woods, or at least at the park, and she slept right through. On our way to the park I even started rolling her in the grass alongside the sidewalk, as opposed to the sidewalk itself, because a smoother ride would keep her awake looking around, but as soon as it got bumpy, she'd go right to sleep!There are only two things I don't like about the stroller, but neither is a big dealbreaker for me. One is that the canopy doesn't go down low enough for summer afternoons, and on top of that, the sides are mesh for some stupid reason, so the sun shines right through. So, on a hot summer day, unless the sun is directly above you, the baby will be blinded. Not very conducive to naps! The ""breathable"" mesh is completely unnecessary. No way the baby would suffocate without a ""breathable"" canopy, even if it went all the way down.The second issue I have is that on the front wheels, the part of the frame that holds the wheel is too close to the surface of the wheel tire, creating a small gap that collects fallen leaves, dirt and debris, especially after a rain. Even if you go on the sidewalk, inevitably there will be debris there. They get rolled up and stuck in that space, jamming up the whole wheel, which stops turning. It's really hard to get the debris out of there, too, and unjam the wheel. I ended up carrying a butter knife with me to poke the stuff out with. It's fine on dry days, but when the debris is wet, it sticks to the wheels and gets rolled up and collected in that gap, and is quite annoying.All in all, Im very happy with the stroller and can see us using it for a long time - birth to late toddler years. And all that at a great price, too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36S9S45FET2KF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHVR3ES#wasThisHelpful","R36S9S45FET2KF","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would've never guessed that these simple cups would be so much fun to my baby. I gave them to her when she was about 5 months old. She's 10 months old now and has loved them all the way through. They are constantly in her play area (I rotate other toys when she gets bored with them) and she plays with them every day, every time I put her down in her playpen. I just don't get it.

"This is a nice lightweight cardigan. I wouldn't call it a sweater, it's very thin. But that's what I needed it for. I use it as an underlayer when it's really cold. I'm nursing/pumping so I needed an underlayer with access to the boobs, so this has been working great for me. I'll wear it just by itself when it gets warmer. The fit is good and it looks nice. My only complaint is the buttons - they are really frustrating! Very flimsily attached, they hang loosely and dangle on just a couple of threads, like they're about to fall off. Their holes are too small for that size buttons, which, combined with the flimsy loose attachment, makes it almost impossible to put the buttons in or out of their holes!! I got so frustrated the first time that in my anger I ripped two  of the buttons out. They all need to be re-sewn and the holes need to be stretched. I can't use the sweater straight out of the box.

"We have been using this glider daily for over 9 months and it's still working perfectly fine. It's a very comfortable, sturdy, versatile glider that has been a life-saver with the baby! The cushioning is thick and comfortable, doesn't show any signs of wear or compression yet. The surface is velvety smooth and easy to clean. Rich chocolate color. It has a lot of versatility in the reclining positions, and it can lock in the position you want. When I was browsing gliders, I wasn't sure if that was all necessary, given the added cost, but people seemed to love the versatility and think it's worth the extra money. Well, it really is! I love that the seat slides forward, too, in addition to the back reclining backwards, so you can get almost horizontal on it. After all this time, the glider is still perfectly silent, which is crucial where babies are involved. I absolutely love love love this glider!There are only two things I don't like about it, but even though they are annoying, I don't think they justify knocking down a star.1. The pads on the arm rests are very flimsily attached. They wrap around and stick with velcro, and there's a flap that hangs down between the arm rest and the seat of the chair. That flap is not anchored to the seat at all, but just hangs down. What happens whenever you sit and use the arm rests, especially if you have a boppy in the chair or otherwise rub against the pads, is they rotate and the flap ends up pointing up or sideways, the velcro gets pulled apart and exposed from the spinning, it crinkles and catches your clothes or baby blanket, and because it's exposed, it feels rough on your skin if you lean your arm against the arm rest. I keep having to rotate the damn pads so the velcro and the flap point down, but it keeps shifting, because it's not actually anchored in any way. Annoying, and could've been prevented, if there was another piece of velcro holding the flap down, attached to the seat. But it's too short and won't reach, if I were to sew a piece of velcro onto it...2. A much bigger annoyance is the ottoman. I hate that ottoman!!! It glides back and forth like the chair does, which initially seems like a cool feature. But only initially. If you have your feet on it and you're trying to rock yourself back and forth in the chair, you can't really push off because it rocks back and keeps moving from under your feet. If you are holding a 20-pound baby and trying to maintain the rocking motion for any period of time, this gets really annoying! I keep having to keep one foot on the ground just so I have something solid to push off of. The ottoman sort of ""locks"" in place if you pull the footrest out, but not really. It locks only in one direction - you can't push it back, but you can still pull it forward, which means that if you bump it in the dark, it will rock forward but then on its way back will run into the stopper and make a loud clanking noise, waking the baby after all that work putting her to sleep. I wish it would just lock and stay locked without moving in any direction, or at least without clanking! The foot rest is very useful, but also annoying because it, too, makes clanking noises when you push off of it to rock the chair. Something about the construction of that ottoman and its footrest make it feel very unstable and clanky and noisy, and it annoys me daily. I'd still recommend the recliner though, because the main part of it - the actual recliner - is awesome! Just maybe get another ottoman.UPDATE: It has been a year and a half now and the glider is still doing great! We still use it daily, though now it's mostly for bedtime stories, and the occasional comforting when my daughter is having a bad night. The cushions still feel the same - no compression that I can notice. It's still silent, except for one tiny pop that happens when you shift your weight forward in preparation for getting up. But I have figured out how to avoid or at least lessen the pop. If my daughter is asleep, it doesn't seem to bother her. No other complaints, and even that is a minor one. This glider was definitely one of the best baby purchases we've made so far!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GM9TWN3SE0QE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1BV574#wasThisHelpful","R2GM9TWN3SE0QE","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the ugliest drapery material I've ever seen. It's hard and stiff, and plasticky! The material reminds me of those linoleum-like stiff plastic table covers you see in third-world countries. It looks and feels ugly, it doesn't slide over curtain rods at all, and if you want to tie it back, the bottom ends stick up stiff and look horrible. The only positive thing about it is that it does block light well. But man, is it ugly! I used it for about a year but I hate it so much that I just bought light-blocking curtains to replace it with.

"Seems like there are a lot of bad reviews for an older model of this sippy cup. The current one (as of December 2014) however is great! It doesn't leak, it's sturdy and well made, and it's easy for the baby to hold. I love that it's made from safe plastics, too! I gave it to my baby for the first time when she was 7 months old. She was very interested but couldn't quite figure out what to do with it. She'd bite the spout instead of suck it, and she held the cup with just one hand by the handle, so it was dangling awkwardly. She also hated water at that point. I took it away and waited another month. At 8 months I tried again, and to my surprise, she started sucking right away and drank her water without any grimaces, all by herself! She figured out the handles, too. After a few days of practice, she was able to grab it by both handles, lift and drink from it without assistance. So, it's been working out great for us! It's the only sippy cup we've tried so far, and it looks like it will be the only one.P.S. I got the blue, and the color is much darker than in the picture.

"These socks have weird proportions. The foot part is big, bigger than my 8-month-old's foot, but the elastic at the top is way too tight even for her, let alone a bigger 1-year-old who will have thicker legs, too. They pinch her calves so tightly that they leave deep, purple grooves. I know it's hard to make baby socks that stay on, but damn, babies need circulation in their feet, too! I ended up stretching them up to under her knees, where the leg is a little narrower, but then the heel is halfway up her calf... Grotesque socks. They should've used a wide stretchy band (like other brands of baby socks) instead of a narrow regular elastic band that cuts into the chub.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ETMQGD4ZOBWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3C62FU#wasThisHelpful","R1ETMQGD4ZOBWX","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These boots are surprisingly warm, even though the shaggy part is just at the top. The inside looks vety thin but clearly has some sort of other insulating material. They are warmer than my Tims! I love that you can get warmth without needing bulky fluff on the inside, so the shoe can remain small and elegant. I haven't worn them in snow yet, but on a 20-degree day my feet feel warm, even with just regular socks on (not thick winter socks). I can't objectively comment on the fit, because I have wide flat feet, plus I wear orthotic insoles. So in my situation I needed these shoes a size and a half larger than my usual shoe size, to accommodate the width. With other boots I only need them one size up. So I guess these are a half size smaller/narrower than other boots.The only thing I don't like about them is that the treads on the main part of the sole have a fuzzy surface, like suede, and are very slippery on smooth ground (porch, hardwood floors, tile). I've slipped and almost fallen a few times. The treads on the heel are fine (and the reason why I didn't fall after all). Very weird design choice. They are okay on pavement, but I hope the suede wears down soon so I can have more traction...","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38QD3ER5KXMWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMA2UJ8#wasThisHelpful","R38QD3ER5KXMWD","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this as an alternative to the ubiquitous giraffe, and have so far been very happy with it. It's much cuter (I think!) and the baby loves it! It's easy to hold and bite, and has enough give for younger babies (mine isn't teething yet at 8 months, but loves chewing stuff). It's easier to squeak than other squeaky toys we have, too. I love that it's made of safe materials! It's hard to find toys like that nowadays.I don't really have any complaints, just a funny sort of note The squeak hole on the belly of the zebra has a spray of pink paint on and around it, which makes it look a bit painful like her belly button got inflamed or worse - like a misplaced, inflamed anus! :-P Of course the baby doesn't care, but my husband and I can't help laughing whenever we see it.

"We don't use this at bath time (because I don't want water getting into it) but the baby still finds ways to enjoy it. It's her favorite chew toy, and she can go at it for a loooong time! It's soft and easy to hold, easy to squish, squeak and to bite. She stuffs the whole head in her mouth and chomps down, making squeaky sounds in the meantime. It looks very satisfying. She loves to hold the head and chew the body, too. I'm very happy that it's natural rubber and free of sketchy chemicals. There aren't that many toys like that around.

"We've been using this baby monitor daily for a year and a half now and love it. It's sensitive to the baby's voice, but not to other sounds in her room (for example, the white noise machine right next to the baby unit) so it doesn't get triggered by other things. Her voice comes through loud and clear. We haven't had interference or static issues at all. Haven't had to adjust frequencies either, it worked straight out of the box. I like that it has a built-in room thermometer, too. We've been using the monitor both at night and for naps, and it has been enough for us (I really don't see a need for a video monitor - this is just fine). I like that it can recharge its batteries, too.I've had a few small issues with the monitor, which have been adding up and now I'm taking off one star. One is that the halo night light button makes a VERY loud and sharp click sound when you press it to turn the light on or off, and it wakes the baby up. So that feature is useless to me, even though it would've been very convenient to have it. Also, less than a year after I bought the unit, the display stopped working. The little lights that illuminate the parts of the display started dying one by one. At first just parts of the number showing the temperature went black, but you could sort of still make out the number. Then there was no number at all. Then no more audio levels or anything else, so the display became useless. I loved the temperature display feature, because it allowed me to regulate the temperature in her room from the thermostat downstairs without going in to check a thermometer in the bedroom (our central air is wonky and it can quickly get either too cold or too hot in individual rooms). The last annoying thing is that while the parent unit is charging (which I do at night), there's no way to turn the display off but keep the unit itself on, it's always lit. It's very bright and casts too much light in our bedroom, and being that it sits right by my head, it's too bright for me to sleep. I tried taping over it, but I want to be able to see the monitor before I go to bed, and removing and replacing sticky tape every day was too much of a hassle. Even a dimming feature would've been enough, but as it is, it's too bright at night. I ended up knitting it a little hat so now it wears a hat at night :-)Overall, this is an excellent monitor that I would highly recommend. The cons are pretty minor. It served us well for a year and a half, and only now it's starting to actually degrade in quality. It recently started emitting strange staticky noises and waking me up at night, even when there's nothing going on in the baby's room. I'm considering getting another unit of this model though - that's how much I still like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NF4XH1ROY49Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FGWA8G#wasThisHelpful","R1NF4XH1ROY49Q","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to hold off on reviewing this until after we've been using it for a while, and most importantly, until after our baby has been eating solid food (I'd heard all kinds of horror stories about the smell of solid food coming out the other end) Well, it's been 8 months, and I still love it! The part about solid food was true. Impressive odors coming out of that baby! However, I haven't noticed any smell problems with the diaper pail. I don't get a whiff when I hit the foot pedal. The baby is in daycare during the week, so it takes us at least a week to fill the pail up and need to empty it, so stuff sits there for a week, with no smell problems. In 8 months there has been only one instance of smell coming out, and the whole room smelled like sh!t. Being that that was highly unusual, I opened the pail to investigate, and found that the bag had ripped and there were exposed diapers smelling up the place. I can't blame the bag though When it's late and I'm dead tired and the genie is full, the last thing I want to do is drag a heavy bag of crap out to the trash, so I stuff it and stuff it because it can always take juuuuuust one more And it seems that eventually, it ripped. So, user error. The genie and its bags have been great. It works with regular trash bags, too. It's easy to use, convenient, hasn't jammed on us yet, it's easy to empty and reload and it really does keep the diapers sealed during that process! Emptying it is a breeze and does not expose you to either the diapers or the smell. I also like that it's tall, so I don't have to bend down. We have two genies - one for downstairs, and one for upstairs, and both have been performing great. At this point I can't imagine sh!t getting any smellier, so I don't foresee any problems in the future. I can confidently declare the diaper genie a success!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33NG7D2YTCZGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HT6E6GW#wasThisHelpful","R33NG7D2YTCZGG","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The drawings are horrendous, but the baby doesn't care and loves it, so whatever that's what matters. Esthetics aside, it's a well-made book with a lot going on to keep the baby's attention.

"This Christmas tree skirt is a joke. It's not a circle, but a lumpy oval attempt at a circle. It's one single solid piece and doesn't have the side and center cut like it is in the image, so out of the bag it cannot be used for the purpose it was intended for, unless you cut it yourself. Worst of all, it's so thin that you can literally see through it. I can see the floorboards through it when I put it down. It's not expensive, but it's not worth even that kind of price, so I can't even settle for ""you get what you pay for"". I can get a LOT of loose fleece fabric of much better quality for this price, and it will take me about 2 minutes to cut it.The only redeeming quality of the whole exchange was that the seller (BEGUM9) was great about it.

"This is not just a hoodie - it's a heavy winter coat, very thick, and hopefully very warm! It seems sturdy and well made. I washed it in cold water, tumble dry low, and it came out fine. For some reason I thought the outside was knit probably because of the pattern, and the picture on Amazon is very grainy and low-res and hard to see. It's not knit, the pattern is printed on the smooth surface. It looks a bit odd, but also like it was intentional. I don't really care, it looks nice. I got the green color and it looks very cute and cozy. It took a while to arrive because it comes from China, but I bought it ahead of time so that was okay. It came with the tags cut, which was very sketchy Just the plastic string thing dangling and no tag hanging from it but whatever.My only real complaint is that the hood is absolutely useless. It's so small that it can't even reach up to the baby's head, let alone actually cover it in any way! The rest of the jacket fits fine for the size baby it was meant for, but the hood *might* fit on my cat's head, maybe. So it just hangs around the baby's neck uselessly and is a bulky dead weight that looks (and probably feels) uncomfortable when the baby is leaning back against the stroller or car seat back, and this thing is bunched up behind her neck If you're gonna do a hood, do it well or not at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDPGCVGMD6KYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVCV6CY#wasThisHelpful","RDPGCVGMD6KYN","A1QG1UIWO4UGHL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QG1UIWO4UGHL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I didn't want to spend a fortune on guest slippers, and I thought well, how bad can they be Well, quite bad, it turns out! The worst part about these cheap slippers is that they are dangerous! The underside of the sole is incredibly slippery and just does not work on smooth, hard surfaces like tile - you'll be sliding around like you're on ice. So don't go into your kitchen or bathroom wearing these. Hardwood floors are marginally better, though still quite bad. Our stairwell is uncovered wood and I'm just plain afraid to go down the stairs wearing these. They are also very thin overall, and the inside compresses so much that after just a few weeks of occasional wear, you can feel the texture of the rubber sole through the inside of the slipper! They are wide, flat and uncomfortable. They also collect dust, dirt and hair like crazy and are a pain to clean, because everything sticks to them. I even tried vacuuming them but even that didn't clean them completely, so they look horrible.

You would be surprised how hard it is to find a blazer of quality that doesn't cost a fortune that can be machine washed.  I paid more for blazers not as nice as this one. This one is can go from wearing it as part of a uniform to jeans and a tank. It looks great with slacks or skirts or over dress.  I was nervous about what size to order because I wear an 8-10 but in tops and jackets I have to try it on because I have a large chest. Sometimes ordering up in size means the sleeves are too long.

After I washed them before using them they were even softer.  The color did not fade when I washed them.  They stayed a really dark black color.  These are really nice sheets.  I have bought a lot of sheets trying to find the perfect ones for my bed.  I have many sheet sets that claim they are California king size that are clearly not because they are ill fitting.  I have some that claim to be deep pockets that are a struggle to get on the mattress.  These are properly sized for my bed, they were California king and deep pocket.  They fit perfectly.  The fitted sheet didn't ride up and off the mattress while sleeping and moving around the bed.  They felt soft and silky and luxurious and cozy.  I'm just thrilled with them and plan to purchase more.  I want to mention that I received the wrong size to began with but the seller paid the shipping to have them returned to them and immediately sent me the correct size.

" 3:54 MinsI am obsessed with essential oil diffusers and essential oils.  I have asthma and allergies and I have been dealing with a respiratory illness for months so I run my diffusers literally 24 hours a day to breathe.  My goal is to have a diffuser(s) in every room of the house.  I already have them in his office at work and it's been a hit there too.  He comes home with questions from co-workers for me about the diffuser and essentials oils and their use.  This diffuser is a nice one.  It's great quality.  It put out a good deal of mist.  It runs about 4 hours and the blue color light is so soothing and beautiful.  This one doesn't have a mist option to run it intermittently.  This is fine with me because I run my on constant mode at home. My boyfriend runs the one he has in his office on intermittent mode because it will last for 8 hours and he doesn't have to think about it and refill it during the day especially since he may not have a moment to do it. He sets it up at the end of each work day so all he has to do is turn it on in the morning and forget about it.  So it's just a matter of preference.  This diffuser does have lighting options. You press the power button once to turn on the diffuser with light, once more to turn off light and mist continues, once more to turn off completely.  This one is also electric and I like that the power cord unplugs from the diffuser.  It makes it easier to transfer and clean.  To clean use a q-tip to wipe the sensor and the mist path and spout.  I purchased my diffuser at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FVNR0DBVLO11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXZ4IIM#wasThisHelpful","R3FVNR0DBVLO11","A36LXYBEF7ZWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LXYBEF7ZWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:06 MinsI love having a hands free automatic soap dispenser for my kitchen sink.  When I am working with poultry and other raw meats I want to touch as little surfaces as possible to prevent cross contamination or the transfer bacteria.  This is a sanitary option.  The dispenser is easy to operate.  It takes 4 AA batteries, not included.  There is a cap on top that you turn counter-clockwise and fill with your favorite soap, lotion, shampoo, etc.  Press and hold the power button (on top) down for 3 seconds to turn on.  Hold your hand under the dispenser and the motion sensor will activate dispensing the liquid.  It will dispense for 1.5 seconds, if you want more soap at a time, press the power button a second time to dispense 2 seconds, a third time to dispense 2.5 second, and a fourth time to change back to 1.5 seconds.  It's recommended not to immerse in water or use in direct contact, so if you use it in the shower I would set it on the side where the shower curtain could shield it.  You don't want water to get into the battery compartment.  I put the batteries in wrong to begin with so I had to flip it upside down to change the batteries after I had fill it with soap.  Because of this I found out that the soap does NOT leak out when you have to change the batteries.  Also it says not to fill it more than 90 percent full, I guess you need a little air space inside.  I noticed that the soap expanded after using it a couple times. so it appeared to be 100 percent full.

" 3:47 MinsI so needed this shiatsu massage pillow.  Most ""shiatsu massage"" gadgets I have tried have been a real let down.  Either they are not very powerful or they just don't hit the spot.  This pillow is fantastic.  The massage nodes are on a v-spring and really wrap around your muscles.  And powerful? The nodes really work your muscles deeply and intensely. I was actually sore a couple of days after using it.  It worked some knots and tension out of muscles that I didn't realize were that tight before using the pillow.  I carry a lot of tension in my back and neck and don't realize it sometimes how extreme I do so unless my boyfriend touches my neck or back and comments on it.  And the few times I've had a deep tissue massage the therapists always comment on it.  I use this pillow starting at the bottom of my back and work up to my neck and by then I am so relaxed.  I also used it on my legs and arms.  This pillow really is multi-functional with the designed allowing you to use it on many different and varied parts of your body.  And the heat option is awesome, I like to use it with heat the best.  When you press the power button once the nodes will operate with heat, press a second time to turn off the heat, and hold it down for 3 seconds and it will turn off.  When activated the pillow will massage for 20 minutes (the recommended limit per section of your body) then turn off. This is also a safety mechanism in case you forget to turn it off.  The nodes are covered by a soft mesh like material and by a button flap of the same red leatherette of the pillow.  Leave the flap down, covering the mesh and nodes for a less intense massage, lift it to expose the mesh covered node for a stronger more intense experience.  I would recommend the first time to leave the flap down if you are not used to it unless you want to be sore like I was after my first use.  When not using for massage you can turn it around so the cushion side is facing you and use it as a lumbar support cushion or to look pretty on your couch, chair, or in your car.  It comes with an electrical plug and a car charger plug in.  Please heed health warnings and don't use if you have a pacemaker, if you are diabetic, at risk for clots, have phlebitis, thrombosis, or any circulatory problem.  And don't use on any part of your body that has plates, screws, or any type of reconstructive surgery.  I can't use it on my left leg because of reconstruction of my knee, and all the screws.  If your not sure if you can use it ask your doctor.

"These kitty cat ears are adorable.  I ordered them for Halloween options but they are so cute you can wear them anywhere. I see them worn everywhere all the time, it's the fashion.  They are a lot of fun and everyone likes them even animals.  I had a friends dog that is mesmerized by them.  He seems to think I'm an animal too when I have them on.  LOL.  The headband is very flexible and comfortable and the ears are constructed out of bendable wire  with the band and ears covered with a soft sheer black shimmery lace.  If the ears get bent, they are easily reshaped.  The ears are about two inches tall and since they are bendable you can form them into any shape you want.

"These are great for taking your lunch to work or school, packing snacks, or freezing meals.  There are 8 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 2 inches deep.  There are 2 compartments, the large holds up to 2 cups (16 ounces) and the smaller compartment holds up to 1 cup (8 ounces).  If you portion control your food, meal prep containers are the way to go.  I have the 3 compartment containers too.  The two compartment containers feel a little sturdier and not as bendy because of it only having two sections (more sections  more bendy).  Because of the design and color these look a lot like take out containers but they are a thicker more durable plastic than disposable one time use containers.  These you can use over and over for some time before needing to replace.  The plastic is BPA free and is safe for the microwave, dishwasher, and freezer. And the lids seal with no leakage so far.  We use them for ready-made healthy snacks to grab and go, and for pre made meals.  I like to cook in the slow cooker, make large pots of pasta, stuffed peppers, meals that are hard to make for just the two of you.  This way I can make up meals from the leftovers and freeze to take to lunch or for dinner when I dont have time or feel like cooking.

"These jeans are fabulous!  I love the sparkly bling ""V O"" on the band on the back.  I love the crystal trim on the pockets and the chain and leather braiding on the pockets and the white stitching detail..  I read all the reviews and recommendations for sizing and the seller's recommendations and size chart.  These are junior sizes and Asian sizes on top of that so they are going to run small.  I wear an 8-10 at the moment so taking everything into consideration I ordered the 13 and they fit like a glove.  So don't be vain and insist on getting the size you usually wear, or you will end up with cute jeans you can't wear.  It's all just a number, what's important is that you feel good in them and like the way you look (beautiful).  These jeans are skinny jeans and the cut and design of these really accentuate your butt.  They are pretty sexy looking.  I've worn them with just a tank or t-shirt and I've worn them with boots.  I went to an animal park and wore them with boots and a top and jeans jacket and they looked awesome. I had good range of movement in them.  I was able to bend and squat petting baby animals.  They were very comfortable all day which included a three hour ride back home.

"I love this halter babydoll nightie.  It is so sexy and seductive.  I love the sheer slinky fabric of the skirt.  It is soft and feels wonderful and sensual against your skin.  The skirt is stretchy, flowy,  and airy.  The bodice is a sheer lace that is stretchy and soft and has some ribbon embellishments.  The lingerie is well constructed of quality materials and is very flattering to the female figure.  The top ties behind your neck like a halter and which always looks great on large busted women.  I wear size medium or size 8 to 10 in pants at the moment and a medium or large in a top depending on the style. Button up tops can be a real problem. It's hard to find one that fits without pins to keep it from gaping in the breast area. I am 34DD sometimes 34DDD and when buying lingerie, it is difficult to find something sexy that fits through the chest and that is not too big everywhere else. So taking this in consideration and looking at some other similar styles and recommendations, I went a full two sizes up from the chart and ordered size XL.  It is a little large so I could have worn a size L and still had enough coverage in the breast.  But because of the style, tying the top and the flowy skirt a little large is not a problem.

"I wish I had these a few weeks ago when my ice maker decided to quit working.  Living in a large apartment complex it took a week for them to get to me to repair it since it wasn't an emergency, then they ended up having to replace it.  I long ago lost track of my spare ice trays while moving so I was filling up my ice spheres constantly make sure there was enough ice for everyone.  These ice cube trays are larger than traditional cube trays.  Each cube is 2 inches square and there are six cubes to a tray.  You get two trays.  The trays are made of a soft, flexible silicone that has enough stiffness to give it structure without collapsing and that is BPA free.  These ice trays are useful not just for ice but if you make your own soaps or candles these are the perfect mold for them.  Or for kitchen use, you can also use them to freeze broth, herbs, soup, baby food, fruit, to mold candy, chocolate, jello, etc.  When you need to clean them just throw them in the top rack of your dishwasher.  I'm going to try one of the ideas listed for freezing essential oils in water to put in your shower.

"This satin lingerie nightgown is so pretty and sexy.  I got the blue and it is such a gorgeous rich royal blue.  The satin is so soft and it has some stretch to it that makes it cling and mold to your body while at the same being kind of slinky.  The lace and ribbon detail and trim is also very soft and stretchy.  I am so glad it is not scratchy lace, I have bought a lot of expensive lingerie in the past that had rough and scratchy material and trim and it ended up in the back of the dresser never being worn because of it.  This little nightie is comfortable while still looking glamorous.  The color I got is very flattering to any skin tone.  Right now I wear size medium or size 8 to 10 in pants and a medium or large in a top depending on the style. Button up tops can be a real problem.

It is a little large so I could have worn a size L and still had enough coverage in the breast.  The top can be fastened a few different ways.  My two favorite ways are either to tie the straps behind my neck like a halter or to crisscross them in the back and tie them to the two little rings at the top of the skirt in the back.  You could just tie them to the two rings without crisscrossing but I think its more flattering and sexy crossed. I plan on purchasing some of the other colors.

"This leisure men's belt is made from a single piece of genuine cowhide leather and is very nice quality.  The leather has a fine texture to it and smells wonderful. I love the smell of leather, it is a smell of luxury to me. The buckle is an alloy metal that is silver and black with smooth and textured finishes that is quite attractive.  This belt does not have a typical hole and pin buckle, this one has a ratchet design buckle.  You slide the belt through the buckle and when you clamp the buckle down it grips the grooves of a rubber strip that is sewn into the back of the belt.  It has lever on the side of the buckle to release.  This type of belt makes it really easy to adjust to the size you need because you don't have to punch new holes in your belt.  You can still trim this belt if you need to by removing the buckle.  There is a small square clasp at the base of the buckle that has teeth that holds the leather belt in the buckle.  Pry it open and pull out the belt, trim the belt, and reattach the buckle securing the toothed clasp back into the leather by pressing tightly closed.  The belt that I received was 48 inches and came in a nice gift box,  This belt looks great the dress pants or to dress up jeans.

"I got this for my boyfriend because he has thick coarse hair and occasionally gets ingrown hairs.  We had some mixed feelings about the oil.  First the bottle had a small amount of leakage in the bag when it arrived but upon close inspection it appeared to be sealed securely.  I had to peel the safety seal off and the bottle looked full so that was a little bit of a mystery.  Second, the oil smells good, it has a manly smell.  I would have thought the lavender essential oil would make it smell too feminine but the black pepper essential oil give it a kick and the lemon essential oil gives it some citrus.  The spearmint gives it a little bit of a cooling scent and feel.  It also has juniper berry all in a carrier oil.  The first he used it, he didn't have his glasses so he didn't read the bottle that tells you to apply a small amount to your face under a coat of shave gel / cream.  Well he put it on his face as if this was all he needed to shave, in other words, he put a lot on his face.  We he came and told me he couldn't get it to rinse off, that it was like a thick film and that he then got it in his eyes trying to scrub it off in the shower, I thought that this must be a terrible product.  But then after questioning him and finding out what he did I had to laugh, especially since he didn't blind himself.  Now he does it properly and is happy with it's performance, and the way his face is moisturized and soft afterwards without being oily or filmy.  He's neutral on the smell.  Also this would be better dispensed with a pump bottle.  It would be more convenient and less messy since your are using both hands.  That will teach him though not to read directions in the future.

"This pack of 10 marshmallow roasting forks are perfect for making smores with the family.  I grew up having bonfires and weeny roasts every year for my and my sister's birthday.  These would have come in handy back then.  Anyone else remember improvising with wire hangers?  With ten there is enough for a party.  We still like to do the bonfire weeny roast, fire pit smores, and campfires.  Each roasting fork is lightweight and almost 2 feet long which is long enough to keep little ones from being so close with supervision and to keep yourself from getting burned.  The wood handles protect your hands from getting burned holding a metal rod.  The handles are ridges to make it a little easier and more comfortable to hold onto and come in several attractive rustic stained colors.  Don't forget to take off the protective rubber tips before using unless you want melted plastic in your smores.  The forks come in a handy storage bag.

"This is such an ingenious idea. Making exercise into a dice game makes exercise fun and challenging.  Each workout is different because it all depends on the roll of the dice.  I got the beginner's quick sweat dice set in the velvet drawstring bag. This exercise idea was developed by a military fitness expert for his mother who had cancer and was a fitness lover and wanted to continue to exercise and needed help with ideas of exercises that were portable and required no equipment.  I love the dice because they take up no room, you can them anywhere for a workout at anytime.  There are six color coded dice. The set I have is normal difficulty.  The white dice is the repetition, the red is for core exercises, the green is for chest exercises, the orange is for arm exercises, the yellow is for leg exercises, and the blue is for cardio.  You can play by yourself or challenge someone.  It's really a lot of fun and challenging yourself or someone else makes it into game so you don't think about it being work especially since no two workouts are alike.  None of the exercises require any equipment and you get instructions how to find the website for video demonstrations of all the exercises.

"How convenient is this applicator?  This lavender balm comes in an applicator like a stick of deodorant for easy application with no mess.  Instead of oils or liquid or creams and lotions it's a solid stick that you just swipe across your skin then rub in and it absorbs quickly.  The balm itself consist of 100% organic beeswax and three different types of lavender essential oils.  The three different types of lavender essential oils are Lavendula L (Spanish), English lavender, and French lavender. The combination of the different varieties of lavender results in a spicy, smokey, sweet aroma.  It's a relaxing and calming scent.  I like to put some on the balm on my legs and arms and feet before bed to help me relax.  It's good for massage or soothing skin irritations and dryness.  The price seems a little high but  a little goes a long way so the stick should last a while depending on how often and how much surface you cover.

"I have really dry skin and sensitive skin so I can't use a lot of products on it.  I also spend a lot of time outdoors hiking and other activities and even though I use sunscreen religiously I am still seeing some sun damage in the form of sun spots and discoloration.  This scrub is a micro-scrub.  The grains are very fine in a creamy base and really gets down in my pores for a deep clean without over drying or irritating my skin.  I use it two to three times a week to exfoliate and deep clean.  My skin always looks fresh and bright afterwards and the pores are nice and clear (really gets those blackheads) and my sun spots and discoloration on my face and neck have lightened significantly.  The texture and tone of my skin looks good.  The jar has about 2-3 ounces of a minty green colored scrub and smells like a typical cleanser.  It doesn't take much and a little goes a long way.

"I remember growing up my father and grandparents using coal tar shampoo and how bad it smelled not only while it was being used but afterwards too when it dried you could still smell it on the hair and skin.  It was so harsh.  This coal tar shampoo has a strong smell but it's nothing like that.  And  the smell doesn't linger on the hair and skin when your hair is dry.  It's probably because of the lemon, cypress, rosemary, and basil essential oils in it.  Also it's not as harsh.  Because of the addition of jojoba and argon oils it makes my hair feel extra lustrous and thick.  It helps my dry itchy scalp and when I use it I can go longer in between washes.  I color my grey hair and it has not strip any color.  My fella uses it for dandruff.  At first he didn't care for the smell but now he says he actually likes it.  He loves what it does for him and has declare it his favorite shampoo so we will definitely be buying more when this runs out.

"This novelty cupcake soap is so pretty and cute.  I took it out the box and unwrapped it from the tissue paper and felt like I was looking at a real cupcake from a bakery.  A lot of work went into making this cupcake soap look so scrumptious.  I got the guava tangerine cupcake soap and it smells heavenly.  It has the zesty scent of tangerine combined with the sweet scent of guava, mango, passion fruit, and acai berry. From the swirl of the icing to the cupcake liner to the realistic tangerine slice on top with a sprinkle of glitter it looks good enough to eat.  It's pretty enough to give as a gift or keep for yourself.  You can use it as decoration or if you can make yourself use such a pretty soap the great thing about this soap is you can actually use it. The difference in this soap and your typical novelty soap is this one has some great ingredients like coconut oil, palm fruit oil, safflower seed oil, and olive oil, oat protein, and some essential oils to nourish your skin.  And it's kosher and vegan. I would love to collect all the different cupcakes, they would be adorable displayed on a cake plate or cupcake stand.

"I was right in the middle of a really bad episode of razor bumps and irritation.  I made the mistake of using a dull razor to shave my bikini zone then throwing on shorts and going hiking for a day.  It was the next day that was torture. I usually use a cream made for the bikini zone to keep this from occurring but I was out.  By the third day the hair removal serum arrived.  I was afraid to apply it at first because I was afraid it would burn and sting but surprisingly it was instead cooling and soothing and I immediately felt some sort of relief.  I applied it a couple of times throughout the day in addition to after coming out of the shower and within 24 hours it was almost cleared up and within 48 hours it was pretty much normal again.  I love the all natural ingredients and essential and carrier oils in this serum.  I also appreciated that it has no perfumes, dyes, or chemicals.  The only scent is from the natural ingredients.  The only thing I would change is the description.  It is a serum, a liquid, not a cream.  It goes on like an aftershave, so it's easiest to pour a little in your hand and rub your hands together and pat onto skin or use a cotton round or ball.  But it really does work.

"This cordyceps mushroom extract powder is hot water extracted from organic cordyceps militaris mushrooms. Cordyeps milatris is a fungus that has been long known to grow on caterpillars in the high mountain regions of China.  The fungus basically invades the hosts body eventually killing it as it turns it into the biomass it needs to grow.  The cordyceps mushroom has been used in Tibetan and Chinese medicine for centuries most notably as an aphrodisiac and for stamina.  It's believed to have immune boosting properties and has been used to treat cough and respiratory problems, night time urination, male sexual problems, and improved renal function, anemia, liver function, stamina, improve athletic performance, and to reduce the effects of aging.  It's even believed to have anticancer properties.  Most people use it to enhance their stamina, increase energy, and reduce fatigue in place of caffeine.  Me personally I like it mixed in my decaf coffee with cream (it give it a rich full taste and texture) or mixed in a smoothie.  The actual taste of the powder doesn't change the taste of my drinks because it's pretty neutral.  I have more energy but it's a sustained, level energy when I take it without dips allowing me to feel focused throughout the day.

"Having been born and raised in the south I have tons of cast iron cookware, 5 skillets alone.  Anyone with cast iron knows that you can't just use anything to clean your cast iron without stripping it of it's seasoning because then you have to season it all over again.  This chain mail cast iron cleaner solves that problem.  It is made of high quality 316L stainless steel that is strong, durable, and doesn't bend.  It's well constructed and shouldn't fall apart.  It scrubs your cast iron skillet removing any stuck on food like nobody's business.  I was really impressed with it.  The links are smooth so it doesn't scratch or cut your hands when using and they say you can use it on other cookware too like stainless steel, copper, and glass. So far I've just been using it exclusively for my cast iron and I know it works on that.  It's an extra large size (7 inch x 7 inch) giving you ample chain to hold onto.  It came with a suction hook to hang to store.  The hook holds good on a tile surface or something similar.  I wanted to hang mine on the inside of the door under my sink but I couldn't get it to stay long on the painted wood surface especially opening and closing the door which caused the cleaner and fall. But that doesn't change how I feel about the cleaner.

Instead it's very feminine and elegant. I love the engravings on the inside of the ring.  It has the words Truly Madly Deeply engraved along with the knot symbol.  The ring is waterproof and hypoallergenic.  I like having an alternative to wear during hiking or outdoor activities, exercise, or anytime I don't want to take a risk of losing or damaging my ring.

"This mandoline slicer has the sharpest blades of any mandoline slicer I have ever owned.  I was kind of nervous that I was going to lose a finger or cut myself changing out the blade inserts until I got the hang of it.  It's easy to pop a guide insert out and a new one in if you do it with the mandoline sitting flat on your counter, not so easy if you are holding the mandoline at an angle in your hands.  The food safety holder is large enough and deep enough to hold your vegetable or fruit to slice without it constantly flying off.  And the safety holder completely guards my fingers and hand.  I'm so accident prone though that I wear my cutting gloves handling the blades and inserts with blades.  There are 5 inserts, 3 slicing guides and 2 julienne.  The slicing inserts are 1.5 mm (1/16 inch) thickness, 2.5 mm (1/12 inch) thickness, and 3.5 mm (1/8 inch) thickness and the julienne inserts are 7 mm (1/4 inch) thickness and 3.5 mm (1/8 inch) thickness.  Like I said above the blades are really sharp and slice easily through fruit and vegetables.  I have used it on potatoes, cucumber, carrots, tomatoes, squash, zuchinni, and an onion so far without issues.  You are going to have a small piece of whatever you are slicing left that won't slice all the way because of the holder spikes and the large diameter of the holder but it's to be expected and is no big deal.  There is a storage holder included for your inserts to keep them organized and in one place.

"When I first opened it I thought oh no it's hardened.  But the letter from the seller said this would be the case because there are no emulsifiers, binders or stabilizers used so the sugar would settle to the bottom with the oils sitting on top.

"My sweetie is self conscious about his receding hair line.  I would love him and still find him sexy if he was bald but I want him to feel good about himself.  He has been using this for the past thirty days and every time I ask him if he can see or feel a difference he says no.  I was all ready to totally write this product off.  Then I remembered I took pictures the first day he started using the treatment and thought what the heck, let's take progress pictures today.  I didn't expect to see any difference so I was surprised at what we saw.  This is why it is so important to take progress pictures for something like this.  His hair looks thicker and you can clearly see the new little hairs where previously there were none.  The change was so slow (over a month's time) and subtle that we didn't realize it was happening.  Think about it, you are growing new hair.  You are not going to wake up with a inch of hair overnight.  It's got to start at the root, a root that has been inactive.  His existing hair is clearly thicker and stronger with less loss too.  I hope the progress continues and that it doesn't just stay baby hair.  The bottle is a three month supply so time (and progress photos) will tell.  He sprays it on his scalp after showering and rubs it in.  It has absolutely no smell and has not caused him any headaches or other side effects.

"This all natural organic foaming face wash does a good job of deep cleaning your pores.  It is not oily at all and your face feels clean with no residue.

"I am such a fan of chalkboard labels. They are economical and cut down on waste.  You can re-use them over and over again.  Once you stick them on a non porous surface they are dishwasher and refrigerator safe.  When you are ready to remove them they peel off fairly easily. You can write on them with regular chalk or liquid chalk markers, erase with a damp cloth, and write on them again.

There are five lids in the set and the sizes are extra large: 11.75"", large: 10.25"", medium: 8"", small: 6"" and extra small: 4"" .  They are great for bowls, cups, pots, pan, plates, pie plates, etc.  They are flexible and when you put them on a plate, bowl, pan, etc. they create a suction (think suction cups) and form a watertight and airtight seal.  They are made from a heat resistant silicone (up to 425F)  and with the seal they form it makes them ideal for the microwave, baking, or on the stove.  You can also put them in the fridge or freezer because they can withstand as low as -40F and since they seal airtight you shouldn't get any frostbite on your food in the fridge.

" 1:22 MinsI love this little solar lantern.  We hike, camp,  and do a lot of outdoor activities and this is a cool little lantern to have when you are out after dark. It has a solar panel on the top of the lantern and charges from completely dead in about 8 hours, less if not dead.  You can charge in full sun or incandescent light.  A full charge will last approximately 12 hours.  There is a light indicator on the solar panel to let you know how much charge you have left.  The red power button on top when depressed once will turn the lantern on low, a second time will switch to high, and a third time will switch to flashing mode.  Depress once more to turn off.  The lantern in made of a tough clear pvc that is durable and can take the outdoors environment.  It pretty neat to use at the pool, fishing, camping, or hiking or even in the home or on the patio or balconey.  It is compact (3.9"" x 3.9"") and since its solar it is light weight and takes up little space in your backpack and adds little weight at 3.2 ounces. It stores flat and compressed and to inflate it takes about three exhales on into the valve.  It has a handle on each end to hold or you can hang it.  I would be careful about using it in a really windy environment without securing it because of it's lightweight.

"These tattoos are really nice.  They are easy to apply. After removing plastic seal place the tattoo on clean dry skin (make sure there is no lotion or oils on the skin), press a damp sponge or cloth to back of tattoo evenly for 30 seconds.  Let air dry before touching.  They last a good while without flaking.  When you are ready to remove, apply some oil (does not matter what kind, baby oil, coconut oil, olive oil, etc), let it absorb and soften for a couple minutes then rub off.  It will come off with out with feeling like you are removing several layers of skin like some temporary tattoos.  If you allergic to adhesives do not use these tattoos, and don't apply to sensitive skin.  The tattoos look great on, they are slick and shiny and look expensive.  These are high quality and are great for adults as well as kids. I think my personal favorites are the bear paws and koi fish.  The kids love them especially the bears and super heros.

"I have suffered from depression along with panic disorder and anxiety for practically all my life. I took medication for so many years and a few months ago completely weaned myself off all medication and have tried to go completely natural and holistic and meditative. It's a struggle and I can't tell you how glad I am to have received this cd. It helps me so much. I alternate listening to this cd on a nightly basis with the cd for overcoming anxiety and panic attacks. Mark Bowden's voice is very calming and soothing and he knows what he is doing. I feel like it has helped me with depression.  I sleep better and deeper after listening to the cd and I'm more focused and productive the next day. My boyfriend even commented on the difference. I had him listen to it and he said it helped him relax and he slept so deeply afterwards. Now he listens to it regularly too. The cd has three parts. The first part is the introduction that explains why we have feelings of depression and how hypnosis works and helps. The second part is the hypnosis session for daytime and the third part is the hypnosis session for nighttime. I downloaded the free mp3 versions to my phone so I have access to them at all times and to my computer and tablet. I recommend this cd to anyone who struggles with depression.

" 1:22 MinsThe first one I received leaked causing the housing where you plug it in to corrode and you couldn't smell the essential oils.  I contacted the seller hoping it was just a defect or maybe had been damaged in transit causing these problems.  They sent me a new one and what a difference!  I had a completely different experience with this one.  It doesn't leak, I can smell the essential oils.  The air smells and feels clean and fresh in my room.  I am so glad.  I got this because of my asthma and because I have had a respiratory infection for the last couple of months that I just cannot kick making it so hard for me to breath especially at night.  I can't tell you how much better I can breathe since night one of receiving the replacement purifier.  I have this right beside my bed and the soft blue light and the waterfall effect of the water is so soothing and relaxing.  I really love this little diffuser / humidifier / purifier.  It cleans the dust, allergens, and pollutants from the air.  It's easy to operate, twist the top half clockwise and lift off, fill with water to max line, add a few drops of essential if you want, put top back on and twist counter clockwise to lock back into place, plug cord into usb port, press down on blue triangle on top of unit and it will start (press again to stop).

"These herb scissors are cool.  I have been wanting a pair of them for a long time.  They make quick work of chopping herbs and other greens.  I'm used to chopping with a knife and sometimes the particular herb you are trying to cut has such a high moisture content that the knife kind of squash it and makes a wet mush.  And maybe I'm not ready for all the herby goodness to be extracted yet.  These scissors seems to solve that problem, by applying blades from both sides it makes a cleaner cut on delicate herbs and greens.  I say greens because it also does a good job making chopped spinach, kale, turnips, collards, cabbage for coleslaw, shredded lettuce, etc. The scissors come with a cleaning comb.  I also appreciated the bonus mini scissors with guard that was included. Perfect for loose strings and sewing kit.

"This is not an in depth book with amazing detailed stories of survivors.  It's more like an overview you would read on wikipedia or a student's essay or book report.  It's fine if you know nothing about Auschwitz and the terrible crimes committed there during one of the darkest times during human history.  It will make you want to read and research more to learn about the history.  It has a few anecdotes that are interesting but the author is detached and seems to just be reciting and stating facts or information he appears to have read himself elsewhere.  It just seems to skim the surface without ever delving deeper into the human emotion and experiences of the time.  The grammar is basic and a lot of times redundant as if the author is just look for phrases to fill space and increase word count.  It seems disrespectful to write a ""book"" on such a subject as devastating as the holocaust just for the sake of writing a book to capitalize off such a tragedy and making profit.

"I got Tender Sprouts organic zinc oxide sunscreen not just for the kids but for the adults also.  I prefer to use organic and chemical free products and this sunscreen is just that.  It only has six ingredients, zinc oxide 25% (non-nano), eldorado springs artesian spring water, certified organic extra virgin olive oil, cerified organic beeswax, vegetable vitamin e (non-gmo from sunflower),and cholecalciferol (vitamin d3).  It has a thick creamy consistency that is white in color.  Apparently, and I just learned this myself, you should not rub zinc oxide sunscreen into the skin to the point that the ""white"" is gone because then you have rubbed off all the protection.  It's supposed to still look somewhat white.  This sunscreen has an spf of 35 and it has some pretty good staying power on the skin, however as with any sunscreen it should be reapplied after swimming, excess sweating, after any excessive rubbing, and at least every two hours.  We really like this sunscreen and how well it protects and especially how safe it is for us.

"I really like this pilates mini exercise ball. I like the material it is made of, a durable and strong pvc material that has a soft grippy texture.  The grippy texture helps you have control of the ball.  It's easy to control with contact with body contact because it's not slippery.  Because it's not stable it forces you to use your core muscles to stay steady in turn strengthening your muscles and improving your balance.  It does take some finesse to blow up using a straw and plug.  I placed the plug tip right at the edge of the hole and did a quick fluid transfer of straw to plug.  It took a few tries to get my technique down but I finally got it plugged at the inflation level I wanted.  The reason for the plug instead of a valve is it can handle the pressure and weight put on it through exercise and our bodies.

"I love this yoga mat by Simply Color.  It's made out of one hundred percent organic cotton and has a very zen earthy feel and look to it.  It is very roomy at twenty five inches long and six inches in diameter.  It is roomy enough to accommodate a variety of sizes of yoga, pilates, or fitness mats.  And there is enough room left over to fit a towel and or change of clothes.  There is a inner pocket large enough for my phone and keys with room to spare.  It's very well constructed out of quality materials and should last a long time.  It feels very durable.  I like the solid black color with the complimentary blue and white leaf print on the ends.

"This is a good value for reusable bento style meal prep containers.  Each container has three compartments, two 8 ounce and one sixteen ounce size compartments.  This is great for portion control if you are dieting or just trying to eat healthy. The lid fits on the bottom in a way that totally separates each compartment from each other so your food doesn't cross mix or contaminate.  The plastic is BPA free and is safe for the microwave, dishwasher, and freezer.  The only thing I would be careful about putting in it and carrying would be heavy, soup, or foods without at lot of liquid because it has some bend to it and doesn't seal tight enough to keep it from leaking if it gets tipped in transfer or travel.

I wear gloves like this under my outdoor gloves during winter. These will get a lot of use. Packing says 100% copper infused material, I saw another brand that said 88% at a local store. I can not say if the copper is doing anything but we have used copper socks in the past that help with foot odor so at least these shouldn't get stinky between washes.

The click is after you come to the edge of your zip and pull it just past closed. You can turn the bag upside down with no leaking.

"These are just like dish washing or laundry pods. They dissolve in water. Nice that they are pre measured be cone in a resealable tub. To use in laundry you throw it directly in with the clothes, best after 5 minutes of washing. I only tried this with towels, I can't see me using these for laundry with any color in it. I am use to putting a small amount in the soap compartment when needed so it pre diluted before it hits my clothes. Nice for sanitizing empty washer though. I can see using these for travel and for people that still go to the laundry mat, no liquids to spill. One pack to one gallon water for mopping and cleaning. I will probably continue using liquid bleach, but these do have their uses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MYHATKMZXOA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EVP32S#wasThisHelpful","R2MYHATKMZXOA7","A1B6O7SAIYG2N0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6O7SAIYG2N0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are using these breath drops on a 17 year old lapdog with bad teeth. He needs them removed but vet said might be dangerous putting him under with his issues. We had to start out at just one drop at first because he would sniff the water and walk away. He had since either gotten use to it or doesn't care anymore, and we can do the three drops per bottle of water. Even though it can't fix his issue, it has made a difference with his mouth odor. When he pants you can get a whiff of the minty cover. Didn't cause any digestive issues. If you have a dog with mild mouth issues this would probably work wonders, even with our issue with old dog it helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QYVXKWLZWHBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHU4644#wasThisHelpful","R1QYVXKWLZWHBO","A1B6O7SAIYG2N0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6O7SAIYG2N0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the small compact cat tree, yet is is pretty heavy and has a stable base. Having just built my own I was curious what a mass market tree would be made of. It comes in a box and you assemble at home. Just go over the one page instruction sheet, it's very easy and only takes minutes with the included Allen wrench. There is no off gas odors on the materials and the bolts are better than most, like lag bolts. I was expecting carpeted areas but they are more like a stuffed animal fabric, soft like a teddy bear. The rope smells like sisal rope, I do wish it was the beefier kind, just a bit thicker but it is ok. I used 1/2 inch on my home made one. I also wish it ran the full length of the legs, and that the base legs were taller. The hiding home is perfect, I wish the top tunnel was larger, not a lot a room to lay in it for napping without something hanging over. I do like the solid build, how easy it was to put together, just as easy to take apart if you need to move it or store it. I like that it doesn't stink of chemicals. The carpet I bought at hardware store for my home made one stunk for weeks. I would use this company again, I would also get it taller as I have the room and my cat loves to climb. The surface area is basically for napping not play on this model.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZCD55MB3DF53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY26XPW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZCD55MB3DF53","A1B6O7SAIYG2N0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6O7SAIYG2N0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a compact heater that looks like a car battery in shape with a handle in top. No frills heating. Two knobs for control, one for your settings off, fan, low, and high. The other is temperature setting. Turn this up till your warm enough, then turn down till it stops, at this point heater will kick on when temperature drops below this setting. Needs 3 feet of clearance all around for safety. Not for outdoors or wet environments like the bathroom. Fan noise is noticeable, you will know when it's running and depending on room noise you will hear it kick on and off. Does have safety button in bottom that if it gets knocked over will make it stop running. It does come with a small filter (electrostatic) for the back, it is thin cheap and won't hold shape on its own. Directions don't say if the four screws under the rim where it goes are meant to be pushed through it for hold. They should have given it a frame and a drop in metal surround.This type of filter is good at trapping dust, cleaning your air. You need to remember to clean it or replace it when it looks dirty, same mainlanders as your furnace/ac unit filters. Nice thick grounded power cord. Body of heater stays cool to touch till nearing front of unit. I saw this heater listed under fifteen bucks by a third party seller.

"This is very similarities to the Aerogarden 3SL which I own with the CFL(compact fluorescent light) bulb instead of the LED lighting. I have the 3SL in white which reflects light well and this in black which inhibits algae growth. The new Sprout LED does not heat up as much and uses less energy. the LED has a blue tone to its lighting and the CFL is more yellow. Hopefully you can see it in my photograph. Other changes is they improved the bubbler with more air holes and a different water/nutrient lid. They sound like a fish tank running. Set up only takes a few minutes, plants begin growing in a few days. I like the fact they are compact and I can move them around the house, they are currently in their third area of the house as I try to find them a ideal spot that I can add to and put up reflective material for the spilled lighting. I like the fact they require little care. I used a Rapitest light meter and found both to be about a 5 on the 1-10 scale. Almost a 6 right next to LED, so when the plant grow it will get more lighting. Stays on 16 hours a day but you can set when it starts up. Comes with starter pods and plant food with measuring cup. I really like these and am thinking of getting a larger one for vegetables. This kit comes with herbs dill, parsley and basil.One last comment on the lighting, while it takes along time for LEDs to burn out, they are typically not replaceable, CFL lights are a removable and replaceable lighting source .","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROOCW6SA9SV5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NBJLZU#wasThisHelpful","ROOCW6SA9SV5M","A1B6O7SAIYG2N0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6O7SAIYG2N0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the Toshiba Satellite L55t-C5388, there are other models with different specs with similar numbers and some times the reviews get bunched together under different laptops yet same brand. We have tablets, desktops, smartphones, and two other older laptops in our house. First thing I noticed is slower start up as tablets are instant and our other laptop has a SSD drive in it. Not super long but there is a waiting period. Comes preloaded with quite a bit of software and apps, you need to sign in and sign up to use most of them, and pay for a lot of them separately. I chose to uninstall many. Be aware if you accept the standard sign ins you are allowing them to track your internet browsing and other data. I miss the days of free roaming the Internet without being tracked to be marketed to. To use Cortana, you must let Microsoft collect and use info about your location, history, contacts and etc. Be sure to update the windows and chose your security program.The display is ok to me, I have other budget screens in the house that are comparable. The screen tends to look slightly washed out and words have fuzzy edges. There is a control in advanced settings for clear type text, you can set it for your individual eyes.It does have a standard CD/DVD drive, a web camera built in, 2 USB 3 ports, HDMI, as well as a card reader. Head phone jack, Ethernet port, standard USB and power port.Keyboard is flat spaced chiclet keys set in a plastic base, large wrist rests with responsive trackpad, as well as dedicated number keys.We have a couple computers that run Windows 8, never liked it much, while Windows 10 still has some annoying features it seems to be easier to work around and they gave back normal desktop start up screen.The graphics are Intel HD graphics 520, played War of Thunder without graphic issues at the highest setting allowed.This is my first touch screen laptop, I do like this feature, while using the laptop in kitchen and needing to scroll down a recipe I was able to stick out my pinkie finger and scroll.The battery doesn't have a quick release, but it is replaceable by removing two small screws.Base comes off with removing ten screws. Has 2 Kingston 4GB Ram cards. The body on this is thin plastic, care will have to be used handling this laptop.The speakers are spread across the front of keyboard. While voice clarity is great, bass is barely there, and I am not one to want a lot of base.It's fan is basically quiet, stays pretty cool to touch. Good value based general use laptop.Lots of storage space and pretty good ram with wide touch screen.Middle of the road graphics and sound, fine for average web surfing, email, and casual gaming or movies.Wish is had the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950M graphics card the Toshiba Satellite S55-C5364 comes with. I would like the aluminum body and back lit keys and SSD drive.

"Just what you expect out of a Ace bandage wrap. Good quality with stretch and if you ever owned one you know they last a long time. I like the black color, more sporty looking than pale beige that has been used for years. Black shows less soiling. This has a new clip on the end instead of the small metal clips with teeth. I finally figured out how to use it. At first I wished it just came with metal clips as back ups. But it does have all day hold. We used it for a twisted knee, supportive and the Velcro end held on for all day wear. I do have concern over the longevity of the wrap with the reapplying of Velcro over and over. I has wrist guards with Velcro and that action pills up the material requiring replacement. Only time will tell on this new clip device.

"This kit comes with needed assembly tools. The instructions are colored drawings with little to no written instructions till it is built and you move on to connecting and play stage. Nice that pictures for which screws to use are pictures with 1:1 ratio, simply lay the screws down on top of drawing for size. When attaching your plates they do have a front and a back, look closely at drawings for placement. Same with the screws, you use so many S3 that you might over look when it changes to S2 and a regular nut turns into a nylon nut. Took us days to build and we made a few mistakes and had to fix, put things on backward or upside down. I say this in a good way, it teaches problem solving and patience. The build alone is days worth of work, exciting to see it come together. The robot is sturdy on its feet when done, although we did manage to get it rocking trying to turn and it started to fall over. That was a a thick wool rug.We found set up pretty straight forward but you need to keep the book handy to do the command prompts. The pre recorded Voice commands are neat at first but then you really want to move on to making it do what you want. We tied a string to its hand to play with the cat. The hands themselves are just hanging there, they have no options for control. I would like to take away the head movements and add even one hand control. Maybe in the future. The arms move in surprisingly fast wide motions. The app is fast set up, no sign in. Controlling through the app is much easier and fun. Scan, touch the Meccanoid name at top of screen then again connect in the scan area. Shows battery power left. Not all smart phones will fit in pocket on front of robot, phone does not have to be on robot, I even used an iPad. It's fun playing around with it, enjoyed building it. Would like to try a different build. Parts are solid, should last with care. Looked at the Meccanoid G15 that currently sits under two hundred bucks with less of a height issue. Also hope in future model for charge cable to plug in like cell phone, the current one is hard to get in and out for charging. I fear kids tugging it out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSPBROCZRMZIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY40ERW#wasThisHelpful","RSPBROCZRMZIX","A1B6O7SAIYG2N0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6O7SAIYG2N0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good variety of Mountain House foods. We use these for camping and back packing yet they have such a long shelf life they are also good for emergency food supplies as long as you have potable water to mix them with. This box contains packages for more than one serving at a time although they do sell individual meals. This means if your a single person you will probably waste such large packs like the chicken and rice, that is three servings. They do have high sodium content so they are not an everyday food but when your hiking and losing salts throughout the day it's ok. They do taste good, most tend to look good to the eye as well. I prefer the chicken meals over the beef. Chicken teriyaki is one of my favorites. If you bring along some flat bread like pita or flour taco shells they really go along way. Also recommend small packets of salsa. The eggs taste like eggs, give them a little longer to sit so they can draw up as much moisture as possible. While I don't use salsa on eggs normally, on the trail it makes them taste amazing. This Mountain House brand does a good job on flavor and the foods look appetizing to the eye.

"We have and still use an old Philips Norelco epilator, it also came with a removable shaver head, single line of blades. This new Panasonic is a huge improvement. You can use it wet or dry. The head pivots, allowing better coverage over curves and dips. The two heads of tweezers cut down the amount of time you are in pain. If you have ever used one of these you know it can hurt like mad yet it's worth it to have smooth skin for weeks, I use for under the arm and you have no red from pokey hairs irritating your skin and no under arm five o'clock shadow. This Panasonic ES-ED50 pulls most of the hair in just a couple passes, so much quicker for me than the Norelco, less passes less damage. I use those little blue bottles of oil that come in wax strip boxes. Instant relief, if you don't have that place a cold wash cloth under your arm for a few minutes. I used this for a mans back also, done quickly and LED light really does highlight the remaining hairs. The razor is ok, not smooth but enough to be able to wear shorts. The clear bikini trimmer cap is a nice touch, shaver has the pop up trimmer. Also has a brush and cover. Head pops off after pushing a button at the back. Power switch is on the front, two speeds. Little white bag to keep it all together. Easy to pop off gold colored cap to rinse out hair. My only complaint is the fact the gave it a pretty long power cord considering it won't work plugged in. It's just for charging. My old one works plugged it, so as this gets older and battery life diminishes it might not be ready to use when you need it. Currently has 30 minute use, plenty of time for now as it works faster than my old one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVYZVF8LIT2ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTD2CNG#wasThisHelpful","RVYZVF8LIT2ED","A1B6O7SAIYG2N0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6O7SAIYG2N0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is what we like about the Recon 50p, blue gaming head set. It can be used across multiple gaming systems. Mic can be removed, end is just like a headphone jack. Mute and volume located chest level, it's a small box, barely any weight or in the way at all. It's over the ears and does a excellent job blocking room noise. Headset is light weight.Here so far what we don't like, the head band is super tight, feels like it was made for a child's head, hopefully this loosens up with time. The cable is short, (3feet) when using this with a PC set on the floor there is no room for moving around.  Chat volume and game is not separate controls.Over all not bad for a low cost headset. They will get used. Yet I have to say after a few days use we are right back to our old Turtle beach P11s, we have three of those in this house, they are comfortable, super long cable (about 12 feet) to move around and comfortable after hours of use and can still be bought new at a comparable price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPKQGNSISK1CY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5UKY#wasThisHelpful","RPKQGNSISK1CY","A1B6O7SAIYG2N0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6O7SAIYG2N0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Dries in hair quickly, controls my frizzy prone wavy/curly hair in a held together yet still able to move naturally way. I can run my hands in hair without getting caught up in product. This is a good product for me, as I like natural looking hair. I didn't really get a shine bump from it, I wouldn't really call it a strong holding gel either.

"I own four other Bose speakers, I really like their clarity. I love the small size of this radio with its booming sound. This is the first one I have had with the ability to pull in radio over the air. I like not having to grab a tablet or a phone to pull up an app to find quick tunes or news. It's a quick set up, plug in it, the straighter the power cord the better the FM reception as it doubles as the antenna. There is a place to attach a real antenna if this is not enough for your location. Set up the time, just push the + or - till you reach the current time. I do not like the placement of the time buttons on the remote, they look like volume buttons and they are right where your thumb rests. They would have been better to put that up by the power button or made them smaller. After that you can run through the search of FM stations and preset up to six channels just by holding down the button for a second, you hear a beep, it's done. Each station displays on the front of speaker under the time, lists song and artist. Change over to AM and set up six more. AM can be picked up better by the way your system faces. Alarm set is in bottom corner, you can set two alarms, each with its own button to the left of the alarm setup button. Buzzer is default but you can set up for music. You can adjust the alarm volume. The buzzer steadily gets louder, I like this as it doesn't have to jolt you out of sleep. Place on back for headphone jack, aux, and antenna as well as a Bose link port. You can adjust display brightness also. Besides the remote you can turn the system on and off by touching the top of the speaker, this feature can be disabled, say if you have a cat you don't want walking on the radio and blaring music while your sleeping or not at home. Does hold the time when power is cut. This sounds really full and clear, at first I thought it was having issues while testing how loud I could get it but it turned out that it was radio static. Sadly it does not have Bluetooth, all my other Bose have this feature, it's surprising in this age of music electronics and this price range. After looking online I see there is a Bluetooth adapter that works with older models, doesn't list if it would work with current machine. It lists at a hundred bucks currently, that seems like something that should be included in the box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34N59WUG88K24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IH6TYE#wasThisHelpful","R34N59WUG88K24","A1B6O7SAIYG2N0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6O7SAIYG2N0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can substitute to make it dairy free or vegan, they list how to do that on the bag also. One full bag makes 12 muffins.

"I have been using Quilted Northern double roll 3 ply, this Charmin is double roll 2 ply. The northern is thicker on the tube but I think that's due to its loose rolling. the Charmin has a thicker feel to the actual paper with more texture for cleaning. Both appear to have the same tearing rate wet and dry. The Northern lists that it is septic safe but I can't find that on the Charmin. Unscented, very little dusting when pieces torn off, doesn't break through while wiping. If you like a soft touch I would go with the Northern, if you like a textured clean go with the Charmin. I live in the country on a septic tank, I would like to know if Charmin is considered septic safe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GFBZRIDM9PNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YMVI4GK#wasThisHelpful","R2GFBZRIDM9PNY","A1B6O7SAIYG2N0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1B6O7SAIYG2N0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am not sure about the tint, still pretty close to white although a shade darker than Olay regenerist luminous. I picked this LOreal skin illuminati because I was using the Olay at SPF 15 and the LOreal is 20 SPF. They have similar ingredient lists, in varying amounts. The LOreal seems to absorb better and less greasy.

"About a year or so ago, I came across videos Jason Hanson had made and put together in a package deal regarding many of the same things he has written in his book.  Our family enjoys various self-defense training, and I was very impressed with these videos.  I shared them with members of my family.  They were impressed too.  They were short and fun to watch.  However, we enjoyed them so much we watched them all within a 3 day period of time, before going back over them individually to really learn and practice the techniques he shared to keep us from harms way.I've been subscribed to his newsletters, and enjoy the tidbits of information he offers with each one. Through these, I found out about his new book, Spy Secrets That Can Save Your Life.  Of course, I purchased this and read it within 3 hours.  (I'm a fast reader, but this was also a fast reading book.) I'm sure others could read it faster, but to glean the information from it that it was intended for, don't speed read.  I'm in the process of reading it again along with my husband.  We read and practice and repeat.A lot of the information covered in the book, I already had watched on the videos.  So, if you have purchased the video collection, would you still want to purchase the book? Yes!  The book contains additional information not found in the videos.  For instance, one of my favorite chapters was near the end, ""The Art of Survival Driving.""  Jason offers a course that teaches this, which I would love to enroll my husband in.  He's pretty stoked about taking this class some day.  In the meantime, we have the basic information taught in this book.I love all the true-life stories he tells regarding each of the topics he covers in the book.  One gets a real life perspective that these bad things do happen to people, and by reading and practicing his suggestions (yes practicing each day and Jason shares his training schedule) we can each avoid many of these situations, or know what to do to save ourselves.  He also provides many websites he has created regarding these particular topics.  The websites share videos and other valuable information.This book should be in everyone's home and not to just sit on a bookshelf.  Read it, and read it again. Practice, and practice daily.  Be ready to protect you and your family with simple steps such as just getting off the X.  (Mentioned throughout the book how important it is to move and not freeze.)I was very impressed by this book and all of the additional information that did not come with the videos I purchased a year earlier.  Glad to have this knowledge.  This book will be a source of valuable information for a long time. I strongly recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26C9D6SCJY79K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399175148#wasThisHelpful","R26C9D6SCJY79K","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Living in a very humid climate, everything that has something cold inside condenses quickly and a lot making a very wet mess all over my table or breakfast bar.  From condiment jars, to bottled water, to milk jugs, to just about everything.  Coasters go only so far.Thanks to Ozeri and their new innovation of the Serafino double layer drinking glasses, I no longer have to deal with the condensation from these particular glasses.  That's Awesome!  They are so pretty and clear, unlike my other drinking glasses that were ruined with our hard water and dishwasher.  These glasses are dishwasher safe, but not recommended.  I hand wash all of my new glassware now.Not only are these great to keep condensation away, and good looking, they are also microwaveable. The really awesome part about this is that you can heat up your milk for hot chocolate in the microwave add your chocolate mix, and the glass is Never hot to the touch. In fact, it is room temperature, not even warm.  Any other glass I own, first off is not microwaveable, but any mug I place in the microwave is Hot after heating up milk or water etc.Serafino glassware is made from glass similar to Pyrex.  So although they are more breakable resistant, they are less likely to break than a normal drinking glass.  That translates into, if you have older kids you trust to drink from a ""glass"" glass, you will absolutely love these.  I wouldn't trust toddlers still learning to hold onto a cup.Do yourself and your family a favorite, and be sure to order a set of these 12 ounce drinking glasses, along with the 8 ounce ones.  These make awesome Christmas gifts, house warming gifts, or any other reason you choose.  Make your table setting prettier with these great glasses today.Love the No condensation, the fact they are microwaveable and freezer safe.  They look awesome with any place setting, and love the suspended beverage look.  The contour on the glass makes it easy to hold.  They are awesome glasses.  I highly recommend these glasses even though I received them free in exchange for my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FTMR1CKLD6SD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TA1IUW#wasThisHelpful","R1FTMR1CKLD6SD","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ozeri has come up with an awesome product the Moderna Artisan Series Double Wall Beverage Glasses.  These are 8 ounce glasses, and come in a set of 4 on sale right now at Amazon for $20.  These are made from borosilicate glass which is a mixture of silica and boron trioxide making them more resistant to thermal shock than any other glass.  Think Pyrex.It is way past time to update my drinking glasses.  The hard water where I live, plus the fact that most of my glasses are over 35 years old, have really taken a toll these last 3 years.  My dishwasher, no matter which detergent I use, and I've tried them all, plus hand washing, just don't make these very appealing to drink from any more.  Time to dispose of them and get something new.  So I've been looking for awhile, and when Ozeri presented these new awesome glasses, there was no way I wasn't going to try them.  It was love at first sight.The fact that each of these glasses are hand made, or rather mouth-blown using a glass that Pyrex used to use, I knew these had to be great.  I love the double-walled design with the little dimples that fit fingers perfectly when holding them.  They're adorable.I was very surprised when I heated up a glass of water for my morning lemon, cayenne and honey drink.  I heated the water for 1 minute in the microwave.  30 seconds longer than I normally do.  The glass felt as if it were room temperature.  I let the glass sit on the counter for 5 minutes, and no condensation whatsoever, and the double-walled glass kept my drink warmer than in a normal mug.  I nearly burned my mouth with the drink, but the glass remained almost cool to the touch.Next, I placed cold water in my everyday drinking glass, and the Ozeri Moderna Artisan Series Double Wall Beverage Glass.  No condensation after leaving out on counter for 15 minutes.  Next, I placed both glasses in the fridge for about 30 minutes, pulled them out and placed on counter again for about 10 minutes.  Still no condensation on the Ozeri glasses just my glass.  That's impressive.  I live in such a humid climate that every glass, water bottle, etc., gets condensation on it, despite hot or cold beverage inside.Needless to say these glasses are winners with me.  They may break, but they are less likely to do so than regular glasses.  They are less likely to shatter if they do break.  They are completely resistant to acids (yeah for my lemon drink each morning) and these will never lose their original sheen.  No more ugly glasses.They are oven and microwave safe, as well as freezer safe.  They can also be placed in the dishwasher, but not recommended.  Use caution when placing ice in the glass or when using stirrers such as metal spoons.These are such fun and awesome glasses.  I love the double-wall design along with the little ""dimples"" for the fingers.  No matter how hot or cold the beverage, the glasses feel room temperature, so be careful when drinking hot drinks.  Love the fact they will never lose their original sheen.  Even though I received these free for my honest opinion, I have now found my new set of drinking glasses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R215XAQ0TRHYIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004101WM0#wasThisHelpful","R215XAQ0TRHYIV","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love how my skin and hair feel after using Foxbrim 100% Pure Jojoba Oil. No more frizzies, and hair shines and feels hydrated, not dry, especially since I dye it regularly.  Blends well with other ingredients, but great just by itself.  I use as a make-up remover and moisturizer night and morning.  It is absorbed into skin quickly without leaving it greasy.  I know, because my phone screen does not leave any fingerprints on it after applying Jojoba oil.  Fine lines around eyes are diminishing quickly, like just a couple of days of use I've seen improvement.  Skin is more soft and supple.  Love Love Love the big 4 ounce bottle of Jojoba Oil by Foxbrim.  Did receive product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.  However, if I didn't like the oil to begin with, I wouldn't have asked to review it.  Most pleasant surprise was the huge 4 ounce size.  I certainly recommend this product to all.

"I've never experienced using a professional lemon squeezer such as this.  I just have the old fashioned kind.  My first impression when I opened up the box was this thing is huge.  I can squeeze my oranges too, not just lemons and limes.I've learned over the years that to get the most juice from your citrus when squeezing, there are certain things to do first.  You can either roll the fruits on a counter or cutting board using the palm of your hand to soften the membranes of the fruit.  You can heat up the fruit in a microwave for about 30 seconds.  You can run the fruit under hot water for a few minutes.  Then when you are ready to squeeze, slice your fruit lengthwise (which is the opposite of what you would normally tend to do.)Well after I washed the fruit using a mixture of vinegar, water, and lemon essential oil, I placed the lime and orange in the microwave for 30 seconds, then slightly rolled them in the palm of my hand to completely soften and break down the hard membranes so I could maximize the juice quantity.  Then I sliced my oranges the normal way, and the lime lengthwise.  Now my oranges are small.  In fact, the lime was larger than my oranges.  But my small oranges are very tasty.When you place the fruit into the squeezer, it almost seems natural to place it in upside down.  Don't do that or you will have juice going where you don't want it.  When place properly, the juice will flow out the holes in the bottom into your container. Needless to say, when I saw all the pulp left on the peels, I thought that a lot of juice was still left untouched.  Not so.  I was pleasantly surprised that the pulp was extremely dry.  So, if you want the pulp in your juice, this lemon squeezer won't provide it.  You will have to manually extract the pulp from the peel.After trying the oranges, I decided to test this professional citrus squeezer against my old fashioned kind.  I did this with the lime.  I sliced my lime lengthwise to maximize juice production.  I again was pleasantly surprised that each yielded the same amount of juice.  However, the old fashioned juicer gave me all the pulp, the professional squeezer left the pulp in the peel.  I'll tell you this, the professional squeezer has my vote.  It is faster, easier and more fun to use.  Clean up is fast and easy and there was less mess all together with Kitchen Frontier's Professional Lemon Squeezer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIS1FXQJ1RSHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KIC4DF8#wasThisHelpful","RIS1FXQJ1RSHQ","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lately I've experienced some pain in my upper arm. Have had this off and on over the last 9 months or so.  So, I just applied two drops of peppermint oil to my arm.  It hasn't been 2 minutes and I can feel the warmth seeping down into my muscles relieving the pain in my arm.  My husband, sitting 5 feet away at his desk working, said his nose cleared up and he can breathe better than he could just moments ago.  45 minutes later and my arm is still pain free.Peppermint Oil helps relieve migraine headaches. Apply a drop to each temple, and rub some on the back of your neck and you should receive instant relief.I have tried the peppermint oil to ward off spiders.  This stuff really works.  Believe me.  I've tried just about every product on the market found in the Bug Killer section at my local Lowe's.  Nothing has worked like the peppermint oil to keep spiders away.  And with all the Black Widows I have around my place, I don't need spiders hanging out with me.I make my own re-mineralization toothpaste.  I've had two cavities I've been working real hard to get rid of since January of this year.  One is completely gone, and the other is almost gone.  I believe that the Peppermint Oil in my DIY Toothpaste is a big part of why the cavities are disappearing.This is such a great product,  I firmly believe every home should have 100% Pure Peppermint Oil.  It is a great panacea for our health.  Peppermint Oil is the world's most widely used essential oil.Amazing product that works for many different things.  Very versatile.  Therapeutic Grade A.

"This garden hand tool set are new play toys for me.  New play toys for me.  My kids have all come to understand that when Mom wants to ""play"", she is out working in the garden/yard or painting walls.  I've even begged my son to fly me out to his new home so I could ""play"" with him as he painted walls.  Oh well.  These new ""play"" tools came at the right time.I was only going to go out for a few minutes and pull up some obnoxious weeds with my new toys. An hour and a half later, and because it started to rain, I finally came in.  I did not have any blisters on my hands.  These tools fit so comfy in the palms of my hands my arms were not tired one bit, even the next day.  Can't wait to go ""play"" some more later today.The hand trowel is perfect for digging up weeds as well as useful for planting.  However, the transplanting trowel, with it's graduated numbers showing depth in inches and centimeters, is the perfect tool for planting seedlings and other plants that come in the starter packs.  It also does a great job digging up dandelions.  Which is the one tool I use the most - a dandelion digger, and not included in this set.  Not that I have a lot of dandelions, but I have quite an accumulation of weeds from the community lawn mowers.The hand cultivator or ""rake"" does not have pointed tips.  Be it good or bad, you'll need to decide. I've only ever used those with the pointed tips, so was pleasantly surprised at how well this hand cultivator with the squared off tips actually performed better than I anticipated.  I especially like to use this tool for fluffing up my pine needles around my plants, especially after the hard rains we get. This tool is also used to remove shallow rooted weeds and loosen surface soil.  Personally, I didn't think it did a great job with the surface or shallow rooted weeds.  It did well with loosening the soil however.These hand tools are brightly colored lime green.  I didn't believe they would be easy to spot, but sure enough, I laid them down, took one of the tools with me around the yard, and didn't have to search long before I found where I placed the others.  The lime green really did stand out.LifeWell Hand Tools are great little tools for every gardener.  I like my new set of toys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJSLC5L0BLFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBNGOGS#wasThisHelpful","R3BJSLC5L0BLFP","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love love love the Ozeri Green Earth Pans.  I use them for just about everything I cook on the stove.  I like to make skillet dinners and these are perfect for those.  Cooking omlets and frying eggs are a snap.  Because of the textured bottoms, my eggs are evenly cooked on the bottom.  I'll cook up chopped onions and other veggies and I've been impressed every time.  In fact, I very seldom use my other waterless cookware as I've come to rely on the Ozeri Green Earth Pans.Another feature I especially like about the textured bottomed pans is actually the diamter of the pans. The 12 inch fry pan does indeed measure 12 inches across the top edge.  The bottom edge measures 11 inches.  It doesn't slope upward so the entire bottom of the pan is still 11 inches.  This makes it easier for me when I cook, as I don't feel like the food is having to cook up the side of the fry pan like with other pans.The silicone handle is wonderful.  I recently cooked pancakes in a non-Green Earth Pan.  I automatically grabbed onto the handle as I was flipping the pancake over and burned my hand.  I'm so used to never needing to use hot pads with the silicone handles, it was quite a shock when I touched this very hot handle.  I never have to worry about that with the silicone handles on the Green Earth Pan's.I remember years ago about someone commenting about how they always seemed to burn cheese in their fry pans and it would stick real bad and made cleaning difficult.  I always thought she used fake cheese to make it burn in the first place, but I do not have to use very much oil in my cooking at all with this fry pan, and I've never had anything stick or burn.  You can actually use lower temperatures with this fry pan as it heats so evenly.  My suggestion would be to heat the pan up first on the stove before starting to cook.  That way, you will feel like it will actually cook faster at lower temperatures, as well as cooking more evenly.This pan comes with a heavy duty felt pad to help protect your pan from being scratched when storing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE33G9HS3JOM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0068SEQJE#wasThisHelpful","RE33G9HS3JOM7","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I typically do not use sugar substitutes.  I use honey or regular good old fashioned sugar.  Sugar substitutes have a bad wrap.  They're either not healthy, very dangerous, or have awful bitter after tastes.  Well, you can now give up those unhealthy bad tasting ""sugars"" and get Kiva Organic Stevia instead.  It has a pleasant taste, no bitter after taste.  Not only that but it mixes and dissolves well. There are ""0"" calories, and because of the low glycemic index, makes it great for anyone concerned about managing their blood sugar.This container holds 8 ounces so this will last you a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EYGTHL2QA7WE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NKQ2BNK#wasThisHelpful","R1EYGTHL2QA7WE","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bathroom scale is by far the most unique I have ever used.  I was amazed at how many functions it measures just by stepping onto the scale.  You do need to be barefoot, and right after a shower is best when feet are slightly moist.  Otherwise, slightly moisten feet before stepping onto scale.  The 4G sensors that your feet step on help to provide a precise body weight measurement, by sending a small electrical current that honestly cannot be felt.Each item it tracks has its own little symbol and lights up while the large numbers on the large blue backlight LCD screen indicate what those measurements are.Customer Service is great.  I had a question about the kcal measurement (Last Symbol on Scale.) They responded very quickly.This scale is smaller than most I've used, but I don't bump into it either.  It fits better in my bathroom. I have also noticed that it shows me weighing about 1/2 pound higher than other scales I have used. If you want to see the other body measurements, not just your body weight, you need to stay on the scale a little longer for the calculations and display to show up.The only other thing that would have made this scale a 5 star was the ability for it to track either up or down, or percentages or some other way each individual category it calculates so I didn't have to write it down and keep track of it myself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQLARJLDDTA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0ZSAG0#wasThisHelpful","R2AQLARJLDDTA7","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are so many reasons to use kitchen scales.  Lately for me it has been to weigh my postal mail to determine if I need another stamp or not.  I know that usually 2 stamps are more than the letter needs, but when I consider the drive time, gas, etc., I'm better off with 2 stamps on the letter.  And that is certainly better than having the letter come back with insuffienct postage stamped on it.The Pro Pocket Scale by Smart Weigh has several cool features.  I always like the tare function on kitchen scales, which is included.  It has a back light, which is always a plus for me.  The numbers are large enough for me to read.  I like the small size.  I've not experienced it being too small for anything I've needed to weigh. Capacity is 2000 grams or just over 4 pounds.  This is the first kitchen scale that has come with lids or lipped containers that I've used, to help keep things like beads, or powder confined. A great feature.I can see how this would be very useful for someone who is into jewelry making, or one who sells jewelry pieces.  The PCS function is perfect for weighing 100's of beads quickly.  For instance, you can tare the lipped container provided with scale, put in 10 pieces of beads, press the PCS button, then enter the number of beads you just placed (10). Next add more beads and the Pro Pocket Scale will count the number of beads.  You don't have to count out the number of beads you desire, the scale does it for you.I really like the petite size of this scale, and the lipped containers/lids to keep things from rolling off the scale.  It comes with 2 AAA batteries so one doesn't have to worry about finding the lithium batteries.  It works great for everything I need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CN9EPOWMPGZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ME8VI34#wasThisHelpful","R3CN9EPOWMPGZE","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Spirulina.  I feel it is one of the best products out there to provide many of the minerals our bodies need.  I often have a hard time finding it in my local stores, and when I do I stock up.  Now with Organic Spirulina by Sari Foods, I feel I get a much more perfect food product.  And now I can trust that I am getting a superior product through Sari Foods.I love the deep dark green color of the fine powder.  It pretty much stays bright green too when mixed with other foods.  Sometimes that can be overwhelming if you are not used to this.  I kept thinking as I mixed this powder into various food items, how this would have been the perfect item to add to my ""green"" foods for St. Patrick's Day.  I used to serve our kids all green meals that day from breakfast to dinner.Ok, so despite that, I've been very impressed that this does not taste or smell fishy nor like a swamp. There is a certain amount of freshness that comes to mind when I open up the package to add to various meals.  My favorite so far is adding to green smoothies.  Now they're really green.  I also add this to soups, rice, and salads.  I feel like my body is actually noticing a difference and starting to ""wake-up"" and feel energized.Currently, my husband and I are focusing on improving our immune system.  Spirulina is the perfect way to do this.  I must say I was very surprised that it is also a great source of calcum, magnesium, selenium and beta-carotine.  The chlorophyll is an added benefit.  Chlorophyll helps control hunger, promotes cleansing, helps with candida albicans, and much more.Sari Foods includes an ebook with all kinds of recipes to incorporate Spirulina powder.  There are appetizers, main dishes, snacks, smoothies, seasonings, and desserts.  I haven't tried them all, but the hummus recipe is great.The thing I like the best is the almost no-flavor, no smell yet powerful Spirulina from Sari Foods.  I feel this is such a concentrated powder compared to others, that you know you are getting a top quality product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMMQ3FCL54HWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSPVJGU#wasThisHelpful","RMMQ3FCL54HWF","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never owned a garlic press before in my life until recently.  Basically, I just don't like garlic, why bother.  Then my daughter mentioned that a garlic press would work great with fresh ginger, and now I was listening.  Having the opportunity to try this garlic press by Priority Chef, I thought I might give this a try not only on ginger, but garlic as well.I really liked the feature of being able to mince the garlic without having to peel it first.  I really don't like the smell of garlic, therefore, didn't want that on my hands.  It works real slick.  Just break the cloves off the main bulb, stick them in the chamber, clamp down on the handle grips, and woolah, minced garlic on one side, skins on the other.  The skins were easily removed with a knife.Next I did try the ginger.  I did peel the ginger first and probably didn't need too.  However, ginger at least peels easily, it's just slicing that is difficult.  I placed a chunck about the size of a clove of garlic in the chamber.  Squeezing the handles for the ginger was a little tougher than for the garlic.  But it worked.  Ginger produces a lot of extra juice, but the minced pieces soaked that up nicely.The handles on the Priority Chef garlic press are designed so that those with small hands can grip and squeeze comfortably.  Unfortunately, they actually didn't feel very good in my hands.  I thought if they were more rounded it would have been more comfortable.  Consequently, I have medium sized hands so that may have made a difference.  Despite the handles, the garlic press was impressive and something I'll use for a long time.This comes with a free e-book that states very clearly how to use the garlic press and how to clean it.  It also provides several delicious recipes, and a large variety of recipes in which garlic is used.  I've tried some of them, and quite frankly, for someone who doesn't like garlic, these are pretty good.  I'm learning to like garlic a whole lot more since it is so good for our bodies.Works just like they said.  Easy cleanup.  Don't have to have smelly hands from the garlic. Great recipes in the free e-book.Wished the handles were more rounded.  Would have felt more comfortable to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBVTDLHE50JVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJOEV9Y#wasThisHelpful","RBVTDLHE50JVB","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love pasta, but pasta doesn't love my waist line.  Now I can have some of my favorite pasta dishes by subsituting vegetables and know I'm much better off eating healthier.The first time I tried this tool, I wasn't quite getting the hang of it.  I thought how silly, it's just like a giant pencil sharpener.  My first veggie of choice was a carrot.  Well, I rushed out to the store and stocked up on summer squash and cucumbers.  It was easier for me to master the hang of this cool gadget using a veggie that was a little less firm than a carrot.  Once I got the hang of it, I've been going crazy ever since. And now carrots are no problemo.I like having the 2 Julienne sizes.  I prefer the summer squashes thick, and the carrots extra thin.  I don't have to worry about the extra seeds, especially from the cucumbers getting into the spirals. This tool is designed to core the veggies and keep seeds from getting into the spiraled veggies.  I've made several dishes from these pasta like veggies.  I was even surprised when my husband said he actually liked the new versions of the pasta dishes.  Yeah!The Brieftons Spiral Slicer is a must have for a healthy way of living, for families with kids that need a new fun way of eating veggies, and for everyone.  Encourage your kids to help create their own veggie pastas too, while supervising them with the Spiral Slicer.  I know my kids were more anxious to eat when they helped prepare their own meals.Cleanup is a snap.  I just rinse under the tap, spray with a solution of vinegar and water, and rinse again.  I also just hand wash and utilize the cleaning brush to clear all seeds from the blades.I love the spiraled veggies, and the fun ways to incorporate them into my diet.  Very easy to swap out these spiraled veggies for pasta in many dishes.  It's fun and easy to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SSTOD171G7L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBVCVLM#wasThisHelpful","R2SSTOD171G7L8","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the taste of molasses, so figured this would be a great tasting product.  I began by substituting Yacon Syrup for honey I was adding to my warm lemon water, cayenne pepper and honey each morning.  Well, I'll tell you this much, I like molasses a whole lot better, and I prefer the honey in my lemon water.  BUT...given the facts that this product will help me feel full longer, will speed up my metabolism, and help me lose weight, I figured I could give this a try.  I've also tried it in green smoothies, and I like that option a whole lot better.So, I started this on Monday.  Today is Friday.  I've lost 2 pounds in just that short period of time-5 days. I've eaten the same as I have been, but I'll also mention that I have also started rebounding again for 10 minutes each day.  It is recommended to take 1 teaspoon 3 times a day.  I've only been taking 1 teaspoon a day.I believe that the Yacon Syrup is what helped get these 2 pounds off so quickly.  I'm not sure how fast it will continue to work, meaning, how fast will I continue to lose 2 pounds every 5 days, but as long as the weight loss is steady, I'm good with that.  I have just about 10 more pounds to drop, and I understand this will be the hardest 10 pounds to lose, so I'm hoping for continued success with Yacon Syrup.So far it is working very well in helping me feel full longer, and helping me lose weight.  However, the taste is hard to get used to.  Just cannot take it straight, but have to mix it with something.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26WBSBWIMLNVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GK92558#wasThisHelpful","R26WBSBWIMLNVP","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never owned a garlic press in my life.  This is my first experience with one.  My hubby has been wanting me to incorporate fresh garlic into our diet for years.  Well, I personally don't care for it, so never obliged.  Now that we are focusing more on our health, not that we are unhealthy, but want to have better health, and lose about 15 pounds each, I gave in to the garlic once I had this opportunity to review this product.  Of course, it certainly helped to see how my daughter and her husband have each lost about 15 pounds over the last couple of months, and she uses garlic all the time and recommended that I get a good quality garlic press not only for fresh garlic, but ginger as well.  Hello Alpha Grillers!I already had fresh ginger in my pantry, and decided to try that first.  What a disaster.  Not blaming the garlic press at all, but the ginger.  It was very green, not bright yellow like we were used to.  I did get a lot of ginger juice though.That night I purchased a better root branch of ginger.  Much better results.  This was so cool, so easy. Love it!  We eat raw ginger on our tuna/salmon sandwiches daily.  I no longer have to worry if I'm going to end up getting my fingers cut when I sliced ginger, because I can now put it through this great garlic press.  Never would have guessed ginger would be so difficult to slice.Next I actually tried garlic.  Yep!  The garlic peeler worked wonders.  Just place a clove of garlic in the tube, rub it around a bit, and like magic the skin is off and ready for the press.Then I placed the garlic in the press, squeezed, much lighter than I had to with the ginger, and I was amazed at how swift this process was.  Painless, quick, and I didn't even have to touch the left overs in the press.  I just removed that with a butter knife.Now I'm going to make humus using the fresh garlic, butternut squash, and a few other seasonings.This is so easy to use.  Don't have to squeeze very hard.  Works great on ripe (if that's the correct term) of ginger root, and very slick process for the garlic cloves.  Washes up quick and easy by hand.  Peeler is a snap too.

"The Ozeri 360 Tower fan is a 3 feet by 7 inch tall fan with 3 speeds.  Programmable timer for up to 8 hours.  Will oscillate at 60,  90, 120 or 360 degrees for partial to complete air circulation.  Uses color LED display for fan functions.  Has a night time dimmer.  Comes with remote. Very quiet.The first day we used this fan, it was in the afternoon, where the room had been heating up during the day.  The sun was beginning to shine through the windows, despite the blinds on them, and this room was Hot.  We already had the ceiling fan running, the a/c down, and still working in a hot room.  We turned the Ozeri 360 Tower Fan on.  It took awhile to determine the best position to place it in the room.  Once we got it positioned in the room, this fan literally dropped the temperature by 3 degrees in under 5 minutes using the medium speed.  We were impressed at how quickly and efficiently and quietly it runs.I recommend this to anyone who likes to have a fan running at night to help them sleep better.  You can program the speed, how long you want it to run, how far you want it to oscillate, and best of all it is very quiet and lulls you to sleep.If you just need to cool a room down during the day like we need to, this is the perfect fan for this.Be sure to read the full review here: [...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AEAHNO7DESTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3RG0GA#wasThisHelpful","R1AEAHNO7DESTF","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With this pedometer you set  your target of how many steps you want to accomplish then it keeps track for you.  This pedometer counts up to 1 million steps with built-in memory for 30 days of activity.  It features a clock, calendar and sports timer.  Comes with clip on strap.

The lid fits tight so when the carafe is placed in bags or drawers, there is no worry of the water getting on everything after drinking.To see my full review, go here: [...]","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ19T0UMAUF1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBZ3PJU#wasThisHelpful","RZ19T0UMAUF1N","ALDM67VMA0962","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALDM67VMA0962?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sabi Day box is a twist 'n go travel pill box.  There are 8 separate containers in which to place pills. These 8 containers can all be hooked together, or separated in any way you wish.  They are labeled Sunday through Saturday.  Each daily container has 3 compartments for pills.After separating each container, it is a bit more challenging to connect them back together.  One side goes up, while the other goes down.  Sounds simple enough, but not as easy as it sounds.  That is the biggest drawback for this container.To see my full review, go here.

"The Folio is a great idea.  You can place two weeks of pills in it at a time, and secure them in the case with its snug fitting lid, and the addition of the elastic strap that wraps around the case.  The departments for the pills are ""bathtub"" shaped to allow your fingers to easily grasp the pills that are placed inside.Sometimes it is hard to get just one compartment of pills at a time.

"My grandkids are always eating soft foods from their original containers with a hole poked through the lid and they drink through a straw the contents.  There is a limit on some foods that they eat by doing that.  However, it is perfect for their on-the-go life style they have, and convenient for mom.  Mom was excited to try the large 10 oz. pouches.  Just in time too.

"John Rebus is back at work.  The mandatory retirement age was changed and he is reemployed, although at a reduced rank.  He becomes involved in two cold cases.  One he is pursuing on his own - it involves a man he is sure is guilty of murder but they could never find the body.  The other is an old case that involved colleagues that he worked with years before - some people don't want that case reopened because there was something wrong with the investigation.  The second case becomes very hot when a couple people are killed, one of them being a prominent politician.  There are questions of people being paid off, and some people involved in shady activities.  Sometimes events result in doing an unintended favor for someone, and there are interesting ways that a favor can be called in.A lot of people may be damaged by the investigation, and Rebus has to manage to stay out of the line of fire, while determining who pulled the trigger past and present.

Someone is going to be killed.  There are some strange people who have shown up in the area, and everyone has agendas of their own.

"War has many kinds of casualties, both military and civilian.  Some people are killed.  Some people disappear never to be seen again,  Many people are injured, both physically and mentally.  The story starts in St. Malo, France in 1944, just before the bombing that destroyed most of the city.  The story is told mainly by flashbacks that establish the various characters who eventually are brought together by the war.  Add in a jewel that has a curse.  The story is fragmented as it moves from character to character and they have different experiences because of the war.  Not everyone will survive.  It would be difficult to make it into a motion picture.You won't be sure who to root for in this novel because many people are victims, often by circumstances of their birth.  They cannot always be what they want to be.  You have a blind French girl who has been brought to her great uncle's home in St. Malo as a refugee from Paris.  You have a young German boy with unusual talents who was pressed into special services that will haunt him.  There is the great uncle who has PTSD from World War I.  You will always find a collaborator with the enemy, and neighbors organizing a resistance group.  Then there are the people left behind when someone goes off to war.Stick with the story as it moves about.  It will all come together.

"Lucas is drawn into a case by his adopted daughter who is attempting to help a young woman whom she met out in San Francisco when the woman was busking.  Now the woman is worried about her male companion who went off to meet a group and disappeared.  The group seem to be a strange religious cult, but think in terms of Manson (if you remember him).  The group has a dangerous, possibly insane, charismatic leader who goes by the name Pilate.  The plot moves through South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota.  People don't stay in place very long - usually just long enough to cause trouble.The novel has violence ranging from gun fights to physical attacks.  Expect some people to die.  There are some unlikely heroes and heroines.  In the Upper Peninsula, everyone has access to at least a rifle, and many have military training.  You will get a lot of details about tracking and containing dangerous criminals.  There is sexual content, mainly by discussion.  I would give the novel an R rating, with motion picture potential.  It has a surprise ending.  I am not sure where the author intends to take the characters.  Virgil Flowers makes a brief cameo appearance, but Lucas takes the lead on the law inforcement side, aided by various other people.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CWO235UCCU44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399168796#wasThisHelpful","R1CWO235UCCU44","A3BH49ZKESHDID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BH49ZKESHDID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I actually have an Epson XP-424 Printer which seems to be an upgrade of some sort, but it has the same features.  The printers are rated as wireless but can be connected to your PC with a standard USB cable (not provided).  I prefer to connect it directly to my PC as they are side by side in any case.  It is a low-priced printer that won't break your budget, and is adequate for most people's needs.  The multifunction features are more than I need, but it is nice to have a copier capability.  The printer cartridges are easy to install (much more so than my old HP printer that died, where I usually ended up with ink on my fingers).  This is a new printer, so I am not aware at this time how long the ink cartridges last or how much they cost to replace (my old HP printer had cartridges that cost almost as much as buying this printer).  For color prints, it is not top of the line as it does not distinguish well between varying shades of colors.  It is OK for most prints, and I used it for some family photos.  It is somewhat slow compared to other printers, and is not intended for high volume printing.My main issue (the reason I knocked off a star) is the scanty set of directions provided with the printer, written in four languages.  Hey, the U.S is a major market.  If you are selling your product here, write the instructions in English, and make them a little more comprehensive.  Customer support was not helpful.  I had immediate setup problems because the directions were inadequate.  You need to open the top of the computer (accessing the same area where you install the ink cartridges) in order to remove all the blue tape, and there was a small Styrofoam packing piece inside the back of the computer that was not mentioned.  Having got past that, the installation went OK, but then I got some strange error message saying the installation was not completed.  Hmmm... Before going through all the procedure again, I punted.  I closed the installation software, and tried printing a file.  It worked just fine.  I have no idea what installation was not completed, but it may have been a function that I don't use.  I received automatic updates of the software from Epson (printers that have been sitting in a store for a while usually don't have the latest updates)..I still have to figure out the other features, but I will get to them.  I would note that there were a lot of confusing pictorial directions for loading paper that I mostly ignored.  I little observation makes the process obvious.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T00PMRMQS8QQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SX0R6MO#wasThisHelpful","R1T00PMRMQS8QQ","A3BH49ZKESHDID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BH49ZKESHDID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The latest adventures of Lady Georgiana Rannock, but this one does not involve the Queen.  Georgie has continued staying on as a poor house guest with some older women.  Her mother arrives unexpectedly and recruits her as a companion for a trip to America, in particular, to Reno where her mother plans to obtain a Nevada divorce from her estranged husband (the rich Texas oilman) in order to marry the rich German industrialist (who has given her the chateau on the French coast plus a Swiss chalet).So, it is off to London, with Queenie in tow, to stay at a somewhat posh hotel while her mother takes her shopping.  Then it is off to a first class cabin on an Ocean Liner bound across the Atlantic - her first trans-Atlantic trip.  Aw, but there is a thief aboard, and a valuable jewel disappears.  The game is afoot, and it turns out Darcy is chasing the elusive thief who has been plundering valuables from rich British aristocrats.Things become complicated when Lady Georgiana's mother, who started life as an actress, makes a side trip to Hollywood, in particular to Beverly Hills to stay at the best hotel in town.  One thing leads to another.  Could her mother be going back into acting?  Ah, but a weekend invitation to an estate leads to a death, which always seems to be the case where Lady Georgiana is involved.  There are numerous side plots involving the usual characters as the case winds down to a blazing finish.Onward to the next adventure.  Maybe the Queen will need her skills again.  And there is that character, Hitler, causing problems in Germany.

"I am not sure how I missed this collection when it first came out.  I was checking on one of my favorite authors, and found the lead to it.  The title is misleading.

As to the 23 stories (you get a lot for your money), we have -""Nightshade"" by Stephen England - A team of CIA assassins are in Paraguay to take out a terrorist.  Things go wrong, but skilled people know how to improvise.  A recent novel by the author is Day of Reckoning (Shadow Warriors)""The Pepper Tyrant"" by J.

There is a way to remove the threat, but not everything is as he expected.""Everybody Wins"" by Lisa Mannetti - A woman is suicidal, but someone has an arrangement to change her life, perhaps not as expected.""Fat Larry's Night With the Alligators"" by Ben Goldman - A question of disposing of a body in the Everglades, except that is not the only reason they are there.""Thyf's Tale"" by Christine Morgan - set in the Viking era with an unexpected assassin.""Misconceptions"" by Matt Hilton - sometimes two jobs get rolled into one.""Second Amendment Solution"" by Billie Sue Mosiman - Set in Texas, the home of the author, this is a story that would appeal to the NRA and others favoring the right to bear arms.  Big government in the form of Homeland Security has taken a man away without saying why.  His wife was brought up to believe a person has a right to defend themselves and their family (her father had killed an intruder).  So what should she do?""Killer"" by Ken Bruen - is a strange story, almost surreal.""For the Love of Boys""  by Rob M. Miller - A story about pedophiles and retribution.""Bloodshed Fred"" by Monica J. O'Rourke - A hit man gets an assignment that he had not expected and perhaps should have used more caution.""Slasher"" by F. Paul Wilson - This is a bit of an eerie story.  People need to be careful to check things out better.""Fire and Ice"" by Joseph Badal - Some punks who think they are above the law find out they have messed with the wrong family.

"An interesting collection of short stories, some of which were published elsewhere.  Of particular interest is the author's discussion of how the Dortmunder series of novels came into being.  What we have are 9 interesting Dortmunder stories, one story which I would call a scene rather than a complete short story, and one short story about other characters similar to Dortmunder and Associates.  It is only a dozen if you count the author's discussion.  What the collection contains is""Dortmunder and Me, in Short"" - an interesting discussion by the author about the development of the Dortmunder character.""Ask a Silly Question"" - A solicitation to Dortmunder by an individual who wants to recover something given to his wife.  A usual with Dortmunder, nothing works out right, but there are some side benefits.""Horse Laugh"" - A man wants assistance in stealing a valuable horse.  Nothing works out as expected.""Too Many Crooks"" - A beautiful plan to tunnel into a bank's vault.  Oops...someone else had ideas about robbing the bank.  Well, there is more than one way to handle things.""A Midsummer Daydream"" - Dortmunder is off away from the city while things cool off at home, but gets accused of a robbery.  He has to find the real thief, and there is a little twist at the end.""The Dortmunder Workout"" - This is really a short scene at OJ's rather than a short story (my reason for knocking a star off the rating).  People should not include writing exercises in their published collections.""Party Animal"" - Dortmunder's escape from a crime scene takes him into the middle of someone's party.  He has to improvise a bit, and part with some of his loot.  All's well that ends well, at least for Dortmunder.""Give Till it Hurts""  - finds Dortmunder escaping from another theft, and this time finding himself in the middle of a ""friendly"" poker game.  He discovers that you have to use care in how you play a game.""Jumble Sale"" - Dortmunder finds himself in the middle of an attempted sting.  As the end result, he makes a swap.""Now What"" - Dortmunder finds himself in possession of a valuable brooch.  The problem that he has is disposing of it as everything goes wrong.  It's like it is cursed.  He finally makes a deal, but it does not turn out as expected.""Art and Craft""  - A former acquaintance, whom Dortmunder does not really trust, tries to pull Dortmunder into a robbery scheme.  Dortmunder is not buying, and the results are not what anyone expected.""Fugue for Felons"" - this is not about Dortmunder, but is about some similar characters who have plans for robbing a bank.  Things don't work out quite like they expected.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LHXTFW7SOGCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446693022#wasThisHelpful","R3LHXTFW7SOGCJ","A3BH49ZKESHDID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BH49ZKESHDID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dortmunder is offered a deal by his fence.  A wealthy individual in on extended vacation, and his penthouse apartment is full of expensive artwork.  The trick is getting the artwork out of the apartment without being caught.  Then a second problem comes up which detracts the gang - the OJ (their usual meeting place to lay out their plans) is being taken over by organized crime to use as a bust out business, i.e., running up huge debts on the business' credit, then going out of business and leaving creditors holding the bag.  This becomes two plots that run together to get surprising results.Dortmunder and friends are not going to come out of this with as much as they hoped, but it's a living.  Other people end up with problems they deserve.  Life will go on.

"This is a tooth friendly chewing gum similar to the Chiclets Chiclets Gum (2-Piece per Package), 200-Count Package that I remember from when I was a child.  It is made with Xylitol so that it protects the teeth.  The Xylitol sweetener is a tree sugar that suppresses harmful bacteria.  I personally prefer the spearmint flavor, and this is a good price for chewing gum.  I use two pieces at a time, so a single blister pack gives me six servings.

"This is one of the author's earlier novels (copyright 1969).  The value of money may seem low by today's standards, but the storyline is still good.  It is not great literature, but is good light reading for a rainy day.  Chester Conway has a tip on a horse from one of his fares - in fact it is the only tip he receives from the cheapskate.  But Chester is a gambler.  He bets on credit with his bookie, the horse comes in, and he goes to collect.  Oops - someone was there before him, and his bookie was murdered.  The bookie's wife walks in on the scene, and now Chester is a suspect.The horse was a longshot, and someone owes Chester a chunk of money, so he becomes an unwilling investigator both to clear his name and to  get his money.  Of course there are some people who would prefer not to have Chester nosing around.  And then the bookie's sister shows up to add to the story, and you get introduced to Chester's weekly card game.  Everything will work out, one way or another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EM1OZ1HCXFJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006BZ2U6#wasThisHelpful","R3EM1OZ1HCXFJV","A3BH49ZKESHDID","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BH49ZKESHDID?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my preferred vegetable mix because it leave out potatoes.  It is a mixture of carrots, green beans, lima beans, corn and peas.

I normally season to taste with thyme, creole blend spice (Frontier Blackened Creole Blend, 2.19-Ounce Bottle), garlic pepper, turmeric, etc.  The 14.5 ounce can makes two good sixed vegetable servings.

"It's easy to get along with anyone as long as they live in another state.  In this case Franny and Jim Post have planned a two-week vacation on Mallorca for their family and some friends, all staying in the same house.  What could possibly go wrong?  Well Jim, an editor at a magazine, was caught bonking a young editorial assistant who happened to be the daughter of one of the Board of Directors, and he has been summarily fired.  He and Franny now have a strained relationship that they are trying to conceal from their children.  Their daughter Sylvia has learned the hard way that, in the world of cellphone cameras, what you do at a party tonight can end up on Facebook tomorrow morning.  Their son Bobby is bringing along his live-in girlfriend Carmen - Bobby has a problem he has not told his parents about..  Franny has invited her longtime friend Charles - an artist she used to pose for (how many children have seen nude paintings of their mother) - and Charles is bringing along his husband Lawrence.Needless to say a few other people enter into the plot.  There is that college age son of a neighbor on the island who has been hired, at the recommendation of the house's owner, to tutor Sylvia in Spanish.  And Franny has discovered a distinguished looking older tennis instructor - someone she had seen in tennis matches years earlier.  Of course there are those two men in leather jackets whom they had seen on the airplane coming into Mallorca - a couple of bikers who are having a vacation riding the roads on the island.For better or worse, things work out as they work out.  Life will not be the same again.  As a warning, you will not like this novel unless you have liberal attitudes.

"There was a shift in feelings in this book in my opinion. Not that you don't think Belle will love the alpha, but rather her feelings change from being attracted to him and tolerating her situation to one of complete acceptance. It wasn't unexpected, but it felt sudden. Actually everything about the entire five book plot is sudden. I liked that because I wanted a story that I could actually put down while taking care of my kids but left ,e feeling satisfied with my knowledge of what was going on. This book delivered that. You get the final installment of the conspiracy in this book and get to experience what Belle is willing to go through for her husband. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't want to give too much away of the plot because this really is the summation of everything. This series is available as a single book. Seeing that I had to have the next one as soon as I finished reading the previous one, I think the complete series is a must have before you even start reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IE65FV9OJRL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU6MZXI#wasThisHelpful","R2IE65FV9OJRL4","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In an extreme twist, Belle is broken out of prison by Grey's Beta who was standing guard. The problem is that he broke her out in order to kidnap her and take her to someone that wants her dead. In book one, Belle kills a starving werewolf in her own self-defense. It's a pretty amazing feat for a human to kill a werewolf which is what earned her Grey's respect and marriage proposal. Well now Belle has been turned over to another werewolf pack to serve a different murder sentence. Grey's beta felt that it was right to turn her over to the other pack to serve justice for losing one of their own. There's a lot more conspiracy to it and you will learn a little about the rival pack in the process. What amazes me is that we learn how much of a survivor Belle is. One of the lines I liked the best was Grey saying that it is really hard to be the hero when she keeps saving herself. That obviously is not the exact words, but you get the idea. She's a survivor and worthy to be the alpha's mate. The story ends with them discovering a plot that goes into the Shadow Pack's enforcer unit and could endanger everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RPLR8O7G0JEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZ4JFRU#wasThisHelpful","R3RPLR8O7G0JEY","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading book one, I had to know what was going to happen next between Belle and Grey, the Shadow Pack alpha. Grey marked Belle as being his before she went to The Choosing so that no other werewolf would dare try to claim her for their bride. It really wasn't something to worry about though since the alpha picks his mate first and he didn't give the other werewolves a chance to even consider Belle. In this book we learn how The Choosing really works and get to experience Belle's first time with a man and also what it is like for a werewolf to attempt to not let his wolfish nature take over during it. Grey proves to be a gentlemanly as he can be, but you are left wondering if Belle will be able to open her heart to him now that they are essentially married. She has a lot to learn about werewolf dynamics and their laws which is proven when she ends up arrested for murder during their honeymoon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6J9XEHNDNL4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFOQHM6#wasThisHelpful","R6J9XEHNDNL4X","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Belle has been arrested for murder, a murder that she knows she didn't commit and Grey feels she couldn't have done either. However, Grey can't speak against his lead enforcer who claims to have evidence to support her claim. Seeing that other enforcers have shown up to take Belle away, Grey allows for her to be imprisoned, but on his terms. Since they are in the midst of their honeymoon, her jail cell is turned into a luxury suite where the two of them will continue to consummate their marriage until Belle is freed. Grey gives us a little more information as to why he can't just drop the charges against her, but we learn from his beta wolves that her accuser has not been deemed unbiased enough to conduct the investigation. Her accuser is a rare female born werewolf who was once Grey's lover. Her jealousy of Belle is more than a little evident.What I really liked was that we get to see Belle start to open up to Grey sexually. Since she was a virgin, she knows nothing about the way of making love, and there's no better time to discover it than with your husband locked in a jail cell. There's really not a lot else to do. During this time, she evens starts to think that maybe this arranged marriage could be a good thing. The story ends with a twist that you will never see coming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31V0AP9YTJ9RY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOVUXAW#wasThisHelpful","R31V0AP9YTJ9RY","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a while since I have written book reviews. I took a sabbatical from them because I was burnt out, but now I am picking it up again. This book is the first one I chose to read. It's part of a five book series and for some reason I already had books 1-3 on my kindle. Each book is pretty short and if you put them all together you would have one book that would probably be around 250 pages. It was an ideal book to start back up with just because my kids haven't been giving me a lot of time to really sit and focus on any reading at all. The shortness made it so I could read the book in less than an hour or keep reading a few pages throughout the day and still feel like I actually got somewhere with the plot by the end of the day.That said, the story is very intriguing. This book gives you all the information you need to understand the dynamic between the Shadow Pack and Bleed City (the first is a werewolf pack and the other an actual town). Every 20 years, the people of the town send their 18 and older first born virgin daughters to be married off to the eligible male werewolves of the pack. This story is about Belle who is not looking forward to going to The Choosing. She was not the first born daughter in her family, but her older twin sister is no longer alive leaving Belle to fill in her footsteps. You learn all about The Choosing and a little about the pack itself in this story. Just when you think the story is in full force though, it ends. So have book two ready to go!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24EG53TE2UP0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K23MG7U#wasThisHelpful","R24EG53TE2UP0E","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With my first child, we used these cabinet locks that went through the cabinet handles called slide locks. They were only good for the double door cabinets. I had to move everything around in my kitchen so that the single door cabinets didn't contain anything dangerous for my child. Well when we moved into our new house, those locks apparently didn't come with us. I have a second child that gets into everything leaving even the single door cabinets needing to be locked. Not knowing what else to do, I have locks that screw into both the door and cabinet wall. I hated to put screws into my cabinets, but you do what you have to to keep your children safe. Well what if you can put locks on that use 3M sticky tape? Locks that are strong enough for your kids not to pull off the doors or drawers, but still easy for you to use?Introducing Purple Safety. I received these locks in exchange for my honest opinion. These locks use 3M tape on the back that you simply peel off the tape cover, place on your cabinet or drawer, and then line up and stick the other part of the lock in the cabinet. The package comes with a pamphlet of instructions on how to install these locks, but I found the pamphlet to be rather confusing. If you like really extensive instructions, these will be great for you. Otherwise, Purple Safety has created a much easier to understand set of instructions via a video. I found this to be quite helpful and you can find it on their youtube channel under the name of Tomer Rabinovich.I tried to use these locks in a couple of places. I planned to use them on my hutch which has glass doors that I really would prefer my kids not to be able to open so freely. I learned that these locks are meant for a specific kind of door or drawer. The piece that is considered the actual locking mechanism according to the package is about an inch long.You can stick it to cabinet walls or lips, but I would say there needs to be at least half an inch of surface area for it to stick to. Unfortunately, not having it stuck more fully makes it much easier to pull off. I learned this from my hutch. Also, you really cannot use these locks with doors that close flush to their frame. At least it didn't work in my hutch very well. The doors push in flush and the engaging portion of the lock forced the door to either not close or wedged between the door and frame. I'm having trouble explaining this clearly I think, but I took a video to help out with this which you can find on my youtube channel under phaedracamille.So as you can see from the video, there are types of cabinets that these locks will work well with, but I don't consider them universal. You need to do a little research before getting them. Look at your cabinets and drawers to make sure that you have a long enough flat surface for the actual lock. If you have the right type of cabinets and drawers, these locks are great for you!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12UBSS8IBVEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PNG1X1Q#wasThisHelpful","R12UBSS8IBVEK","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Butane torch lighters are useful to have in the kitchen, but they have other purposes as well. I recently did a review of Too Hot in the Kitchen, a cookbook, and did a YouTube video on White Chocolate Creme Brulee from this cookbook. Well In the process of making this dish, I tried to use the broiler to caramelize the sugar on top. The instructions say that this is one method to use if you don't own a kitchen torch. At the time I didn't. When I came across this butane torch lighter to review, I decided that I needed to try the creme brulee again.I was given this torch for my honest review. It does not come with fluid in it, for safety reasons. It has a trigger ignition to make it easier to light and a dual safety lock. Though I will tell you that I am unsure what the dual safety lock means. Like most torch lighters, you can lock the bottom where you fill the canister with fluid by simply turning the little wheel (see picture below).There's another spot on the lighter that says lock and I had interpreted that to be the second locking feature, but have since learned that that lock is to keep the torch lit. Once you have the torch lit, you switch use the lock switch to keep it lit. I don't see that really as a safety feature, but a convenience.The manufacturer boasts that you can use this torch on things like Light Welding and Brazing, Plumbing Repairs, Soldering, Jewelry Making, Hobbies & Crafts, Model Making as well as cooking and lighting cigars.We tried out the torch in two ways. My husband loves cigars, so our first use was him lighting a cigar. Since it was the first time we used it, we had a little trouble to get the lighter to start, but once it was lit it worked great. It lit the cigar evenly and quickly.The second way I used it was for Creme Brulee like I mentioned earlier. I took a video of this, so you can watch the torch melt the sugar. I will tell you, I wasn't able to get the golden brown color that most Creme Brulee has. The torch got too hot for me to hold after several minutes of melting the sugar. I don't think I used it wrong, but that is always a possibility. I was able to melt all the sugar, just not to the caramel brown color we are used to. The Creme Brulee tasted great and was better than when I tried to broil it the first time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PKW45PXSPMVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S8Q3MJO#wasThisHelpful","R3PKW45PXSPMVM","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll be honest, I don't actually do yoga. I have always wanted to though. I signed up to promote Aurorae Yoga's ""The Ultimate"" Racer Back Tank Top a while ago when I was going to sign up for a yoga class at my YMCA. While waiting to hear back from the company, I found out that the Yoga classes available were at times that were impossible for me due to my son being in half day preschool. There was no way that I could pick him up from preschool and go to the beginners class. I never signed up for the class, though some day I will learn to do yoga. That said, I am still writing a review of this tank top from a non-yoga stand point.First off, I love the material. It is made from 93% Lenzing Modal and 7% Spandex. The high quality Lenzing Modal Fabric is made with an Eco-Friendly, Carbon-Neutral process from 100% rejuvenating Beech Wood Trees. This is my second piece of clothing made from trees and I have to say I like it. It is super stretchy, lightweight and thin. When I originally signed up, I was 10 lbs heavier than I am now, so the size I received really is too big for what I like, but it is still wearable. The material composition makes it so that when you sweat, the shirt dries really quickly without you feeling like the shirt is wet or sticky. You also don't get cold.Below is a picture of why I say it is a little too big for me. The shirt bunches in my armpits and does not cover my sports bra. If I pull it down so that it is its full length, more of my sports bra shows than I would like.I wore the tank top while cleaning my house because I break a sweat vacuuming. I also wore it while chasing my son up and down the street as he practiced riding his bike while I carried my one year old daughter. I tell you what! That was a workout! I ran probably about a mile carrying a 26lbs toddler and physically pushing my son periodically to get him moving on the bike. Not once did I feel uncomfortable in this shirt though. It is super comfortable even if my sports bra was showing for my neighbors. At the time, I was too worried about my kids to care about that.So even though I currently do not do Yoga, I plan to use this tank top for any kind of exercise I currently am getting. I like the way the material breathes and how I don't feel my own sweat. That is great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y4LHI01E2BS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AU52WVK#wasThisHelpful","R1Y4LHI01E2BS6","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 14 month old daughter and another baby on the way. It will be a while before the new one gets solid foods, but I am always looking for ways to get my daughter to eat more variety. She does pretty good, but she won't let me spoon food into her mouth any more and she can't seem to do it for herself either. That means food like applesauce, yogurt, and pudding are not ate by her very often. When I discovered that there's such a thing as a reusable food pouch that kids can slurp food out of, I decided I had to try it.Easy Anywhere makes these pouches. They are dishwasher and freezer safe. They are also BPA-free, PVC-free and phthalate-free. It says specifically on the package and on each pouch that you should NEVER microwave them or boil them. Each pouch has a screw on cap that locks into place so they don't come unscrewed in your bag and so your child won't get it open unless you help them. It will help reduce the mess and make feeding your child a little cleaner as long as your child doesn't spit out the food that is! The bags have a super strong and durable zipper (like Ziploc bags only stronger) that you open to fill the pouch with food and to clean the inside of them (see below).I made pureed sweet potatoes to try in these pouches. My daughter used to love them back when she would let me feed her. Since learning to feed herself, she hasn't had any sweet potatoes so I figured this would be a good treat for her. If you're wondering how I made them, I peeled them and cubed them like a regular potato, boiled them until they were soft, and then pureed them in my Ninja. Using a spoon, I filled the pouches and patiently waited for my daughter to be ready for her next meal. There's a spot on the back of each pouch where I am pretty sure you write what is in the bag. I wrote on one and plan to check to see if the writing washes off when I wash it.When it was time for my daughter to eat, I first fed her myself using the pouch so she would get the idea that food actually comes out of the bag. Sweet Potatoes are a little thick, so it takes a little work to get them out of the pouch. I actually liked this because it meant she didn't squeeze it out all over the place. It worked wonderfully. She ate about 3 ounces out of it, which I thought was pretty good since she hasn't ate pureed foods in months.On the washing front, I put one bag in the dishwasher with all my other dishes. I highly recommend putting them on the top rack. It washed perfectly, except that my writing on what I thought was a label spot didn't come off. I have a way around that, so it isn't like the container is ruined. You can use scotch tape on the spot and write on the scotch tape. Then when you have emptied the pouch, you simply peel off the tape to show that there's something new in the pouch when you fill it again later.Video on YouTube on the channel phaedracamille.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1182SCRL7MEB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5DU1X8#wasThisHelpful","R1182SCRL7MEB9","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You may or may not know that my daughter has a lot of lung issues. I was recently reminded that we need to be extra careful every time she gets a cold because it can turn into bronchiolitis very easily for her. She had this back in September that resulted in her being hospitalized for two days until she could breathe easily again, but this last cold she had turned into it again. This time I was able to keep her air passageways cleared enough so that we didn't need another trip to the hospital (thanks to the Snotarator for that!). Along with using the Snotarator to suction her nose though, I had to use her inhaler whenever she got wheezy. I took her to the doctor and they checked her with an oximeter. They had to make sure that she wasn't breathing more than 60 times in a minute and that her oxygen level was 93% or higher. Thankfully both were good, but I was under strict instructions to keep track of her breathing. That's easier said than done for a one year old with a chest cold. It seemed like every time I tried to count her breaths she would go into a coughing fit. I thought to myself, ""If only I had one of those oximeters to tell me if her oxygen was getting low, then I would know if she really needed her inhaler."" Imagine my surprise when I discovered an oximeter to review! It's like a sign from God that I will actually be able to keep my daughter breathing!A little about the GO-410 Finger Pulse Oximeter before I get into how well it worked for us. It is FDA Approved. Measures quickly and accurately pulse rate and SpO2 blood oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin levels. The bright color OLED display shows real time Pulse Rate, Plesthymograph of strength of pulse, Pulse Rate, SpO2 level and Battery level. The built-in alarm can be set to High and Low. Battery life of thousands of readings plus automatic power off. It is light and compact, easy to carry around. Accommodates wide range of finger sizes. Not a medical device.This little device is pretty amazing. I showed it to my friends and they both had to try it. Sadly, I had the highest pulse rate of all of us. I have a cold right now that is cause me trouble with my breathing so my heart is working harder than it should. You can see that in the image above. You can set up alarms on it and you can tell it when the alarms need to go off. It defaults the alarms when the oxygen level is higher than 100% and lower than 94%. It will also go off for a pulse rate high of 130 and low of 50. Everything is operated by a single button but it is done by long clicks and short clicks. A long click will get you into the menu and a short click will change which item you are modifying. So the short click will move you from Sp02 Alm Hi to SP02 Alm Lo. You move down the chart and then use a long click when you are on the item you want in order to modify the number which will set off the alarm. There is also a menu to determine if the alarm is on or not. In that menu, you can turn off the beep that it makes when you turn it on, set it to demo mode, or restore it to the original defaults. The defaults are exactly what I need in order to take care of my daughter, so I am perfectly happy leaving it as is. You'll see in my video how well it worked on my daughter and then what I learned after using it on her. She's only one, so her fingers are still small.If you watched the video, you saw that the alarm went off for my daughter. It indicated that her oxygen level was around 80%. That told me that she needed to use her inhaler, but at that level it would have been very obvious that she needed it. She would have been struggling to breathe visibly. The whole reason I wanted this for a review was so I would have a better idea of when she needs her inhaler, so I tried a few things. I found out that if you wiggle your finger or only have it partly over the red light inside, the reading will be inaccurate. Good to know, huh? I tried it on myself and recorded it so you could see what happens when the red light is not completely covered. It is possible to use the pulse oximeter on my daughter. When she holds still it works and when it covers her entire finger. I tried it later off camera and it worked wonderfully. The key in the future is to make sure she holds still as much as possible and to cover her entire finger. I feel very confident that I will be able to use the GO-410 Pulse Oximeter to help me determine when my daughter needs her inhaler. I have to say, it is a great load of stress and worry gone knowing that I have something here at home that will help me to keep her healthy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R365OLSCFZ1NOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R59OS4S#wasThisHelpful","R365OLSCFZ1NOX","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For Christmas this year, I received one TopChips kit made by Mastrad. Since just before I conceived my daughter, we have tried to eat healthier. We are on Weight Watchers, which has been amazing for us, and I have done things like make homemade baby food for my daughter in order to get her to eat things like fruits and vegetables (which my son won't do). The biggest change that has happened naturally has been our intolerance for fast food. All the grease in fast food causes major issues with my digestive track now. I don't even use much vegetable oil or olive when cooking our meals thanks to my Green Pan from Ozeri. Well recently even eating things like potato chips have been causing me issues due to the grease they are cooked in, but how do you get crunchy yummy snacks without grease? That is where TopChips comes in.This thing looks too simple to make something like chips honestly, but I have used it a couple of times and so far it continues to make chips that do not bother my stomach. All you have to do is use the slicer to slice your desired fruit or vegetable into thin slices. I have only made red potato chips so far.Now I don't know if you can use a different slicer with this or not. This exact one is rather small, and the blade is not adjustable. It is made to slice your item to the exact thickness that will work with the chip maker. If you try a different slicer, you might not get the best results. Also, you cannot use it on really soft items. It is not recommended for things like tomatoes or bananas. The slices are too thin. So far I love my red potato chips. I have made them twice and even purposely left some out in a bowl over night to see if they would retain their crunch. They did. The only other thing I have not tried is making them and storing them in a container. So far we have have ate them so fast that there hasn't been any need for storing.The pictures above are of the actual thing you use to make the chips. You put the thinly sliced item on this tray (do not overlap) and microwave according to the wattage of your microwave. My only complaint is that I only have one tray. To make one bowl of chips, it takes me thirty minutes to an hour because I have to cook each tray of chips for three minutes. You can use as many as three at a time. I wish my mom had know that when she bought this for me because I need three trays to save me time. I have two little kids and they don't always approve of me standing in the kitchen for any length of time.If you are an all natural eater or just don't like grease, I highly recommend trying out the Mastrad TopChips. I can eat chips now without them bothering my stomach.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R192Q6GZCCYO2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005AV0RVQ#wasThisHelpful","R192Q6GZCCYO2K","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FoxMind Games has created something that people who have trouble figuring out how to spend time with their kids or grandkids can use to help them out. Time in a Box is less of a game and more of a time management system and time capsule. At the very beginning of opening the box, you see five things, four packages of cards labeled for the different seasons and a rolled piece of paper.This paper is a pledge that you and your child sign saying that you will try to do two cards a week. You will take the time out of your busy schedule to spend time with your child. Phones turned off or put away. No tablets or gaming systems to distract you.You do what is on the card with your child. Each card has a place for you to date it and right some comments about how the event went for the two of you. What I like about the comments section is that as an adult you can keep track of the things that worked well with your child or didn't work at all. You can avoid doing the things that caused you or your child strife simply by taking notes about your activities. Below are all winter activities that we have done.Each card, as mentioned before, is labeled for a different season. Obviously there are things you can do during the summer that you cannot do during the winter. There are items that overlap and depending on where you live, you might even be able to do everything year round. We live in Ohio. We definitely will not be having a water fight in the middle of winter.I'm a stay at home mom, so I actually do something with my son every day even though I am still taking care of the house and his baby sister. I try really hard to take one of her nap times to do something with him. We are using Time in a Box to help come up with things to do from time to time, but not all the time. My first thought when I opened this was that it would be PERFECT for a grandparent. It's easy to not know what to do with a grandchild because of the generation gap. We have always tried to make sure the kids see their grandparents once a week (yes both sides). It is difficult on me, but at least they really know each other. I am thinking of taking the box with him when he visits and that way both sides of the family can have suggestions on activities they an do together to really spend time with each other. It's a great opportunity for everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MRVN7HNW3TBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKLGMWE#wasThisHelpful","R1MRVN7HNW3TBN","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

On top of that, Gertie, her witchy friend and mentor, goes missing. Now she is tasked with undoing her magic on her best friend's boyfriends, finding Gertie, and finishing her own books.It's a funny story with a lot of twists to it. I get a kick out of how everything Leigh does seems to backfire on her. Her words get so twisted that it makes me wonder why any witch with the writing power would ever write anything on the magical writing desk. Though it does seem that even things she writes not at the desk and just sets on it actually turn into magic spells as well. It's a romantic comedy to me.

"Just the other day, I was standing at my son's bus stop waiting for him to get home. It was 12 degrees outside and I was freezing. I also was standing there for 20 minutes because the bus was running late. I always have my phone with me so I started to play a game while I waited, but the temperature was so cold that my fingers froze. Did you know that it is possible for your fingers to get so cold that the touchscreen won't register that you are touching it? Yeah that happened to me. I posted on Facebook that day that I needed gloves with just an exposed fingertip so I could play on my phone and keep my hands warm. Well even that wouldn't have solved my issue with my fingertip getting too cold to use my phone. What does someone like me need then? A pair of gloves that somehow work on touchscreens and still keeps my hands AND fingertips warm.IGotTech has exactly what I need! I jumped on this opportunity so fast because The EXACT answer to my problem actually existed. They are black gloves (which go with everything) and have grey fingertips on the fingers that can be used on your touchscreens. They are made out of very high quality material and fit snug on my hands. Very easy to use. They do keep my hands warm just like any other gloves. I have always found that no pair of gloves keep my hands perfectly warm, but these work as good as normal non-texting gloves. The only issue that I foresee is that they fit my hands great which means they probably would be too tight on larger hands. I haven't tested that yet, but I plan to get a pair for my husband very soon. He's been out of town and hasn't been able to try my gloves, but honestly I don't really want him to because I am afraid he will stretch them and they won't fit my hands as well. I'm selfishly keeping them all to myself.I have used them out in the cold. I think it was 22 degrees the last time I used them outside. They still worked perfectly. I am more than happy. If I had known bout these gloves before Christmas, I would have bought them for everyone I know. I am going to refer everyone to them. Seriously, cellphone stores and technology stores like Best Buy need to carry these all winter long.

"Easy@Home Ovulation and Pregnancy tests have been designed to make testing for your ovulation and pregnancy easier at home. While they were made for women who are ""trying to conceive"", they can also be used for women who are avoiding getting pregnant as well. The ovulation tests allow you to predict your most fertile days even if your cycle lengths vary. If you're like me, you have no idea when you ovulate because my cycles are very erratic these days. Having ovulation tests allow me to identify if I am ovulating when I think I am. Having these easy pregnancy tests help me to identify if I messed up when predicting my ovulations.Easy to test : simply dip the test in urine for 3 seconds; Easy to read: two lines means pregnant and one line means not pregnant ;Levels of hCG as low as 25 mIU/ml ( FDA standard) can be detected within 3 to 5 minutes. Results are over 99.8% accurate;100% customer satisfaction guaranteed : experienced and professional customer service are available for any questions coming up. Refund or return are acceptable by brand owner,who is dedicated to be the best home use tests provider.When I received this product, I immediately tried out one pregnancy test and one ovulation test. This is was my basis to compare later on because I knew I wasn't ovulating and I wasn't supposed to start my period yet. Both tests should have been negative and given me a good comparison of what the positive test strips would look like. Now I realize that the pregnancy test strip looks like it might be positive, but it wasn't. The little piece of paper at the end curled up a little and you are seeing the underside of that paper. I did indeed start my period a few days later, so that was not a positive result.I use an app on my phone to help me predict my cycles and ovulation. This really was a great month for me to try out this kit because my cycles have been so messed up that the app had me ovulating only four days after I finished my cycle. While this isn't impossible, I didn't really believe that was accurate. I immediately started using the ovulation strips in order to verify that the app was correct. I have discovered that it was very much incorrect. Thankfully, the ovulation test strips have shown me when I did ovulate so my husband and I could be more careful. My daughter just turned one, so we aren't ready to try again just yet. Something I did learn about ovulation testing though is that from the time you finish your cycle, your body starts producing the hormone for ovulation. So the strips came back a very very lite positive for several days before finally giving me something I felt was definite ""You're ovulating"" answer. So if you don't want to go through more than necessary, start using the tests closer to when you think you are ovulating. If you really want to be 100% positive of that day though, use as many as necessary.Now I won't be able to show you for this review that I am not pregnant at the end of this cycle due to time restraints for finishing the review. However, as of right now, I know I am not just because the tests have given us the information needed to take other precautions.I highly recommend using something like this to help you to either conceive or avoid it. It makes life easier and takes a load of stress off of you. I know from personal experience that stress can cause you to not conceive. I experienced that for a couple of months. Just for reading this review, you can get 15% off an order of Easy@Home branded pregnancy and ovulation tests at this link: http://healthcare-manager.com/collections/ovulation-tests. This is only good to the end of January though. So order fast.

"I have been drinking Insta Lite Weight Loss Tea for just under two weeks now. I was sent enough to have two cups a day for two weeks, but some days I just don't get to have both cups. The good part about that is that me not drinking two cups means that I wasn't snacking that day. The idea behind this tea is that you drink it between meals instead of snacking. So while I cannot really say if it suppressed my appetite a lot, I can say that using it as a replacement for snack works great. I started off weighing 182lbs and after almost two weeks, I am at 180lbs. With the holiday season, you expect to gain weight from all the cookies and candies and otherwise unhealthy food you tend to eat. I have not changed what I eat at all. The only thing I changed was that I tried to just have a cup of Insta Lite Weight Loss Tea in between meals instead of grabbing a snack. Now, I am a realist. I am sure that it is just water weight that I have lost, but losing 1lbs a week is the healthy way to lose weight, so maybe it's the real deal. Obviously, losing weight this slowly would take a long time to get anything significant enough to see. That is always the problem with reviewing weight loss supplements, you never get enough to see the long lasting effects so I can't vouch for it helping you lose the amount that they show in their pictures (See below).I like the way it tastes. I don't add any sweetener to it at all. It says that you can sweeten it however you want and it will still work, but personally adding sugar to a weight loss drink seems counter productive. It really doesn't need it though and I have drank it hot, warm, room temperature, and cold. Personally, I like it warm the best.The other part of this tea that I actually think works (since it is hard to tell something like this most of the time), is the immune system support. Both of my kids have developed a cold while I have been drinking this tea. It's the full chest cough and icky running nose kind. I haven't had any of it except a slight runny nose which is my normal for winter and not a cold. You might think, ""You must have a better immune system than them right now, but my husband literally got up this morning to tell me that he is fighting what they have and losing. I interpret that to mean that the tea is actually helping me to not get sick. A great bonus to the weight loss element.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HOMA62YEK2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUZ1C6I#wasThisHelpful","R2HOMA62YEK2B","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dot&Dot Travel Accessories has something that every parent needs. As your kids grow, their car seats are turned to forward facing and long before you can reason with them, they learn to kick the back of your seat. Besides being annoying and sometimes painful, it's messy. Picture this scenario. It's winter and snowing. Your child has been walking through the snow to get into your vehicle. While you make every effort not to track a bunch of snow into your vehicle, inevitably some will get stuck to their shoes and melt. In my experience this causes a nice muddy streak on the back of the seat as they kick and wipe their dirty shoes on it. In some vehicles, this isn't too big of a problem to clean, but it is all dependent on the type of interior you have. The kind that are made of their weird fuzzy material are almost impossible to get all the dirt out. My pleather seats in my truck can be cleaned, but I can't get everything out of all the little lines in the interior.The protector came in this little plastic zipper bag that can be used for something else when not holding the cover. I intend to put diapers in it to store in my truck.Now I used to have this Eddie Bauer seat back cover that was made to hold stuff like diapers and wipes. I put it in my truck and the thing could not be tightened enough to 1) protect the seat or 2) hold anything without dumping it. When Dot&Dot approved me to review their Car Seat Back Protector/Cover, I was thrilled to see if my truck was just incompatible with this type of thing or if that expensive Eddie Bauer cover was really worthless. I am happy to report that the Dot&Dot Car Seat Back Protector/Cover fits in the truck amazingly! The top clips around the head rest and tightens a lot so you can keep it in place.The bottom has an elastic strap on one side and not elastic on the other side. So you stretch it around the base of the seat and it can slide between the cushions. it holds tightly and the protector doesn't move.I have given this protector a full week before deciding how I feel about it. We haven't have any snow, but we had some rain. Not a lot of bad weather to create messy shoes. I can say though that the cover has helped not feel the sting of kicks as much and it has protected my seat wonderfully.

"In Ashes of War you get glimpse at a relationship between two gods that had been torn apart and ""forgotten"" for over 1500 years. Ashlynn, daughter of Artemis, discovers that the father she has never known and whom her mother will not talk about is actually alive on Earth. He was cast of from Olympus for reasons unknown and her mother told that he was dead. Well...really she was told that he was no longer ""with them"" which Artemis interpreted as him being dead. The virgin goddess never attempted to look for Evangelos because she didn't think that her father, Zeus, would lie to her. Zeus simple mislead her and now she must decide if she wants to have Evan (instead of Evangelos) back in her immortal life. He was the only man that she loved and the only one to ever touch her. She gave up her virginity to him and conceived Ashlynn. He never knew that she was pregnant because he was cast out of Olympus before Artemis could tell him of the pregnancy.This novella is a short story giving you more detail about the gods in Lia Davis's universe. While it is part of the Sons of War series, it doesn't actually involve the dragon shape shifters all that much. It focuses on Artemis and Evan rekindling their relationship and trying to get Evan's godhood re-established. Zeus feels bad about sending Evan away and had hoped that Artemis would get over her love for him. He was wrong. Over 1500 years later, he is finally ready to admit that he was wrong (in his own way) and give Artemis the blessing on her relationship that she never knew she wanted. I loved how their relationship unfolds and thoroughly enjoyed the little bit of back plot given for the Sons of War series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJHRV2L4RAHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQ7YJJ8#wasThisHelpful","RTJHRV2L4RAHC","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Book two in the Sons of War series is just as exciting as the first book. This was another book that I read in less than a day because I just couldn't put it down. Ash (her preferred nickname instead of Ashlynn) is a goddess. She really isn't crazy about being reminded of this, but both of her parents were gods and she was born on Olympus which makes her a full goddess even if she is just a minor goddess of the hunt. Her mother is Artemis and her father it turns out was a god sentenced to an immortal life among mortals. His godhood was stripped from him for unknown reasons. Ash has been living among mortals for a long time though as she spies on the demigods and dragons for the gods' purposes. Her current assignment is to watch Ty, a dragon son of Ares, to determine if he is guilty of killing another Goddess (or two). Upon seeing him, she is immediately drawn to him. Apparently gods, goddesses, and demigods are immediately drawn to their soul mates. She has been trying her hardest to stay out of Ty's life, but it has come to a point where she must get answers directly from him in order to prove his innocence. This is her mission and if she must seduce him or even die in while trying, so be it. She just has to find a way to break down Ty's walls in order to get him to trust her. She must discover the reason behind his deep hatred of all women and try not to completely fall in love with him in the process.I loved this book, much like the first one. The most upsetting part about it is that there's only one more book in the series for me to read before I have to move on to another series or author. I love the mix of Greek mythology and the dragon shapeshifters. The character development i wonderful. Even though things happen over a short period of time, you really get the feeling that time doesn't matter in their immortal lives. A week to them feels like a day or even a month. It feels like it is possible to fall in love with someone without saying, ""I haven't known them long enough."" This is a problem I find in a lot of books, that the love couldn't have happened that fast, but I don't feel that way about this story. A fantastic read for those that love romance, Greek myth, and dragons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T2C6EX3P1IAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LE51YL4#wasThisHelpful","R2T2C6EX3P1IAM","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Greek mythos and Dragon shape shifters together in one book. Sign me up! This is a refreshing twist on mythology for me with enough of what I actually know combined with something new an exciting. Gwen is a demigod which in this story means that she has the blood of the gods in her but she was not born on Olympus. Being born on earth makes her a mortal and subject to the rules the Gods have placed on them. Gwen knows that she is Aphrodite's grand daughter, but after traumatic events that resulted in her parents' deaths via a scary black dragon, she does not accept that part of herself. She has the gift of persuasion, but she has locked it down for years. Unfortunately, a winged man keeps appearing where ever she goes causing her to move across the country to remain in hiding. Her fear of dragons comes to life when she meets the sons of War (Ares), the legendary dragon warriors. Her body betrays her by being drawn to Markus. She fears him and at the same time wants nothing more than to be with him. How can these warring emotions be reconciled? How will Markus deal with his growing attraction to Gwen when he is forbidden from mating with the demigods? How will he protect her from the dragon, his brother, who is hunting her down to use in a war against the Gods?I loved this book. There are some typos and if I hadn't been so into the story, I might have marked them for the author simply because I think it had to do with the conversion to MOBI. Don't quote me on that though. It was exciting, sexy, and entertaining. I read it in one day when I had planned to read it over the course of a week. I just had to know what would happen next. I am actually going to read the second book next because I am so excited about the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WAC32IY937R7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPPQ9G6#wasThisHelpful","R2WAC32IY937R7","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was gifted a copy of this book.This is a cute story with unique computer generated graphics. I don't mean computer generated as in clipart, but rather C.L. Murphy had to have painstakingly created these images on the computer. They are super cute. They story is tells about how Lobo and his raven friend Roxy find a blue-footed booby bird named Bobbie and help him to find his way home. Home just happens to be on another island in the Galapagos. They make some other friends along the way and even discover that sometimes facing their fears is necessary. I enjoyed the story. The only issue I had was that I kind of felt like I was missing a page where there were introductions with Bobbie in the beginning of the story. I had it on PDF, so I don't really think a page was missing, but I felt like there was a little jump in the story. My son didn't seem to notice this though so it could just be because I read more extensive books typically.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPHVZ8J514MVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MSUCZR6#wasThisHelpful","RPHVZ8J514MVB","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastically cute book! I absolutely love the art and the rhyming story. My four-year old son loves construction trucks. He has to point them out everywhere we go. His Nana has borrowed countless books from the library for him about these types of vehicles. I knew when I saw it that it would be a big hit. I personally loved the rhyming and how wonderful the descriptions of what each vehicle does was simplistically put for a child to understand. Yet the vocabulary is something that encourages kids to ask questions and learn. The song is very cute too.My son enjoyed the book. One picture on my blog has the story upside down, but he quickly righted it. He showed me the different trucks and identified the ones he already knew. He has a few books that we have read several times which taught him what some of the trucks do. He laughed at me when I sang the song and told me to just read him the story. Being that he just started preschool and they read a book every day, I think he just wanted me to do what his teacher has done so far. This is definitely a great book for your little lover of cars and working vehicles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E608WG1EYEH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500544930#wasThisHelpful","R3E608WG1EYEH1","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heed the warning in the description of this book. If you do not like to read about topics like rape, suicide, adultery, abuse, etc., this book is not for you. Alana has been through more than any girl should have in just shy of a decade. She developed faster than the other girls her age which caused her to be ridiculed for being more grown up than the others her age. Unfortunately, she caught the eyes of adult men as early as eleven years old. None acted on their desires until her father took advantage of her. She was so young that she didn't know it was wrong. This became a trend in her life. She was called derogatory names that really don't apply to a rape victim, but the other kids in school didn't know the difference. How any other them learned the truth, we will never know.Alana makes friends with Jack and Dave who have some serious problems of their own. They are the outcasts at school, but their misfortunes bring them together. Their closeness also causes them not to move forward with their lives. They latch onto each other in an unhealthy way where they dwell on their problems. Except for Dave really. He has found a way to move forward, but his love for Alana remains. It's just a question of whether that love is a healthy kind or not and whether Alana can learn to accept it for what it is. These are all issues that Alana must deal with in therapy. She finally has a therapist she likes and is making progress.The book alternates each chapter between what happened in her past and what is currently happening. It is a book about healing and that it can be a long, miserable road. However, I found this book rather depressing. Of course it doesn't help that I was reading it when dealing with my husband's grandfather's death. Much like how Jack, Dave, and Alana being around each other causes them not to move past their problems, my depressing family death caused this book to be even more upsetting to me. This concept is why I am not crazy about things like group therapy. I think hearing about other people's problems can make you feel better if their problems are worse than yours, but it can have the opposite affect if yours are worse than theirs. I think this topic was covered in this story in a subliminal way. It's well written, but not my thing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SPUV7N1M6KA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZRCETG#wasThisHelpful","R2SPUV7N1M6KA5","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was gifted a copy of this book.Emily Warren has been through a great ordeal but doesn't want to tell anyone about it. Her sister Suzette knows that there is one person whom Emily might reveal her secret to. Bill has been a friend of the family since Emily was six, but somewhere in her teenage years, she fell deeply in love with him. She never confessed it to anyone because she never felt good enough for him even though he was from a poor broken family and she from a famous actor/actress married couple. She never acted on her feelings and instead went off to college to pursue her dream of becoming a doctor. It was when she finally completed school that she nearly had the unspeakable happen to her. Under the guise of being sick, Emily is sent to Bill's house to try to discover the source of his ""migraines"", but really her sister sent her there to see if bill could get her to tell him what actually happened to her to cause her to lock herself in her childhood bedroom and not to eat. As a doctor, everyone knew that she knew better, so something traumatic must have happened.I really liked how Regina Puckett had the characters interact in order to reveal the big secret and pretty much how Emily's entire family reacted to it. Many women that suffer any kind of abuse are not believed, but Emily's family immediately believes her and supports her. The character development is great. Things don't happen too fast or slow, but you do still have those moments where you want to scream at them for not just speaking their minds. Of course, that's human nature. The love story is endearing. I found it very entertaining and am interested in reading the rest of the series. By the way, you can read these stories out of order since this is number three in the series. I don't feel like I learned too much about Emily's family to have ruined the other stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F9JXKSQLTMR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJ0N5G2#wasThisHelpful","R3F9JXKSQLTMR2","A1DI7FN3LMBVSM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DI7FN3LMBVSM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was gifted a copy of this book.I was immediately entertained by this book. The story is pretty short and to the point. You are introduced to a few immortals at first who are bantering about the ""equipment"" of the other immortals. It is quite funny. I honestly am not sure where they are though. The entire story teller about other realms but I don't know if they are based on any specific mythology. It doesn't impact the base story, but I am actually curious if it was real myth or author created. The importance is only when Samuel is sucked from his realm into Ella's realm, which I believe is on Earth. You see, Ella is a witch and she created a potion to summon her perfect guy for her for Valentine's day. She didn't expect an actual angel. Their relationship develops and Samuel gets annoyed being picked second in Ella's life by her zombie pet. You read that right. She has a zombie she is taking care of and trying to cute from his zombie curse.It was really entertaining and I really want to read more by this author.

"Finally, I have a matching set of crochet hooks rather than the ragtag bunch I've made do with for years. I received these for review and really like them. They are easy to hold and use, and the soft handles really help. Another reviewer mentioned that they are short, but I consider that a plus because they are easier to carry around. I prefer to crochet small items and had no problems with them.The case holds the hooks securely, but it's a little bit flashy for my taste.

I really like the thumb indentation.These are easily washable, but they do scratch. I get a lot of uses out of one glass, but eventually I recycle them due to scratches.

"I received this tea as a sample to use with a glass teapot from Tea Beyond. The flowering tea compares very well to other flowering teas I've had. It's always fun to watch the flower unfold as it brews. I always have flowering tea on January first; as I watch the flower bloom, I think about all my hopes for the new year. The tea is drinkable, but not as good as regular tea.Of the non-blooming teas, I loved the jasmin best. The earl grey was pretty good, but I didn't care for the caramel at all. That's the nature of samplers though, and it's still fun to try all the different kinds.

Tea Beyond also sells a flowering tea that works very well with this teapot.I will say it's fragile, since it's small and made of glass.

"Reading some of the reviews makes me wonder if we're thinking of the same product. Yes, it adds a touch of softness to the bed, but it won't be cloudlike unless you have a good mattress to start with. I bought it to use temporarily on an old mattress that I'm about to replace. It makes it bearable, but I still feel every coil in the mattress. Imagine putting a nice fluffy duvet on your bed and sleeping on top of it  that's exactly what this is like.It does seem well made, and it stays put on the mattress without sliding around. I chose this pad in particular because I wanted one that would not add much height to my bed. I expect a foam topper would be much more comfortable. This has no resiliency and flattens completely when you lie on it.As for washing it, I don't. I put it under a mattress protector and it stays clean.

"As of this writing, Apple doesnt make a dock for the iPhone 6 plus. After a few weeks of fishing around for the cord that constantly fell behind my bedside table, I grudgingly I bought this one. I wasnt enthusiastic  Id envisioned something lower and more discreet. The other options were either more expensive, or else very cheap plastic.In person though, I love this stand. Its very easy to dock and undock the phone, it works perfectly with the Apple cable, and now that Im used to it, I love that it raises the phone up off the table surface. It makes it easier to see when my phones alarm wakes me up in the morning.It does take some assembly, which caught me off guard when the box arrived. Its in more pieces than youd think possible for such a little stand. For that reason, I dont recommend it as a gift, unless youre prepared to help the recipient put it together. The advantage is that it comes with three connector options that fit different types of iPhone cases.

In retrospect, choosing a case with a black liner would be more practical.The outer layer seems pretty tough; Im not worried about bending.

"I believe the pdf of this book is now offered free on the author's website.I read this because it's on Josh Kaufman's reading list of the 99 best business books, which is supposedly kept up to date - but this book has me wondering.It's interesting to learn how businesses changed as they began using the internet, especially before social media like Facebook and Twitter existed. However, this book is very much outdated. I looked up many of the businesses highlighted as positive examples, and most are either gone or have websites that look like they haven't been updated since this came out a decade ago. This isn't one of those books with timeless wisdom you can apply to modern situations. Some core information is still valid, but most of it comes from other books, which are extensively quoted.This book would probably appeal most to seniors who want inspiration for starting their own businesses after retirement. However, it doesn't give a full picture of what's available and what works best now.

"I thought I'd love this candle based on the description of amber, sandalwood and vanilla. Unfortunately, it has an underlying perfumey scent that I don't like. The fragrance is strong when you're smelling the unlit candle up close, but it doesn't fill the room when lit.The wick is actually made of wood and makes a gentle crackling sound, which is good for people who might forget about the lit candle. However, it does make a lot of smoke when you blow it out. The flame is bigger than I expected, and I trimmed it despite the directions saying not to. It's a soy candle and burns very slowly; the listed burn time of 50-60 hours is probably accurate. It takes a long time for the wax to pool all the way to the edges of the square holder.The glass container looks cheap, because the amber color is sprayed onto a regular clear container, and the metal logo is put on as a sticker. I was hoping it would be actual amber-colored glass so that I could reuse it, but the bottom is clear.The candle is made in the USA, which would have been more of a selling point to me than the pretentious story about experiencing `the same sense of privilege once left for only a select few.'","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7042UQ68RNN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDWQVB0#wasThisHelpful","R7042UQ68RNN2","A25HPZCFR9CY5W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HPZCFR9CY5W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, this candle does not smell like you think it will when you hear the name 'cannabis'. That could be a plus or minus depending on your perspective. It's a warm chypre, maybe veering a little towards masculine. I'm not sure how to describe the scent, but the website describes it as 'top notes of fresh lemon and orange, middle notes of fig and pepper, with a sophisticated base of oakmoss, sandlewood and amber-patchouli'. I mainly smelled oakmoss with a bit of sandlewood.This candle burns cleaner than most other candles I've tried. They say it's a blend of beeswax, soy wax and vegetable wax. The whole contents of the votive turn to liquid when it burns. I was a little concerned about the thin glass, but it's definitely heatproof. The candle has a great throw and made the room smell wonderful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IW6YGKOULMY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBHP27W#wasThisHelpful","R1IW6YGKOULMY3","A25HPZCFR9CY5W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HPZCFR9CY5W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have this speaker in purple; the color in the photo is a little brighter than it is in real life. I think it looks much better in person, and I love that they make this in so many color variations. It has a soft, almost rubberized feel. I also appreciate that it comes with a pouch for travel.The sound quality is ok for the price. Not audiophile quality by any means, but it works well for the podcasts I listen to and the volume is good. Im a little surprised by some of the reviews that rave about the great sound quality; we may have different standards. Or it may work better for bass-heavy pop music than the opera and symphonies I tried it with. Still, its decent enough for an inexpensive travel option.This is very similar to the more expensive Boomtune Macaron, which I also have. In comparison, the Xboom is slightly larger, but both use the same twist mechanism for expansion. The Macaron is more attractive because it doesnt have branding across the top. However, the Xboom has some features that make it much more useful, such as volume control and an attached audio jack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PAQED1GNTM28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8PNPAO#wasThisHelpful","R1PAQED1GNTM28","A25HPZCFR9CY5W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HPZCFR9CY5W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start with the obvious and explicable: this is a large, hefty book. The cover has embossed glossy parts; there's no dust jacket. The pages are a matte cream paper with a texture; it's a little thin, so frequently the content on the reverse page shows through like a shadow. I would have preferred thicker paper, but the coloured pencil illustrations are clear and vibrant.The endpapers are vivid yellow and there's a pocket at the end with the Decodex, a booklet with a brief essay from Serafini translated into several languages. It explains a little of the Codex's background, and reveals the muse who may have inspired it. I was worried that any (readable) text would either squelch the mystery or come across as pretentious, but the Decodex is charming.There are complaints about a large white sticker on the back. Warm it with your breath and peel it gently away, breathing heavily on it again if it gets stuck. The warm moisture of your breath should soften the glue enough for safe removal. I can't absolutely guarantee this method, but it worked for me. Go slowly!As for the content... if you are considering buying this expensive volume, you probably already know what you're in for. This is an encyclopedia from an imaginary realm, and depicts plants, machines, people, animals and all kinds of things that ought to make no sense whatsoever, and yet somehow do. The squiggly writing is not meant to be decipherable.The Codex is whimsical without being cutesy. There are diagrams of organs, skeletons and dismembered nudes, assorted bizarre creatures and a two-page spread devoted to showing a human couple having sex while morphing into an alligator. I personally don't find any of this disturbing, but if Hieronymus Bosch is too much for you, then you won't like this either.This book inspires a kind of fascination. I look through it slowly, curious and engaged, wordlessly piecing together meanings that fall away as soon as I turn the page. It will delight people who enjoy ambiguity and creating their own interpretations. It will displease people who like to get to the bottom of meanings and are bored by things they don't understand.If you think the Codex is your cup of tea, buy it right now, even if it's backordered. It's been years since this book sold for under $100, and I would expect this edition to sell out like every other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21LM1VESD0VZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0847842134#wasThisHelpful","R21LM1VESD0VZY","A25HPZCFR9CY5W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HPZCFR9CY5W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to love this needle threader, because it's so pretty. It comes on a lanyard and the design looks just like the picture. It works a little differently from most threaders I've used: you put the thread in a notch, and it gets caught by a little hook that you slide upwards through the eye of your needle.The problem is, the tiny notched piece is made of thin metal that easily bends. And although it's very thin, it doesn't fit into the smallest needle eyes at all. It's ok for occasional use, but isn't a tool to rely upon.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HS58GUHIPBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EBZO70Y#wasThisHelpful","R23HS58GUHIPBM","A25HPZCFR9CY5W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HPZCFR9CY5W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this would be a funny stocking stuffer for a family member who is enthusiastic about Obamacare. I couldnt tell from the description, but this is actually a deck of cards that you can use for regular card games. Consequently, the backs are all the same, and the reverse has cartoons and tidbits of information along with the card values. Each card is unique; the illustrations and info do not repeat. The cards feel pretty sturdy and well made.Those who oppose Obamacare will not appreciate the one-sided positivity, but then they wouldnt buy this anyway. I learnt a few new things, for example that screening for cervical cancer will be free for women over 30.Im removing one star for the typography.

"I bought this elephant to be used as a stool in the bathroom, but it's so cute that I'm considering using it elsewhere as a small table. It's better than the photo because it looks great from any angle. I'm a little bit timid about sitting on something that seems like it could break, but it held up fine when I tried it out. Compared to the more expensive Jonathan Adler menagerie animals I have, this has a less consistent finish; it's glossy in some places and less so in others.

"In the intro, Crilley says he did his best to make this 'a real how-to-draw-manga' book, meaning an emphasis on conveying narrative rather than just drawing manga-style characters as art. There are sections that explain his process start to  finish, planning a panel, composition, sequencing, inking, page layout and more. I especially liked the section on using point of view to convey narrative purpose.The bulk of the book focuses on drawing characters, both male and female. Some of the basics do overlap with volume I, like basic proportions of the body/face. However this book includes variations such as a worm's eye view, sitting, a standing kiss and foreshortened views. The harder poses are a good continuation as a level-up from volume I, but the instructions are clear enough that I think beginners could follow them if they take their time to get it right.I follow the author's Youtube channel and I've noticed that his style has evolved a bit since the first book was written. Lately he seems to be doing more traditionally realistic drawings, many of which are quite impressive. However, this book is more rooted in the manga style. I've read some criticisms of the first book that say it's not authentically Japanese enough, but personally I like that he portrays people of different ethnicities and ages, which I haven't seen as much in the Japanese books I have.Both volumes of Mastering Manga are good, but if you can only get one, consider what you want to learn. This book would be a better choice if you want to learn more about putting together a full story, whereas the first book had more examples of variations for details such as hands or eyes. Each book does stand on its own, so get both if you can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24HFHNFJVNSR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1440328307#wasThisHelpful","R24HFHNFJVNSR1","A25HPZCFR9CY5W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HPZCFR9CY5W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My terrible cooking is legendary. Someone I knew at university taught me how to make toast for the first time, but it was years before I realized 'broil' wasn't just a variant spelling of 'boil'. I once invited my best friend over to dinner; she asked if I were cooking the meal myself, and I admitted we'd be getting takeout. She brightly responded, 'in that case, I'll come!'Over the years, I've found a few little things I can make, but when I saw this book, I knew it was meant for me. It's a lovely cookbook, spiral bound so that it will lay flat, but with a hard cover for durability. The instructions are clear and each dish is shown full size in color. The tone is friendly and each recipe has a 'Don't Panic' note, such as 'Using an electric mixer may put you off, but it's only about as complicated as using a blow dryer.' There's a part at the beginning that explains kitchen tools and how to set things up, along with photos showing how techniques like chopping garlic and removing the pit from an avocado. The back has a glossary, a guide to in-season produce, a meat temperature chart, storage guidelines, measurement equivalents and a couple of pages for notes. Also, some pages have a little icon that you can use with a smartphone to view videos; it isn't necessary, but it's a nice touch.In the 24 hours I've had this book, I've tried two recipes. The Shepherd's French Toast (page 57) was absolutely delicious! I've always loved French toast but didn't think it was something I could manage myself. The book does assume you have things like multiple cookware items, but I managed to make the french toast one piece at a time in my only saucepan, and it came out fine. I know I'll be making this recipe a lot! I also tried the marinara sauce on page 133, which was also very good. I did find it a little spicy and might not use as much red pepper next time. I made both dishes with ingredients I happened to have; there was nothing obscure. The instructions are short enough that I could read through once and remember them while cooking.There are sections for chicken, meat and fish, but there are enough other dishes to make the book useful for vegetarians. Nearly all dishes outside the meat sections are vegetarian, which includes most of the book. Even the ones with meat could be adapted. (For example, I want to try the Tuna & Apple Pita Pizza without the tuna.) However, there are a lot of recipes with eggs, milk or cheese, so vegans may not find enough recipes to justify the purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS0TBNLJMRLF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451662254#wasThisHelpful","RS0TBNLJMRLF2","A25HPZCFR9CY5W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HPZCFR9CY5W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can tell that Erica Domesk is a very creative person who is inspired by many materials that most of us might overlook. Her projects have a lot of flair and personality. My favorites were the party decorations: fringe streamers, raffia-wrapped bottles, glassware decorated with paint and nail polish... there are some festive ideas. From the title, I would have expected a big focus on entertaining, but it's really just a sprinkling of party projects throughout the book. This is a shame, because Domesk's particular talent of turning everyday items into a fun decoration is perfectly suited to casual entertaining.Too many projects are things that most people would not want to own, let alone invest time and money to make. For example,  there's a cocktail ring made from an outdoor plumbing valve handle, and earrings made out of safety pins. Other projects would be charming for kids' costumes, like a plastic pencil box made into an evening clutch and a poncho made from a fleece blanket. In fact, I would love to see Domesek release a book of Halloween costumes for children; sadly, the accessories and jewelry in this book are already halfway there. I can envision a fabulously artsy person carrying off some of these looks, but if you're the type to rock Sharpie-embellished clothes, you probably don't need a book to tell you how.The home decor projects are a little better; I'm going to try the faux mercury glass technique, though I found better examples on Pinterest and more detailed instructions on Youtube. There's a moroccan mirror made from faux tin tile that's really pretty clever, but again it seems more like a flimsy party decoration than permanent decor. The low points are framed art of the word `love' scrawled in neon cord, and sticker dots used to decorate a table. Yes, neon sticker dots, the kind you get at an office supply store to tag items at a yardsale.The book itself is nicely hardbound and beautifully designed. The photo instructions are clear, and there are plenty of them. The book is light on text, which is fine - the pictures and videos give plenty of instructions. Yes, videos! You can get extra instruction if you have a smartphone that can read the codes included on several pages. I did have to download a special app to read the code, but it was easy to use. I think this is a great idea, and it's the first craft book I have with this feature.Still, this is the kind of book that gives DIY a bad reputation, the glue-this-to-that type projects that scream ""I made it myself"". A lot of projects assume you already have things like tshirts, tote bags, pillow covers or even a chandelier lying around waiting to be made over. If you don't, these projects will get expensive fast, especially since some include pricier supplies like peacock feather trim or Swarovski chain. This book might have some appeal to tweens, but most crafters expect a little more quality out of the items they make.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R0HMNWDGABOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGYMTYS#wasThisHelpful","R1R0HMNWDGABOM","A25HPZCFR9CY5W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25HPZCFR9CY5W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this bento box and use it nearly every day. I have the purple box and the colours are true to what's shown in the photo. My favourite thing about it is that it doesn't become stained from food like so many other containers do. At first, I wasn't sure if the parts would hold together well, since they don't lock together. However, yesterday I accidentally dropped the whole thing on the hard kitchen floor, and only one tiny drop of fresh spaghetti sauce escaped the bottom container.I used to live in Japan and have owned lots of different bento boxes. I thought I preferred the kind that has an inner seal and handles that clamp down. I would still use that type for soup, but this style is much easier to clean. I haven't noticed a difference in freshness between food stored in this type and the other. This also holds more food than most of the Japanese ones. For me, it easily holds two meals, depending on what's in it.I took advantage of the mail-in offer for a free extra strap and received it in the mail about a week later. I haven't had a need to use it yet though. The only negative I can think of is that the plastic utensils fit a little loosely in the middle section, but it's not a big deal.

After four weeks of regular use, I can't tell any difference in the milia at all. That aside, I still wasn't impressed with this product. The smell is so unpleasant that I dread using it; it smells just like Vick's vap-o-rub. I agree with the reviewer who said it makes eyes sting and water, but that only lasts a few seconds.

"This is a bag you either love or are bewildered by, but I think if you like it online, you'll like it in person. It's a great medium size, and the handles are soft and sturdy. It has both a zipper and a magnetic flap closure. The inside has a couple of open pockets and one zippered pocket, and there's a zippered pocket on the back. The striped part is canvas.It looks adorable, but the quality is mediocre. The zippers work smoothly, the metal spikes are solidly attached and the tassels on the front have real bamboo beads. However, my bag had a few loose threads, and the zipper stitching is already pulling away on one side. The lining feels cheap, and there is no extra lining behind the grommets, so it's not waterproof at all. The bottom doesn't have metal feet, and the pleather seems delicate. The tassels look especially fake, since you can see the white vinyl backing. I still think this bag is very cute, but I don't think it's worth even half the retail value.

"Tea, fig & tobacco? Hardly! This candle smells like a Christmas tree. Which isn't bad, but I wouldn't have purchased it in May had I known. I questioned the name 'gifted', wondering if it's a holiday scent, but there was nothing in the description to indicate it.I was expecting a warm, grassy scent and instead got this bright evergreen fragrance. As a candle, it's heavily scented and burns well. As perfume, it has staying power. However, I can't imagine anybody, male or female, wanting to smell like a spruce!Update: This candle does not burn cleanly at all. I use scented candles on a daily basis, but this one gave me a headache. Candles in tins are my favourites, and I loved the idea of using this as a wearable fragrance. I also appreciate that it's cruelty free. But I also have to say, as someone who buys many candles from a variety of makers, this is probably the worst candle I've ever bought, from the scent to the smoke to the headaches.

"This Byul is much prettier in person. Its skintone looks washed out in the photos; in real life it's darker and has reddish undertones. The doll has a nice wig that can be unbraided. The natural faceup and simple hairstyle make this a versatile doll if you'd like to redress it. It looks cute in traditional or modern clothes. The doll is fully articulated and poses well. Moving a lever on the back of the head will make the eyes move from side to side - they don't close.The clothing looks like the photo and is very detailed. It's worth noting that part of the doll's outfit uses real fur, probably rabbit fur. However, it's possible to remove the fur part and display the doll in her cotton dress and the cape-like piece that fits over the shoulders. The clogs (?!) fall off her feet easily, but might stay on better if she were wearing socks. She comes with an ornate orange plastic stand and a collector's card, in an attractive box.This is a collector's doll meant for adults, and is not durable enough to withstand rough play. It has a lot of tiny parts and one of the arms on mine falls off from time to time.

"This toy, or at least most of it's parts, will be in my home for years to come! The toy seems primarily designed for bath time fun, with holes in the shapes to allow water to run through, as well as decorative holes in the bottom of the green bowl to allow water to escape. The brown nose on the center face squeaks when you press it, but I'm not sure if this feature would work in the tub if it were wet. My kiddo isn't quite old enough to be taking full tub baths yet, so we play with this in the living room or sometimes when we go on playdates.Another awesome use for this toy would be sand castle additions. The little shapes are open on one side which would make perfect little sand stuffers for the beach. Would be great to toss in the toy tote for the beach day.This toy is well made, easy to handle, even for the littlest of littles, and will be around to take abuse for years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R199K99YNL7Q38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013Q13100#wasThisHelpful","R199K99YNL7Q38","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love this coffee & buy the kilo when we can as it is the cheapest we can find it (even with shipping from Amazon) per ounce. The 454 variety of Kicking Horse, in particular, is our go-to and we use it in both our French press and our espresso machine with delish results. Coffee preference varies so much by individual so I'm sure there will be plenty of folks that don't enjoy this, but this is the coffee we love and get every time we're able to.

"These gorgeous blue simulated sapphire studs are a great addition to my jewelry box. While my office wear is generally business casual, every once in awhile we have a formal business meeting or get together that I need to dress up a bit for. These will be my go-to's for such occasions. They would also work well for any other formal or semi-formal event you might have to attend, but I could also see these glamming up some awesome jeans, t-shirt, & heels combo.The only thing I'm not terribly fond of is how heavy these are for their size. The sides do stick up a bit, maybe 1/8"" or so, and while this side detailing is beautiful, I feel it pointlessly adds to the overall weight of the stud resulting in it sagging on the ear a bit. I think if the post were higher set on the earring it might counter this, but they are a bit droopy for my taste.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HAF4JZE65JCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JC0BJPY#wasThisHelpful","R3HAF4JZE65JCX","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and I sat down to play this and had a pretty good time of it. We come from different game preferences; He is a fan of the written series and generally enjoys strategy games, and I have never read or watched the series and am rather terrible at strategy games. He also has a background in strategy card games while I do not. I found the game to be a little more confusing than he did, but I think this just has to do with him being more adept at interpreting several rules per phase of each turn while it is harder for me to keep track of so much at one time.The gameplay is not fast-paced, but with some practice the games will get quicker. Learning the rules and cards and abilities will help with this and the only way to do this is to just play the game.While I know nothing of the story line or lore, my husband does and says it follows the books pretty well. Even with my lack of knowledge, the game is still very enjoyable and I don't feel like I'm missing something or not 'getting it'.A few things I didn't like about the game - I hear the first edition of this same game is not compatible with this edition. All the cards that were published before for the game are now obsolete. This is a pretty huge drawback for me and I would hate to have to keep sinking the same start up capital over and over again into a game that I enjoyed because the makers chose to do this. Allowing the cards to be used across editions of the same game seems like a better way to keep players returning for more rather than forcing them to purchase all new cards.Another thing I do not enjoy about the game is the complexity without there being too much strategy involved. From the couple of playthroughs that we did, it seemed like the game encourages you to really duke it out between two players, but there isn't much reward for me. Again, this isn't my type of game to begin with, so it could be something I just don't enjoy and others do.Overall, I would recommend this to people who have regular game nights with their family and friends, and who have a couple people handy that have some sort of background in strategy card games to help out along the way with rules and such. I look forward to keeping this in our rotation for our game nights and really hope future editions will be compatible!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MBQTSJG6NG6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633441903#wasThisHelpful","R2MBQTSJG6NG6C","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Giving this four stars because sometimes my baby just refuses to eat this, but as we all know that doesn't really mean anything when you're trying to feed a baby.I tried some of this myself - without the breastmilk - and it tastes pretty bland. There is an apple flavor there but it's not overly sweet or fake tasting. The cereal itself was a bit gritty and coarse, but I literally ate some dry powder off the spoon, so not the best judge there. I would assume if it sat in some liquid for a while, hot or cold, that it would soften up quite a bit.As with any other cereal you feed to babies, this will get hard and lumpy if not stirred well and enough liquid is added. We don't follow the directions whatsoever on this package and just kind of eyeball it and make a gruel with the powder when we want to spoon feed her and just put some directly into a small bottle for a thick milk / super thin cereal bottle at night with a nipple that we cut a slit in the end of.Baby will sometimes eat this, sometimes not. I like that the ingredients are recognizable and that I think it tastes pretty okay, too. We're not huge cereal feeders and usually only do it for a comfort measure for her (after a bath, before bed, etc.), but when we do give it to her, it's nice to know she's getting good quality food. We stay away from super processed foods, so we try to keep her away from them too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R264W4EP13KKI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J8DYVXC#wasThisHelpful","R264W4EP13KKI1","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I think the glare-free, halo-free, shadow-free adjectives are a little absurd to describe the light output of a lamp, I do really like the desk lamp. It has two light settings that are selected by holding down the power button for one second. The power button itself is a touch-sensitive button, so there isn't any mechanical feedback to it, i.e. you don't feel it click on or off. I like the silence of it, honestly, as silly as that sounds.While I do wish the head swiveled back and forth, the up and down movement of it seems to be adequate for lighting my desk. I like the USB charger that is on the side and the little cubby is nice for holding small gadgets or your phone while they charge from the port.The design itself is okay and I do feel that the plastic is a bit cheap looking for the price point this lamp is at, but that doesn't take away from the lamp in any way.The light output is sufficient for my desk and would also be great for a bedside table, but I wouldn't try to use it for much more than that. This is great for task lighting at my desk, but I wouldn't want to depend solely on this for long hours if I needed lighting for a specific need like crafting or small detail work on something.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24FUQYI7MGCHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW793M#wasThisHelpful","R24FUQYI7MGCHY","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am familiar with De'Longhi products from an acquaintance who for many years had an older model cappuccino machine from that company. I knew the quality and durability of their products, so I was excited to get this in and started up!From doorstep to cappuccino in hand was about 10 to 15 minutes, so set up time is short and directions are super easy to follow even for someone who has never made drinks with this type of machine before.After setup, which is basically giving things a bit of a wash (my preferences, this is not included in the directions for setup) and then running a full tank of water through the machine, you're ready to go.The machine is lightweight and takes up as much counter space as a regular drip coffee pot would, so there is minimal space investment with this machine. I did find the filter holder to be hard to turn once it's seated in the boiler outlet, and because of the light weight of the machine - even with the water tank full - I had to press my hand against the side to brace the machine while I attached it. Most probably won't have this issue, but I'm not the strongest in my upper body.The milk steamer worked great with our soy and we sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top for a nice treat. Te Get Started book that comes in the box includes the different drinks you can make such as cappuccino, cafe latte, Americano, etc.In addition to regular ground espresso, the machine will also take espresso pods if you prefer to deal with the grounds that way making cleanup easier. There are some descaling instructions in the owner's manual, but first time espresso machine owners should really take some time to get to know the machine and the different areas that should be cleaned after each use to keep the machine in top form.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T6IQTG3JANZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCP6ZNU#wasThisHelpful","R2T6IQTG3JANZP","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is supremely robust accounting software that is perfect for small to mid-sized business that are seriously keeping track of their own accounting, with or without the assistance of a CPA.I have a small business that I run with my sister and my husband and this software makes keeping all of us on the same page a breeze - especially because my sister is located in a different state. I love that you can seamlessly export to Excel much of the data - this makes storage and sending info to others really easy for us.The main draw to this software is the breadth of service that is offered here. Shipping automation, task management, cost estimates and comparisons, and tons of other features are available for use. There is even features that let you forecast your options in pricing and purchasing and training. I love that we can do everything from here - payroll, bank account watching, business forecasting, and tons more.Installation was straightforward and typical of any software. A few steps and we were ready to go without having to install too much extra stuff on the computer.There is a HUGE drawback to this software. The price vs. life span of the software is not that great. While our business will be able to continue to use most features of the software in the future without the support and other features that will be disabled when the Sage service is up, all those extras are nice and losing them really sucks, for lack of a better word. I suppose I could continue to fork over the ridiculous price they want to allow me to keep these services, but it just isn't worth it after I've dropped such a pretty penny on the software.The software is truly amazing for what it is and I really hope that when our year is up, the bill won't be all that bad and we'll be able to keep it for a while, but as it's looking it doesn't seem to be the case.Despite the time limit on some of the features, I would still recommend this to anyone who has the capital to invest in good accounting software. It's pretty easy to use, despite the complexity and I feel there is a pretty good bang for your buck with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36CRE1PSPKZHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011I737WG#wasThisHelpful","R36CRE1PSPKZHK","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Essie is a leading brand in nail color and is also a 3-free polish, meaning no dibutyl phthalate, toluene, or formaldehyde in the mix. This particular shade I got, Coat Couture, is a beautiful purple gray color that has a shimmer of teal / green / blue in it.Because the polish is matte, the shimmer is much more subtle than what you would find in a high gloss finish, but the effect is amazing. I love wearing this color on it's own or mixing it in with a regular polish, creating a single stripe on each nail or doing just the tip in the gloss to create a more interesting look.The color is perfect for fall, but I can see wearing it year round without any issues. The color goes on well and covers great. One coat would work, but two makes this really stand out and last a good bit. Chip free for about two and a half days on my fingers (this is saying something as I'm currently an at-home mom who is constantly doing something with my hands) before I needed a couple touch ups.

"We are primarily a cloth diapering family, but when I do use disposables I use the Pampers Swaddlers. These diapers are the Swaddlers Sensitive and just like the regular Swaddlers, these do a wonderful job when we need them. Mostly, I use disposables when I use a carrier to avoid compression leaks with the cloth diapers and when we're going for longer car rides and I don't want to pull over every couple hours to change her diaper. These do a great job.The sensitive branding isn't too much of a step up to warrant the price difference, in my opinion, but we've never really had problems with extra sensitive skin, either. I can't say it won't help a babe with extra sensitive skin, but we just were not able to tell a difference. The diaper is softer on the outside and the tabs are white instead of yellow. Other than that, we can't see much of a difference. The scent is the same as the regular Swaddlers, as well. There is added aloe according to the packaging.These hold well for our child and we don't have too many blowouts. I can't say that a blowout is the mark of a bad diaper, it just happens.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OFCQAI83GG34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009TSIJFM#wasThisHelpful","R1OFCQAI83GG34","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my go-to dry shampoo and I use it almost every day.So why four stars instead of five? I'm still searching for the perfect dry shampoo, that's why. I'll list my two main complaints with this, and all other dry shampoos I've tried after going over the awesomeness first.I love the effectiveness of the product, firstly. I need to either shampoo my hair or do something to mask the greasy look after about 24 hours post-washing. This dry shampoo is great at doing that for me. Shake it up pretty good and spray on my roots in a few areas, let it sit while I brush my teeth, then use my fingers to give myself a mini scalp massage to work in the product.Another great use is for this product is texturizing. If you want to give your hair a bit more of a lived-in look when you've just washed it, spray a bit of this on the ends and work it through with a wide toothed comb.The two things I don't like about the product is the strong smell, which after trying a few flavors (scents?) of this product I found the Original is my favorite and the lightest scented, in my book. I also don't like the velocity of the spray that comes out. It tends to mess up my hair, but holding it farther out only applies product where I don't want it. I'm going for a worn-in look or just trying to touch up yesterday's look, not going for the wind tunnel look. It's not so bad, though, but wish it was a little more chill on those fronts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19KM6HJPE2DPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TB00DK2#wasThisHelpful","R19KM6HJPE2DPQ","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As with all other Presonus devices, this recording device has all the small details covered to deliver a truly world-class product. Some find that the limit of two inputs is limiting, but I never find myself playing more than one instrument at a time and wanting to record it. If I had a group to record, I'd probably do it in a different format for better quality, or just use an ambient mic.Beyond the two inputs little details like control clicks when you turn the knobs and the awesome software that is included with this recording device is really great.I had a little bit of issues when using this for the first time. The software is set to pic up the Mic by default so until I found this setting, I wasn't able to record properly.

"Sometimes the little things make a big difference in life; a new lip color or lotion can really give you a boost. I was really excited to try this leave-on Dead Sea mud cream to give myself a bit of extra pampering every once in a while.After using the lotion a few times, I've found that I prefer to use it when I bathe so that I can wash it off. The smell is way too strong for me and the product becomes oily after applying, so rinsing it off is my preference.Advantages:- Does a wonderful job of giving me super soft feet.- Thick cream that melts with your body's natural heat.- Can use and remove, and still get good results.Disadvantages:- The overpowering scent was too much for me and a big reason I didn't care for this foot cream as much as I wished I would.- As your body heat melts the oils in the cream, the product gets oily and did not quickly absorb. This would be perfect under some socks for the evening, but I don't like walking around in socks and I don't like oily feet for more than a couple minutes.- There are no ingredients listed on the bottle. For what it's worth, the product I received could have been without it's outer packaging because I am a Vine reviewer, but it still struck me as odd.After the second use, I washed it off with a damp rag because of the smell and have since just used it when I'm taking a bath so I can enjoy the sft feet  without the lingering scent or oil.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D5ZM6ZWY82LS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SUY46E#wasThisHelpful","R3D5ZM6ZWY82LS","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a good amount of gaming that takes place in my household and I was very excited to try this racing wheel. I wish that I could give a 3.5 star review; the set is exceptional, but super expensive and a slight pain to get working on Windows 7 x64.Fresh out of the box my first thoughts were that this product feels well made, it is hefty and the hand stitched leather on the steering wheel feels excellent. The pedal base has a pop out pad of spikes to keep it from moving on carpet, which I found to work quite well without it tearing up the carpet at all. It mounts easily and securely to my desk with two clamps that screw into place.Some of the only issues I had installing the device was when I installed the Logitech Gaming Software package from the official website, and after successful installation, Windows 7 informed me it was an unsigned driver then disabled the device.  Heading back to the Logitech website I noticed under the details tab that Windows 7 users need to install a certain Windows Update, which fixed my unsigned driver issue.The force feedback on the wheel is quite strong, and I have it turned down a bit from the default levels. The Logitech software allows full configuration of buttons as well as sensitivity levels for the wheel and pedals.This really takes games to the next level and I highly recommend it for the serious game lover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AWQET40H69LG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z0UWWYC#wasThisHelpful","R2AWQET40H69LG","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Got this for the spouse - he's around 6' and 170lbs or so - in the large size. It fits him nicely and isn't too snug. He probably could have gotten a medium, but he prefers a roomier fit in all of his clothing.Despite the light weight of the robe, it is very warm but still highly breathable thanks to the silk composition. The fabric weave is a charmeuse, meaning that the outside has a sheen while the inside is more dull. It's very similar to the lining on men's jackets and the like.There are a few features that I really like about this robe.First is the belt. It is sturdily sewn into place in the middle back which helps prevent missing belts altogether. On my spouse's other silk robe, he has shoved his belt into one pocket to keep from losing it which, over the last ten years, has resulted in a permanently wrinkled belt that looks a bit scuzzy when he wears it. Sewing the belt into place only makes sense and it's a small touch that does wonders for the garment as a whole.The next feature I really like are the offset pockets. Pockets on robes are almost useless, but they almost always seem to be in an odd spot, like the front and center of your thighs rather than more along the side of the leg. These pockets are set off to the side a little more than usual for robes and the top is even on a bias so you can get your hands in and out with ease and little to no stress from the pockets pulling on the main fabric of the robe.My only complaint with this product is the packaging. I've seen others mention the same thing, but the packaging on a robe that costs this much should really be thought out a bit more. Mine came in a flimsy plastic sleeve with the robe folded around a standard cardboard square. Granted, I wasn't expecting much more, but I was just so surprised they couldn't find classy packaging to match the classiness of the robe. First impressions are very important for consumers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLR3OIMJ8GCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF7HAB6#wasThisHelpful","RTLR3OIMJ8GCO","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whenever I make purchases for my kitchen, in particular, my cook and bakeware, I try to make sure the product I get will last me for a good long while. I will never, ever understand the person that will re-buy a crappy pot or pan every five years. If you would have spent the money on a nicer product in the first place, the original would have lasted through several of the typical re-purchase cycles.That being said, this KitchenAid cast iron casserole dish is certainly a piece you will be able to hand down to your children. The manufacturers know this is a lifetime piece and even offer a lifetime warranty along with their product. In addition to this being microwave and freezer safe, you can also put this guy in the dishwasher, and use it on either the stovetop or in the oven. (ETA: This is NOT microwave safe - it is toaster oven safe, however, but not microwave! Thanks for pointing this out!)The dimensions given in the info boxes for the product include the handles, so the cooking area is about 9""x9"". I've used this pan almost a dozen times since receiving it. A few of the dishes we've done so far include shepherd's pie, which starts on the stovetop before finishing in the oven, brownies (the handy 9""x9"" size...), cornbread that stuck a little bit, potato gratin, and baked ziti.All our food has tasted fine and the flavors have not transferred from one dish to another. The nonstick interior really is nonstick for the most part. One of the issues I struggled with on my traditional cast iron ovenware is how badly thing stuck, even if I had properly seasoned the pan (or thought I had). Other than a little bit of cornbread that stuck in one of the corners, my batch came out just fine elsewhere.Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend this casserole dish as a good investment piece. There are brands out there you could easily pay two or three times this much for the exact same quality as you will receive with this casserole. I look forward to using this for years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34Z3P1FKNNM5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JS7FCRC#wasThisHelpful","R34Z3P1FKNNM5E","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are a primarily cloth-diapering family, but still having disposables on hand, I feel, is a must. Not only are these diapers getting us through those first weeks of adjusting to a newborn, but they also give our friends and family members that drop in to visit an opportunity to care for the child without hassling with our cloth diapers if they aren't comfortable with them.Another reason I keep disposables on hand is because many daycares or drop-in child care that is provided at the gym or church will not take a child with cloth diapers. Some family members or babysitters are not comfortable with the idea of changing a cloth diaper, and sometimes I just don't want my cloth diaper to possibly be damaged if they use them improperly.In any case, these diapers are fitting wonderfully, a couple of leaks around the legs, but nothing too serious. I don't really dig the Disney prints, but it seems near impossible to find major brand diapers without some sort of branding on them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OR2SSIAKAFKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TX1KIF4#wasThisHelpful","R2OR2SSIAKAFKN","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This socket wrench set makes a great starter set or addition to any toolbox. We have been hodge-podging together a toolbox of various, basic purchases over the last ten years or so, and these were a much welcomed addition.Advantages:- Set comes in a box that is peg-board compatible.- Easy to maintain and clean- Lifetime warranty gets me every time- One handed operation with the quick release button on the back of the wrench that allows you to change the socket being used with only one hand instead of twoDisadvantages:- The foam that comes inside the case to keep things from rattling around too much is pretty thin and isn't attached to the box at all. This will probably end up being replaced with a cloth at some point.This is an excellent set overall and for the price range, it is hard to beat the quality.

"After having a cat become diabetic around 6 years ago, we switched all our cat food and treats to grain-free formulas, with Wellness taking the majority of our loyalty. It's easy to find the brand in most of the major grocery stores and the chain pet stores.The Trufood line of the Wellness brand in particular has a very wide range of vegetables and supplements that have been added in to help provide a more complete food. I do not find that the step-up in quality is that significant over the current food that I use - the Wellness canned wet food & Natural Balance dry food - to warrant such an increase in price per pound. This is the only reason I'm taking off two stars. I just wish that for this price jump, there would be more of a benefit or fewer fillers and supplements than what is offered.My cats eat this and really like it, something I was concerned about as they tend to be hesitant to any changes in their diet. Their coat is still looking great and they haven't had any extra stinky breath issues since starting this food - all issues that I keep an eye out for when we change things up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PLVEKXJMTA5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZ03HJC#wasThisHelpful","R1PLVEKXJMTA5Q","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This simple and classic design in rose toned gold is is offset with a matte black ribbon that wraps around the center of the strap and surrounds the faceplate of this Kate Spade New York analog wrist watch.

I really like the black color the most out of the series as it has the most versatile function for my wardrobe.I am in love with this watch - the rose gold is perfect for both the office or going out at night and it has a such a classic design that it goes with literally anything I wear. Besides working out, if I am going out of the house I am grabbing this guy off my dresser without fail.The width of the watch is perfect, even for someone with small wrists.

"This AIO is a great starter for both newborns and new parents - or those parents new to cloth diapering. The diaper is designed to be very similar to a modern disposable diaper and I think this is very important for those just starting out with cloth diapers. The inside is very soft with a flip-out insert that is sewn into the diaper along the front side of the diaper. The back side of the insert has a pocket designed to hold an extra layer of absorbent material if you need that for a heavy wetter or an overnight diaper.I found that adding a flour sack towel, or even half of one, is a bit much for this diaper in terms of bulk and causes it not to fit the best in the world around legs, but this is different for each child.The umbilical cord area is not permanent - which is excellent for keeping the diaper in use for longer stretches of time - and is just a one-snap fold down area in the front center of the diaper. There are also rise adjusting snaps on each leg that can be used for those kiddos with the skinny thighs. I do wish that the flaps that fold around from the back and secure to the front came with more than just one snap for securing the diaper to provide for a bit more stability, but the diaper functions perfectly fine without it - just a personal preference.The design is super cute and vibrant, and is easily used with boy or girl clothing.

"I tend to put my hair through the heat trials - I blow dry and flatten my hair back to back some mornings and if I'm not doing that, I have a curling wand that I use on the highest setting. While I do use a good quality heat protectant spray before I use any heat, it only does so much. I still have to moisturize and make sure my shampoo isn't too drying or I'll end up with frizzy, lifeless hair.This smoothing conditioner is great at doing what it is designed for. A little bit goes a very long way with this conditioner and the product really coats your hair to provide lasting results throughout the day. I can blow dry after using this product and if I take my time with a large round brush, I can even get away without flat ironing the ends of my hair.

"This diaper has some serious marketing with it - they really lead people to believe, as evidenced by some of the other reviews here, that they are chemical free, contain only natural ingredients, or something else of the like.While they are made with substantially less 'stuff' than many other leading diapers out there, they still contain several types of plastic and it's all over the areas that are next to baby's skin. Polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, and a few other chemicals are all used next to the skin in this diaper whereas most of the plant-derived ingredients are found in the absorbent layers and material that covers the outside of the diaper.Advantages:- The diapers work at holding in major bathroom happenings. Things are kept where they should be the majority of the time.- White pigment is the only coloring agent in the diaper and plant-based materials have been used in this diaper where other companies use plastic fillers. This cuts down on time spent decomposing in landfills and the footprint of creating the diapers.- Less expensive than many other eco-friendly diapers on the market.Disadvantages:- The velcro area for attaching the diaper to itself is rather small and if you have a kiddo that likes to tug at their diaper if it's not covered, this might not hold up very well for you.- The marketing campaign behind these diapers does tend to make folks believe that these are either fully cotton diapers or 100% natural.I'm taking two stars away for a couple of reasons - one star gone for the marketing campaign behind these. Yes, they are made with friendlier materials for the earth, but the amount of folks that seem to think these are chemical free or a fully cotton diaper is a bit disheartening. I'm not sure to hold this against the company or the folks that assume this. The other star is gone for the lack of staying power on the velcro attachments.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL6WBPNAJXN2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOCKTUQ#wasThisHelpful","RL6WBPNAJXN2C","A12ENBT314RFXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12ENBT314RFXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"REVIEW OF THEATRICAL RELEASE BLURAY (SEE BELOW FOR REVIEW OF EXTENDED EDITION):This BluRay contains the 137 minute theatrical release of the film, plus the usual Bonus materials including an interview with the film's executive producer Rafaella de Laurentiis and a collection of deleted scenes.  The overall quality of the video is only ""fair"". I was disappointed to see that the transfer was made from a print of the film that was not in pristine condition. Specifically, it looks like they at least tried to clean up scratches, dirt, and smudges on the film before it was scanned, but the color saturation, luminance values, and contrast are inconsistant, being poor in many scenes, and better in others. It's as if pieces from many different prints of the film, that were not all stored in the same conditions, were cut and spliced back together. Many of the scenes have a faded, almost ""muddy"" look to them. Audio quality was also less than ideal in some scenes.  By way of comparison, I have BluRays of other films from the 1970's and 1980's, ""Blazing Saddles"" being a good example, that are MUCH better in image quality, even though Blazing Saddles was made 10 years before Dune. One thing to note is that the deleted scenes shown in the bonus videos are in far worse condition than the main movie: they're heavily scratched, faded, and showing tons of dirt specks and holes in the film emulsion, so it's obvious that at least some effort was made to repair the physical damage in the film print transfer for the main movie; it's just not as crisp, clean and bright as some other 30 to 40 year old films I've seen on DVD's or BluRays.Actual resolution of the film image isn't very impressive, and frankly this BluRay is not significantly better than a DVD, at least in my opinion.  On the other hand, the $11 purchase price is only a couple of bucks more than a DVD, so I guess it's reasonable, and you do get 5 or 6 bonus videos that you wouldn't get with a DVD.WARNING - Spoilers in the next couple of paragraphs.As for the movie itself, if you have never seen it, I STRONGLY urge you to read Frank Herbert's novel FIRST. The story is very abstract, and even though there are frequent voice-overs that give the viewer some insight into what the characters are thinking, I think you will get much more enjoyment out of this film if you read the novels first, or at least shortly after watching the movie. Remarkably, director David Lynch stuck very close to the actual novel, even lifting crucial lines of dialog right out of the book in many scenes. Some of the actors are far too old for their characters, especially Kyle McLachlan (Paul Atreides) and Sting (Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen), who are only 16~18 years old in the novel. But overall, most of the cast were good ""fits"" for their characters, especially Jose Ferrer as the Emperor, Virginia Madsen as Irulan, Jurgen Prochnow as Duke Leto, and Freddie Jones as Thufir Hawat. The only characterizations that I think were overdone were the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and Glossu ""The Beast"" Rabban. In many of Frank and Brian Herbert's novels set in the Dune universe, the Baron is a central character, and while he is undoubtedly corrupt, vindictive, scheming, vicious, and evil, he is not portrayed in the novels as an outright psychopath as he is in this movie. The same goes for Rabban, who is also portrayed as a raving lunatic and depraved psychotic in the movie, and doesn't come off that way in the novels.Unfortunately, 137 minutes isn't very much time in which to try and tell a story as complex as this, and the movie as shown in theaters (and in this BluRay), contains only a little more than half of the footage actually shot. Some crucial scenes are not in this film, or were shortened drastically, including Paul and Jessica's entry into Stilgar's tribe, and Paul's duel with Jamis, Again, a read of the novel is essential to get maximum appreciation for this film.  There is an Extended version of Dune, with almost an hour of extra footage, that may tell the story better for some viewers, but the extra footage is mostly in the first half of the movie, which leaves many scenes after the Harkonnen attack still uncovered.To younger viewers who grew up with films like Star Wars Episodes 1-3, the special effects in Dune will seem laughably crude, especially the sandworms and 'thopters, but remember that in 1984, sophisticated CGI was still in it's infancy, and it was not yet possible to marry CGI and live action in a totally seamless way, so Dune used animatronic models, like Jabba the Hutt in ""Return of the Jedi"". The difference being that Jabba was only a little larger than a human, whereas Dune had to try and portray sandworms that could be 450 meters long and 80 meters wide, with people riding on them, moving through sand in a believable way, and on a very limited budget. The Wikipedia article on this film mentions that the ""bean counters"" in charge of financing at the studio placed severe budgetary restrictions on the producers, and this is most visible in the special effects. Other areas of production, like costumes and set design/decoration, are surprisingly lavish. The very first scene in the film, where the Padishah Emperor is threatened by the Spacing Guild in the person of Edric, the Navigator, is extraordinary. One would think that the costume and set design budget for the entire film was expended on this one scene. The dress worn by Princess Irulan (portrayed by Virginia Madsen), is stunningly beautiful, and the costumes worn by other persons in this scene are almost as good, even though many of them are only passing through the room and are only on screen for two or three seconds.Summary: Dune (and I include all 6 novels of the series) was Frank Herbert's ""magnum opus"", This film by David Lynch was the first major attempt to translate the story into a movie, and while it was not very successful at the box office, it's well worth watching for Dune fans. It is especially gratifying to see how well the cast and crew tried to keep to the essentials of the novel, considering how often other Sci-Fi novels get horribly mangled in their movie versions (Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"" being a prime example). For the $11 price, and a few more cents for a bag of microwave popcorn to eat while watching it, it's well worth adding to your collection, despite the less-than-ideal, sometimes faded and muddy quality of the film-to-digital transfer.  I gave this BluRay only 4 stars instead of 5 because of the mediocre film transfer quality; the lower rating was not because the movie itself was less than what I expected.REVIEW OF EXTENDED EDITION DVD:Amazon won't allow me to post this review of the Extended Edition separately; for some reason they have lumped the reviews of the Theatrical Release and the Extended Edition separately, which is a shame because they are practically different movies. The total run time of the Extended Edition is 177 minutes, 40 minutes longer than the Theatrical version. What do you actually get in that 40 minutes? (WARNING, SPOILERS)1. A 10 minute long Prologue, that replaces Princess Irulan's opening monologue from the Theatrical version. This prologue isn't even video footage from the film, it's a sequence of paintings and drawings, kind of like a storyboard, that gives a brief introduction to Frank Herbert's Dune Universe, including the primary story elements and the main characters. They start the Prologue with the Time of Titans (~6000 CE), and the Butlerian Jihad (~10,000 CE) (although they don't use those exact names), then discuss the formation of the Bene Gesserit, Spacing Guild, CHOAM, and the Landsraad. All of this Prologue material is wasted on anyone who has read the book, although it may be helpful to other viewers who know nothing of the story. I found this prologue to be somewhat jarring; it didn't feel, look, or sound right. The voice-over narration for the Prologue was done by a male actor who I don't think was part of the original cast. I would have had a better opinion of the prologue if the narration had been done by Virginia Madsen, speaking as Princess Irulan. That would at least have been consistant with the opening monologue of the Theatrical release, and with the chapter openings in the Novel, many of which are taken from the various histories written by Irulan. NOTE: The Prologue has a continuity error: The narrator states the year as 10,192, whereas Irulan's opening monologue in the Theatrical version states that it is 10,191 (which is consistant with the dating of Yueh's death at the opening of Chapter 5 in the novel).The remaining 30 minutes of extra material in the Extended edition is additional film footage, some of which consists of brief extensions to scenes that are also in the Theatrical version, and other clips which were ""deleted scenes"", and therefore will be new to viewers who have only seen the Theatrical version. Much of the new material is concentrated in the first half of the film, which may give an ""unbalanced"" feeling to the Extended edition for some viewers. The actor who did the narration for the Prologue also does some voice-over during other scenes in the movie, this supposedly was done to ""explain"" the story and make it easier for viewers who had not read the novel to understand and place in context what was going on. I found this extra narration to be distracting, and wish it could be turned off, or at least that it had been done by Virginia Madsen (as Irulan).The image and sound quality of this DVD is okay. It actually looks better than the BluRay of the Theatrical release in some respects, probably because the higher resolution of the BluRay emphasizes the flaws, color fading, and other problems in the film-to-digital transfer (see above).Is this DVD worth the price? That depends on a couple of factors. If you don't already own any version of Dune, this DVD is double-sided: it will give you BOTH the Theatrical and Extended versions on the one disc, plus several videos of Bonus material.  If you can find a used one in good condition for under $15, it's definitely worth it. However, if you already own the Theatrical version, either on a DVD or BluRay, then it's a harder choice. That 10 minute Prologue is practically worthless to anyone who already knows the story, so you are really only getting 30 minutes of extra movie footage. The Amazon price for this Extended Edition DVD is $46 (new), which is outrageous considering the BluRay of the Theatrical version is only $11. If you can find a Used copy for under $15, including shipping, it may be worth it if you are a dedicated Dune fan and just HAVE to have that 30 minutes of extra movie footage. I paid $15, including S&H, and my copy was in near-new condition, so I feel like I got my money's worth.One question that occasionally comes up is the rumored 4 hour version of Dune. Rafaella de Laurentiis talks about this in an interview on one of the bonus videos. Apparently the sum total of the principal photography that was completed includes a bit more than 4 hours of film footage. But just because that footage exists, doesn't mean that anyone will ever bundle it all together into a ""super-extended"" version of the movie, at least Ms. de Laurentiis doesn't think it will ever happen. So, go make some popcorn and enjoy the movie as it exists. And again, to really get the full appreciation of this film, you really should read the novel if you haven't already.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XSHZJ6N8EL5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00371QQ0M#wasThisHelpful","R1XSHZJ6N8EL5T","A3BACUOZV1M0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BACUOZV1M0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The rounded edges make it a little safer to use on a squirmy cat than the rectangular models with pointed corners on the brush head.  My cat likes being brushed with this brush, and it does a good job of gathering up the loose hair.  Clearing the brush of the hair is easy: just start lifting the wad of hair along the back edge of the brush and with a combined lifting/pulling motion, the whole wad of hair will pull off. Recommended for short hair cats.  I don't have a long-hair breed cat to try the brush on, but maybe another reviewer does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1II7HJFH452AZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EQ9VMA#wasThisHelpful","R1II7HJFH452AZ","A3BACUOZV1M0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BACUOZV1M0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bristles on the brush are just what I hoped for: neither too stiff or not stiff enough. If the handle was 6"" longer it would be perfect. I shopped around for an all-plastic bath brush with a longer handle but could not find anything, so this model was a compromise. I suppose I could use a piece of PVC pipe to extend the handle.  For the price it's okay.  The ridges on the handle help you keep a grip on it when your hands are soapy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R266IXCXDTFVAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001D9U07A#wasThisHelpful","R266IXCXDTFVAZ","A3BACUOZV1M0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BACUOZV1M0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems like there are at least a million choices in tablet computers nowadays, so it's becoming very difficult to figure out which are the best values.  First off, you have to figure out what features and functions you want the tablet to have, then prioritize your list. AFAIK, all tablets can play music and video clips, and they all have WiFi so that you can browse the Internet and do email, and there are more apps than you can even comprehend. All tablets can serve as e-book readers, although some are optimized for this function, like the Kindle. There are even several choices in operating systems: various flavors of Android OS, Apple's IOS, Windows Mobile, and probably others. I am most familiar with Android v2 (Gingerbread), having owned a 4"" Samsung Galaxy MP3 player for several years, that came with this OS (I still have it and it still works fine, but the screen is too small for comfortable ebook reading, which is why I decided to upgrade to a tablet). I am happy enough with Android, and the available apps on Google Play Store, do I decided to narrow my shopping list to Android tablets.I looked at all of the available devices on Amazon, which range in price from $100 to $600, and screen size from 7"" to 10"". The very cheapest ones turned out to be no-name Chinese knockoffs of questionable quality and stability, with lots of problems reported by owners, so I eliminated those from consideration. Likewise, I decided to limit my budget to $350, so that cut off the big 10"" models with ultra-high-resolution screens. I also noticed that the 10"" models were double the weight of the 7"" and 8"" models, and I wanted something that would be comfortable to hold for extended periods of reading.Next, I started researching models for which user-replaceable batteries are available, a feature that's important to me, as I hate dumping electronic gadgets in the trash just because the battery is worn out and can't be easily replaced.  This search quickly narrowed the choices down: I found only a couple of manufacturers for which replacement batteries are available. One of these is Samsung, and the others were all brands that I had already eliminated from consideration for other reasons. I was disappointed to not find a battery replacement for the ASUS MeMo Pad seies; these were high on my list, due to having a much higher screen resolution at the same price point as most other brands, including the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.After extended research, I finally had narrowed the choices down to one of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 models, and based on weight, size, memory, and price, the 8"" model for $269 looked like it was the best value for me. I purchased the tablet and a MoKo case [http://www.amazon.com/MoKo-Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-Case/dp/B00CSMYBFS/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1395853862&sr=8-5&keywords=samsung+galaxy+tab+3+8%22+case], and so far after a couple of months I am very happy with the purchase.This tablet has Android v4.2 Jelly Bean as the operating system, which is similar to the older v2 Gingerbread on my MP3 player, except for one major - and extremely annoying - difference: Mass Storage Mode has been removed, and I have not found ANY way to re-enable it or add it back in as an app. Mass Storage Mode allows you to plug the Android device into your desktop or laptop PC with a USB cable, and easily transfer files back and forth between the PC and the device's internal or MicroSD card storage in Windows Explorer. Mass Storage Mode basically turns your device into an ""SD Card Reader"", just like you might use to download images from your digital camera's SD card. You can use various file management tools, like WinMerge, in Mass Storage Mode to compare (synchronize) files on the PC's hard disk to files on the Android device.Well, when I first plugged this tablet into my desktop machine, which runs XP-32/SP3, the only access I could get was ""digital camera mode"", which limits you to downloading JPEG photos, and only from the DCIM folder on the tablet. After many hours of research on the Internet, and downloading several supposed ""fixes"" for the problem (most of which did not work, including Samsung KIES, surprisingly), I finally found the following solution, that enables the MTP Protocol on Windows XP: 1. Install Windows Media Player Version 11. 2. Install Microsoft User Mode Driver Framework for XP. These two packages finally got MTP mode working on my PC, so I could see the files and folders on the tablet, but MTP is basically crippled from the get-go. You can not use file management tools like WinMerge with it, so it's not really a substitute for Mass Storage Mode.  All of the above problems I experienced are supposedly taken care of in Windows 7 and 8 with built-in MTP drivers, but I have no PC running either of those OS's to test this tablet on. And MTP is still a lousy downgrade from Mass Storage Mode.So, other than the unexpected lack of Mass Storage Mode in Android Jelly Bean, what else do I have to say about the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8""?  Overall, I like it! So far, I have two primary uses for it: 1. As an ebook reader, and 2. as a GPS navigator in my car. I have also used it as an alarm clock, as an MP3 player, as an Internet browser and email tool, as a game platform for playing chess, Angry Birds, and Freecell Solitaire, as a remote controller with a Canon 6D camera, and as a night-sky Astronomy tool with the SkEYE App (this app is really cool, if you live somewhere where it's dark enough to really see the night sky).1. As an ebook reader: the 1280x800 screen is adequate. Obviously, it won't be quite as sharp as the 1920x1200 screen on the ASUS MeMo Pad tablet, but it's not bad. The color rendition for looking at photos or videos is okay, if not brilliant, and the widely adjustable screen brightness can handle almost any environment except full outdoor sunlight. There's no way to make the screen contrast high enough to use this tablet as an e-reader outdoors in full sunlight. In any less challenging conditions, the screen is good. I use the built-in Adobe Reader with my PDF format ebooks, and re-flow the text. The tablet can also read TXT ebooks with the built-in Polaris Office app.2. As a GPS Navigator, this 8"" tablet can give some serious competition to a Garmin Nuvi. It is GLONASS enabled, which gives it better capability to maintain position lock in urban areas where you might be surrounded by high buildings, or in deep canyons (think Utah, Arizona, or any mountainous region). I use the MapFactor Navigator app with free Open Street Maps, and it works well (some stability problems, and occasionally obviously wrong turn directions, but this is a problem with the software and the map, and is not the Tablet's fault).  There are several other car navigation and GPS apps on Google Play, I just happen to like this one because the process of downloading and installing bulk map updates is easy and automatic. The big 8"" screen on the Samsung Tablet makes it VERY nice as a car navigator, compared to the much smaller screen on most cell phones, Nuvi, and TomTom type devices.Battery life for non-processor intensive tasks, like looking at still photos or reading ebooks, seems to be at least 8 hours.  High-power apps like playing videos, or any app that needs the GPS chipset or the WiFi or Blue Tooth radios, will run the battery down much faster. Browsing the Internet - which means using WiFi, obviously - will use up the battery in about 3~4 hours, same for using any GPS app, so be sure to turn off the WiFi, Blue Tooth, and GPS when not actually needed.  The included charger will pump up an almost dead battery to 100% in about 4 hours, and a 50% battery in less than 2 hours, assuming the device is powered off. When actively running as a GPS Navigator, the power draw appears to be as much as 2 amps, maybe even a little more, as my ANKER USB 12 volt, 1.5 amp car charger can't quite keep up, and the tablet battery very slowly goes down, rather than charging back up, until I shut down the GPS app.Speakers: As a music player, the built in speakers on this tablet are better than the ones on my old Samsung MP3 player, but not nearly as good as the speakers on some IPad tablets. You get what you pay for, and to be able to sell this talet for only $269, Samsung obviously had to save costs somewhere, and the barely-adequate speakers are one of the cost-savers, I guess. If you really want to listen to music or watch videos, you will have to plug in an external speaker or headphones.  The speakers are good enough, and actually quite clear, for the voice prompting of a GPS Navigation app, or whatever sound you set up for the Alarm clock app, they're just not quite good enough for real music listening.Controls: The power on/off button on my copy of the tablet is actually hard to work. I usually have to press it with the edge of a coin, or something else hard and small. Maybe this is a deliberate design, so that it's not easy to power the device on or off with an accidental button press when you didn't intend to? The volume control and the ""home"" button are both easy and don't require excessive force.Built-in apps and widgets: There are a bunch of these, only a few of which I think I will ever use. The Polaris Office, Adobe Reader, Alarm Clock,  Memo Pad, Email, Google Play Store, Music Player, SPlanner (a calendar app), and the Camera app are all ones I've used. For a general purpose Internet browser, I installed Firefox, and for a calculator, I installed Droid48, an HP-48 Emulator. I also installed The Hacker's Keyboard, which is VERY nice, and gives you most of the functionality of a the QWERTY keyboard that you use with your regular computer, including arrow keys, and a Delete key in addition to the Backspace key. The only downside of this keyboard is that it's a little larger than the default Samsung keyboard, so it takes up more screen space, leaving you less to see what you are typing.Size, weight, and Form Factor: The Samsung 8"" weighs in at around 0.8 lb, about half the weight of the 10"" ASUS MemoPad and  Samsung tablets. It is too large to fit in a shirt pocket, but might fit in the side or back pockets of some blue jeans. It should easily fit in most any purse, fanny pack, backpack, briefcase, or coat pocket.Screen touch: The screen feels nice and smooth, like gorilla glass (I'm not sure if it actually is gorilla glass or not), The usual swiping, tapping and pinching motions all work as you would expect - with bare fingers, but not wearing gloves or mittens - and the screen is easy to clean with a damp cloth.Cameras: The 5mp rear camera is okay, for if you ever really need to take a snapshot and don't have a real camera available, but there is no flash so it only works in daylight, or brightly lit indoor areas. The lens can focus on subjects as close as a 3"", so it's got some macro capability, and there is a 4x zoom function. I am not sure if this is an Optical or Digital zoom. Unfortunately, this camera app appears to be hard-coded to use a very heavy level of JPEG compression, and I have not been able to find a setting to change it. The files average 560kB, whereas 5 megapixel photos with ""light"" JPEG compression should be around 4 mB. This heavy level of compression means that photos with large areas of clear color, like sky, will show a lot of JPEG compression artifacts. The front facing 1 mp camera is very low quality.SUMMARY: A nice general purpose Android tablet computer with a medium-size screen. A good choice for someone who wants maximum functionality, but doesn't want the extra weight, higher price, and larger physical size of a 10"" model.UPDATE JULY 29, 2014: If your Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 came with Android v4.2.2 (Jelly Bean), I recommend that you stay on this version and do NOT accept the automatic update to Android v 4.4.2 (KitKat) that Samsung is pushing out.  KITKAT WILL CAUSE YOU MANY PROBLEMS, especially with Apps that store data on the external SD card.  Google made a significant change in KitKat that imposes a new layer of permissions on how Apps are allowed to access storage. For me, the worst effect was that as soon as I rebooted after installing KitKat, all of my GPS and Navigation apps stopped working, as they all store their maps off-line on the external SD card. I had to uninstall three apps, than download and re-install them, then download and re-install several gigabytes of map tiles. A MAJOR irritation that left me with no functional Navigation software for several days.  As far as I can tell, KitKat offers no noticeable improvements in the tablet's user interface, so from the User's point of view, it offers no benefit and will actually cause problems for you. Stay away - once you install Kit Kat, EVERYTHING on your external SD card is at risk: music, videos, documents, game stats, maps, etc. It's not that KitKat will actually erase these files, but the extra layer of ""permissions"" that it imposes on the external SD card will effectively render these files invisible to the apps they are associated with; to fix the problem, you will probably have to re-install the app from scratch, and may have to re-load it's data files from backup to reconstitute the association. Maybe not with music and photos, but that's what I had to do to get my Navigation apps working again.UPDATE August 5, 2014.  After months of frustration at not having Mass Storage Mode, I finally couldn't stand the thought of doing any more file transfers with MTP, and decided to Root the tablet and try out a Custom ROM that promised to give me Mass Storage Mode.  The first step, gaining Root access, was relatively simple: I had to install ROM Manager, SuperSU, TWRP Recovery, and a Root exploit I downloaded from the XDA Developers website. WARNING: The Root Exploit and TWRP packages have to be versions compiled specifically for your exact model device! Attempting to install any other version could ""brick"" your device.  So far, so good. After a little stumbling around and a couple of false starts, the installs were done, TWRP, SuperSU, and ROM Manager were running, and the Root Checker app said I had full Root access. So the next step was to download CyanogenMod.  Uh,Oh! This Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 (model SM-T310) Tablet isn't directly supported by the ""official"" CyanogenMod!  But I found a link to ""unofficial"" builds of CyanogenMod, done by volunteers for less popular devices. After a couple of hours of searching, I had located 4 different Custom ROM's that claimed to be for the Samsung SM-T310 8"" tablet. Also, at this point, I made a TWRP Full backup of the device. And I will be eternally grateful that I did, because NONE of the four Custom ROMS that I had downloaded would boot the tablet: all four caused unbreakable boot loops. After spending an entire weekend in ever increasing desperation, figuring that I had ""bricked"" my $279 tablet, I managed to revert the tablet back to the previous (stock Samsung) operating system from TWRP Restore. Of course I lost all the apps and had to re-install them, but my personal data was all safe on the external SD card so I didn't lose any of that.  Lessons learned: (1) Tablet computers have a lot of proprietary hardware in them unique to each brand - you MUST be sure that the Custom ROM you are installing was created and tested by Android-savvy techs, who actually know what they are doing, specifically for your model. (2) If your device isn't officially supported by CyanogenMod, it might be for a very good reason: that the Gurus at CyanogenMod simply could not find or create a Kernal that would work with your hardware. (3) Boot Loops are VERY common in tablets, especially Sumsung models, and I was very fortunate to have been able to recover from mine - many owners have irreparably bricked Samsung tablets while trying out Custom ROM's and Recovery programs, and had to junk them.  (4) After going through all of the above, I STILL don't have Mass Storage mode, and might never get it unless someone comes up with a build of CyanogenMod specifically for my tablet.UPDATE: July 16, 2015.  The Tablet has continued to function perfectly. I use it several hours every week, mostly as an e-book reader, car navigation device, and for general note-taking and listening to music. The battery is holding up well, and I expect to get at least a couple more years of service out of it. I also found a work-around (actually a Registry setting) that over-rides the stupid block that Google put on Android v4.4.2 that restricts  you from directly editing files on the external SD card. The URL for this fix is at: [http://trendblog.net/fix-kitkat-sd-card-write-restriction/]. NOTE: You have to have Root access to your tablet to make this Registry change.Also, after nearly a year of waiting to see if an official build of CyanogenMod would come out for this tablet, it appears that there will be none. I have been anxiously awaiting this, as CyanogenMod is supposed to re-enable Mass Storage Mode, which Google and Samsung have removed from the ""official"" versions of Android after Gingerbread. I tried one of the ""unofficial"" CyanogenMod builds and it put the tablet into an infinite boot-loop, nearly bricking it. Thankfully I had made a TWRP backup of the original Samsung operating system, so I was able to break the boot loop, but CyanogenMod appears to be a no-go, at least for the time being.UPDATE: November 20, 2015. I think the battery is starting to wear out and lose charge capacity. It still powers the tablet for several hours when just reading an E-book, but if the WiFi and/or GPS services are switched on, the battery will drop from 100% to 30% in less than two hours, which indicates that the battery has lost maybe half it's charge capacity from when it was new. Other than that, everything else is still working well. At one point I was thinking of replacing the battery, but Samsung has a couple of newer 8"" tablets with WXGA screens (2560 x 1600 pixels) that only cost $320 and have much better performance thanks to a quad-core processor, and that have ""official"" builds of CyanogenMod available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZT1333TZNJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D02AHEO#wasThisHelpful","R2YZT1333TZNJ","A3BACUOZV1M0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BACUOZV1M0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This small-footprint laser printer is amazingly fast. Warm up time is a few seconds, so it's a little slower ""out of the gate"" than an inkjet, but once it starts printing, it's much faster than most inkjets. Of course, this is a monochrome printer, so it's most useful for printing text documents (it might also be able to print greyscale graphics and photos, although I have not tested it that way for image quality). It comes with a ""starter"" toner cartridge, so I don't expect to get more than maybe 500 prints before it needs a replacement cartridge, but reconditioned Canon 125 cartridges aren't very expensive, around $25 for a 2-pack.Set up is pretty easy, but involves several steps: When you unpack the machine, there is a large instruction sheet with graphics showing what to do: all of the orange plastic thingys inside the machine are shipping restraints that protect the mechanism from vibration and impact, and also seal the toner powder in the cartridge from leaking - all of these orange widgets need to be removed. There are at least 6 of these, be sure to follow the instruction sheet carefully and make sure you have removed all of them before powering the machine up.This printer does not come with a USB cable, so be sure you have one already, or purchase one-they are not expensive. This is the standard USB printer cable, with the little square connector on the printer end, and the usual flat USB-A connector on the computer end. Also, when you are first unpacking the machine, you will be removing the toner cartridge in order to pull off the toner sealing tape: pay close attention to how the toner cartridge is oriented so you can install it back the way it's supposed to go.The printer comes with a CD of Windows drivers which need to be installed, and installation - in Windows XP - was easy and intuitive. Other reviewers have reported that drivers for the Macintosh OS are NOT included on the CD, and have to be downloaded from Canon's website. Some Mac owners have reported difficulties with installing the Mac version of the drivers; check other reviews for detailed instructions.I was pleased to see that the Windows drivers are quite small, in terms of how much ""footprint"" they take up on your computer. There is no bloated software program on the CD, like some inkjet printers come with, other than the drivers, so this printer would be a good choice for use with a laptop that has a small hard drive.Main reasons to buy a laser printer instead of an inkjet:1. If you are a person who only makes a few prints per month, a laser printer is a much better choice than an inkjet. The toner powder in a laser printer will not dry out and clog like the liquid ink in an inkjet printer that is only used occasionally. Toner may ""cake"" after a long period of disuse, or in very humid environments; if your prints start looking streaky or there are gaps, try removing the toner cartridge and shaking it GENTLY to fluff up and redistribute the toner powder. WARNING: Toner may leak when you do this, and it's messy to clean up, so do this outdoors somewhere, or over a sink or trash can, where any leakage won't be an issue.2. Toner cartridges cost about 1/3 as much per page printed as black ink for an inkjet, and that's assuming you manage to actually use up all of the ink before it dries out and clogs, something I have never managed to do, since I rarely print more than 2 or 3 pages per month.3. If you are printing primarily text documents, then a laser is definitely a better choice. When you do want to print photos, send them to a place like Walmart or Costco - their photo printing services are not very expensive, and you will get MUCH better quality images, on really nice, heavy photo paper, than you can get from a small home-use inkjet. Also, the prints you get from a photo store will last longer since the ink is archival quality and the colors won't shift or fade, at least not as fast as ink from a home printer.NOTE: because laser printers use an electrically heated fuser to ""melt"" the toner powder onto the page, this printer will use more electricity than an inkjet, but considering how much more you pay for inkjet cartridges, I believe that the laser printer is still less expensive per page. Just be sure to power it off when not in use.Printing quality: Looks pretty good, at least good enough for home use. I think the dots-per-inch specification is not quite as high on this machine as what you get with big Office laser printers, but this little Canon costs thousands of dollars less, so what do you expect? I printed some income tax forms yesterday that had lots of very small 6-point type font, and it was perfectly readable, although not quite as smooth around the curved characters as the same forms printed by the government on a color offset press.NOTES ON TONER REFILLING: I found a webpage with a very detailed, very high quality HD video showing step-by-step instructions and a demonstration of how to recondition, clean, and refill the Canon 125 toner cartridge used by this printer. If you intend to purchase toner refill kits and refill the cartridge yourself, this video is a must-see. The URL is: [...]. Also, the Canon 125 toner cartridge uses one of those memory chips that count pages or toner level, so be sure the refill kit you buy includes a new chip.WARNING: The toner cartridge in the video was empty and clean, which yours will not be when you go to refill it. Toner powder is EXTREMELY MESSY, and it will get all over everything. Cover your work surface with newspaper or something to catch spillage and do NOT tilt or tip the cartridge like the technician does in the video. He was doing that so the camera could focus on everything, but if you tilt the cartridge with toner in it after the seals and wipers have been removed, it will spill!Also, please keep in mind that the light-sensitive drum in the toner cartridge, as well as the rollers, wiper blades, gears, and bearings, are all subject to mechanical wear and tear in normal useage, and you should not expect to be able to keep refilling a toner cartridge indefinitely-at some point, these parts will wear out and fail, or the drum will get scratched (which will result in big black streaks on every print), at which point the cartridge is done for. However, the low purchase price for the printer and the relatively inexpensive toner cartridges still make this little machine a pretty good value for a home or small business user. If any Amazon vendor is still selling this machine for less than $60 (I paid $55 for mine), I don't see how you could go wrong. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25RY70S41X7C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BDMP8M#wasThisHelpful","R25RY70S41X7C1","A3BACUOZV1M0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BACUOZV1M0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I won't wade into the war currently being waged between Tolkien ""purists"" and Peter Jackson loyalists over the changes Jackson made to Bilbo's story as told in this film adaptation. At least not very deeply. Suffice it to say that these changes are many, and some of them are HUGE departures from the original story that were hard for me to swallow the first time I saw this movie in a cinema.  However, I have to say that much of the extra footage in this Extended edition is crucial, and I wish it had been included in the theatrical version. If you are wondering if the $10 extra for this Extended edition is worth it, I would answer that as an unqualified ""yes"". If you have never seen this film, and your purchase of this BluRay will be your first viewing of it, let me just say that Martin Freeman does a very good job of portraying a younger Bilbo Baggins; he doesn't look like Ian Holm did as Bilbo in LOTR, but I think he projects the spirit and attitudes of Tolkien's Bilbo very nicely. If you can accept that this film was made to: 1. make oodles of money for the producers, and 2. appeal to and entertain as wide an audience as possible, and if you keep it in mind that 80 years have passed since J.R.R Tolkiien wrote the original story, hopefully you can keep an open mind about Peter Jackson's handling of the plot lines and story and just enjoy it as an entertainment.You might want to consider that the additions in this film flesh out some characters, like Radagast and Saruman, that were barely mentioned in Tolkien's novel of The Hobbit, and that other changes add links to tie The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings together more seamlessly. Whether or not these changes were TOO drastic is up to you to judge, personally, I appreciate the extra element of pure storytelling pleasure I got from most of Jackson's additions.I also want to note that Ian McKellan (Gandalf), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel), Hugo Weaving (Elrond), Andy Serkis (Smeagol/Gollum), and Christopher Lee (Saruman),  all reprise their LOTR characters wonderfully, and the fact that this movie actually takes you inside the White Council (which the novel just barely mentions), is great, and I'm glad that Peter Jackson provided time for it in the screenplay. Without the White Council scene, Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee would not have had parts in this film, and their characters are fun to watch.  So throw some popcorn in the microwave and get settled in your most comfortable chair - this is a long movie (2 hours 50 minutes) and you won't want to pause it, at least not on the first viewing. Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT8YWQ8GW55EP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8S2JZ4#wasThisHelpful","RT8YWQ8GW55EP","A3BACUOZV1M0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BACUOZV1M0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This MoKo case for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and Note series tablets is a bare-bones folding cover. It is made from PVC embossed in a faux-leather pattern, and is available in lots of colors.  Structurally, the rim of the MoKo case is a hard plastic molding into which you snap corners of the tablet. The fit is very precise and the tablet is held securely enough that you should not have to worry about it popping out and falling to the floor. The ""lid"" of the cover is held closed by a couple of small magnets. The automatic sleep/wake function works exactly as desribed: the screen shuts off as you close the cover, and wakes up to the lock screen when you open it again. I wonder how this is accomplished? Maybe the front camera ""sees"" the lid open and close?The inside of the lid is coated with some kind of fuzzy material that I suppose was intended to simulate micro-fiber cloth and protect the screen against scratches; I assume this is the same material as the flocking on an air mattress, since PVC is what both products are made of.  The fit and finish of the MoKo case is excellent: all the connection ports have cut-outs that are very accurately sized and positioned, and there is even a small opening for the miniscule microphone hole that the Tab 3 has.I have a couple of reservations about this product's long-term durability and service life:1. As far as I can tell, the ""hinges"" that allow you to fold the lid into a makeshift support stand for the tablet, as shown in the Amazon product photo, are made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), same as the case cover, and my experience with this material, in applications where it is required to flex, is that it tears along the crease line after not very many cycles of folding and bending. With this in mind, I suggest that you avoid frequent folding the MoKo cover into the stand configuration, at least until the durability of the hinges can be proven some way.2. There isn't any actual padding or shock-absorbing material in the areas of the case that are the most critical to protect the computer from impact damage; i.e. the corners and the screen. This product is not an Otterbox case by any stretch of the imagination, and if you buy one, I wouldn't go around assuming that it will provide much more than a minimal level of drop and impact protection for your tablet. It also has no water resistance at all, being completely open around the edges, so you still have to put your tablet in a waterproof bag or box if you have to carry it outdoors in wet weather.  I know from experience that digital devices like cell phones can go crazy if even a tiny bit of rain water gets into the headphone jack or USB port.Ergonomics: I was hoping that this cover would make it a little more comfortable to hold the tablet for reading, but unfortunately, in some ways the cover is actually more uncomfortable than trying to keep a grip on Samsung's famously slippery plastic with the tablet ""naked"". The trouble is that the top cover isn't detachable, so it's always going to be there, flopping around loose and upsetting the ""balance"" of the tablet while you are holding it, unless you bend it 180 and fold it against the bottom cover.  And if you recall from my comment in the last paragraph, I don't think the hinges will last very long if you bend them a lot.I am thinking that I might try attaching a couple of elastic strips across the back of the case to slip my hands through for when I want to hold the tablet for reading. These will let me relax my fingers so I don't have to ""grip"" the tablet very hard. I used a Trimble TSC2 Data Collector for several years that had a heavy duty elastic strap across the hand grip that made it a lot easier to hold the device, especially when you might not have a convenient place around the job site to set it down, and end up with it in your hand for three or four hours at a time. With that strap, you could extend your fingers at any time to work out cramps and the data collector wouldn't fall.For the time being, I am giving this product only three stars, because my impression of it is that it isn't much better than average in build quality, and may not even be worth the $15 I paid.  If it lasts a full year without the hinges cracking, I will upgrade my rating to four stars.SUMMARY: A low price cover - IMO it is misleading to call this product a ""case"" - that gives minimal screen protection for a Samsung Galaxy tablet, but no water resistance for inclement weather, no storage pockets for extra MicroSD cards, only a little drop/impact protection for either the screen or the corners, and only a little ergonomic improvement for hand holding your tablet. It's only a little less slippery than the bare Samsung plastic, and there's nothing really for your fingers to grab on to. I guess it's better than nothing, and is possibly worth the $15 retail price, but it falls far short of an Otterbox case for protecting a delicate electronic device that costs $300~$600. The ability to fold it into stand for the tablet, and the automatic wake/sleep function both work as advertised, but I have a feeling that frequently folding the hinges in the top lid will cause it to fail fairly quickly.UPDATE: March 25, 2014.  I have upgraded my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars, something I rarely do. The MoKo case has turned out to be more durable than I thought it would be, with no signs of cracking or failure at the folding joints after 6 weeks of use, and it does make the tablet much easier to hold. I especially like the auto-sleep function, which is a feature one would not get with a gel-skin.UPDATE: July 15, 2015. I have upgraded my rating to the full 5 stars. This MoKo Case has surpassed my expectations in every way. It is still in perfect condition, despite my almost daily use of the tablet, with so signs of cracking at the folding hinges. I would buy another one if and when I buy a newer Samsung tablet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L4N32XVP5I26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTZGEKU#wasThisHelpful","R1L4N32XVP5I26","A3BACUOZV1M0WM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BACUOZV1M0WM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These ice cube trays are somewhat larger than the blue Sterilte ones that are also sold on Amazon and retail stores like WalMart, so you get maybe 10~15% more ice per freeze cycle. The ice cubes pop right out with a light twist of the tray, and there is less sticking and need to pound the tray on your kitchen counter, than with the blue Sterilite trays, which I also own a few of.  They seem durable and since you don't have to twist the tray very hard to pop the cubes out, they should last quite a long time before failure.

"This cable was purchased to allow a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 to access files on USB thumb drives, and it works perfectly.  My Galaxy Tab is running Android Jelly Bean 4.2, and it connected immediately to the 4 gb Kingston thumb drive that I plugged into it. I was able to see the drive and all folder/files content in the built-in ""My Files"" App on the tablet, with no special tweaks or drivers at all.  I have not yet tried it with an external HDD, as I don't have one formatted as FAT-32 (Android does not support NTFS drives), but I would assume it would work. The cable end connectors fit just right: not too loose or too tight, so the quality appears to be at least average.

"As a long-time author in both the traditional and indie fields, I've been watching the publishing landscape like a hawk. It's clear that the old models are no longer feasible for most authors (including me) but what is the new model that will create lasting and ongoing income? Jim Kukral's book delves into that very question. Fortunately, he has some answers.Traditionally, the ability for an author to get a book into the hands of readers has been controlled by industry gatekeepers (traditional publishing companies). Today, digital publishing has smashed that barrier. However, the question Jim's book raises is:  Can an author succeed by first going directly to her true fans?  This theory was tested on this book's release in a ""go direct"" campaign, before moving onto the Amazon platform. (I purchased the book as a Go Direct buyer) The key, as you might suspect, depends on how ""true"" your true fans really are.I love the way Jim's thinking about the future of publishing and about how a very old system of art patronage is being brought into today's publishing world. This book has really forced me to think outside the box and explore for myself ways to leverage the people who are my true fans.If you write - whether you ever go direct or not - take the time to read this book. I'm sure you'll come away with as many ideas as I did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NJCV493LPLGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQ2NZCU#wasThisHelpful","R1NJCV493LPLGK","A1ZW0UPEQ4XOG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZW0UPEQ4XOG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had previously purchased Wendy Owen's book on arthritis so was interested to read this one about fibromyalgia. Although it's not something I suffer from, my oldest friend does - and has for years. I know that one of my friend's most frustrating issues was in simply trying to get a diagnosis, as many of her health care providers didn't really think fibromyalgia was a ""real"" disease. I was hoping that by reading this book I could at least offer up some alternative suggestions.Fortunately, this book had several.I think the two most important things I learned was how debilitating fibromyalgia can be in terms of sleep. I know my friend complains about never getting good sleep because pain wakes her up.I loved the idea of the sleep diary because I do think it will help identify patterns like how sleep is impacted by stress or certain foods or napping, etc. I also think the chapter on a fibromyalgia diet was excellent, along with the alternative supplements that can benefit people who suffer from this disease.Just like the author's book on arthritis, this one is well-researched and well-written.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VL636YPPOLCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQASRLW#wasThisHelpful","R1VL636YPPOLCT","A1ZW0UPEQ4XOG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZW0UPEQ4XOG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Just wish more places within large cities were more like this.The author begins by mapping out the boundaries of Le Plateau as it sits within Montreal, then gives readers an overview of the language, culture and spirit of the area. Clearly more French than English, this neighborhood retains a charm that makes it (as the author says) more an experience than a venue.To be honest, prior to reading this book I hadn't really thought about going to Montreal, but Le Plateau is now enticing me to go north!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5FKJOSTOHE83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KY9PGBA#wasThisHelpful","R5FKJOSTOHE83","A1ZW0UPEQ4XOG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZW0UPEQ4XOG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I think it takes a lot of courage to get up in front of other people and sing regardless of the language - - but singing in a language that's not your own must be doubly challenging.  But, fun.

This book is a compilation of articles originally published in his newsletter - which I just signed up to receive.

I don't want to give away the story, but suffice it to say that if your intent is of a negative outcome, a negative outcome you'll receive!If you're interested in creating a wonderful relationship (or a wonderful life) - I highly recommend reading this book.

"I've been on a spiritual path most of my adult life and love reading what other people have experienced and learned along the way. This book was no disappointment. Whether you travel across the globe or simply walk outside your door, you have the opportunity to be fully present in your own life. While the author had the opportunity to be present in many exotic locales (Tibet, Beijing, Hong Kong), he also recognizes that being present in your own life doesn't require world travel, but it does require being awake.In addition to the chapters on travel and enlightenment, I really enjoyed reading about the many synchronicities the author experienced. Again, even recognizing that a synchronicity is happening requires being awake vs. walking through your life in a haze. Lastly, I loved reading about practicing psychometry in Tibet. This was a synchronicity for ME as one of the characters in a book I'm writing is a psychometrist!A good read; if you're not sure about the whole ""spiritual"" or ""enlightenment"" thing pick up this book - I think you'll find a bit of synchronicity of your own!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13YAJV0YHRPXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLY24IE#wasThisHelpful","R13YAJV0YHRPXK","A1ZW0UPEQ4XOG3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZW0UPEQ4XOG3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a fulltime author myself, I'm always in the market to read books about the writing world, including self-publishing. I thought this book had a lot of helpful information that would be particularly helpful to those fairly new to indie publishing. While the author inspires new writers to persevere, she's also practical about the nuts and bolts of the business, from marketing (a must!) to connecting with readers, to the various sites that an indie can get started (Smashwords, Goodreads, etc).

I thought I'd give her this book as a gift! In skimming through the contents (just in case I could pick up a tip or two) - I totally agree that clutter that's hidden is still clutter and it works on our subconscious mind just as if the junk was sitting out in the open.

"I have to admit, the whole gluten-free thing has always mystified me. One of my good friends was diagnosed with celiac disease and went gluten-free. Talking to her, it seemed to me that avoiding gluten might be a good thing for those of us who don't have celiac. Reading this book just confirmed my prior beliefs, probably because I also now think I'm gluten intolerant. As someone who has always had gut issues, it was good to learn more about gluten and its impact on our systems - particularly our guts.  Good info here - I learned far more than I anticipated.I also want to say a word about the recipes. For some reason I thought that gluten-free foods were bland and tasteless, but after going through the recipes I can see how wrong I was.

"As a long-time reader of the western genre, I've recently had the pleasure of discovering the books written by L.J. Martin. Mojave Showdown was my latest read - and among my most favorite. The story is about Ned Cody's relentless search for his pals in the Mojave and as the book's description said, it really is reminiscent of Louis L'Amour classics. What I enjoyed more than anything - aside from the story itself - was the author's ability to transport me to a time and a place through great dialogue and believable physical descriptions.I was captivated from the very beginning and could easily picture the wind in the gap, the raven cawing and Mangas Saragosa blending in with the shadows of mesquite. Because I spend a lot of time in the Southwest, I'm familiar with the scenery and can honestly say that Martin captures it incredibly well.  I also want to mention how well his dialogue suits the time and place as does descriptions such as ""his head caved in like a watermelon kicked with a pointed boot"" !

"My sister-in-law and one of my good friends suffer from RA, so I wanted to pick up this book to learn more about it - and to see if there were things I could suggest to them. First, I'm always more open to suggestions when they come from someone who has ""been there and done that"".  Secondly, the author doesn't suggest any magic bullets, but rather a well-thought out and sensible approach. For example, I found the section of the auto-immune section really interesting, particularly when talking about food. I am in total agreement about the quality of today's food and was interested to read the author's take on this as well as her thoughts about detoxifying the system. Interestingly, many of the foods mentioned are the same suggested for people with cardiac disease.I discovered so many things (thank you for the info on systemic enzymes) that I think are good for my own (non-RA) issues.

"The CARMEN legend gets a Spaghetti Western makeover in Director Luigi Bazzoni's 'MAN, PRIDE. AND VENGEANCE' aka 'L'UOMO, L'OROLOGIO. LA VENDETTA'- `1967.  Fresh from his hit Director Sergio Corbucci's 'DJANGO'-1966, actor Franco Nero plays the tragic soldier infatuated with the gypsy prostitute Carmen played by cult actress Tina Aumont.  Along for the ride is actor Klaus Kinski as her sleazy outlaw husband and a small cameo by Franco Ressel.  With a nice flamenco guitar score by Carlo Rusticelli and beautiful photography by the Director's brother Camillo Bazzoni. it never achieves the epic status that it deserves.  The Western action takes second place to the love triangle and tragedies that Carmen puts the soldier through as she slowly destroys his life but its slow in coming.  The archivists at Blue Underground have found the original negative and the transfer is flawless in HD 1080p with a 2.35 aspect ratio which looks like it was made yesterday.  You can enjoy the English dubbed version or the original Italian track with English, Spanish. or French sub titles.  Extras include an audio commentary with 2 journalists Henry Parke and C. Courtney Joyner which I have not heard , a great interview with actor Franco Nero and cameraman Vittorio Storaro in Italian with English sub titles.  Nero has great stories on the shoot plus his take on coming to America , Italian and International trailers and a poster and stills gallery.  Director Bazzoni would direct Franco Nero again in the excellent Giallo 'THE FIFTH CORD' aka ' GIORNATA NERA PER L'ARIETE'-1971 but this Western only starts cooking at its climax with a brutal fist fight between Kinski and Nero.  It's worth it just for that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O6PZ3H8QQFCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJ9N16Q#wasThisHelpful","R1O6PZ3H8QQFCB","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the Giallo genre was peppered throughout the sixties with works by Directors Mario Bava and Umberto Lenzi among others, it wasn't until Director Dario Argento's 'THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMMAGE' aka 'L'UCCELLO DELLE PIUME DI CRISTALLO-1970that the genre kick started into over drive causing other countries to get on the band wagon.  Here we have a British production Director Sydney Hayers's  'IN THE DEVIL'S GARDEN ' aka 'SATAN'S PLAYTHING'-1971 which is a cut above (no pun intended) some of the releases of that year.  Boasting the lead actress from Argento's opus, Suzy Kendall , it emerges as a routine thriller involving school girls being sliced and diced and the usual suspects of teachers are paraded in front of the viewer.  Actor Frank Finlay is wasted as the prefect of police and one of the main victims who survives is played by an incredibly young Lesley Anne Downe.  Director Hayers who gave us such classics as 'CIRCUS OF HORRORS'-1960 and the wonderfully atmospheric  'BURN,WITCH, BURN' aka 'THE NIGHT OF THE EAGLE'-1961 seems off his mark this time around.  The film emerges as a routine thriller resembling the West German Edgar Wallace films and the climax where the killer is trapped is the films only highlight utilizing the cinematography by Ken Hodges beautifully.

"The archivists at Vinegar Syndrome known mainly for reviving vintage X-rated films from the Seventies and Eighties have dusted off two rare Horror titles  for fan completists.  First up is 'CRYPT OF THE LIVING DEAD' aka 'YOUNG HANNAH , QUEEN OF THE VAMPIRES' aka' LA TUMBA DE LA ISLA MALDITA'-1973, a Euro/US production with an interesting history.  Started and shot in Turkey with a Spanish film crew directed by Julio Salvador, it was completed in the US by Actor/Director Ray Danton using L.A. locations and retaining some of the actors with extra sequences.  When a noted archaelogist turns up mysteriously dead on the reclusive 'Vampire' island, his son decides to investigate and becomes embroiled with a beautiful 700 year old Vampire queen overseeing a blood cult.  Resembling Vampire 70's cult classics such  as Director Bob Kelljan's 'COUNT YORGA, VAMPIRE' -1970 and Director John Hayes's 'GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE'-1971, it boasts a mixed bag of wonderful atmospherics trapped under slipshod film making.  It has a great cast in actor Andrew Prine , one of the best actors of that period, actor Mark Damon who flip flopped back and forth from Europe (he just completed Director Paolo Solvay's 'THE DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT' aka 'IL PLENILUNIO DELLE VERGINI'-1973) to the US. , actress Patty Shepard who also played a vampire queen in the Paul Naschy Werewolf saga Director Leon Klimovsky's 'WEREWOLF VERSUS THE VAMPIRE WOMEN' aka  'WEREWOLF'S SHADOW' aka  'LA NOTTE DE WALPURGIS '-1970 but here plays a school teacher and the beautiful Spanish actress Teresa Gimpera as Hannah who appeared in Director Jess Franco's 'COUNT DRACULA'-1970 among others.  You'll also spot Spanish actor Frank Brana and American Edward Walsh who played Count Yorga's valet 'Brudah' in the film mentioned above.  Vinegar Syndrome restores  the film in 2K Blu-Ray from a 35mm negative with nice color and is the best the film has ever looked.  It is ,however, the US cut which trims a bit of the gory shots included in the Spanish version.  The second bonus feature is a rare British Gothic rarely scribed about in Horror film books and round table discussions.  Director Ray Austin's HOUSE OF THE LIVING DEAD' -1974 resembles its distant cousin Director Robert Hartford-Davis's 'THE BLACK TORMENT'-1964 bringing Voodoo practices and Soul entrapment experiments into the Gothic mix.  To reveal the plot would be detrimental to first time viewers but it emerges as the better of the two films boasting great costumes and performances including the beautiful Shirley Anne Field who also graced Director Michael Powell's 'PEEPING TOM '-1960 and Director Joseph Losey's 'THE DAMNED'-1961.  Director Austin who was a stunt man/Director on the British Cult TV series 'THE AVENGERS' and who lensed the wonderfully delirious  'THE VIRGIN  WITCH'-1970  directs with style and flair right up to the films surprise ending.  Vinegar Syndrome releases it in 1080P with the quality ranging from overly bright to overly dark which shows that the original film source was obviously in poor shape but is saved by its clarity and stereo sound.  This release has no extras except for a trailer for 'HANNAH' and footage utilizing the 'CRYPT' title . It also has the same double Feature in DVD format and both are perfect for a midnight film party. It seems to be listed as a limited edition so get your copy while you can.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A685IRERS4F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZY5BX8Y#wasThisHelpful","R3A685IRERS4F9","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember back in 1987 that I was ecstatic over Michael Wheldon's book of movie reviews from his 'PSYCHOTRONIC MAGAZINE' that was the first time that someone collected hundreds of then obscure titles and commented on them with an open mind for Horror fans.  Now we have a Psychotronic book for a new generation that stands out even more .  Author Clive Davies has assembled not only Euro and American Horror/Exploitation titles but also an extensive collection of Martial Arts/Oriental and Indian films some probably being reviewed for the first time.  Having lived in Tokyo since the late Eighties, he had the ability to acquire and view many obscure titles from around the world that most fans never could get their hands on.  Mr. Davies covers the silent era all the way up to the present, some may quibble about the lack of certain titles but with the total of at least 8,000 films collected in this colossal venture, shame on them for grousing .  Each film is capsulized in alphabetical order by title and also lists the aka's, Director , producer, screenwriter, and actors .  Every fan needs this book in their libraries and kudos for Mr. Davies and his wife at having viewed each of these titles either good or dreadful.

"Here we finally have a decent transfer of Director Augusto Caminito's 'PRINCE OF THE NIGHT' aka 'NOSFERATU IN VENICE' aka 'VAMPIRE IN VENICE- 1988.  Available over the years in foggy ,scratchy bootleg copies in both VHS and DVD, One 7 Movies finally shows the film in its original 1.85 transfer where the cinematography by Tonino Nardi can be fully appreciated.  Unfairly trounced over the years by critics, the film emerges as an ethereal take on vampire love over the ages.  The film had a very troubled shoot with a very disgruntled actor who basically wanted perfection.  Actor Klaus Kinski had the original Director Maurizio Lucidi tossed off the set and started directing some scenes himself with Caminito arriving and refining the script .  Some sources list Director Luigi Cozzi as completing some sequences.  As the other reviews have stated, this film has nothing to do with Director Werner Herzog's 'NOSFERATU THE VAMPIRE' aka 'NOSFERATU,PHANTOM DER NACHT'-1979 and if you approach it this way, you'll appreciate it even more.  When an heiress played by Barbara De Rossi summons a Van Helsing like professor played somberly by Christopher Plummer to investigate her mansions haunted past , things start getting worse after a seance when the 200 year old vampire is summoned  on the eve of Carnival time in Venice. For the modern day Horror fan , Beware!  This is not a fast paced exercise that you're used to.  The film relies on the visual aspects and does not give the viewer easy answers to the set pieces which will cause frustration to some.  The power of the film lies in its subtlety. The film has a cameo by actor Donald Pleasence as the holier than thou pastor of the mansion who's presence is castrated by the power of the Vampire.  It is Kinski's show all the way as he overpowers every frame of the film and makes it the underrated nightmare that it is.  The film's only flaw is a hodge podge keyboard symphonic score by Luigi Ceccarelli and pop composer Vangelis which does not fit the film at all.  One 7 Movies has both the Italian and English dubbed versions and a photo gallery its only extra.  Recommended to serious Vampire film and Euro Horror  fans, it deserves to have a better reputation and kudos to One 7 Movies for releasing this nice transfer for American audiences.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8R0I7TN41B6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KT5P9XE#wasThisHelpful","R8R0I7TN41B6K","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Western Genre has virtually mutated into various action/adventure movies and television shows with its reverberations emitting now and then to prove that it has never left us.  Over the years we have seen low budget forays and big budget homages such as Director Quentin Tarantino's 'DJANGO UNCHAINED'-2012 trying to invigorate the genre.  Here we have Director Kristian Levring's 'THE SALVATION' and it turns out to be a wonderful surprise.  The film encapsulates the core of the quintessential Western: Revenge and Salvation all in its running time utilizing three major actors who are so underrated to the point of being ludicrous:  Mads Mikkelson who is currently acting in the underrated and unfortunately cancelled series 'HANNIBAL'  ; Jefferey Dean Morgan who always brings brilliance and intelligence to his roles and also lost an underrated series 'MAGIC CITY' to the corporate manure; and  the beautiful, bewitching Eva Green who is currently shining in the Showtime series 'PENNY DREADFUL'.  All bring a poignant resonance to the proceedings making this a revelation for Western fans.  You have read the plot in the other reviews so click the add to cart button  if you want to view a brilliant excursion buffered by the gorgeous photography by Jens Schlosser.  The locales of Almeria ,Spain abetted the  Euro Westerns during the sixties and seventies and now we have the arid,bleak landscapes of South Africa to aid in the films atmosphere. Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35DX0GHDVWUD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y0QOHG8#wasThisHelpful","R35DX0GHDVWUD8","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Little did I know what wonders would be found in the package that arrived at my doorstep the other day.  I know many of you Franco fans out there are wondering about the quality and research that can constitute a retrospective on the cinema of Director Jesus Franco .  Well, look no further for author Stephen Thrower with assistance from Julian Grainger has accomplished this and even more.  This is Volume One of ,it seems, a two volume series and this one covers the years of 1959 thru 1974 starting with 'TENEMOS 18 ANOS'  and ending with 'LES GRANDES EMMERDEUCES ' aka 'THE COLOSSAL BLOODY NUISANCES '.  Each film is presented by year release, alternate titles, production companies involved in the films release, theatrical distributors, a timeline of the shooting date to the theatrical release, cast and credits, full synopsis of the film, production notes, a full review of the film , reflections on the cast and crew, Franco on screen (cameos he appeared in ) the films locations, the films music , connections( where the film echoes other Franco films or ideas of films to come) ,other versions of the film, and press coverage on each film.  Had enough?  There's more.  The book has a forward by actress Monica Swinn, a wonderful introduction to what constitutes a Franco film experience, a section on the Eurocine production company and a conversation between the author and Franco and his muse, Lina Romay conducted in 2010 .  There is still more but that's for you to find out.  The book is super saturated with rare stills and photos plus 2 color sections which will knock your eyes out.  Author Thrower has greatly improved since his other tome 'BEYOND TERROR- THE FILMS OF LUCIO FULCI discussing each films positives and negatives without seeming redundant. It has almost been two decades since the first serious book on the Director 'OBSESSION- THE FILMS OF JESS FRANCO  scribed by Lucas Balbo , Peter Bluminstock and Christian Kessler was published and since then , hard to find prints of his films have become readily available thru DVD and BLU-RAY making this series of books long over due and we are blessed that Stephen Thrower and Julian Grainger have taken up the gauntlet.  Don't let the book's price throw you off, it is worth the treasures found within it's massive bulk and I think I read that it is a limited edition so act fast.  Alongside author Tim Lucas's quintessential tome on Director Mario Bava 'ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK', this first volume on Director Jesus Franco is essential for fans and film scholars alike and it would be a tragedy for any serious genre fan to be without it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N534JG09OMN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1907222316#wasThisHelpful","R1N534JG09OMN0","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I finally got around to viewing Olive Films release of Director Santos Alcocer's 'CAULDRON OF BLOOD' aka 'BLIND MAN'S BLUFF'-1967 and thought it was a real head scratcher.  The plot which is a slight rehash of Director Roger Corman's 'A BUCKET OF BLOOD'-1960 mixed with Giallo elements such as a raincoat clad killer on the loose never seems to get off the ground because screenwriter Edward Mann does not know if the film should be horror , thriller , or travelogue.  The film is also bogged down with endless scenes of people dancing whether in the streets or in a night club which bogs down the already slow crawl of the films running time.  Boris Karloff does what he can as a blind sculptor forced to create works under the nagging influence of his sister played by an obviously bored Vivica Lindfors.  The raincoat killer is procuring various people of the town to utilize their bones to complete the sculptures.  Director Alcocer who directed some minor Westerns in the Sixties tries to bring some artiness to the mix such as a bizarre nightmare experienced by Lindfors  but is stopped at every turn by the jerkiness of the script.  Even the beautiful Dyanika Zurakowska is reduced to just eye candy and used as another corpse for the art gallery.  I viewed the DVD transfer and its absolutely gorgeous in a 1.85 ratio with vivid colors but a slightly tinny soundtrack so the Blu-Ray is not a necessary purchase .  Boris looks tired and as usual, gives his all for the performance.  For Karloff completists only .","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5HAZ3NGY6829/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGBS6ZC#wasThisHelpful","R5HAZ3NGY6829","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a Bounty Hunter, make sure that you take care of all the angles.  It's liable to lead to fatal consequences as our titled hero in this lack lustre Spaghetti Western finds out.  American actor Mark Damon is the man is black in Director Sergio Corbucci's 'RINGO AND HIS GOLDEN PISTOL' aka 'JOHNNY ORO'-1966 but seems to spend a lot of his screen time behind bars till the inevitable climactic shootout.  Ringo takes out three brothers at a church wedding but leaves one alive since he wasn't part of the bounty.  In a rare instance for Euro Westerns, the villains team up with a local Indian tribe bent on revenge for the sheriff in the town of Goldstone who chased them off their land.  The story takes almost 90 minutes to get to the climax and for those fans who have seen it all, it may not be worth it.  Director Corbucci seems not to care for the material scribed by no less than three writers.  The film has a startling hatchet in the head scene but it's not up to his usually intense oaters.  He would redeem himself, however, by following this film with 'DJANGO'-1966 and the rest is history.  Actor Damon who made some low budget features in the states, notably with Director Roger Corman , would pull up his stakes and move to Italy where he would work with great Directors such as Corbucci and Mario Bava among others eventually becoming a successful Producer. Ettore Manni plays the sheriff and would make many more genre films throughout the Sixties.  What saves the film is the cinematography by Riccardo Pallotini who was Director Antonio Margheriti's favorite camera man and a catchy score by Carlo Savina.  It's just an OK time waster boasting better things to come from its Director.  Warner Archive delivers the transfer in a nice 1.85 widescreen negative English Dubbed with a nice Dolby Stereo track to enjoy the music even more with a trailer as its only extra.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L51XYLVZ4EB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLOJS8M#wasThisHelpful","R2L51XYLVZ4EB1","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first introduction to the Gothic Horror genre was Director Roger Corman's 'THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM'-1961  .  Home grown on the Universal monster movies televised in the early sixties , this eight year old was disappointed that Vincent Price was the closest thing to a monster that I would find here. My mind, however, was changed forever when I gazed on the beautiful visage of actress Barbara Steele as the Gothic Horror film planted its seed in me . Eight years later, I saw Director Mario Bava's 'BLACK SUNDAY' aka ''LA MASCHERA DEL DEMONIO'-1960  for the first time and here was my favorite actress playing a dual role against the most beautiful horrific images I had ever seen.  The Italian Gothic Horror film has stayed with me to this day and now , author Roberto Curti has compiled an excellent tome on this vastly neglected genre.  Mr.Curti has selected over 40 plus titles , some of which have never been discussed before from the years 1957 to 1969.  The three kings of the genre ( Mario Bava, Riccardo Freda, and Antonio Margheriti) are well represented but it's wonderful to see Director's Camillo Marstrocinque, Roberto Mauri, and Giorgio Ferroni getting their due.  Each film is represented in year order with full cast, credits , synopsis and interviews with the filmmakers and technicians.  Mr. Curti, who also gave us the incredible 'ITALIAN CRIME FILMOGRAPHY' book a few years back , scribes in a user friendly manner never over indulging or playing favorites on the films.  The book has a wonderful introduction by Ernesto Gastaldi who not only wrote screenplays for some of the Gothic films presented here but the Giallo genre as well.  Rare photos, lobby cards and fotobustas round out the mix ( no color ones unfortunately but who can quibble) and an impeccable introduction chapter on what constitutes a Gothic Horror film and explaining how the Italians peppered Westerns and Sword and Sandal films with slight Gothic touches when needed. It was a joy to read through coverage of such films as the rare vampire tale Director Renato Polselli's 'THE VAMPIRE OF THE OPERA' aka 'IL MOSTRO DELL' OPERA'-1964 , Director Alberto De Martino's 'THE BLANCHEVILLE MONSTER' aka ' HORROR'-1963 and Director Brunello Rondi's underrated 'RUN,PSYCHO,RUN' aka 'PIU TARDI, CLAIRE...PIU TARDI'- 1968.  One of my favorite reviews is for Director Stefano Vanzina's guilty pleasure 'UNCLE WAS A VAMPIRE' aka 'TEMPI DURI PER I VAMPIRI-1959.  Archivists should try to find and release this film in its Technicolor Techniscope glory and its great to see actor Sir Christopher Lee playing his vampire straight against the comedy.  Having seen this film on a small Black and White TV set back in the Sixties, it brought back many memories.  The review encompasses the tone of the Italian Gothic at that period predating the classics to come and satirizing a genre which just begun to foliate. When you read it, you'll see what I mean.  Mr. Curti has given fans and scholars alike another welcome addition to the Horror film genre library as this book comes highly recommended from a now sixty year old fan who still breaks out in a cold sweat when Barbara Steele over powers her leading man delivering that icy cold purring laugh amidst the cobwebs and the candle light of her exquisite photoplays.  This fast paced modern world of cinema may have left these genres in the dust but it's books like these that give them eternal life.  Ancora, Signor Curti, Bravissimo!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K95FGALH48B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786494379#wasThisHelpful","R3K95FGALH48B7","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over a decade ago, I wrote a review for Amazon about a double feature DVD release by a now defunct label Midnight Choir of Director Antonio Margheriti's 'THE LONG HAIR OF DEATH' aka 'I LUNGHI CAPELLI DELLA MORTE' and Director Camillo Mastrocinque's 'AN ANGEL FOR SATAN' aka ' UN ANGELO PER SATANA'.  Each were presented in widescreen for the first time and I thought the transfer of 'LONG HAIR' was the best I had seen. Now I can eat those words for this Blu-Ray edition from Raro Video is light years ahead of that and in the best condition that the film has ever been presented for Horror fans.  For the first time , we can finally become totally engrossed in this gothic masterpiece of treachery, witchcraft, adultery,and necrophilia .  Besides the ethereal beauty of  the Queen of sixties Horror Barbara Steele, we can fully appreciate cameraman Riccardo Pallotini's hauntingly moving images and music composer Carlo Rusticelli's  classically gothic score which would be tinkered with in  Director Mario Bava's 'KILL BABY KILL' aka 'OPERAZIONE PAURA'-1966.  Screenwriters Ernesto Gastaldi and future Director Tonino Valerii give Steele one if her best dual roles and Giorgio Ardisson an extremely villainous performance as a nobleman who will stop at nothing to get his inheritance.  Euro fans will notice actor Nello Pazzafini who graced many Spaghetti Westerns and Umberto Raho who worked with Directors Federico Fellini and Dario Argento. Raro Video presents the film in its proper 1.85 ratio and for the first time we can enjoy the Italian LPCM 2.0 soundtrack with optional English Subtitles.  The English Dubbed version is also included .  Bonus features include a 10 minute interview with Margheriti's son Edoardo which takes place in the Dario Argento museum and photographed on the original dungeon set used in the film; a 6 minute interview with screenwriter Antonio Tentori who covers practically all of the directors important works ; an introduction to the movie by Fangoria Magazines Chris Alexander who really captures what the film represents and states he enjoys it better than Bava's 'BLACK SUNDAY' aka 'LA MASCHERA DEL DEMONIO' -1960 ; and separate English /Italian trailers of the film .  Included is a fully illustrated booklet written by Chris Alexander which completes this wonderful package. Released over the years in inferior transfers, fans can finally enjoy this underrated masterpiece in all of its Black and White glory.  After all these years, it emerges as Margheritis's most accomplished work and a fitting tribute to the beauty that Barbara Steele brought to Italian Horror in the Sixties.  Bravo, Raro Video.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18H3DBA9PEH6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R33O65C#wasThisHelpful","R18H3DBA9PEH6U","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"American actor Richard Harrison is the focus of this double bill from the curators at Wild East productions.  Harrison starred in many genres in Italy but is mostly known for his Sword and Sandal and Western films.  Before Director Sergio Leone would change the look of the Euro Western with his Dollars trilogy , other Directors were extremely influenced by their American counterparts.  Up first in the bill is a perfect example of this with Director Joaquin Romero Merchant's 'GUNFIGHT AT HIGH NOON' aka 'THREE RUTHLESS ONES' aka 'I TRE SPIETATI' and as it appears in the end credits 'EL SABOR DE LA VENGANZA'- 1963.  Here we have a rancher brutally murdered by bandits leaving his widow and three sons left to swear vengeance on any person who sets foot on their land.  The film follows the three sons as their lives intersect and change due to the tragedy. Harrison plays the lesser role who becomes a US marshal and eventually sheriff who falls in love with a woman who happens to be the daughter of one of his father's killers.  His other brother played by Robert Hundar gets whiff of this news as the film escalates in a brother against brother confrontation leading to the eventual gunfight.  Its all very straight forward without the grit that would become the staple of the Spaghetti Western genre.  With a nice music score by Riz Ortolani and roles by future Euro western stars( Fernando Sancho, Jose Manuel Martin, Aldo Sambrell), its a nice time waster.  Up next is Director Renato Savino's (here billed as Don Reynolds) 'HIS NAME WAS KING' aka 'LO CHIAMAVONO KING' -1971 which is yet another revenge Western with Harrison  swearing vengeance against the Benson gang for murdering his brother and raping his sister in law.  Along for the kharma ride is Klaus Kinski who only takes up about 8 minutes of the films running time but makes the most of it playing a sheriff with an agenda and cameos by Luciano Pigozzi and Vassili Karis.  It winds down with the eventual showdown highlighted by a great score by Luis Enrique Bacalov (traces of his 'DJANGO' score pop up now and then) and gritty photography by Guglielmo Mancori.  The highlight of this set is an excellent 55 minute interview with Harrison which appears to be on the grounds of his estate.  All of his major films are discussed along with a treasure trove of tidbits and facts about the Italian film industry and his take on how he turned down Sergio Leone for the major role  in 'A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS ' aka 'PER UN PUGNO DI DOLLARI'-1964 and recommended Clint Eastwood for the part. Each film has the Wild East stamp of excellent quality widescreen transfers dubbed in English with picture galleries and original trailers .  All in all, another nice double bill of rare Euro Westerns and worth the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R167CB7IVIHHPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZVB07U#wasThisHelpful","R167CB7IVIHHPU","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The archivists at Retromedia Entertainment continue to locate and release the Edgar Wallace adaptations of Directors Harold Reinl and Alfred Vohrer which were so prolific in West Germany in the early sixties.  These films were partly influential for the Italian Giallo genre to springboard into action with the early works of Director Mario Bava and would come to fruition by Director Dario Argento.  Here we have two Krimi rarities starting off with Director Reinl's 'THE TERRIBLE PEOPLE' aka 'HANDS OF THE GALLOWS' aka  'DIE BANDE DES SCHRECKENS' -1960, an entertaining  mystery resembling the old PRC /MONOGRAM  horrors of the 1940's.  The film stars four of the Krimi genres prominent actors:the inspector played by Joachim  Fuchsberger, the beautiful Karin Dor, sinister Dieter Eppler,  and the comic relief of Eddi Arent.  The photography by Alfred Benitz is superb as we are witness to a curse issued by a megalomaniac on his way to the gallows to the people responsible for his capture.  The bodies pile up as his ghost seems to come and go along with his henchman until the tense climax with a surprise ending to round out the running time.  The film is presented in a black and white window boxed  widescreen print culled from a worn 16mm print with splices annoyingly showing up to spoil some tense dialogue and action exchanges intermittently.  The film, however , is so rarely seen that it seems redundant to quibble but I am just warning the viewers.  The next film , Director Vohrer's 'INN ON THE RIVER' aka 'DAS GASTHAUS A DER THEMSE' -1962 fairs much better quality wise.  Here we have a villain known as the Shark who is murdering people dressed in scuba gear and using a spear gun prowling the sewer tunnels along the Thames.  The film seems to be the precursor to Director Dick Maas 's underrated rarely seen thriller 'AMSTERDAMNED'- 1988 (yet to see a digital release) as the killer is one step ahead of our inspector again played by Fuchsberger.  Eddi Arent helps once again and a very young Klaus Kinski cameos as a sleazy thug while the plot unfolds a diamond smuggling ring led by a surprise character within the cast.  What helps the film is the atmospheric photography by Karl Loeb utilizing fog and smoke expertly. The film is also presented window boxed widescreen from a pristine 16mm print and looks just perfect.  Both films are dubbed in English and does not distract the viewer from the stories as so many of them did at that time due to poorly dubbed voices .  Highly recommended to Krimi fans and mystery lovers,  the price is just right for this wonderful collection from the golden age of Euro thrillers.  Keep em coming, Retromedia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10DNBJ41QFTEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBI0A9A#wasThisHelpful","R10DNBJ41QFTEY","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was anticipating Director Francesco Barilli's 'THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK' aka 'IL PROFUMO DELLA SIGNORA IN NERO'-1974 with great relish because of all that has been written about it these past decades.  I was kinda disappointed.  The film is not a Giallo film at all but is masquerading as one.  What we have here is a woman slowly descending into madness due to a past tragedy which resembles Director Roman Polanski's 'REPULSION' -1966 but there are other elements a foot to prolong the films running time.  The film is beautifully acted by Mimsy Farmer who worked with the greats( Dario Argento - Lucio Fulci) and gorgeously photographed by Mario Masini.  The images are so beautiful that you can see Barillis future calling as a painter in each frame.  The film is graced with a memorable music score by Nicola Piovani which you just can't shake once you hear it.  The film introduces an is she or isn't she nuts theme through out but is mired by scenes of characters which have been peppered onto the viewer during the films middle and slowly building into more Polanski territory (ROSEMARY'S BABY-1967, to be exact) revealing an underground cult .  Barilli actually gives a nod to maestro Mario Bava by having a blond ghost child popping in to annoy Farmer's character when things get rough. Euro Fans may enjoy the surprise? ending but it didn't work for this viewer.  Raro Video presents the film in a beautiful 1.85 transfer from the original negative with eye popping colors making you appreciate the films gorgeous images.  Extras include a 35 minute interview with Director Barilli, and a biography and filmography on him as well.  The package comes with a small booklet on the film.  Not for everyone, the film deserves to be seen just for Farmer's performance alone but the sum of its parts doesn't warrant a whiff of its perfume.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R375B7FXKS3BOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H0M34A#wasThisHelpful","R375B7FXKS3BOA","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tom, You did it!  You gave our favorite movie monster the greatest tribute ever which his own studio failed to do until the 2004 Legacy collection was released on DVD.  Here we have a book which is a treasure trove of information on everything Creature. Beginning with a glorious introduction by actress Julie Adams. it starts from his origination at an after dinner conversation in 1940 at the home of Orson Welles where cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa related a tale about a Gill man.  Present at the gathering was future Producer William Alland  who kept the idea with him all those years.  The book then approaches the production of 'THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON' and its two sequels with meticulous details which blows away many film tomes that have tried to do the same.  I defy anyone out there to find any more  information about these films, that's how complete this book is.  Assisting Mr. Weaver is David Schecter  who discusses the music scores for each film and does it in such a way that even a tone deaf music hater will get something enjoyable out it.  There are biographies on the major actors of each film with so many enjoyable anecdotes that you feel that you knew these people all these years.  The only kink I have with the book is the analysis of each film by author Steve Kronenberg.  I have nothing against his writing, it's just that Mr. Weaver covers so much and gives the analysis that the films deserve so that Mr. Kronenberg's chapters seem like a form of deja vu and slightly redundant.  I could go on and on about the highlights but you, the fan, deserve to embrace this book on your own.  Tom , your labour of Love will give the Creature his everlasting endurance for future generations of fans who continue to embrace the mystique and passion of this denizen of the Black Lagoon. Accolades to you and your helpers,  this book is a revelation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C2A1F7MGD8RN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786494182#wasThisHelpful","R1C2A1F7MGD8RN","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, Euro fans, it's finally here.  Mr. Howarth has given us Volume 1 of an excellent guide to the Italian Giallo covering the genre from its beginning in 1963 to the height of its glory in 1973.  Each film is grouped together by year with full credits, a brief synopsis before the films review , information on the DVD-Blu-Ray releases of each film and important anecdotes on major actors and technicians for each title.  The book is also generously illustrated with rare photos and color blowups of the movie posters and fotobustas of each film.  What enhances the book is the user friendly manner in which the book is presented by giving people who are not familiar with the genre an in depth look of each title. I was amazed at how many films I have still not viewed, some of which have not seen the light of day since their release dates.  The book begins with a nice intro by Giallo screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi on what constitutes a Gialo film, an excellent chapter by writer Roberto Curti (who is releasing a book on the Italian Gothic Horror Film this summer) on the Giallo from the pages of the paperback novellas to the screen, and a chapter of Giallo prototypes and some films which resemble the genre such as the German Krimi's and some which did not quite make the grade.  The book is a revelation for fans and scholars alike and is highly recommended.  I can't wait for volume two which will cover the years 1974 thru 2013 and will make this collection a wonderful Encyclopedia of one of the most underrated of Euro Genres. This seems to be the year for the Euro Horror Film finally getting its due with releases of these two volumes, Mr. Curti's book mentioned above and also his take on the Italian superhero genre and Mr. Stephen Thrower's book on the cinema of Director Jess Franco coming in May.  Who would of thought?

"A film which has a lurid title, Director Milan Todovic's 'KILLER MERMAID' aka 'NYMPH'-2014 doesn't quite deliver the goods till it reaches 45 minutes into its 95 minute running time.  Before we meet the titled creature, we are treated to a rather slow moving travelogue of Croatian landscapes with scantily clad women never building up to character and plot development until veteran Euro actor Franco Nero arrives on the scene.  Tourists are disappearing at a rapid rate suggesting a serial killer on the loose but its just a fisherman who is under the influence of our mermaid to supply her with human flesh.  Our quartet of characters led by actress Kristina Klebe who outshines the rest of the cast must struggle to survive on an isolated hard to get to atoll as Nero tries to get them back to the mainland.  The special effects of the creature played by fetching Euro model Mina Sablic are quite good and save the film from being a routine Horror outing.  Director Todovic does what he can with the budget that he had giving the audience some suspenseful scenes but because of the slow beginning, its like watching two different films.  Franco Nero looks great for his age bringing a seriousness and touch of class to the proceedings.  The film looks beautiful in a slightly letterboxed 1.85 crisp transfer in English.  The extras include a making of and behind the scenes featurette with good interviews with the cast and crew and a bonus crowd funding promotion for the film at the time of its release.  Not a bad way to spend an afternoon, the film suffers from that long stretch at the beginning which keeps it from the cult status it deserves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R327OEX6E0HTMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L6AW1GY#wasThisHelpful","R327OEX6E0HTMJ","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These past years have seen the works of Italian genre Director Fernando Di Leo gracing our US monitors with no less than two box sets representing his best work.  This release from New Star Video is ,however, entirely another matter.  After the release of his excellent 'SHOOT FIRST, DIE LATER' aka 'IL POLIZIOTTO E MARCIO'-1974, he decided to blend the crime drama with a comedy sex farce with painful results.  'LOADED GUNS' aka 'COLPO IN CANNA'  is one of those Euro titles which sunk many genres including the Spaghetti Western by trying to mix dead serious themes with slapstick comedy( the 'TRINITY'  films are a good example) .  The results are extremely painful too watch in these modern times and does not represent Di Leo's best efforts.  The beautiful Ursula Andress who was no stranger to these types of films having made many in Italy at that time tries to bring dignity to her role by playing it straight bouncing off the films insanity by vamping up her character.  Di Leo takes full advantage of Ursula 's assets and this is what saves the film.  Along for the ride is Woody Strode who found himself in Europe and worked with Di Leo and other Euro Directors but is just wasted here.  The Music score by Luis Enriquez Bacalov is as hectic as the films pace.  More bad news is that New Star Video used an inferior print and presents it in a full screen faded slightly fuzzy transfer and English dubbed.  Their is no pan and scan so the image is dead on making some of the characters invisible in some shots as they spout their dialogue. The only extra is a still gallery of frame blowups from the fuzzy transfer. Recommended for Ursula Andress fans (nudity abounds) and for Euro completists only.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN4PAU9XSKSYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P6R570#wasThisHelpful","RN4PAU9XSKSYY","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here we have a film which was lost in the shuffle with the glut of demonic possession films this past year.  Director Scott Derrickson's latest venture 'DELIVER US FROM EVIL'-2014 is much more than that.  Don't be put off at the fact the film is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer known mostly for his big budget amusement park rides, this is a serious cop movie with paranormal happenings peppered into the streets of N.Y.'s Bronx milieu.  It also works because of the collaboration of the real exploits of Sergeant Ralph Sarchie brought to fruition by Director Derrickson and actor Bana's interraction with him during the shoot. With you-are there lensing by director of photography Scott Kevan and brilliant performances by Eric Bana (his best yet) ,Edgar Ramirez, Olivia Munn and a chilling Sean Harris,  the plot unfolds with electrifying chills as the horror and mysteries unfold in sledge hammer style throughout the films running time. Many have groused that the climactic exorcism has been done before but the reality and intensity of that sequence is as good or equal to Director Wiliam Friedkin's classic 'THE EXORCIST'-1971. You have read the other reviews following the plot so the buyer should be satisfied by the quality of this Blu-Ray release.  Spotlighting no less than 4 featurettes and a Director's commentary, the 1080P high def image and DTS digital sound will sate Horror buffs for years to come.  As the reviewer of the Boston Herald stated 'Disturbing enough to unsettle your sleep for weeks' , this film blows away the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' franchise and Director Derrickson is a craftsman to watch as the Horror genre is finally blessed with a true talent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCVX2P908LCP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LH9ROKM#wasThisHelpful","RCVX2P908LCP7","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In my high school years, I was a big Raquel Welch fan and here is a title that I missed when it was first released which alluded me until now.  Warner Archive has released Director James Neilson's 'FLAREUP'-1969, a missed opportunity bogged down by a lame script by television series scribe, Marc Rodgers.  If the beginning did not contain topless scenes of girls go-go dancing, it resembles the assembly line Movie of the Week television excursions that flooded the home screens at that time and TV director Neilson treats the material in that fashion.  Witnessing her girl friend gunned down by spurned ex-husband Luke Askew in a scene stealing performance, she becomes his next target which causes her to go on the run.  The film should have escalated into a 'RUN LOLA RUN' type actioner but it slowly plummets into a soapy affair as Raquel finds herself falling for night club owner James Stacy.  It takes over 95 minutes for Askew to catch up with Raquel for the supposed nail biting climax but by then, nobody cares.  Raquel is excellent in the lead showing what an underrated actress she truly was.  Her career would take a slight slump following this film with Director Joseph McGrath's 'THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN'-1969 and Director Michael Sarne's silly mess 'MYRA BRECKINRIDGE'-1970.  Actor James Stacy known for his television work including his series 'LANCER'-1968-1970 can't seem to carry the leading man spot causing Raquel to shine on her own.  Character actor Luke Askew was a pro at playing psycho roles and this one is no exception.  He would go on to make the cult Spaghetti Western , Director Guilio Petroni's 'NIGHT OF THE SERPENT' aka 'LA NOTTE DEI SERPENTI' and available from Wild East Productions as 'NEST OF VIPERS' the same year.  There is a nice cameo by actress Jean Byron (billed as Jeane) as a go-go club owner. With straight on photography by Andrew J. McIntyre and music by AIP stalwart Les Baxter, it emerges as a routine thriller at best recommended for hard core Raquel fans only (you know who you are).  Warner Archive releases it in a nice 1.85 DVD-R transfer with an original trailer pushing Raquel as the world's most wanted woman as its only extra.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8Z6LE35TDNQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0080QOK2K#wasThisHelpful","R8Z6LE35TDNQP","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is a great case of a film being made and released at the wrong time.  Director Jerry Thorpe's 'THE VENETIAN AFFAIR'-1967 is a masterful tale of intrigue and double crosses but unfortunately had two things against it: 1) It's leading man ,Robert Vaughn, was acting in one of television's popular shows at the time 'THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.'-1964-1968 causing audiences used to the humorous air of the show to be thrown for a loop at the seriousness and lack of action sequences contained within its 92 minute running time; 2) there was an onslaught of spy/secret agent films flooding the theaters from Europe to the US following the James Bond phenomena so with the films credits, people were expecting a TV movie being released theatrically as some of the two part U.N.C.L.E. episodes were packaged for US and over seas at that time.  The film flopped at its release and seemed forgotten if not for sporadic showings on Turner Classic Movies.  Warner Archive has given it a well deserved resurrection preserving it as an underrated espionage thriller with some great performances.  Vaughn plays an ex-CIA agent turned journalist assigned to investigate a possible terrorist bombing at a peace conference in Venice.  Vaughn approaches the role of Bill Fenner in a cool mea-culpa tone with traces of his U.N.C.L.E. character Solo creeping in once in a while. He would continue his movie roles with Director Peter Yate's classic 'BULLITT'-1968 as the corrupt cop Chalmers; Edward Asner ,before his future successful television career ,is excellent as Vaughn's ex boss stopping at nothing to get to the bottom of the affair.  The lovely Elke Sommer plays Vaughn's ex wife who double crossed him in the past and would go on to grace Director Ralph Nelson's underrated spy film 'DEADLIER THAN THE MALE' the same year ; Cameos by T.V. actor Roger C. Carmel (known as Harry Mudd on two 'STAR TREK' episodes at that time), the venerable Boris Karloff as ,what else, a nobel scientist, and the beautiful Luciana Paluzzi who played the lethal Fiona Volpe in Director Terrance Young's Bond classic 'THUNDERBALL'-1965 as Carmel's secretary.  The scene stealer is Euro actor Karl Boehm as Wall, an enemy agent who wants Karloff's plans for his own. Boehm, known for his performance in Director Michael Powell's unfairly maligned and ahead of its time serial killer thriller 'PEEPING TOM'-1960,gives his role an incredible air of evil. Director Jerry Thorpe, son of Director Richard Thorpe, known for his massive T.V. movie and series works, seems to have helmed only two theatrical features in his career, this one and 'DAY OF THE EVIL GUN'-1968.  He keeps the film moving in a slow, powder keg tone throughout which enhances the elements of the script.  With a catchy lounge music score from T.V. composer Lalo Schifrin (one of his best), beautiful photography from two time Oscar winner Milton Krasner showing off the breath taking Venetian locales and a good screenplay by Producer E.Jack Newman based on Helen MacInnes's  novel,  'THE VENETIAN AFFAIR' can finally be appreciated by modern day audiences.  It has flaws but it has a timelessness about it hauntingly reminiscent of our modern day terrorist happenings.  Warner releases it in a beautiful 2.35 widescreen transfer with a US trailer its only extra.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LI5D29H2B596/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JJCMRG#wasThisHelpful","R1LI5D29H2B596","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Director Duccio Tessari and actor Giuliano Gemma made many genres films together and this one is one of their best, 'THE CATS' aka 'I BASTARDI'- 1968 released by Warner Archive.  The film resembles a Ma Parker gangster film involving actress Rita Hayworth in one of her last roles playing an alcoholic  mother ruling her sons Gemma and cult actor Klaus Kinski in an evil performance with an iron fist.  Revenge is the game however after a jewel heist is ambushed by Kinski and in a case of sibling rivalry, he absconds with Gemma's girlfriend played by beautiful Margaret Lee as Gemma winds up getting the muscle tendons in his hands sliced and diced.  Nursed back together by equally gorgeous Claudine Auger , he orchestrates vengeance with a passion till a frustratingly abrupt ending prevents this film from getting five stars. Tessari directs the script co-written by himself and Ennio Di Concini like a Spaghetti Western at a rapid pace never having the humor which would discolor his later efforts interfering with the proceedings. Euro fans will also spot Dan Van Husen and Umberto Raho along for the ride. With a great lounge score by Michel Magne resembling Herb Alpert and his Tijuana Brass in some spots and beautiful cinematography by Carlo Carlini, its a must for fans of Italian cinema and also the chance in seeing two beautiful actresses ,Auger and Lee, strutting their stuff.  Unfortunately, Rita Hayworth chews the scenery so hard you expect cardboard to spit out of her mouth alongside the saliva. Joan Crawford was supposed to play the role but turned it down. Too bad, at the time she was doing some over the top roles herself and might have given this film a slightly needed cutting edge . Warner releases it in an English dubbed  1.85 DVD-R transfer with its original Italian beginning and end titles but, sadly, no extras.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18XIRSB66HQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NU548S#wasThisHelpful","R18XIRSB66HQ6","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frances and Christian Decamps were the founders of 'ANGE' ,one of the leading Progressive Rock bands to arrive from France in the early Seventies .  Since Christian is continuing on with a new incarnation of the band , his brother, Frances, has released sporadic music over the past few decades and this new album is a reboot of 'ANGE'S' second album 'CARICATURES'.  For those used to the arrangements from that album released back in 1972, Decamps has rearranged each track into new incarnations including musicians Dominique Leonetti on Lead Guitar, Jean Philippe Suzan sharing lead vocals with Frances and Tristan Decamps who plays keyboards with the new 'ANGE' coloring the keyboards on these tracks when needed.  All in all, the music emerges as a refreshing take into the new age proving that great music is timeless and consistent.  I purchased this through Musea Store in France and it arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  Required listening for 'ANGE' fans, this is a real treat and to Frances, I say 'merci'.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT6K6YT0VWET3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WCK1Y0#wasThisHelpful","RT6K6YT0VWET3","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Attention Horror Fans!! Warner Archive has released a rare obscure gem from the early thirties , Director William Cowen's 'KONGO'-1932, an unclassifiable tale of revenge, sadism and jungle thrills boasting awesome performances and incredibly atmospheric images packed into its 86 minute running time.  Basically a remake of Director Tod Browning and star Lon Chaney Sr.'s silent film 'WEST OF ZANZIBAR'-1927, this reboot outshines it by having the main character this time played by Walter Huston taking back stage to the other characters in the film thereby increasing the tragedy and maudlin atmosphere of the jungle surroundings.  Huston plays 'Dead Legs' Flint, a depraved, revenge ridden megalomaniac who lives to fulfill a two decade grudge against Grant played by C. Henry Gordon who was responsible for stealing away his wife and causing his wheel chair bound paralysis.  Ruling his jungle terrain by performing voodoo rituals and magic tricks, he keeps the surrounding cannibalistic native tribes one spear away at every turn.  It would not be fair to continue a synopsis of the film, it should be experienced in all of its humid, torrid glory.  Huston gives a blistering performance right up there with his characters of Old Scratch in Director William Dieterle's classic 'THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER'-1941 and his Oscar winning performance of Howard in his son Director John Huston's masterpiece 'THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE'-1948.  Joining him are actress Lupe Velez as Flint's girl Friday Tula dripping eroticism and sultriness in every frame of the film that she encapsulates; an early performance by actress Virginia Bruce and one of her best roles steering away from the fainting flower hysterics that were embellished by many actresses at that time; and Conrad Nagel who gives his leading man a cutting edge rare for this early sound excursion. The film is beautifully photographed by Harold Rossen actually capturing the heat and humidity of the environment.  Rossen would go on to lens such classics as Director Victor Fleming's 'THE WIZARD OF OZ'-1939 and Director King Vidor's 'DUEL IN THE SUN'- 1946 among others. Rarely screened save for sporadic appearances on Turner Classic Movies,  Warner Archive releases it as a DVD-R with a grainy feel showing that the negative is in need of a digital restoration.  The only extra is a 56 minute documentary entitled 'UNTAMED AFRICA'-1933,  a you-are-there excursion predating the 'MONDO' films which emerged from Italy in the Sixties and centering around the Hubbard family who are showcased by rare jungle footage(not staged) surrounding their safari.  It is inconceivable that a prestigious studio such as MGM would produce a film like 'KONGO' for it resembles its pre-code distant cousin releases from Paramount Pictures: Director Erle C. Kenton's 'ISLAND OF LOST SOULS'-1932 and Director A. Edward Sutherland's 'MURDERS IN THE ZOO'-1933.  Never would MGM ever stoop to such depravity as in this film, even Director W.S. Van Dyke's 'TARZAN, THE APE MAN' and Director Charles Brabin's 'THE MASK OF FU MANCHU' pull in the reins although Director Tod Browning's 'FREAKS' comes awfully close and they were all made the same year -1932.  Rarely seen and never appearing in any film encyclopedias , 'KONGO' deserves a resurrection and hopefully with this important release, it will get the audience it deserves.  The film emerges as a masterpiece from the early sound era and I love every sultry frame of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSWZVDZOS48K6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00508W3GQ#wasThisHelpful","RSWZVDZOS48K6","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Director Peter Collinson's production of 'INNOCENT BYSTANDERS'-1972 arrived at the wane of the Spy Film genre as fans were seeing Sean Connery leave the James Bond franchise and awaiting Roger Moore to attain the mantle.  This film owes alot to that particular time frame even down to the ludicrous music score by John Keating trying to emulate the sound and themes of John Barry.  It does, however, succeed by having a clever script by James Mitchell which is based on the novel by James Munro and a stellar cast.  Stanley Baker who's career was largely forgotten at this time plays John Craig, a washed up psychologically scarred Department K agent who's given one last job to redeem himself by his boss, Looms, played magnificently cold and calculating by the great Donald Pleasence.  Dana Andrews ,in one of his last appearances , plays the head of the CIA and Cec Linder who played Felix Lieter in Director Guy Hamilton's classic Bond opus 'GOLDFINGER'- 1964 plays his shrink. We also have Derren Nesbett known for his role as Von Huren in Director Brian G. Hutton's epic war actioner 'WHERE EAGLES DARE'-1968 along with Ferdy Mayne who cameos here also and Sue Lloyd as Department K agents sent to eliminate Craig on Looms orders; Geraldine Chaplin who never looked more fragile and beautiful as one of the supposed innocent bystanders of the title, the great British character actor Warren Mitchell and the awesome Vladek Sheybal as Kaplan, the man that both sides want. Director Collinson delivers the goods at an intense clip till its punchline conclusion.  I purchased the DVD copy and the image is so crystal clear in a beautiful 1.85 transfer that its hard to perceive that the Blu-Ray copy could be much of an improvement but sadly, there are no extras.  Highly recommended for fans of Espionage photoplays, this rarely seen film is given its just due by Olive Films giving audiences a taste of a different type of spy film plus its good to see Baker in his last film role for he would succumb to an illness at the young age of 48 in 1976.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZN3QW8HREA7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AGKH9AI#wasThisHelpful","R2ZN3QW8HREA7O","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here we have another spy yarn where the lead agent who has a business front in the toy business becomes tired of the intrigue and wants to get out but, unfortunately, has to keep on going to find out the traitor in the midst of his organization.  Director Val Guest's 'ASSIGNMENT K'-1968 was made at the decline of the flood gated spy genre and its tiredness shows.  The first half of the film is devoted to being a travelogue of skiing in Austria before a semblance of plot arises. Actor Stephen Boyd is the lead but shows how he never quite made leading man status playing his character as bland as ever.  The beautiful Camilla Sparv who just came off of Director Henry Levin's Matt Helm opus 'MURDERERS ROW' -1966 is pleasing to the eyes but that's about it.  Actors Jeremy Kemp and Jane Merrow are wasted in their roles and even the great Sir Michael Redgrave is confined to one room during his total of 10 minutes on film.  It leaves the wonderful Leo McKern to try to save and give spark to the proceedings but by that time, the audience (me included) doesn't care.  It took three screen writers to adapt the book ""DEPARTMENT K' by Hartley Howard to the screen but to no avail, there are so many double crosses and false characters that you need a score card.  The film is one of the most lacklustre in Director Guest's repertoire which does not contain any suspenseful set pieces and continued a career slump which began with the previous dud 'WHERE THE SPIES ARE'- 1965 and would continue with the silly messy James Bond satire 'CASINO ROYALE'- 1967 in the company of four other directors no less.  Sony/Columbia releases it in a nice 2.35 DVD-R transfer with the mono sound sometimes embellishing the music score by John Coleman making the dialogue difficult to hear in some spots. Their are no extras as the disc loads in a continuous loop with no menu to be had. The three stars is for Mckern's performance and also some wonderfully shot interiors of some Austrian and British night clubs making it a nice time capsule if your into that sort of thing.  For Espionage completists only, the film is a missed opportunity for its time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3WOUEP5TUJYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009M4KSNO#wasThisHelpful","R3WOUEP5TUJYM","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Warner Archive has dipped into its MGM coffers and has released Director Etienne Perier's 'SWORDSMAN OF SIENA' aka 'LA CONGIURA DEI DIECI' -1962, a surprising coupling of romance ,tragedy and derring do packed into its 96 minute running time.  Hollywood star Stewart Granger never looked more dashing harkening the days of his Beau Brummell/Scaramouche roles and just coming off Director Robert Aldrich's production of 'SODOM AND GOMORRAH' would remain in Europe doing costume and espionage films.  Helping him along is the statuesque Sylva Koscina coming off her Steve Reeves/Hercules films and the beautiful Christine Kaufmann showing her naivety and fragility coming off her role in Director J.Lee Thompson's 'TARAS BULBA' with husband at the time, Tony Curtis.  Peppered throughout are excellent Italian character actors including Claudio Gora, Alberto Lupo who has a great sword fight with Granger, the gorgeous Marina Berti and the always excellent villainy of the great Fausto Tozzi.  The film centers around an excellently edited and photographed horse race which was a real event at that time and serves as the climax to the romance and treachery which ensues.  There appears to be two different versions of the film: an Italian version directed by Baccio Bandini and this one which was a French/English language version but looks as though they are identical for the running times are the same on both.  It also boasts great credits for this type of production. The music score is by the wonderful Mario Nascimbene who graced Director Richard Fleischer's 'THE VIKINGS'- 1958 and would go on to other memorable scores including Director Don Chaffey/Ray Harryhausen's grunt and groaner 'ONE MILLION YEARS B.C.'-1967. The photography is by the great Tonino Deli Colli who worked with Directors Mario Bava and Sergio Leone among others. Director Perier would have a sporadic career of writing and directing culminating in 1971's release of 'ZEPPELIN' and the underrated Alistair McLean film 'WHEN EIGHT BELLS TOLL'-1972.

"The British Horror Film has seen a resurgence in the past decade with some really nice gems in the mix of all the blood and guts.  Here we have Director Ryan Andrews's 'ELFIE HOPKINS: CANNIBAL HUNTER'-2012, a film which builds into a pressure cooker frenzy by the last 30 minutes. It's really hard to give a synopsis of what goes on before entering spoiler territory, suffice it to say that the DVD cover does not do the film justice as its advertised as a splatter fest in 'BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER' mode.  The film is very subtle in its build up, the characters are eccentric (you may want to press the subtitle button because the British dialects are hard to fathom sometimes), and the story is wonderfully original.  Jamie Winstone is excellent as the title character and her father Ray Winstone who is also Executive Producer on the film plays a nice cameo which abets the mania.  Beautiful location photography by Tovia Sempi and a melancholic music score by Jordan Andrews round out the mix.  Unfortunately, the film's title gives away some of the plot but if you like your mystery clues to unfold gradually, then this film is for you.  I was thoroughly surprised and I hope they make the character of Elfie into a series.  Screen Media Films releases it in a nice 2.35 widescreen transfer with perfect digital sound.

"Raro Video continues to release the works of Screenwriter/Director Fernando Di Leo this time highlighting one of the most violent crime films of the mid seventies Director Ruggero Deodato's 'LIVE LIKE A COP, DIE LIKE A MAN' aka 'UOMINI SI NASCE POLIZIOTTI SI MUORE'-1976 which was his second film as Director.  Boasting in your face cinematography by Guglielmo Mancori and starring french actor Marc Porel and cult actor Ray Lovelock, it resembles an ultra violent version of American televisions 'STARSKY AND HUTCH' but predating it by a number of years. In this films case , the two cops bypass police protocol and red tape by handling their cases in their unique style: punch and shoot first, ask questions if the perpetrator can still talk.  The cast also includes the great Adolfo Celi, Renato Salvatore, Deodato's girlfriend at the time, Silvia Dionisio who also appeared in his first film 'WAVES OF LUST' aka 'ONDATE DI PIACERE'-1975 and her twin sister Sofia Dionisio. Beginning with a 10 minute motorcycle chase through the streets of Rome, the film never lets up till its explosive climax and is highly recommended to action fans.  Director Deodato also pulls a Hitchcock at the beginning of the film as he comes out of a bank that is being robbed. The extras include a 42 minute documentary on the film 'POLIZIOTTI VIOLENTI' aka 'VIOLENT COPS' featuring interviews with Deodato, Ray Lovelock who hums the films theme song which he sang for the film and had not performed it since the shoot, and Producer Armando Novelli with Deodato commenting also on the coincidence of the american TV series and the reason why a sequel was never filmed; TV commercials directed by and with audio commentary by Deodato, Director biographies and filmographies and an illustrated booklet on the film.  Raro Video releases it in a beautiful 1.85 transfer almost looking like a 1080P Blu-Ray in Italian with English Subtitles. It emerges as one of Director Ruggero Deodato's most accomplished works of his repertoire, not recommended if your squeamish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PEQT54XIM32Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ODLUFS#wasThisHelpful","R3PEQT54XIM32Y","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jonathan Rigby is one of my favorite writers of the Horror genre.  His two essential tomes 'ENGLISH GOTHIC' and its sequel 'AMERICAN GOTHIC' remain classic studies of Horror film history which made his new book 'STUDIES IN TERROR' a great anticipation for this reader.  Unfortunately, it falls short because of Mr. Rigby's choices in his definition of landmarks or films which influenced and grew the genre through the years.  Classics are listed but really, Mr. Rigby, do you really thinks such titles as 'THE RETURN OF DR.X'- 1939; 'THE MAZE'-1953; 'DEVIL DOLL'-1963 ; 'THE DUNWICH HORROR'-1969, 'SCREAM'-1996 to name but a few really changed the look of the Horror film?  I don't think so. Don't get me wrong, this book is well researched especially his choices from the silent era and he includes two Science Fiction films ,'THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT' and the 1956 version of 'INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS' which succeed because of their Horror elements and includes some amazing photographs, some seen for the first time by Horror fans and belongs in every Horror fans book collection. But if you really want the definitive last word on the Horror genre, purchase author Kim Newman's definitive tome 'NIGHTMARE MOVIES' and just use 'STUDIES IN TERROR' as a wonderful coffee table diversion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH35MFQ7PJTA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0956653448#wasThisHelpful","RH35MFQ7PJTA0","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Redemption USA continues to release its back catalog of Italian Horror with Director Renato Polselli's unbelievably incoherent 'BLACK MAGIC RITES' aka 'THE REINCARNATION OF ISABEL' aka 'RITI,MAGIE NERE E SEGRETE ORGE DEL TRECENTO'- 1973 in 1080P Blu-Ray.  Released on both VHS and DVD over a decade ago under its alternate title, 'THE REINCARNATION OF ISABEL', the transfer is virtually identical with a few cleaned up speckles and sharper image. The film has the notoriety of being totally incomprehensible by Euro Trash enthusiasts and they would be right.  From my stand point, it seems that a modern day vampire (Count Dracula, perhaps?) is planning an arranged marriage between his daughter and a villager.  Haunted by the death of his beloved Isabel who was burned at the stake for being both a witch and vampire, he uses a satanic sect made up of the wedding party to resurrect poor Isabel's ravaged body sacrificing mostly the female guests in, you guessed it, blood sacrifices. It sounds better written down because the viewer may not see it that way at all.  The cast includes Mickey Hargitay who made many Euro genre titles along with his then wife Jayne Mansfield and Polselli regular Rita Calderoni who was great in Director Luigi Batzella's delirious guilty pleasure 'NUDE FOR SATAN' aka 'NUDA PER SATANA'-1974. Director Polselli used most of the same cast in his previous Horror excursion 'DELIRIUM' aka 'DELIRIO CALDO' -1972.  Polselli, who's most famous title is the second film of an early sixties gothic vampire trilogy 'L'AMANTE DEL VAMPIRO' aka 'THE VAMPIRE AND THE BALLERINA'- 1960 (which has yet to see a Digital release) gives the film an Ed Wood like feel of surrealistic numbness reminding one of Wood's film 'NIGHT OF THE GHOULS'-1960.  It almost makes you want to turn off the English subtitles and try to watch the film on your own making up your own storyline with the images unfolding.  The music is by Progressive Rock great Gianfranco Reverberi who produced the Italian band 'LE ORME's first five albums and also made a few solo albums finally creating and playing in the excellent late Eighties classical rock band 'RONDO VENEZIANO' and moves the film along at a fine clip.  Recommended to Euro Trash fans, it may not be worth the upgrade if you already have the Image/Redemption DVD.  Trailers to other Italian horrors are the Blu-Ray's only extras.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KLGERMGBR04C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083Q4JX2#wasThisHelpful","R1KLGERMGBR04C","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Director Jess Franco's 'EXORCISM' aka 'EXORCISME ET MESSES NOIRES' aka 'SEXORCISMES'-1974/1975 is a true anomaly in his repertoire.  There are at least three different versions out there similar to his other release 'FEMALE VAMPIRE' aka 'LA COMTESSE NOIRE'-1973 and here Redemption has released both the softcore version and its Horror version which was recut in 1979 by the studio Franco was utilizing -Eurocine- and added a different storyline but including footage shot back in 1974 (sounds confusing? it is) and releasing it as 'THE SADIST OF NOTRE DAME' aka 'EL SADICO DE NOTRE DAME'.  It doesn't stop there.  Charles Band who owned Wizard Video in the Eighties released the Horror version in VHS as 'DEMONIAC' which trimmed the films running time to 79 minutes.  Synapse films got a hold of the 'EXORCISM' version and released it on DVD in its 94 minute version and this is the transfer that Redemption has released.  The quality is almost identical but since it is Blu-Ray, a bit sharper.  'SEXORCISMES' is available in bootleg copies and has inserted hard core footage not shot by Franco included in it.  Redemption, however, does not have the audio commentary track between Franco and his muse, actress Lina Romay so you might want to hold on to your Synapse DVD.  Franco's tale of an ex-priest turned horror novelist can now be appreciated because of the availability of his other titles on the home video market.  It contains a performance act by Lina Romay and actress Nadine Pascal similar to the ones included in his films 'SUCCUBUS' aka 'NECRONOMICON'- 1967 and 'VAMPYROS LESBOS'-1970.  Franco plays the main character and witnesses the performance Black Mass thinking its the real thing kicking his priestly brainwashing into high gear and psychotically cleansing all the impure women he can find.  The 'DEMONIAC' version has the character excaping from an insane asylum and becomes a serial writer for a magazine causing him to write about his own crimes.  'EXORCISM' utilizes the music of composer Andre Benichou who was memorable with his guitar score for Franco's 'LORNA THE EXORCIST' aka 'LES POSSEDEES DU DIABLE'-1974 where as 'DEMONIAC' has Daniel White doing the music tonalities with photography credited to P.Van Leenart but it is obvious that Franco is behind the camera. 'EXORCISM' is in its French Language with optional English subtitles and 'DEMONIAC' is the English dubbed version. All in all, this release is wonderful in that it gives the viewer and Franco fans both versions of films that share his vision of censorship and sexual repression.  If you have the Synapse DVD, you may not want to go the extra money for an upgrade but if you are a completist, this release is for you.  Trailers for other Redemption releases are its only extras.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SWII3H9FCYL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008N2Z1GA#wasThisHelpful","R3SWII3H9FCYL9","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wild East Productions has released a rare Spaghetti Western from the year in which the genre was making its presence known and marks its US debut in Digital format.  Director Albert Band's aka Alfredo Antonini's 'THE TRAMPLERS' aka 'GLI UOMINI DAL PASSO PASANTE' aka 'LAS PISTOLAS DEL NORTE DE TEXAS'-1966 is a tough tragedy resembling American oaters such as Director Edward Dmytrik's 'BROKEN LANCE'-1954 but utilizing many Euro touches such as its erupting brutality and gritty performances.  Actor Joseph Cotton plays megalomaniac Temple Cordeen, an ex-confederate officer who refuses to accept the civil war is over and uses his twisted code of honor to protect his lands by utilizing his sons and hired thugs to create a reign of terror.  Trouble starts when two sons played by Gordon Scott and Jim Mitchum and his daughters decide to rebel culminating into a climatic inevitable blood bath.  This is one of Scott's three spaghetti's that he made in the mid sixties in Italy.  Known for his excellent turn as Tarzan in the late fifties and many muscleman pepla's in the early sixties, he shines in this role making it a shame that he didn't do more westerns. Mitchum is good also which makes it a shame that he never got better roles as the years went on. Cotten is excellent as the lead and would make many memorable Euro titles up until the seventies. The film also marks the debut of two prolific actors who helped form the Spaghetti genre:  Francesco Spartanero aka Franco Nero (here billed as Frank Nero in the credits) makes his first Spaghetti Western appearance coming off his role in Director John Huston's 'THE BIBLE'-'1966' and would go onto stardom in Director Sergio Corbucci's classic 'DJANGO'-1966; and actor Romano Puppo who would grace countless genre titles some uncredited but who's face makes the standout stamp.  You will also recognize a blink or you'll miss cameo by venerable Claudio Gora in a brutally violent turn at the film's 10 minute mark.  Director Band was an indefatigable film maker who wrote, produced and directed hundreds of films in his career and along with his son Charles Band formed Empire Pictures in the eighties.  He would also take this films idea and along with Director Sergio Corbucci would lens the underrated 'THE HELLBENDERS' aka 'I CRUDELI' aka 'THE CRUEL ONES' the same year also starring Joseph Cotten in an identical role.  The films credits also boast first rate photography by Alvaro Mancore , an assistant director turn by future director Franco Prosperi and a haunting score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino who's mostly known for his score for Director Eugene Lourie's giant monster movie 'GORGO'- 1961.  Keen viewers will also spot the Cordeen mansion as the one utilized in Director Frank Kramer's aka Gianfranco Parolini's 'SABATA' aka 'EH, AMICO...C'E SABATA, HAI CHUISO!'-1969 and its sequel 'RETURN OF SABATA' aka' E TORNATO SABATA, HAI CHUISO UN ALTRA VOLTA'-1972.  Wild East gives the film a nice 1.85 widescreen transfer showing an Avco Embassy release moniker with Italian credits and English dubbing.  The only extras are a poster and stills gallery and both US and Italian trailers for the film. An excellent addition to any Western collection, it shows actor Gordon Scott at the peak of his art and thanks again, Wild East , for releasing this rarity to fans and giving it the respect it truly deserves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKFGZ49B1BXC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C0Z7ZL0#wasThisHelpful","RKFGZ49B1BXC9","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The film industry suffered a major loss this past month with the passing of the greatest erotic Horror film maker ever, Jesus Franco and last year , his muse Lina Romay who created some of the most incredible images ever to grace the screen.  Redemption has been releasing the Franco Image Entertainment releases of over a decade ago in new Blu-Ray incarnations so that first time viewers and Franco fans can appreciate his style and mojo better than ever.  After the death of his major leading lady Soledad Miranda, Franco discovered 19 year old Lina Romay who worked behind the scenes for many of his productions and with this film 'FEMALE VAMPIRE'aka 'LA COMTESSE AUX SEINS NUS' aka 'LES AVALEUSES'- 1973, their erotic fusion was set.  Included at the party are Franco stalwarts Alice Arno who would also be immortalized in 'THE PERVERSE COUNTESS' made the same year; Jack Taylor as the doomed Baron Von Rathony; the eccentric Monica Swinn and of course, a cameo from Jess himself. The film is one of his most popular titles and which was the first to reach the home video market back in the Eighties under various versions released by Private Screenings and Wizard Video among others.  That's because there are at least three different versions out there: a Horror version known as 'THE BARE-BREASTED COUNTESS' or 'EROTIKILL'; a soft core version known as 'THE LOVES OF IRINA'; and a hardcore version known as 'LES AVALEUSES' aka 'THE SWALLOWERS'. When Image Entertainment first released it on DVD under the title 'FEMALE VAMPIRE' , it was the soft core version that viewers saw trimmed of some hardcore fellatio scenes which seemed to be inserted and which fails to match the footage already present.  Redemption has released both the Horror and soft versions without the X-rated footage on Blu-Ray in beautiful 1080P cleaning up some of the murky elements of the Image disc and has 2.0 mono sound  with French and English tracks with optional English sub titles.  The beauty of actress Lina Romay and the films locations ( Belgium, France, and the Portugese island of Madiera) can now be fully appreciated along with composer Daniel White's dreamy ethereal score.  Although vampire eroticism was introduced by Franco three years previous with 'VAMPYROS LESBOS' -1970 starring Soledad Miranda along with French Director Jean Rollin's erotic vampire films of which his masterpiece 'LIPS OF BLOOD' aka 'LEVRES DE SANG'-1975 owes a major debt, it helped pave the way for Director Harry Kumel's classic 'DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS' -1971  and would go on to influence Director Joseph Larraz's 'VAMPYRES'-1975 among others. The Blu-Ray has some great special features: a 13 minute interview with Franco 'DESTINY IN SOFT FOCUS' with essential anecdotes on the shooting of the film; A 10 minute interview with actor Jean-Pierre Bouyxou who plays Dr. Orloff in the film and worked with Director Jean Rollin narrating a featurette on Lina Romay 'WORDS FOR LINA';  and trailers for other Redemption releases.  This package comes highly recommended and Jess, even if Hollywood didn't give you a tribute or passing words, your films will live on long after the tripe passing off as modern Horror is being forced on to the film going public as we recollect your output.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CB2C0R25F743/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008N2Z1JC#wasThisHelpful","R3CB2C0R25F743","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Director Eugene Lourie's third giant monster movie and the first in color 'GORGO'-1960 gets the definitive transfer in this gorgeous Blu-Ray release by VCI entertainment.  Released theatrically by MGM, it seems it is now in the public domain and was released in two previous incarnations by VCI on DVD but they are quickly left under Mama Gorgo's big feet with this stunning 1.78 transfer from the best negative ever.  Although the blue screen effects and stock footage may be a tinch grainy in some spots (it was much worse on the big screen) the clean up and negative restoration goes a long way. Wait till you see the monsters climactic rampage through London taking place at night and you'll see what I mean. The cinematography by Freddie Young finally gets the treatment that it deserves.  You will also appreciate the beautiful score from Italian composer Angelo Francisco Lavagnino which fluctuates from bombastic to celtic beauty. He touched many genres from Spaghetti Westerns to Sci-Fi space operas but this remains one of his best. VCI gives you the option of isolating the score and its sound effects on their own.  The Blu-ray also enhances the Special Effects by Tom Howard and, Yes, it is a man in a suit movie rather than stop motion but if Director Inoshiro Honda could do it with his 'GODZILLA' aka 'GOJIRA'- 1955, Lourie actually may have improved on it. At a tight 77 minutes, we can forgive the over the top performances by Bill Travers and William Sylvestor by being caught up in the film's breathless pace. The special features in this package really are a 'GORGO' fans dream:  a 30 minute documentary 'THE 9TH WONDER OF THE WORLD: THE MAKING OF GORGO' written by Daniel Griffith, Film Historian Tom Weaver, Paul Mandell and Randall Turnbull who also narrates; motion animated galleries including Posters, Lobby cards. pressbook galleries, the covers of the 'GORGO' comic books, Toys. a behind the scenes photo gallery; Production notes from 1959 and ,of course, an original trailer.  Not my favorite in Director Eugene Lourie's monster trilogy, it does, however, ring a nostalgic bell for having viewed this in a movie theatre at the ripe old age of 7 years old and viewing it countless times back in the sixties on New York's old WOR TV 'MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE' which showed it about 6 times a day, its wonderful to see it in this dazzling Blu-Ray release light years ahead of the 35mm print shown in the theatres at that time.  This release is just that good and highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLRYHGWWC84U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2M78PU#wasThisHelpful","R1NLRYHGWWC84U","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Redemption continues to release the old Eurocine catalog which was available over a decade ago on DVD from Image Entertainment.  Now we have French Director Jean Rollin's troubled zombie excursion 'ZOMBIE LAKE' aka 'LES LAC DES ZOMBIES'- 1981 which was first given by Eurocine Producer Daniel Laseour to Director Jess Franco who co-wrote the script but was passed up because he was already involved with his own living dead opus 'OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES' aka 'LA TUMBA DE LOS MUERTOS VIVIENTES'- 1981 also available on Blu-Ray from Redemption.  This film is a bit different which involves a small European town being besieged by murders of young women and a secondary storyline involving a curse which is enabling the living dead soldiers to arise.  The mayor of the town is played by Franco stalwart Howard Vernon who brings a touch of class to the proceedings but is bogged down by the poor makeup effects and rushed direction.  There is also a touching undercurrent with the daughter of one of the zombie soldiers who confronts her zombified father but the age difference and time element of the situation leaves the viewers scratching their heads. Scenes of the zombies emerging from the water of the lake predate the scenes from Ken Wiederhoren's 'SHOCK WAVES'- 1977 and Director George Romero's 'LAND OF THE DEAD'-2005 but thats not saying much when you see the production values.  Director Rollin would film zombie flashback scenes for Director Jess Franco's excellent 'A VIRGIN AMONG THE LIVING DEAD' aka 'CHRISTINA PRINCESSE DE L'EROTISME'- 1971 when Eurocine decided to re-release the film the same year as 'ZOMBIE LAKE' to replace some soft core footage so the Franco/Rollin link would continue for a while. The only saving grace to this production is the wonderful photography by Max Monteillit who would also lens Rollin's finest zombie film 'THE LIVING DEAD GIRL' aka 'LA MORTE VIVANTE'-1982 and the beautiful performance by Anouchka who plays the daughter of the zombie soldier.  Franco's favorite music composer Daniel White has his work pilfered as fans will recognize excerpts from Jess's masterpieces 'THE AWFUL DR. ORLOFF'- aka 'GRITOS EN LA NOCHE'-1961 and 'FEMALE VAMPIRE' aka 'LA COMTESSE NOIRE'-1973 peppered throughout the film.  Originally released in a poor transfer on VHS by Wizard Video back in the Eighties, Redemption releases the film in a nice 1080P transfer surpassing the Image DVD with English/French Subtitled Audio options and trailers to other Rollin releases and Franco's 'OASIS' its only extras. The price, however, is a bit steep so if you already have the DVD from Image Entertainment, you may want to think about an upgrade.  Director Jean Rollin does try to give the material some kind of life (no pun intended) but unfortunately the film emerges as an oddity only recommended to zombie film fans who want to see them all (like me).","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RMV7IAXTMYV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIANITC#wasThisHelpful","R1RMV7IAXTMYV4","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Director Paco Plaza takes his 'REC' franchise and decides to go for the over the top jugular in 'REC 3-GENESIS'-2012 , a combination of straight out horror and yuk yuk three stooges humor.  The action takes place at the wedding and reception of Clara and Koldo who's day starts off being lensed by the photographers but 30 minutes into the film, Director Plaza decides to film the action straight on discarding the jerky camera movements.  It seems the uncle in the family shows up with a bite wound from the same dog who infected the apartment complex in the first film which causes the foaming mouth mayhem to insue. In fact, their is a beautiful scene where our hero is in a control room filled with monitors showing different areas of the reception grounds. As he is watching the monitors, Plaza revolves the camera to a television attached to the ceiling and it flickers images of the girl reporter filming the fire department entering the quarantined apartment complex so this films action is in real time with the first film.  The infected victims are given great makeup effects and their are some really exciting jolts within the films 80 minute running time. Director Plaza succeeds in some very horrific set pieces, case in point, our heroine finds herself on the grounds by herself during a torrential rain storm.  The camera pans to a lone figure in the distance approaching her and through the pouring rain, she realizes it is her mother.  She reaches out for her as the camera closes in on the mothers mouth spewing blood and puss as she lunges forward. The denouement is both poignant and terrifying.  The performances by Leticia Dolera and Diego Martin as the wedded couple are outstanding  which makes the ending of the film both hysterical and tragic and could have ended no other way.  For some lovers of the first two films, you may be in for a let down for their is no continuation of the storyline left over from the second film but for this fan it was , as always from this franchise, a great roller coaster ride.  The film utilizes a 1.85 aspect ratio for its opening camcorder scenes and when that camera is shattered, it switches to 2.35 for the rest of its running time.  It is in its original Spanish language with English subtitles. Outtakes and deleted scenes are the only extras. There is a fourth in the works so lets hope that we get to see more questions answered in that one.  As for now, 'REC 3-GENESIS' does deliver the goods for lovers of zombie and pandemic cinema.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JMGHPMOCY9LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008Y1YK7G#wasThisHelpful","R3JMGHPMOCY9LW","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deceit, lies , and full frontal nudity (female, of course) abound in Director Ruggero Deodato's 'WAVES OF LUST'aka 'ONDATA DI PIACERE'- 1975, a slick, enjoyable Euro thriller camouflaged by its soft core porn milieu. There were many of these types of films being made at that time in Europe. Directors Jess Franco and Aristide Massaccesi aka Joe d'Amato lensed them throughout the late seventies/early eighties and yet, Deodato's film comes off so much better as the sleaze factor is forced into the background and allowing the story to unfold at its own pacing.  The film is constantly compared to Director Roman Polanski's second feature 'KNIFE IN THE WATER' -1962 but only slightly hints at it. The screenplay and ideas by Lamberto Bava, Gianlorenzo Battaglia, Franco Bottari and Fabio Pittoro introduce many elements such as blackmail, domination, an early suicide (or is it murder ) which is never explained and envelops the viewer into a spiders web spinning into horrible possibilities that are placed strategically on to the screen where finally when the final denoument is revealed, the viewer is forced to exhale and say 'Ah, that's what it was all about'.  The acting quartet consists of: actor John Steiner who plays his egotistical character to the hilt and would also shine in Director Mario Bava's underrated ghost story 'SHOCK' aka 'BEYOND THE DOOR 2'-1977 ; Silvia Dionisio who was the wife of Deodato at the time and insisted on being in the film if her husband was filming abundant nudity; Elisabeth Turner who appeared in Director Lucio Fulci's 'THE PSYCHIC' aka 'SETTE NOTE IN NERO'-1977, and Al Cliver who was in at least five of Fulci's horror films.  The superb camerawork (on the yacht and under water) is by its screen writer Gianlorenzo Battaglia and Mario Capriotti showing off the scenic landscapes of Cefalu and its peppered with a nice progressive rock score by Marcelio Giombini.  Raro Video has now replaced No Shame films as a fantastic source for Italian cinema and this release boasts a beautiful 1.85 transfer in Italian with English Subtitles which is light years ahead of the poor dubbed SLP VHS copy which circulated over a decade ago.  It's extras include a 17 minute featurette called 'EROTIC TSUNAMI' including interviews with Directors Deodato and Lamberto Bava and actors Al Cliver and Deodato's son Saverio who cameos at the beginning of the film; Deleted scenes from a slightly longer English version which comprise of elongated sexual scenes trimmed surprisingly from the Italian version; Some early Television commercials with audio commentary by Deodato, and a director biography/filmography which also appears in a booklet with a critical analysis by Eric Cotenas contained in the slip case.  If you pair this film with Director Herbert Ross's underrated thriller 'THE LAST OF SHEILA'-1977,another film which takes place on a yacht and which contains similar surprises but less sex, you'll be in for a helluva good time. 'WAVES OF LUST' is Director Ruggero Deodato's simplest work before his violent cinema years culminating in my favorite 'CUT AND RUN' aka 'INFERNO IN DIRETTA'-1985 and yet it shows how a good erotic thriller can be made even if the director didn't believe in the project from the start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R169UY8PV16C31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XF0XSE#wasThisHelpful","R169UY8PV16C31","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Towards his final years, Horror icon Boris Karloff always said to interviewers that he would never stop acting and would die in harness which ,unfortunately, would be the case. Before that would happen, he did have the fortune of acting with two young film makers who would utilize him in the best of his final roles, Director Peter Bogdanovich's 'TARGETS'-1968 and Director Michael Reeve's 'THE SORCERERS'-1967.  The 23 year old Reeves was cutting his teeth in film production and his persistence and love of film would have him complete the foreign 'CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD'- 1964 and proceed to his first feature 'THE SHE BEAST'-1965 with actress Barbara Steele.  Producer Tony Tenser at Tigon Films was always looking for independent film makers looking for backing.  American Producer Patrick Curtis who was married to Raquel Welch at that time had two scripts which he wanted Reeves to direct.  Putting those scripts on hold , Curtis and Reeves came up with the basic plot of 'THE SORCERERS' co authored with Tom Baker and through an acquaintance, it came across Tenser's desk. Karloff was no slouch to this type of script having mind swapped decades back in Britain with Director Robert Stevenson's excellent 'THE MAN WHO CHANGED HIS MIND'-1936.  Reeves had Karloff in mind for this film and they got along wonderfully .  The film emerges as a chilling prospect of the older generation wishing for eternal youth which theme would eventually peak in Director Bernard McEveety's chilling masterpiece 'THE BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN'- 1970.  It also stars Catherine Lacey in a scene stealing performance and Reeves's friend Ian Ogilvy who would appear in all three of Reeves films. You will also glimpse a 17 year old Susan George in her first feature appearance as a doomed girl friend of Ogilvy's.  Appearing as a sixties time capsule with its rock music and psychedelic lighting, the film shows Director Reeves honing his craft which would come to fruition in his masterpiece 'WITCHFINDER GENERAL' aka 'THE CONQUEROR WORM'- 1968 and who got Horror icon Vincent Price to emote one of his greatest performances. With brilliant editing by David Woodward and superb photography by John Mantell, Reeves orchestrates his mind swap plot with a snap-crackle-pop pace making it more tragic that Reeves's life was cut off too soon due to a drug overdose just before he was to direct 'THE OBLONG BOX'.  The film has been rarely seen having been released on VHS by Allied Artists back in the eighties in a horrible transfer and badly cut (surprisingly , there is no nudity in the film and has some minor gore scenes).  Warner Archive has released it in its first DVD transfer in the United States in its proper 1.85 ratio but no negative clean up which makes the film look more cutting edge than ever.  Unfortunately, their are no extras, it would have been nice to see a feature on Director Reeves or even an original trailer but it's not to be.  Warner, however, deserves kudos for giving Karloff fans a glimpse of one of his final performances even through the pain he must have been feeling in his scenes (you can see him wincing as he sits in a chair or walks across a room).  He was a real trooper and a brilliant artist who along with Director Michael Reeves created a unique be-careful-what-you- wish-for thriller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K7KUDZSTGP1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009H3LPKU#wasThisHelpful","R3K7KUDZSTGP1Z","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once you become a Jess Franco fan and you try to view as many of his titles as you can find, you will discover many instances when he either believed in the project or just went through the motions.  This film 'OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES' aka 'LA TUMBA DE LOS MUERTOS VIVIENTES' aka 'L' ABIME DES MORTS-VIVANTS'- 1981 is a perfect example of the latter. This is the Franco film  which many Horror fans were turned onto and disappointed with when released on VHS by the Wizard label in the mid eighties and probably turned many viewers off to Franco's films from then onward.  It also belongs to a series? of Nazi Zombie movies that erupted at this time including Director Jean Rollin's 'ZOMBIE LAKE' aka 'LES LAC DES ZOMBIES'- 1981 and Director Ken Weiderhorn's 'SHOCK WAVES'-1977. The son of a Nazi officer who was under Rommel's desert army tactics decides to take a bunch of friends to the North African desert to satisfy his curiosity on his fathers demise. It also involves buried treasure which coincides with a sub plot involving a survivor of Rommel's army searching for the spoils also and whose party is spoiled when his digging causes the buried dead soldiers of the German squad to rise and wreck havoc protecting the treasure resembling the plot of Director Edward L. Cahn's superior low budget entry 'ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU'- 1957. It sounds good on paper but it is definitely a low point in Franco's filmography.  Releasing the film under the Eurocine label of which he directed some of his best work, here he is just merely slumming through the proceedings with only an occasional location site to wake up the viewer.  The film was released in French (which is represented here) and Spanish versions of which, unfortunately, Redemption does not include in this release which means that it has never been released world wide and seems to be the one to view because it includes Franco muse Lina Romay and Spanish actor Eduardo Fajardo in the roles played by Miriam Landson and Henri Lambert in the French version and is edited by both Franco and Romay. This Blu-Ray release is the identical version released by Image Entertainment over a decade ago and is much sharper and clearer but even the format cannot transform a sows ear into a silk purse. The viewer will notice that the desert scenes seem to be culled from footage to an Italian film directed by exploitation master Alfredo Rizzo 'I GIARDINI DEL DIAVOLO-' 1971 which as yet has not seen a digital release (and probably won't) and do not match the film stock in Franco's film.  The three stars is for the music score by Franco alumnus Daniel White who never disappoints.  The film can be viewed in both English and French with English subtitles and has other Redemption trailers as its extras. With mediocre makeup effects and poor continuity, this film is recommended for Jess Franco and Zombie film completists only although a Franco film is never a complete time waster for this viewer, however, if you have the Image DVD, it may not pay to upgrade for the price is a bit steep for the Blu-Ray edition .","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MY3DDQ7KQX9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIANJ7S#wasThisHelpful","R3MY3DDQ7KQX9X","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here we have a good old fashioned Horror movie the likes of which proliferated throughout the Forties and Fifties and because of its mixture of humor and bloodletting, it works marvelously.  Director Vernon Sewell's 'THE BLOOD BEAST TERROR' aka 'THE VAMPIRE BEAST CRAVES BLOOD'-1967 resembles its distant British cousins; Director Sydney J. Furie's 'THE SNAKE WOMAN'- 1960 and Director John Gilling's 'THE REPTILE' -1965  with the daughters of prominent doctors having curses placed on them causing them to transform into snakes but here we have our doctor creating his daughter from a moth/human hybrid with the inevitable disastrous results (we must not forget another distant cousin in Director Roger Corman's 'THE WASP WOMAN'-1957 but the transformation results from bee hormones injected into cold cream ).  The doctor role was to be played by Basil Rathbone but he succumbed to a heart attack two weeks before shooting started.  Producer Tony Tenser had distributed Director Riccardo Freda's brilliant hommage to gothic horror, necrophilia and actress Barbara Steele  'L'ORRIBILE SEGRETO DEL DR. HICHCOCK' aka 'THE HORRIBLE DR. HICHCOCK' -1961 and was able to secure actor Robert Flemyng as our 'mad as a March hare' Dr. Mallinger (but he still is Dr. Hichcock in my book).  Our femme fatale is the beautiful Wanda Ventham who plays our deaths head moth in erotic nympho style and steals the film from everyone involved. She would also slightly steal her way through Writer/Director Brian Clemens's underrated vampire western 'CAPTAIN KRONOS VAMPIRE HUNTER'-1971.  We also have Peter Cushing as the Inspector who supposedly detested the script and decided to insert humor into the dialogue predating actor Thorley Walters blusterly policeman in Director Terence Fischer's masterpiece 'FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED' - 1969 but with less sarcasm but a memorable performance none the less.  The film emerges as an entertaining hoot with the script by Peter Bryan borrowing from many past horrors.  The photography is by future British Sex comedy auteur Stanley A. Long which in this Blu-Ray incarnation really enhances the proceedings.  Director Sewell would go on to direct Boris Karloff's last British film 'CURSE OF THE CRIMSON ALTAR' aka 'THE CRIMSON CULT'-1970 with Christopher Lee and Barbara Steele wasting their talents and the frustrating 'BURKE AND HARE'- 1972 which is also released by Redemption in both DVD and Blu-Ray.  Released over a decade ago on DVD by Image Entertainment in a slightly worn transfer, this Redemption disc is light years ahead of it with rich colors and tones presented in its original 1.66 theatrical aspect ratio in eye popping 1080P.  Extras include an original British trailer for the film, other Redemption trailers and a still gallery. For all fans of sixties Horror, this is a real guilty pleasure and recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12V0NDW17LCN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007WCJVSQ#wasThisHelpful","R12V0NDW17LCN9","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is ironic that the two Italian Directors who would change the look of the Western genre in the mid sixties were cutting their teeth in the spectacle arena many years before.  Director Sergio Leone would direct the way ahead of its time epic 'THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES' aka 'IL COLOSSO DI RODI' -1961  and Director Sergio Corbucci would direct a series of spectacles with actor Steve Reeves of which this entry 'THE SLAVE-SON OF SPARTICUS' aka 'IL FIGLIO DI SPARTACUS'- 1962 emerges as Reeves peak as an action performer.  Almost a direct sequel to Director Stanley Kubrick's 'SPARTACUS' -1960, this film continues the legacy as Varinia's child with Spartacus matures and takes revenge on Crassus who was responsible for his fathers demise and crucifiction.  What we have is a magnificent film which sort of got lost in the shuffle with all of the Hercules, Samson, Maciste, Goliath etc. entries unleashed in abundance at that time.  The main characters are portrayed by brilliant familiar Italian actors. Besides Reeves performance of Randus, you have the over the top villainy of Claudio Gora as Crassus spewing so much saliva that the tapestries in his chambers seem drenched with it, the beautiful Gianna Maria Canale as Clodia who is Crassus's unfortunate playmate and incinerates the screen every time she appears, Jacques Sernas as the javelin throwing villain Vernas, and Ivo Garrani as Julius Caesar.  The only flaw is the lame acting of the Egyptian slave inamorata of Randus played by Ombretta Colli who's part could have been played by any Euro starlet at that time.  The film also shines behind the cameras as well with some of the best technicians fused together: Cameraman Enzo Barboni who would become a director of Spaghetti Westerns and photographed Director Corbucci's classic 'DJANGO'-1966 here shoots some of the most panoramic images of his career utilizing depth of field and Egyptian locations fused with some brilliant sets in the Titanus studios; the music score by Piero Piccioni is one of his best and the editing is by future Federico Fellini alumnus Ruggero Mastroianni.  Warner Archive releases the film in a DVD-R in its proper 2.35 ratio with great color and clarity in its English Dubbed Mono soundtrack and images. Director Corbucci would go on to direct the even better epic 'DUEL OF THE TITANS' aka 'ROMOLO E REMO' -1963 with Reeves and actor Gordon Scott utilizing some of the same technicians and help immortalize the Euro Western in a series of unforgettable films.  But for now, click the add to cart button and enjoy a film that must be seen in its widescreen format.  Along with Director Pietro Francisci's 'HERCULES UNCHAINED' aka 'ERCOLE E LA REGINA DI LIDIA'- 1960, 'THE SLAVE' emerges as one of the best of all Italian spectacles and Warner Archive deserves kudos for preserving it for future generations of action film lovers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZQHTKMAZP9SO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NNY8BS#wasThisHelpful","R1ZQHTKMAZP9SO","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't believe it , Roger Corman's  'DEATH RACE' franchise just acts like the energizer bunny , it keeps going and going. Now Paul W.S. Anderson and Director Roel Rene have taken the race to the Kalahari desert in 'DEATH RACE 3: INFERNO' -2013 with virtually the same cast and introducing Dougray Scott and drop dead gorgeously deadly Hlubi Mboya taking care of the villain department.  Luke Goss scowls and rants returning as Death Race champ Frankenstein and his sidekick Katrina played by the equally gorgeous Tanit Phoenix kicks butt to win the final race for freedom.  The real stars of the film however are behind the scenes as the beautiful editing by Radu Ion and Michael Trent blending with the first rate photography by Wayne Shields elevates the film higher than it should be. The music score by Trevor Morris is just OK but eventually overwhelmed by the incredibly loud explosions and grinding motor engines persisting throughout the films running time (but that's why we watch this stuff, right?). The Blu-Ray is beautiful in a 1.85 transfer and thundering Dolby Digital sound to rock the cranium.  The races are faster, the deaths are cleverer and it looks like another sequel is in the works with revenge as the catalyst.  Guys, just bring it on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FKILLTV9X9UQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WGYMO8#wasThisHelpful","R2FKILLTV9X9UQ","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Throughout the seventies, many British studios tried to compete with Hammer Films in the Horror genre output and few succeeded.  Here we have a rare British title , Director Vernon Sewell's 'BURKE AND HARE'- 1972, which received limited distribution in the states and appeared in mom and pop video stores in the eighties via a muddy VHS transfer. The story of grave robbers doing murderous business with surgeons in 1800's Edinburgh had been filmed many times before and because it was the seventies , this version contains dark and crude sexual humor taking place in brothels and pubs making it hard to classify it as a Horror film or an exploitation comedy.  It is peppered with many familiar British actors : Harry Andrews as Dr. Knox who seems to be slumming it, the always excellent Derren Nesbitt in a front and center role for once , an unrecognizable Yootha Joyce as Burke's Sweeney Todd/Mrs. Lovett-like unpleasant wife, and as the gorgeous brothel trollops ,Francoise Pascal and a blink or you'll miss cameo by Yutte Stensgaard who played Mircalla/Millarca Karnstein in Director Jimmy Sangster's 'LUST FOR A VAMPIRE'- 1970 who gave that role an underrated performance. Director Sewell directs the proceedings in a straight forward manner having come off the set of the much better guilty pleasure 'THE BLOOD BEAST TERROR' aka 'THE VAMPIRE BEAST CRAVES BLOOD'-1971 also available from Redemption Films in Blu-Ray or DVD.  The Blu-Ray is a nice clear transfer in its correct 1.66 aspect ratio showing off the production design giving a you are there feel to the dirty alleyways and interior hovels enhancing the crisp cinematography by Desmond Dickinson although the negative fluctuates with bluish blemishes and brownish tones.  The music score by Roger Webb is average but the main and end titles has an annoying theme song sung by a group called 'THE SCAFFOLD'.  Extras include a featurette called 'GRAVE DESIRES:CORPSES ON FILM' ; a wonderful interview with actress Francoise Pascal who seemed to enjoy the shoot and trailers to this film plus other Redemption British titles.  For those who want to see more of this type of material, scope out Director John Gilling's stylish 'THE FLESH AND THE FIENDS' aka 'MANIA' -1961 with Peter Cushing in the Dr. Knox role which may be the definitive version of the material and also Director Freddie Francis's intense work 'THE DOCTOR AND THE DEVILS'- 1985 with Timothy Dalton as Dr. Knox.  Of course, Director Robert Wise's 'THE BODY SNATCHER' -1945  should be mentioned with the 'BURKE AND HARE' characters hovering over the proceedings of actor Henry Daniel as the good Dr. MacFarlane and the ultimate Boris Karloff performance :Cab man Grey.  For British Horror completists only, it is an offbeat piece of British history come to life and should be much better if not for the seesawing of Benny Hill like humor and serious horror making the viewing of 'BURKE AND HARE' a frustrating experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLOXWWHBJVMZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UQ8IP6#wasThisHelpful","RLOXWWHBJVMZO","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW, what a wonderful jewel to come across (just like what takes place in the film).  I came across this title by accident surfing a movie channels selections and was intrigued by the synopsis.  What emerged was a beautiful film of coping with loss and the way every bit of life that people touch within their stay on this plain effects time through the ages up to the present.  Writer/Director Julian Fellowes 'FROM TIME TO TIME'-2008 approaches its subject from the point of view of its main character brilliantly played by Alex Etel and we the audience are introduced and experience each clue as the story progresses.  You've read about the story and characters in the reviews within so its great to discuss the production by Luciana Arrighi and the cinematography by Alan Almond which bounces you back and forth from 1809 to 1940 with the greatest of ease.  The performances are outstanding by all including a villainous take by Dominic West , absolutely shattering characters portrayed by Dame Maggie Smith and Pauline Collins plus a surprise appearance by Timothy Spall.  The transfer is in a 1.85 ratio with subtitles if needed and includes a feature called Cast and Crew Interviews with main actors (not Dame Maggie Smith, unfortunately) and behind the scenes filmmaking.  A trailer for the film rounds out the special features.  It contains so much heart and soul that it must be experienced rather than talked about and it has become one of my favorite films of all time.  Click the add to cart button and enjoy a story which includes time travel, ghosts, and incredible sentimentality taking place at the end of World War II in Britain all during the Christmas holiday.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32X8JL12EJAXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007A2O3FO#wasThisHelpful","R32X8JL12EJAXO","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The latest release from Wild East Productions boasts a double feature which blends the Spaghetti Western with the suspense thriller in two rare films starring two underrated American actors.  Up first is the best of the lot, Director Piero Pierotti's (here billed as Peter E. Stanley) 'TAILS YOU LOSE' aka 'HEADS OR TAILS' aka 'TESTA O CROCE'- 1969 starring John Ericson as an outlaw trying to solve a murder plot involving an innocent prostitute whom he is in love with.  Here the actresses shine as we have incredible performances by Sheyla Rosin and Danila Surima as well as an early appearance by Euro cult babe Edwige Fenech years before her Giallo thrillers with Director Sergio Martino and who graduated to sex comedies and here is involved in a brutally strong whipping sequence. Ericson is awesome as he disposes of the suspects leading to a tragic ending. It boasts a beautiful music score by Carlo Savina and intense camerawork by Fausto Zuccoli. Next we have character actor Luke Askew in his only Euro oater blasting his way through Director Giulio Petroni's 'NEST OF VIPERS' aka 'NIGHT OF THE SERPENT' aka 'NOTTE DEL SERPENTE' -1969. The scene stealer is Euro actor Luigi Pistilli in one of his best roles as a sleazy Mexican cop trying to steal an inheritance from a young boy by hiring Askew to assassinate him.  When Askew becomes aware of his target, he switches sides and the film erupts into a paranoid blood bath.  This film also boast two beautiful Euro actresses, the gorgeous Magda Konopka and the sultry Chelo Alonso along for the ride. It has a great Riz Ortolani music score and nice landscape photography by Mario Vulpiani and Silvio Fraschetti. It's only flaw is its periods of dullness peppered throughout its running time.  Although not as good as his masterpiece 'DEATH RIDES A HORSE' aka 'DA UOMO A UOMO'- 1967, its worth a look just for Pistilli's performance alone. Both films are presented in excellent Wild East style: 'TAILS' is in a brand new 1.85widescreen transfer and 'VIPERS' in a 2.35 aspect ratio, both are in gorgeous shape.  Each has their own picture galleries, 'TAILS"" has its Italian trailer included along with another John Ericson Western Director Jose M. Elorrrieta's 'THE TREASURE OF PANCHO VILLA' aka 'SEVEN FOR PANCHO VILLA'-1966 and 'VIPERS"" with its own trailer.  Again, another great Spaghetti Western package from Wild East as two rarities in the genre get their deserved releases.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HDJI079UH52V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APAR4JA#wasThisHelpful","R2HDJI079UH52V","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Warner Archive releases the first of two films involving the character of Sandokan, a popular Middle Eastern hero in Director Umberto Lenzi's 'SANDOKAN THE GREAT' aka 'SANDOKAN LA TIGRA DI MONPRACEN' aka 'SANDOKAN LE TIGRE DI BORNEO'- 1963 and played by Steve Reeves who graced the screen in many heroic incarnations (Hercules among them) who seeks revenge on the British soldiers who slaughtered his mother and forced his father into exile.  The film contains many great set pieces such as elephant stampedes, tiger wrestling and head hunting natives predating Director Lenzi's later infamous cannibal forays which makes for an enjoyable 100 minute affair. Genre stalwart Andrea Bosic and the beautiful Genevieve Grad who played in other sword and sandal films are along for the party.  It has great location photography lensed on the island of Ceylon by Angelo Lotti and Aurelio Guiterez Larrata and a rousing music score by Giovanni Fusco.  Warner Archive presents the film in a 2.35 widescreen presentation with no extras , the negative fluctuating from clear, brilliant colors to fuzzy faded images depending on the reel changes.  Reeves would team with Lenzi again for 'THE PIRATES OF MALAYSIA' aka 'I PIRATI DELLA MALAYSIA' -1964 continuing Sandokan's adventures and culminating in a rarely seen off shoot entitled 'TEMPLE OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT' aka 'SANDOKAN IL MACISTE DELLA GIUNGLA' made the same year and starring Errol Flynn's son Sean donning the red turban and giving Steve Reeves a well deserved breather.  It makes for a great Saturday afternoon time waster, films which unfortunately are few and far between in our CGI modern age.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16CQ81PJ44H1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NNY8DG#wasThisHelpful","R16CQ81PJ44H1H","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pity poor Gio Brezzi who's not having a good day.  He escapes from prison , kills two farmers for their car and proceeds to a country house where he buried 300 million lire 5 years previous but now finds it occupied by a trio of misfits who he must get out of the way in order to collect the spoils.  This is the premise of the latest release from Raro Video ,Director/Screenwriter Fernando Di Leo's 'MADNESS' aka 'VACANZE PER UN MASSACRO'- 1980.  Basically a four character play, the film cannot be pinned down to any genre and it may not be for everyone with its doses of kinky sex and violence but you can say one thing, you cannot take your eyes off the screen. The film has a surprisingly good performance by Andy Warhol alumnus Joe Dallesandro as Gio but the real scene stealer is the sex pot performance by actress Lorraine De Selle who sexually manipulates both her sisters husband and Gio.  Director Di Leo keeps the movie moving at a rapid clip till its incredible climactic punch line due to an excellent classical rock music score by Luis Enrico Bacalov who scored many a Spaghetti Western including Director Sergio Corbuccis's classic 'DJANGO' -1966 which can now be heard in Director Quentin Tarantino's small hommage to the Euro Western 'DJANGO UNCHAINED'. He completely fills the movie landscape as the score bursts forth endlessly in the background and out of the car radios and transistor radios used by the characters. Raro Video releases the film in a beautiful 1.85 transfer in Italian with English subtitles but skimpy on the extras with a Director Biography and Filmography also found in the illustrated booklet provided within the slipcase.  Raro Video deserves kudos for continually releasing the works of this remarkable artist including the fabulous box set of his crime movies this past year and it deserves to be in every Euro fans film collection.  Recommended for lovers of offbeat cinema, its more than just a kinky diversion and emerges as an interesting character study between these warped individuals presented by a master filmmaker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VIAJYL9I0VEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007K7IBZM#wasThisHelpful","R3VIAJYL9I0VEI","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I had read throughout various Euro Cult Cinema websites that Raro Video USA was releasing Director Giorgio Ferroni's 'THE NIGHT OF THE DEVILS' aka 'LA NOTTE DEI DIAVOLI""-1972 on BluRay , I shivered with anticipation.  Available for over a decade in inferior VHS and DVD bootlegs, the film can now be fully appreciated in its wonderful 2.35 glory with updated English subtitles and gorgeous DTS-HD MA 2.0 audio.  Director Ferroni touched many genres including sword and sandal and a quartet of Spaghetti Westerns with actor Giuliano Gemma but only made two entries in the Horror/Thriller genre, this one and the wonderfully atmospheric 'MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN' aka 'IL MULINO DELLE DONNE DI PIETRA'- 1960 available in a beautiful transfer from the Mondo Macabro label.  The short story by Tolstoy 'THE WURDALAK' was unforgettably lensed as part of a horror trilogy by Horror maestro Mario Bava in 'BLACK SABBATH' aka 'I TRE VOLTI DELLA PAURA'-1963 starring Boris Karloff but now Ferroni reboots the tragic family tale into a modern setting somewhere in the Hungarian countryside. By having our protagonist confined to an insane asylum, we are allowed to experience the nightmare in flashback culminating in an exciting climax at the fade out.  The cast is excellent:  Gianni Garko who is known to Euro fans as the classic Western character Sartana : the stunning Agostina Belli who made many genre titles including Director Edward Dymitryk's infamous version of 'BLUEBEARD'-1972 (wait till you see her beautiful blue eyes in Blu-Ray) and other familiar faces including a wonderful cameo by actress Maria Monti who plays the eerie witch of the town.  Monti also acted in Bava's 'DROP OF WATER' episode in 'BLACK SABBATH' .as the spiritualist's housekeeper.  The true scene stealer is child actress Cinzia De Carolis who plays Irena predating the child vampires from such films as Neil Jordan's 'INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE' -1994 and Director Tomas Alfredson's 'LET THE RIGHT ONE IN'-2008 among others.  De Carolis who also played in Director Dario Argento's 'THE CAT OF NINE TAILS' aka 'IL GATTO A NOVE CODE'-1971 as blind Karl Malden's sidekick plays her vampire role with animalistic gusto and is hard to shake after the film fades to black.  I purchased this through a company called Fictions because it seems Raro Video keeps postponing the release through Amazon so scoff it up while you can, it arrives in good condition and it is a US release not an import.  The release has a few extras including an unnecessarily loud introduction to the film by Fangoria magazines Chris Alexander and an interview with composer Giorgio Gaslini who seems annoyed with his interviewer throughout the Q's & A's.  There is a booklet included with the same Q & A interview with Gaslini and liner notes by Alexander.  Highly recommended for Euro Horror and vampire film fans, Raro Video should be commended for bringing this rarity into the digital age showing how Britain's Hammer Films were not the only memorable studios releasing excellent product in the late sixties/early seventies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29FV6XF2UXKGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008H1Q4XQ#wasThisHelpful","R29FV6XF2UXKGT","A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"~* 3.5 Stars *~I love a good sports romance. Doesn't matter the sport, really, though I do favor football and hockey. Great news for me, then, that Kate Willoughby hits the ice with sexy, romance-y, hockey playing fun in this new series. I've had a fan girl crush on Willoughby since her Be-Wished series (paranormal romantica fans should check that out), so when I found out she was working on this, well...lets just say there was squeeing and happy wiggling and leave it at that. It was embarrassing, really.But I was so happy!It's a more mainstream romance with a tamer sexuality level than her Be-Wished series, but it has the same depth of emotion and story that got me hooked on Willoughby's writing to begin with. It also has a nice mix of sports and romance. The hockey elements never felt superfluous, or just a convenient backdrop for the romance. Instead, it was given enough attention, detail, and significance to the story and the characters that it became one of the defining factors.I would have liked more time spent with Tim's teammates and a closer look inside the team's locker room, though. Tim and Erin's story, while charming, cute, and brimming with emotion and sexy good times, was also fairly straightforward and didn't have many ancillary plot threads focusing on detailing Tim's life as a hockey player or his relationships with fellow players. There were a few ancillary characters and plot threads that were introduced early in the book, but the threads petered out and those characters didn't make much of an appearance once the relationship arc between Tim and Erin heated up and commanded the story's focus.That's not really a complaint, because I liked the story as it is just fine. I just think a few more layers of could've propelled it into the love range for me.The characters didn't have quite the same level of appeal to me as their story did, though. There was nothing wrong with them. I don't mean that. In fact, I can't imagine a more heartbreaking trauma to survive than the death of a child, so Tim in particular tugged at my heart strings from the beginning. I never begrudged him his completely understandable issues, even though they did telegraph a major wrinkle in the relationship with the husband-and-kids-wanting Erin.My problem was that Tim was just slightly more in touch with his hearts-and-flowers emotional side than I prefer in my romantic heroes, and a bit too quick to fall wholeheartedly into love with Erin. And Erin, though feisty and determined, with a generous heart and giving nature, was just not the sort of woman I can easily relate to.She was nice. Truly, there wasn't a single bad thing about her. It's just...the book introduces her while she's trying to catch Dr. O's romantic interest by baking for him until he loves her. That was way too Fifties Housewife for me to feel comfortable with her as the romantic lead and it left me with a less than favorable first impression that lingered well into the book. Even after that improved, I struggled to relate to her long term goals and desires. She was just a bit too much of a gender stereotype for me.But there were great things in the book, too. Things that touched me, or made me grin, or even tear up a little. The story was great. The hockey was great. The writing was great. The characters just weren't quite up there for me. I still got a total feel-good buzz by the end, and I'm looking forward to Willoughby's next installment. It's sports romance. It's hockey. It's Willoughby. I'm so there.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by both the author and Carina Press via NetGalley.

"I've been a long-time fan and user of Caress soap, so I thought I'd give this new scent a try. I was pleased to find that the soap works as well as the Caress I'm used to. It lathers very well (though the bluish color of the suds took a bit of getting used to) and it rinses nicely. I have skin that tends towards dry and has to deal with both the Florida sun and hard water on a daily basis, so moisture retention is important to me, but other soaps - even moisturizing bars - either don't rinse well enough and leave my skin with a slimy feel or completely dry me out. Caress has always been a cost-friendly, reliable choice for my household.I'd love to say that this new Emerald Rush scent was a perfect fit given all that, but unfortunately, this scent didn't work for me. It's very strong, which wouldn't be at all bad if I liked how it smelled. I'm sad to say I don't. It's very floral, too floral for my tastes, and rightly or wrongly, it reminds me of a perfume my grandmother wore when I was a little girl.For those who like the scent, I think this would be a great choice. It does work as reliably and nicely as the Caress I'm used to. This particular scent just isn't for me. I'll go back to the original and be happier for it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU4KMS3ZEM6EZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSNWXYI#wasThisHelpful","RU4KMS3ZEM6EZ","A2E9HDZXQORZLA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9HDZXQORZLA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My feelings are so conflicted about this book. It's definitely like nothing I've ever read before, and I liked both the uniqueness of story and the wealth of emotion Kerick stirs with the personal journeys of main characters Robby and Tristan, with Savi's unconventional assist. It was gripping in places, heart-rending and painful. Other parts were soothingly, gently hopeful or sweetly, charmingly romantic. A good part of it was tense and a little confusing - in that totally good way of reading a story that's drawn you so deeply into a character's life that his or her perplexed discomfort becomes your own.Then there were the parts that infuriated and frustrated me, both on behalf of the trials Robby and Tristan face (a testament to how affected I was by them), and in a less positive way at the story itself, which had a few elements that didn't appeal.For the first three quarters of the book I was totally hooked. I absolutely loved this unusual, touching, emotional story. I loved Robby, with his befuddlement and earnest social awkwardness in the face of his complex and confusing reactions to both Savannah and Tristan. His journey locked me into this book and refused to let me go. And Tristan, the sweet man-child with a gentle soul and horrific past, made my heart ache.He is such a broken young man, our Tristan, so fragile in so many ways, and yet there's such a guileless innocence and decency in him that I just wanted everything to work out for him, because he desperately deserved happiness, peace, and unlimited love.It didn't matter to me in the slightest that the unconventional relationship between Tristan, Robby, and Savannah wasn't to my taste for romance. Frankly, the dynamic between Robby and Tristan didn't work for me in that regard, anyway, so I just stopped expecting any sexy M/M romance from the story early in. That helped tremendously.In fact, this read much more to me like a coming of age story than anything else...except that all parties are already of age (despite the kid's card games and boyish nicknames). It was just far more effective for me as an emotional journey of self-discovery, acceptance, and healing than any sort of romance.That's generally not something I like to read, but for the first three quarters of this book I was utterly and totally captivated by the characters and their lives. I loved everything about it. Well, okay, I loathed Robby's friend Mikey. From his introduction he did nothing but disgust me. That wouldn't have been too big a problem, though, if it didn't also draw Robby's strength of character into question for putting up with him for so long.Still, I was dealing with that well enough right up until the incident between Mikey and Tristan. That's where the story started to stumble for me. The aftermath of that scene did more than draw Robby's strength of character into question. It obliterated it, as well as any respect I had for him as a human being for his response - or astounding lack thereof - to what Mikey had done. But it got worse, because there was also Robby's father.Again, the problem wasn't that Robby's father wouldn't be winning any Father (or Husband) of the Year awards. He's a controlling, close-minded homophobe, but I expect to encounter at least one in stories of this type, so while I detested him, he was not the issue. No, it was Robby's choices and actions after the inevitable face-to-face with the man that derailed the story for me and put another series of large dents into Robby's knight-in-tarnished armor.By that point in the story, I was hating on Robby almost as much as I was on his dad and Mikey. Fortunately, it was relatively near to the end of the book. Unfortunately, the too-abrupt resolution to everything didn't quite redeem Robby to me before the story ends, so in general the book ended in a less positive place for me than it was throughout the first three quarters of the story.It also begs mentioning that the book's cover art, which practically oozes an implication of hot, sexy, mature content, utterly fails to reflect the New Adult tone of the story and the extremely tame (mostly glossed over) sexuality in the two brief scenes in which sex occurs. The cover is sexy and beautiful, no argument there, but that art shouldn't be on a book with a story that refers to a man's dangly bits as his ""privates"" during the only moderately descriptive sex scene in the whole book. Fortunately, it didn't affect my opinions of the story, but that's only because I didn't see it before I finished the book.Disclosure: A copy of this book was provided to me by the author for review.

"~* 4.5 Stars *~Wow, this was such a fun read. Frankly, I wasn't expecting to like it nearly as much as I did. I'm not a fan of zombies, so I tend to avoid books that feature them, but I was curious about the mix of shifter romance and zombie apocalypse in this novella. I thought I'd give it a chance, but my expectations weren't high. By the end, every one of those expectations were greatly exceeded.Despite the short length of this novella, there is an abundance of world building, plenty of action, and enough depth of character that both Seth and Maisie were more well-rounded than I'm used to reading in stories of this length. And the tale is written with a fast, engaging style and has a healthy serving of humor that appealed to me, despite the bleak post-apocalyptic London setting and the zombies that made it that way.Both Seth and Maisie were quirky, completely likable characters, especially the indomitable Maisie, who I adored, and their chemistry was off the charts.The relationship between them built up a lot faster than I normally prefer in my romance, as the entire story timeline takes place over a couple of days, but Seth and Maisie acknowledge that in the narrative, and that, along with the fact that Seth's werewolf nature allowed for a bit more leniency from me about that, served to mitigate any serious issue with how quick they get to their Happily Ever After. Or...well...potential HEA, as the Ever After in the story is fairly dependent on those zombies being dispatched sooner rather than later.One of the things I liked most about this story was the wealth of emotional baggage each character is dragging around. Seth has the weight of his responsibilities as pack alpha and the lingering damage from his former lover's betrayal. Maisie is still struggling with the guilt from surviving the zombie attack that killed her family and has a damaged leg and a permanent limp as a daily reminder. Neither one of them were exactly normal and well-adjusted, but both of them were just three dimensional enough to keep from coming off as cardboard cutouts of real people.There were a surprising number of twists and turns in the plot given the story's shorter length, but I do wish there had been a bit more attention given to fleshing out and better defining the external conflict of the story. That particular plot element was fairly thin, with so much of the story space having already been allotted to building up the foundation of the world and the characters themselves.It actually took me awhile to recognize that there was a specific thread of external conflict going on in the unusual zombie attacks occurring around the city. There was just so much else to focus on that it didn't even occur to me that the tidbits of information about them were being woven into both this particular story's arc as well as the larger series arc until the story started cresting into its climax. Because of that, the end of the story seemed a bit rushed to me and didn't quite answer all the questions I had, nor resolve all the issues.Some of that is understandable as part and parcel of being a series debut, but given how everything else was given such perfect attention, I felt the loss. But because everything else was given such perfect attention, and Seth and Maisie did such a good job stealing my heart, it was a loss I can easily live with.I wish this had been a full-length novel. And not because I would have liked seeing one or two elements have a bit more room to really be explored in the story...though that is part of the reason. Mostly, though, I just wasn't ready to be finished with Seth and Maisie's story. I loved them so much as characters and a couple that I wanted to spend more time with them both. On the bright side, if Schnyder's goal, like P.T. Barnum's, was to leave them wanting more, Schnyder achieved the hell out of it. I want more from her as an author and more of this series.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley.

"~* 3.5 Stars *~Lately it seems I'm plagued with series debuts that don't read like series debuts. It's frustrating. At least in this case, there's a clear reason for it. Main characters Nickie and Duncan are featured in both Wolfe's Black Creek series and in Savage Echoes, a prequel novella for this series. I'm certain I would have had an easier time with this book had I read those, because there just wasn't enough exposition in this one to sufficiently introduce the characters or explain important story elements before the meat of the plot got going.That was a problem for me, as the majority of the plot conflict revolves around Nickie's past, and there are a plethora of references to events and situations that I could only assume took place in one of those other two stories. As a result, I spent most of the first half of the book (and in places in the second half) feeling a general sense of disconnect and varying levels of confused.I think my understanding was hampered by the third person limited point of view in which it's written. Though the character focus in the narrative shifts back and forth between Nickie and Duncan, which helped me get better acquainted with each of them, the lack of an omniscient voice didn't allow for a broader picture of their world and their past, and neither character deigned to reminisce on previously established information in a way that would have helped me find and keep my footing with the story.That's a shame, too, because I think if I'd had that previously laid groundwork to build on, I could have loved this book.I know I loved Duncan and I enjoyed Nickie most of the time - which is saying a lot for me, as I'm very tough on my fictional heroines. There were times when Nickie totally shut down and seemed more the victimized damsel than was comfortable for me, but most of the time she was a tough-as-nails, gritty chick I admired.The best parts of the book for me were the scenes that featured both Duncan and Nickie. I absolutely adored them as a couple. Between Duncan's stalwart and unflagging devotion to Nickie and her fierce love for him, despite her myriad issues and their very different personalities, their scenes together stole the show for me. Before I was even sure I liked either character, I loved them together.I also liked that their relationship, while obviously new, was already established. I don't read a lot of romance fiction in which that's the case, but I think the romantic suspense genre is a good fit for that particular relationship dynamic. Too, both Duncan and Nickie are very damaged characters, another point that appeals. Characters just seem more realistic to me when they have damage or flaws that impact their lives. We are all, to a one of us, walking wounded.The external conflict in the plot was solid and meaty, even though some of the context was lost on me, but a few elements left me perplexed. I couldn't quite get a handle on Nickie's roll on the police force, as she seemed to spend more time investigating the connection between the evidence recovered in Vegas and her own childhood trauma than working any current day-to-day cases.Don't get me wrong, I liked the story elements in the book and thought the investigative/police procedural end was nicely done. I just wasn't clear on how she could spend so much time on it over her open, active cases and more recent local crimes. I ended up feeling a little perplexed but mostly entertained by it all.Hell, any attempt to end what was going on with the Bad Guys in this book is considered a solid win for me, story-wise.Now that I've spent time with Nickie and Duncan and gotten a feel for their personal histories and their relationship, I want to read more, but to be completely honest, it wasn't always easy getting here. I would recommend this book only to readers familiar with the third book in Wolfe's Black Creek series or that prequel novella I mentioned. I certainly wish I had read those, because Savage Deception is listed as the first book in what has the potential to be a gangbusters romantic suspense series. It just doesn't read like it.Disclosure: A copy of this book was provided to me by the author for review.

"This series debut has several really good things going for it. I liked the world quite a lot and appreciated the detailed world-building. There was a nice amount of the story dedicated to fleshing out not just a few of the demon races, but other supernaturals as well. And I loved Gunnar and Nicole's trip to the demon realm, Torth. That was a whole lot of fun.There was also a lot of heat in the relationship between Gunnar and Nicole. The chemistry between them was strong from the moment they meet and I liked that a lot, and Kay can definitely right sizzling sex scenes.Gunnar and his Lash demon cohorts were fairly typical for the genre and not unlike the main characters of several similar-type paranormal romance series, but that's never been downside to me. I happen to like that particular formula of a brotherhood of alpha-male warriors and they worked for me here. It helped, too, that we met several who intrigued me and kept me entertained beyond just the main characters.I enjoyed Nicole through most of the book. Romantic heroines are very often the weak link in books for me, and truthfully, Nicole had her moments, too, most notably late in the book, but I loved her bond with her sisters and she was a strong, independent woman who definitely knew her own mind. I was enamored of her from the moment she decides to use her talent to help people, long before she even knew what she is.What she and her sisters are is probably my favorite aspect of the book. I totally dug the idea that they're so rare, even other supernaturals don't believe they are anything but myth. That tickled me, especially when Nicole keeps meeting supernaturals who express their disbelief. That made me grin every time. It was great.I have to admit, though, I wasn't sold on the plot of the external conflict. Part of the problem for me was the limited amount of time given to it in the story. The Big Bag doesn't show up until the 67% mark and that was just too late in the book for his plot threads to really offer significant contribution to the story as a whole. It didn't help at all that Nicole had a few TSTL moments that led, in a painfully obvious manner, to a climax that seemed both predictable and abrupt.There were also a few too many breakaway scenes for my tastes, scenes that focused on secondary and ancillary characters. I didn't mind Kai's. I liked him a lot and I loved the acrimony between him and Nicole's sister Brooke. It may be easy to see where that's headed, but I adore that sort of conflict, so I'm totally on board with their impending tale and loved how it was set up in this book. And as his story is up next in the series, it made sense that he and Brooke had some groundwork laid here.Raniero's, on the other hand, was a problem for me on several different levels.I would much rather have had the story offer more depth and definition to the bad guy and his plans instead of pages of excessively detailed information about Raniero's past. And that's not even touching the issue I had with his supposed endless love and relentless search for Ashina - given that he's spent all his free time since he last saw her, and I quote, ""buried between the willing thighs of beautiful females."" Made it hard to feel anything at all for the pages of tragic history that preceded that little gem and it didn't exactly endear me to Raniero as a character.Plus, he wasn't a significant enough character for any of that to be necessary in this book to begin with, so all of it just completely turned me off.The meat of the overall story seemed to focus more on the sexual and emotional relationship between Gunnar and Nicole than on the bad guy doing bad things, and that was really my biggest issue. There was a lot of sex in the story. It was very hot sex, for sure, but for me to really enjoy that much in a book I need other story elements to be given equal attention, and that didn't quite happen. My preferences lie with a more robust external conflict and a more plot-driven narrative. To me, the relationship between the main characters overpowered everything else and the romance itself got a little too schmaltzy for me by the end.The good points in the story didn't quite outweigh my issues, but to be fair, the majority of those issues are a personal preference thing. For fans of paranormal romance with more attention on the R than the PN, the very things that didn't work so well for me would totally appeal. And because of those good points, not to mention the delicious teasers for Kai and Brooke's story, I'm looking forward to revisiting the world and seeing how Kay deals with a different character dynamic.Disclosure: A copy of this book was provided to me by the author for review.

"~* 4.5 Stars *~This series debut by new-to-me author Byrne hit so many of my Happy Reader buttons I was practically vibrating with book-crack bliss. The wealth of solid plot-driven suspense kept me on the edge of my seat, the humor that peppered the narrative was right up my alley, and Luca and Hero had so much sexual chemistry sizzling between them that I was glad I was reading on my Kindle. No worry about the pages going up in flames that way.Hey, it was a legitimate concern. Yowza.The uber-alpha male Luca stole this show. He was rockin' the personal demons and aggression management disorder. Often grim, sometimes broody, with a fairly bleak self image, he thought himself little better than the monsters he is so good at catching. That would have been more than enough to appeal to me, but in Luca's case, there was this whole other level to him that completely stole my heart.He was just so completely and obviously butt over brains for Hero from the moment they met, fighting it every step of the way (of course) out of a mix of professionalism (or, you know, fear) and male stupidity, and was utterly endearing for all of it. Well...if a gun-toting, foul-mouthed, hot-tempered, four-hundred-dollar-shoes-wearing alpha male can be called endearing. His struggle with his desire for Hero was the source of many humorous moments in the book and I savored them all.Then there's Hero. Artist. Yoga instructor. A little bit of a hippy. She celebrates her individuality and embraces her sexuality. Strong, independent, spirited, maybe a little sheltered, she is the best thing to ever happen to Luca and she knocks him for a loop, tickling me pink in the process. Her personality was a breath of fresh air and I loved how she acts and reacts to things in the story.And there was nothing I loved more than the fact that while Hero may have been victimized by a serial killer, at no point in the book was she ever a victim.Serial killers are my favorite type of Bad Guy in romantic suspense fiction and there was a very solid plot arc surrounding John the Baptist in the book. It could have been given a bit more prevalence in the story at times. There were a few places I thought the story was focusing a bit too much on the evolving relationship of the main characters and not quite enough on the murder investigation. To be honest, though, that's not really a complaint. I loved Luca and Hero so much that it didn't really bother me their relationship arc got more of the story's focus, but I would have liked just a bit more balance in places.That said, if it came down to choosing between better balance and giving up a single moment of the several stellar scenes with Hero's family, then I'm happy to live with the imbalance, because the Katrova-Connor clan stole every scene in which they were included. Admittedly, the book's prologue threw me a little at first, but when Bryne ties that scene to Hero's family dynamic further into the book, I was totally sold and seriously crushing on every single person in the Katrova-Connor clan.Frankly, there just wasn't anything in the book that I didn't like. It was a fun, sometimes serious, suspenseful, dangerous, smoking hot read with characters that explode across the pages with vibrant intensity. I'll be keeping my eyes peeled for the next book in the series, anxious to get those Happy Reader buttons pushed yet again.QUOTABLES:Okay, now she was just being a bi*ch, but at least she could fortify the moral high ground by avoiding being childish. Because he started it.~*~""I thought you were a vegetarian.""""I am."" Hero closed her eyes to savor the smell. ""Thus the Tofurkey.""""But there's bacon in it.""She shrugged. ""Well yeah, but it's bacon.""Knox nodded his agreement.""Bacon is meat. It comes from a pig,"" Luca said.""It doesn't count as meat because it's bacon.""

"Sometimes you just know, ya know?I wasn't even a tenth of the way into this book before I knew it was going to really work for me. Between initial impressions of the dark, complex Steampunk world, the grim sense of danger and mystery in the opening murder scene, and the intriguing history and emotional detritus between the main characters, the story snatched me up from the start and kept me captivated throughout.What a world. What a dark, dangerous, well-conceived and deftly-written world. I enjoy Steampunk for the imaginative, mechanically-enhanced alternative history inherent in the genre, but have to admit, the stories themselves are hit or miss for me. D'Abo struck just the right cord for my tastes, weaving a wealth of clever Steampunk elements together with a creative twist on Jack the Ripper, and did it in such a way that it enriched the various dramatic conflicts in the story without extraneous over-description or too much superfluous detail. Everything blended together nicely to provide a robust tapestry of story and substance.The characters themselves were as carefully and intently created, and they acquitted themselves very well in the story. I think I preferred Samuel over Piper by a slim margin, though that had more to do with my sympathy for his traumatic childhood, as well as greater understanding of the choices he made and actions he took (as opposed to Piper's) both in his past and during the murder investigations. The guy is definitely dragging around a few demons, and D'Abo was deliciously cagey about disclosing those demons to her readers, but it painted a very solid and three dimensional picture of him as a slightly flawed, definitely damaged romantic hero.Not that I didn't like Piper. I completely did. I found her wonderfully independent, feisty, stubborn, and fiercely loyal. I just also happened to be as disturbed by the Archivists' Guild purpose and presence in the world as Sam was, so the fact that Piper was a very determined Archivist, willfully and knowingly putting holes in her mind for an alleged greater good, was a bit harder to relate to than the guy who had escaped them and went on to make a career for himself in law enforcement.They did fit together nicely as a romantic couple, though, with a chemistry that extended far beyond sexual and included an obvious and genuine childhood friendship. I loved the snippets of their past that get revealed in well-timed flashes throughout the book. Frequent flashbacks in a story rarely work for me and tend to jar me out of the flow of the current-timeline plot, but D'Abo mastered the transitions smoothly and had a judicious eye for how and when to incorporate them to add depth to the story and the relationship between Sam and his Pip.I enjoyed the hell out of the Jack the Ripper investigation, too, but have to admit, I got a little lost when it came to a political element in the investigation. That aspect of the world hadn't been explained quite enough for me to really understand everywhere the leads in the case took Sam and Piper. I didn't have trouble following the action, but I definitely felt an emotional disconnect with the story when it came to a few scenes.And honestly, the resolution to the climax of the book left me feeling...disturbed and a bit unsatisfied.Don't get me wrong, I loved the culmination of the Ripper investigation, and thought the evolution of Sam and Pip's relationship was nicely done. D'Abo built plot and relationship conflict from the first page of this book, adding layers of horror and dread, dastardly motivation and sick psychosis, and connected it all Sam's murky past in such a way that I was left impressed by the complexities and entertained by it all. I heartily enjoyed that very much.How it resolved, though, and what it all means in the big picture, disturbed me. And it's virtually impossible to be any more specific without some huge spoilers and I don't want to do that. I will say this: I don't think there is anything right or good about the Archivists' Guild. Not one thing. That may pose a problem for me in future books depending on its role in the series. It definitely posed a problem for me at the end of this book.It took a bit of the bloom off what was otherwise a passionate and perilous, wildly imaginative, darkly entertaining, bloody-red rose.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Forever Yours publisher Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group via NetGalley.

"I'm so anal about series reading order that it's virtually unheard of for me to go back to read an earlier book in a series after I've read a latter one, but I literally couldn't help myself with this series debut by Shayne. I so enjoyed the characters in this series' second book, Wake to Darkness, I wanted to read Mason and Rachel's introduction, even though the second book tipped me off to several points in the first. And I was pleasantly surprised at how much of this book was still a mystery even after reading that one.With a point of view that shifts between Rachel's first person perspective and a third person omniscient when focusing on Mason and glimpses of the killer, this series works for me in both style and substance. The concept isn't a new one. Heroine gets a corneal transplant and starts seeing death and mayhem because of the donor. Books and movies have tread that ground before. It was Rachel who set this book apart.She was awesome. Sarcastic, often bitchy, and not exactly the most patient person on the planet, she's not your typical helpless, blind-then-newly sighted heroine. And she's no one's damsel in distress. Plus, she's a self-proclaimed fraud who writes writes wildly popular self-help books full of touchy-feely crap and disdains the very people who buy into them. I loved her.As tough and independent as she was, she was a total softie with Myrtle (love Myrt!). She took no prisoners when faced with some pretty horrific images and definite woo-woo stuff, but took such gentle care of the old, blind dog. She was stubbornly self-sufficient and intelligent, but she also had a heart that lent warmth to her character. It didn't hurt she had such a biting and sarcastic sense of humor, either. That's one of my favorite things in a character.I liked Mason, too. Maybe not quite as much as I did Rachel, but beyond being a gorgeous bit of man candy, I felt bad for the guy. He did the best he could for his family when it came to the fact his brother had been killing people for years. And the chemistry between him and Rachel pleased my romance-loving heart even though it never really becoming a focus in the narrative.The plot of the book appealed to me, too. I'm a big fan of serial killer psychological suspense, an even bigger fan of paranormal romance, so the blending of the two in the story worked really well for me.I do wish there had been a bit more explanation or backstory to better explain Eric's psychosis both before and after he died. I like having reasons for things, so there were elements that could have had a bit more definition in that regard. Too, the book went a little off the rails for me during the climax. Due to the nature of the tale, it skirts plausibility from the start, which I'm perfectly fine with, but there was a scene in the climax that went so far beyond plausible that it pretty effectively crushed my willing suspension of disbelief at a crucial moment.Sound travels on a lake, man, that's all I'm saying.All-in-all, though, there was a nice blend of character-driven psychological thriller and paranormal mystery with a thread of romance and it kept me entertained throughout.I already know what comes next in the series, and highly recommend it if you liked this one. I think I prefer the external conflict in this one a little better than in that one, but for me, the storyline isn't the most appealing element of either read. The characters are. I love Rachel so much, and like Mason too, that I'll be following along with their antics for as long as I can. Heck, I must love them, I went back and read a series out of order for them. That's a huge deal for me.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Harlequin MIRA via NetGalley.

"Larissa Ione proves yet again she's at the top of her game with this dark, edgy series debut. I've long been a fan of Ione's complex world building, damaged characters, and sexy-as-sin romance, and was delighted to see her kicking off a new series outside the world of her Demonica and Lords of Deliverance series. She definitely delivered on this one.This book has everything I need in a series debut and then some. The world building and mythos were complex and layered, providing a rock-solid foundation for the plot, one that tantalized and teased, revealing itself gradually as the story progresses. Nicole and Riker were great lead characters, each with their own demons and damage, and their chemistry burned up the pages, even when they hated each other. Maybe especially when they hated each other. The sexual and emotional tension they generated from the start set a perfect tone for the slow-boil of their relationship arc.Another Ione standard, a diverse cast of likable secondary characters, was also in evidence. They provided a perfect blend of friction, support, and even humor as they were introduced, acquitting themselves well in the story. I'm dying to find out about Myne's past, see what Hunter got himself into at the end, spend more time with the weird but brilliant Grant. And Bastian. And Lucy. And...well, I could definitely go on. Ione doesn't skimp on her secondary characters, and they all feel deliciously three-dimensional and real.The book has a lot going on for it story-wise, too. There's quite a journey between Nicole and Riker's initial introduction and the story's conclusion. A lot of conflict. A lot of danger and deadly consequence. A lot of blood and pain. Between Nicole and Riker, between the vamps and the humans, between the different vampire clans...the story is overflowing with conflict. They are many and varied, providing action, danger, and deadly threat, often laying waste to the characters' lives. It was a very meaty and full-flavored plot in that regard.Maybe there was even a little too much going on against Nicole and Riker. It didn't leave quite enough room for me to really believe the relative speed with which they went from bitter enemies to lusty co-conspirators. There were a lot of cards stacked against them, especially in the beginning, and I'm not sure I bought how quickly their attitudes changed. It wasn't a deal breaker for me - frankly, I was enjoying the hell out of the world so much that I was able to mostly forgive it - but I did notice it.I think my favorite elements were the world and the mythos. It's a dark, often ugly, very dangerous world where the slavery, rape, and torture of vampires are de rigueur and even the ""good"" guys are unapologetic - if justified - killers. Including the main and secondary characters. But the humans are so very much worse. As twisted as it makes me, I liked that aspect in particular very much.This book just worked for me. For its originality of premise, (relative) plausibility, great characters, wealth of story, and future story potential it left me hungry for more. The smoking hot sex wasn't exactly a turn-off, either; Ione's no slouch in that department. I can't wait to find out what happens next.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Pocket Books publisher Simon & Schuster via NetGalley.

"I really enjoyed Richard's first book in this series, UNDONE, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on Jax and Grace's story. That's why it kills me to say that so many things went wrong for me in this one that UNDENIABLE left me...well...undone. From the characters, who I found largely intolerable, to the story, which wavered between boring and extremely frustrating, to the writing, which made me a little nuts in several places, there were just too many things that pushed all the wrong buttons.The long-suffering, self-sacrificing martyr character type never works for me, and Jax rode the, ""We can't be together because I'm not good enough for you,"" horse until it keeled over dead. It was a refrain that popped up so many times I lost patience with him even before I reached the halfway point of the book.Honestly, I could never figure out why he was so down on himself. Sure, he has a horrible set of parents and his childhood was traumatic, but only parts of it, because the King family and others took care of him and showed him what love was all about - a fact that is also stressed several times throughout the narrative. He's now a well respected member of the community, has good friends, a good life, and money enough in his pockets to buy his own home. So...not really seeing any real motivation for the I'm-no-good self image. It didn't endear me to him at all. Mostly I just wanted to kick him.I wish I could say I liked Grace more, but I didn't. Her desperation for Jax and the subsequent heartbroken angst after every single time he pulled the push-me-pull-you act on her was very off-putting. And really, more than once would have been too much, but the number of times she went back to him in a blink after his demons reared their oft-seen heads and he treated her like Kleenex yet again was ridiculous.Not for nothing, but any man alludes to me as a whore - in public no less - and I don't care how much I love him, he's not going to be climbing back into my bed with just a weak apology. The fact that Grace just accepted his apologies with very little confrontation every time and cozied right back up to the guy didn't make me think too highly of her level of self respect.Had I liked the main characters more maybe I wouldn't have been so disappointed with the plot of the story, but I was bored through most of it. There were a couple of threads of interest, however. I liked Grace's friend Preston. He had a nice ancillary storyline that added poignancy to the read. I also liked seeing Paige and Brendan again. I love them.On the other hand, the town biddy was up to her old tricks. I just wish someone would make her a victim of a tragic underwater basket-weaving accident or something, because that bat has to go. She's more than a source of conflict, she's an utterly reprehensible, barely human being and I can't for the life of me figure out why someone hasn't at least sued her for slander. The fact that her behavior continues unchecked is really rubbing me the wrong way. As do the town's bad apples, the trio of terror. They're so over the top ugly that I struggle to believe that their behavior has gone unchecked for so long.There was an anemic mystery thread surrounding a rash of robberies in town that could have been better developed and incorporated into the storyline, as well. It wasn't a bad idea, but as it was written, it just seemed contrived to put the characters in the position they were in at the climax of the book, and that bothered me. I also couldn't figure out why what happened in the climax suddenly wakes Jax up when what happened at the end of the previous book didn't seem to.Unfortunately, I wasn't thrilled with the narrative itself, either. I felt it was over-burdened by way too much superfluous information and description. It seemed at times that every single element of a scene was described in minute and unnecessary detail and every ancillary character who was given so much as a mention had their life story and connection to the town detailed to the extreme. And there are a lot of characters mentioned. After a while it all became white noise, and it drowned out the stuff that could have really added to the narrative and the storyline.There are just too many things about this book that either fell short or didn't work for me. I really enjoyed the first book, so I'm hoping that this was just not a good fit for my reading preferences. I'm not ready to give up on this series just yet. There's obviously something brewing between Grace's friend Mel and Jax's friend Bennett, who caught my eye in the first book. I'm sincerely hoping, though, that Bennett acquits himself better than Jax did here.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Forever publisher Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group via NetGalley.

"~* 3.5 Stars *~Unique and original, this series debut by Donovan has a lot going for it, especially in the first half of the book. Kiarra was fiery, cagey, and keenly intelligent, and Jaxton was intense and sexy...and I'm a total sucker for heroes with a British accent. I enjoyed both of their characters very much, and the story was rich with solid world-building, action, and suspense.I loved Kiarra's whole attitude and personality from the moment she's introduced as an AMT inmate through her dubious rescue and subsequent struggle to adapt to her new freedom. I think she was maybe a bit more balanced and sane than a person would be given what she's been through in her life, but I can't say I minded that for the purposes of the story. I liked her, and I was very pleased with the direction her character took following her rescue. That all worked for me nicely.And full credit to Donovan for the creep factor and utter horror that was the AMT. I couldn't help but make comparisons to concentration camps in Nazi Germany and it was truly chilling. I find the sort of subversive, subjugating mentality that went into the creation and use of AMTs to be far more effective as a source of external conflict than an individual Big Bad because it's so damn easy to imagine something exactly like that happening, as it's happened before in humanity's darkest times.I wish I could say I found the second half of the book as entertaining as the first. While the first half provided a solid foundation for the book, was well-conceived and written with a solid focus on fleshing out the world, defining the various factions and introducing the characters, the story took a turn for me at the halfway mark. As soon as Jaxton and Kiarra made it to Scotland and the external conflict became more significant in the plot, I felt like the book started to lose a lot of the cohesion it had established early.There's a lot going on and it's happening to and with several different characters and their individual points of view. Between the evolution of the main characters, their relationship and all that entailed, their struggles to evade the AMT, the sinister- and almost ridiculously obscure - machinations of Bad Guy Sinclair, and the addition of Kiarra's brother Gio, who was a pretty big question mark to me and seemed an unnecessary source of ancillary conflict, there was too much to focus on. Too much was attempted and not enough of it had payoff. The plot's pacing bogged down and the story got a bit unwieldy and cumbersome.At times I found myself getting bored - with Kiarra and Jaxton's relationship, with Sinclair's super secret and oh-so-nefarious plans, and with...whatever it was that Gio was trying to do. There were just too many sources of conflict, big reveals, and murky motivations, so many it all became white noise after awhile. It's a shame, because really, there didn't need to be anything beyond the AMT. The reality of those places and the driving force behind their existence is completely horrifying enough on its own to support an entire series of external conflict without needing all the other story detritus that cluttered the back half of this book.I do think the series has a ton of potential, though, and there are more than enough interesting characters introduced here to provide fodder for many juicy stories to come. This one just didn't quite keep me consistently engaged beyond the story setup and the world-building, and a general sort of appreciation for the romance between Kiarra and Jaxton. Still, I can't say enough about how nice it is to read something that felt truly fresh and original. That alone is worth a lot in a genre glutted on same old same old.Disclosure: A copy of this book was provided to me by the author for review.

"This book did not work for me at all. I liked the idea of it but the actual read gave me a lot of trouble. I pretty much hated Jace throughout the book. I found nothing even remotely heroic or noble about the man. He's an alcoholic, self-loathing jacka*s who treats everyone around him like crap because of some deep-seeded daddy issues. I just wanted him to get the hell over it already and look at the bigger picture, but no.He was also horribly inconsistent, especially when it came to the relationship he has with Frankie. It was as if he had a bad case of emotional ADD, wavering back and forth between disdaining everything about Frankie to getting all wounded when she holds back her feelings from him...often from one page to the next. And I have very little tolerance for lack of communication being the source of relationship conflict in my romance. Their relationship was littered with it.Frankie wasn't as bad. I can't really say I liked her throughout, but at least she didn't make me mental. There were moments when I liked her, and I very much appreciated the fact that she's her pack's alpha, but I wish she had been a little stronger in both power and personality to better reflect that position. She was just a little too submissive to Jace, and too willing to take all the bad stuff he dished out at her and love him anyway, for me to take her seriously as an apex predator and competent leader of her people. Didn't help that my first impression of her included her running and hiding from her responsibility.The story did have its good points, but I struggled there, as well. The world didn't seem all that fleshed out to me. The mythos surrounding skinwalkers was original in theory but I thought the backstory and explanation was an unclear muddle (and in reference to how a skinwalker transitions into a berserker, just flat-out disturbing in context). I also never felt I had a firm handle on the Extermination Underground itself, and given that the series is titled after the organization (so I assume it's important) that was a problem for me.In fact, every time the EU or its members had impact in the story, there was little more offered than a poorly defined but explosive conflict between Jace and the local EU director Damon. That conflict was too all-encompassing to allow me to get a feel for any of the other characters or the organization as a whole. And I was sincerely disappointed that there was no resolution for their absurd and over-the-top chest-thumping contest.That actually smacks at the core of my issues with the book, though. For all that the ideas were sound, the story as a whole seemed bereft of nuance and subtlety. If there was an emotion expressed, it was sweeping and dramatic, if there was an action taken, it was balls-to-the-wall, no holds barred. Conflict was furious and deadly, sex was intense and often angry, characters were tortured, romance was angsty. It was all just...so much noise that the sum total just struck me not as a tapestry of plot, character, and world, but as a brute force cacophony: chaotic, hard-hitting, and lacking sophistication.I wouldn't say I'm sorry I read this one, but I also can't say I'd be interested in continuing the series.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by HQN Books publisher Harlequin via NetGalley.

"This series debut by Collins marks the second time in a handful of months where I had to stop a few chapters into a book and make sure there wasn't a preceding book or novella, or even a main series from which this one spun, because I felt like I was missing a lot of previously laid groundwork almost from the very beginning. There's plenty of tidbits of information about things that happened in the past to set up the story, but the characters, their backstory, and significant elements of the world-building are disclosed in a way that seemed far better suited as reminders than introductions.Julianna and Thomas have a lot of personal history, that much is plain, but I never felt like I was given a good grasp of it. Details about their past were either glossed over or doled out in drips and drabs throughout the tale and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was supposed to have already known the whole story before I started the book. Though I'm not really sure how.That problem wasn't limited to Thomas, either. All of Julianna's friends and acquaintances suffer similarly. There are several who have obvious history with her, but without the all-important context to let me know how and why they were as valuable to her as we're told they are, I never really felt any of those connections. That put a big crimp in the emotional impact of several crucial scenes as the conflict with the Big Bad heated up, and it confused me in general when it came to characters like Raoul and Michael.And not for nothing, but I'm still not sure how I feel about Thomas. I was completely thrown by the weird way he showed up and inserted himself into Juliana's life, offering sketchy detail on what he does and doesn't know about her origins and her life since he left and making some pretty high-handed demands with all kinds of attitude. My first impression of him was of an overbearing, utterly egotistical jacka*s, and while that did improve the longer I read, it didn't completely go away.Maybe it would have if he hadn't kept referring to Juliana as ""his bride."" Ugh. Not only did that bug me with its repetition, it seemed pretty offensively objectifying to me. Like he didn't see her as her own person with her own identity, she was just his bride. It was weird. Not sexy. Weird.On the other hand, it quickly becomes clear that Juliana is absolutely everything to him and he would do anything for her. I would have preferred seeing a bit more of that in application, though, and a smidge of honest communication wouldn't have been remiss, either. I'm starting to wonder if there is just no other way to breed conflict between two stubborn, self-sacrificing characters, as often as that has been the sole source of major relationship conflict in stories I've read lately. Still, his devotion to her did temper my negative opinion of the guy and kept him from being utterly unlikable, but he was definitely not to my personal taste in romantic hero types.There were, however, some very nice things going on, too. It was nice reading an urban fantasy series debut that didn't make me want to poke the heroine with something sharp. First time that's happened in a while. And no inklings of a love triangle, either, which is virtually unheard of in the genre of late. Those were two big positives in a book with a well-conceived (if not perfectly defined) world and solid story, and that's what kept my feelings generally positive overall as I dealt with some of the less favorable elements.I actually liked Juliana. She's not the most original character, is in fact fairly typical for the genre. In Juliana's case, thankfully, her emotional maturity seemed slightly higher than that of an average twelve year old (a welcome change), and she's more palatable than most I've read recently. She's certainly the sort of smart-mouthed, kick-a*s rule breaker I seem to gravitate towards most in the genre. You know the sort: she would sacrifice herself to save anyone she considers ""hers"" but guards her heart and her secrets like a jealous lover and doesn't actually let anyone in very far.It's a common malady in urban fantasy heroines, but one I've always sort of enjoyed, or at the very least, never minded.I did enjoy the glimpses of the world I got in this book, and there were several secondary and ancillary characters with nice page presence, though Michael in particular needed a heck of a lot more explanation. There is also a solid plot conflict going on around and in addition to Juliana's personal crisis with Thomas. It lacked sufficient setup and didn't come close to answering all my questions, especially after that rather odd but revealing climax, but on the surface it provided plenty of action and certainly a high body count.Without the sufficient framework for everything that went on in this book, though, it just wasn't quite executed well enough for me to feel completely satisfied with the story as a whole. And did anyone figure out how Juliana knows who her father is if she can't remember anything from her first twelve years? I think I missed something there.Well...I missed something in a lot of places, but that one still niggles me.The plot execution may have been a bit odd, and it had some pacing issues and abrupt transitions, inconsistent progression and a general lack of the sort of detail found in the more complex urban fantasy series, but it still managed to keep me entertained. With more fleshing out in some crucial areas and another fifty or so more pages this could have really built into a gripping, multi-layered, complex tale with memorable characters. It didn't quite reach that level this time, but the potential is definitely there for the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMB4CYWR8KJG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1V5S3S#wasThisHelpful","RMB4CYWR8KJG3","A2E9HDZXQORZLA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9HDZXQORZLA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of the Kate Daniels series since its inception, but because I'm weird (or dumb...your pick), I was hesitant to try Andrea's story when it came out. I bought it because I love the world and the characters, but I didn't read it...for exactly the same reason. See, spin-off books in beloved series tend not to go so well for me, and it took me a long, long time to finally work up the nerve to give Andrea's book a chance.Of course I'm glad I did and of course I'm kicking myself for waiting so long. Of course. It's Ilona Andrews, after all.I've always liked Andrea's character and appreciated her contributions in Kate's books, and I'm happy to say I think she acquitted herself nicely as a main character in her own. My biggest worry was that she would come off a little like Carbon Copy Kate, but that was certainly not the case. She was the gun-toting, arrow-shooting, bad-a*s Andrea I know and like. Maybe a little older, darker, and more serious than the vibe I got from her in Kate's books, but still Andrea.And man, her backstory definitely gave Kate's childhood a run for the money on level of horror and damage inflicted. Andrea's personality and life choices make so much more sense now. Andrews did a great job bringing that all together and weaving it into a compelling, sympathetic personal history of a character with whom readers were already familiar.I have to admit, I was expecting more of a paranormal romance feel to the story than I got. Like the Kate Daniels books, this one read more like an urban fantasy with a strong thread of romance secondary to the main plot of the book. It's a more robustly traditional romance thread than that of the Kate and Curran saga, and I think it worked as it was supposed to, but it wasn't the focus of the narrative.Andrea's investigation into the murders and the subsequent revelations about the crime, the concerned parties, and the potential for badness was a meaty, solid story that kept me engaged throughout. I don't know that it was as intrinsically intense as any of the books in Kate's series, and it lacked a bit of the personal connection that's so prevalent between Kate and her investigations/catastrophes du jour, but it was well-developed, layered, and provided a broad array of danger and life-threatening situations for Andrea and her friends.I loved spending more time with Roman, who was introduced in Magic Slays, the book preceding this one. I'm still not completely sure how such a nice, decent-seeming guy such as Roman can be an evil Volhv and a source of darkness, but hey, the contradictions in his character make him interesting. I just like the guy.Raphael, on the other hand, was a surprisingly big douche bag throughout a good portion of this book, and was responsible for one of my biggest sources of disappointment in the story. When he had the unmitigated gall to show up in Andrea's office with that human bimbo and was so hideous to Andrea during her interrogation, I wanted to kill him. And I was shocked Andrea didn't ever really nail him on it.I will say the whole scene served as a nice catalyst to get Andrea to embrace her inner beast and let her fur flag fly, providing the impetuous for some much-appreciated character evolution, but the whole messed up situation was begging for a more visceral confrontation before resolution and there just wasn't anything beyond a tepid (well, seemed tepid to me) apology on Raphael's part. I wasn't nearly satisfied considering the insult he paid Andrea by doing what he did. Not. Enough. Groveling.The other elements of their relationship evolution provided a nice level of heat and some humor to the read, but didn't quite wow me in the same way that Kate and Curran's evolving relationship has. I liked it well enough, but it never really captivated me. Personally, I was more moved by Andrea's long-awaited decision about joining the bouda clan and the scene in which she took control of her destiny in that regard. I kinda loved that.In part because the Kate Daniels series has provided such a rich tapestry of world building, story, and character, and in part because the writing duo that is Ilona Andrews is all sorts of awesome, this book really shouldn't be missed if you're a fan of the series. It may not have been quite as fun for me as the Kate and Curran show, but it was was a solidly entertaining, fantastic visit into a world I've come to love and admire and it provided a bit of a different perspective on characters who have been around since the beginning. I liked it a lot.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VY6YZDE4PLFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0072NWKP6#wasThisHelpful","R3VY6YZDE4PLFY","A2E9HDZXQORZLA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9HDZXQORZLA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"~* 3.5 Stars *~Finally! It took a few too many books spread out over I don't even know how many years, but I finally feel like there was some pretty significant progress made in the Lords vs. Hunters/Titans, et al series plot. The sort of progress, in fact, that could alter the direction of the series from this point forward and provide for even greater potential catastrophe for the beloved Lords. The lack of that progress has long been a complaint of mine in this series, so I have to admit, I'm pretty happy that I don't have that problem this time.Oh, yeah, and Paris finally gets some Happily in his Ever After, too.I had reached the end of the line with Paris in the previous book, my well of sympathy for him had run dry, so I was a little uncertain how this book would play out for me. Showalter did a lot of good things in here with Paris and Sienna. A lot of good things. Was it enough to completely redeem Paris for me? Not totally, unfortunately, and I still have some lingering questions about the ambrosia issue given what Cronus did to Sienna, not to mention Paris' double dose of demon issue, but I was mostly able to set aside any lingering discomfort with his character and appreciate the story that was being told.And there was a lot of story being told in this book. Maybe even a little too much, as I had been hoping for a bit more depth and dimension in the relationship between Sienna and Paris and a little less focus on everything else that tends to creep into each book. Something more like what Sabin and Kaia had in their book. Sadly, that didn't happen. Paris and Sienna didn't even share a scene until I was deep into the book and the evolution of their relationship was a little truncated for my tastes, with some less than pleasant - even perplexing, at times - elements, but at the very least it got the job done.Sienna also wasn't quite as strong a heroine as I prefer. Kaia was a much nicer fit for my tastes in that regard, but I did like Sienna, and she was extremely understanding and gracious when it came to Paris' past. On that front I was satisfied, because Paris needed someone who could accept his past without letting it color their relationship. It takes a very special sort of person to be able to do that, and Sienna was that person.She was just a little too good to be true, even though she's been housing Wrath for a while now. She's still naive and a bit innocent, and just a shade too decent for me, despite everything she's been through. She does have a big heart, though, and she had a strength of will and determination that I enjoyed, most notably when she's struggling to resist Cronus' myriad manipulations.And Showalter broke my heart a little with Sienna's sister. That was damn tragic.This was a bit of a darker book than its predecessor, and there was less humor in it. I like the humor, so that was a bummer, but the darker elements did fit with the downward spiral Paris has been on, so it maintained an organic feel. And the story also answered a question I've been wondering for years, so that was a bonus.I can't say this was a be-all-end-all read for me, and the sheer bulk of the story was the largest problem. By this point in the series, there's just so much going on with so many different characters that giving each sufficient attention bogs down the story's pacing quite a bit. I don't know that I needed...or particularly cared for...Narcissism's introduction and the views we get from her point of view. Nor did I need quite so much time spent with Kane.I can't help but wish Showalter would focus more on the featured characters and their relationships in their own books, because though we've known Paris and Sienna for quite some time in the series, there was a lot of room to add character depth and relationship evolution that was spent on highlighting other things. I know how important it is to weave several different elements into each book, but I think the romance arc lost out some in this one.No doubt, though, the series is still going strong, and there are many positives that have reawakened my interest and investment in the Lords. Paris's book isn't a series favorite of mine, but it was a long time coming and I'm glad he finally got some peace and found the woman he loves. Though...she's still dead...and I'm not completely sure how that's going to play out given how the story ends. I guess I'll find out.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GV5CJRWH2QTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006QADQ5Y#wasThisHelpful","R2GV5CJRWH2QTA","A2E9HDZXQORZLA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9HDZXQORZLA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the moment she learns the CIA has put out a burn and delete notice on Richard ""Rock"" Babineaux, Black Knights operator and, apparently, CIA spy, everything in communication specialist Vanessa Cordova rebels. She's had feelings for the man since the first time she heard his slow Cajun drawl, but more than that, she partnered with him on a recent undercover op and she just can't believe the man she knows has committed the heinous crimes the CIA is accusing him of committing.With the full weight of the Black Knights' support behind her, Vanessa is determined to help Rock clear his name. She just has to find him first.He's been in the wind for six months and Rock knows he has to keep his head down as he scrambles to figure out who screwed him and set him up. Practically buried in a South American jungle, alone, he's running out of options, resources, and leads, but he's resolute about not risking his friends. Until one fiery and magnificent woman crashes into his jungle and blows his best intentions straight to the same hell he'll likely be getting an up close and personal tour of all too soon.The dangerously tempting Vanessa has found him, but by doing so, Rock knows unless he manages a miracle, she's likely doomed them both.~*~This fourth book in a series that has posed varying problems for me since its debut is definitely my favorite, though it's not without some large issues. Unlike its predecessors, however, I found myself entertained despite them. Walker's humor, which is sometimes silly but usually geeky and cute, is more prevalent in the narrative, and there were none of the darker, sadistic scenes I found so jarring in previous books. There's a ton of action which appealed, and plenty of sexy goodness to raise the temperature. The plot wasn't quite as layered as some of the previous books, but sometimes simple is, if not better, at least no worse.All in all, I liked this book, though there were definitely elements that made me cringe a little. Or a lot.I loved Rock, even with his persistent and repetitive warning against Vanessa loving him. He was strong and self-sacrificing, sexy and absolutely delicious. Vanessa, frankly, couldn't hold a candle to him, which is a huge shame, because I thought she was going to when she was first introduced in the previous book. Unfortunately, instead of strengthening her character in this book, broadening it and intensifying it, Walker went another route.From competent and savvy communications specialist to crying (and oh my god, the crying!), wailing, screaming, stumbling, scared of the dark, horny emotional idiot whose entire existence seemed to revolve around her desire to make Rock love her, Vanessa's character went through a serious deconstruction in this book. I was completely boggled by it, and her personality grated on me before I was into the third chapter.So did Rock going on and on to himself about how magnificent she was every single time he sees her. Like telling us he thought she was all things hot, courageous, and brilliant was supposed to convince us she was all those things despite all manner of evidence to the contrary. I'm not quite so easy to convince. One single scene in which she was faced with a difficult situation and didn't burst into tears or have some sort of emotional meltdown would've been far more effective. So would having her alleged excellence in her field serve as more than a transitory benefit in the story.Unfortunately, it didn't happen.Other than Becky, featured romantic heroine of the second book and a strong secondary character in this one, there hasn't been a female character that hasn't been a weeping, weak, nervous, shy, innocent stereotype of every bad romance novel cliche. And while that's normally a huge hot button of mine and slams the brakes on my interest in a book or a series, there has so far been enough good in these books to keep me reading. And there was enough in this one to actually entertain me regardless.I'm worried about the next book, though. Nothing about Becky's friend and Wild Bill's former (and obviously not-so-former) crush Eve has indicated she's not exactly that same sort of weak heroine that's been bugging me since the beginning of the series. In fact, she's been drawn as a shy, nervous, uber-rich debutante, and I'm not exactly brimming with enthusiasm about that personality type filling out a main plot arc.With this book, Walker seems to have finished straddling the line between light and serious romantic suspense and has come down on the lighter side. That works for me, as I've always thought the straddling was doing the series no favors. Plus I like humor and several scenes in this book made me chuckle to myself. Personally, I hope this is indicative of how the series intends to continue from this point. Now, if it could just put forth a heroine that doesn't make me roll my eyes, piss me off, or embarrass the hell out of me to be a woman, we'll be golden. But I won't hold my breath.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Sourcebooks Casablanca publisher Sourcebooks via NetGalley.

"~* 3.5 Stars *~Inveterate wedding planner by day and sole Aegis in the whole of the country by night...and day...and, well, every moment in between, Zoey Donovan is feeling the strain of the growing needs of the Hidden who are showing up at her door. The influx of magical, mystical, and beastly traffic has gotten so bad that even with the help of her closet monster Maurice and several other good friends of both the human and Hidden variety she's just barely squeaking by.With a dire message about impending doom looming on the horizon and refugees with tales of Hidden loved ones being abducted, it's quite clear that things are just going to get worse. Something is coming. Something bad. And if the pattern of the mass exodus of Hidden and reports of the missing bear out, that something is heading right for the only Aegis left who can do anything at all to stop it...if it doesn't stop her first.~*~I'm a huge fan of this series. I love the world and I couldn't be happier with the wide array of wildly colorful and eminently lovable characters. Zoey is quirky and fun and one of the more unique heroines I've read in urban fantasy, but it's really the secondary characters who have stolen my heart. Closet monster Maurice in particular and the rest of Zoey's crazy coterie of friends in general elevate each book and make almost every single moment of each one of them a real good time to read.I can't say this was my favorite of the three books, though. It started a little slow for me. Despite my rabid adoration of the veritable cornucopia of Hidden misfits who find their way to Zoey's home, I felt the development and execution of the story's main plot conflict got off to a rocky and anemic start in the first half of the book. For the first time in the series, I felt my attention waning more than once, wondering when the meat of the plot was going to really get going.Fortunately it does get going, and when it does, there are several intense, action-packed, emotional moments (one of which broke my heart) and a couple of big developments that helped broaden and deepen the series plot arc. There's some very solid and highly entertaining storytelling going on in this book, for sure. I just I felt like the story tread water for too long before all that goodness really started.I also can't say I cared for the return of a character we met in the first book. I wouldn't call Councilwoman Alma Dickson a Big Bad, really. She wasn't the story's main antagonist in this book any more than she was in the first, but she was just as big a tertiary source of conflict in this one as she was before. That felt a little too much like double-dipping into the character pool for me to really appreciate the conflict with her here.On a brighter note, this is the first time in the series that I didn't have issues with Riley, Zoey's main squeeze. I haven't been impressed with him in the series to date, and still can't say he thrills me as Zoey's romantic interest, but he played a larger role in this one than in either of the previous books and I didn't mind having him around at all. He just seemed to have more of a presence in this book, and I liked it. His relationship with Zoey also gets some much-needed evolution in this one and I liked that, as well. I just wish they had more chemistry.Naquin keeps surprising me, too. Zoey's wacky life and the wonderful weirdness that comes from the Hidden lend a lighter, more humorous tone to the series than the grittier, more dystopian urban fantasy series out there. That said, in each book there have been elements that remind me that Zoey's world isn't all fun and games by any stretch. There are Bad Things that happen to and around her characters. Very Bad Things. I won't discuss any spoilery stuff here, but the Bad Thing that happens in this one hit me hard and left me reeling.This wasn't a perfect book for me, but I think it was an important one for Zoey's continued development and the evolution of the series. The issues I had with the external conflict were a bit more serious than they were in the previous book, and I'm a little worried that neither one was quite up to the fun level of the series debut. I love this world and the characters so much that I want to love everything else, too. I hope to get another chance to try soon, because I really can't wait to spend more time with Zoey and her fabulous friends.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley.

"A decade after putting his hometown of Crystal Lake in his rearview mirror, tragedy has drawn rock guitarist Cain Black back. One of his best friends is dead, a grim statistic of a war on foreign soil, and Cain has returned to mourn and pay his respects.And because his own life is in shambles and he could use a break.One of the first people he sees at the reception after the funeral is Maggie O'Rourke, single mother and redheaded temptress. Not that she's trying to be. In fact, the fiery beauty makes it quite clear that she wants absolutely nothing to do with Cain and would be perfectly happy if he would disappear off the face of the planet entirely.Not that one of Crystal Lake's former Bad Boys is going to let that stop him. In fact, he's thinking he may as well stay in town for awhile, because there's just something about Maggie that reaches out and squeezes him hard - in all the best places. What surprises him the most, though, is there's also something about the shadow's in her eyes, the wariness and caution, that makes him want to slay her dragons.There is absolutely no doubt in Cain's mind that the ethereal but haunted Maggie O'Rourke has them.~*~Maybe I should've stopped before I started this book. It's not a bad romance, and there were parts that really worked for me, but overall I had too many issues with it and some of those issues started early. When the book opens there are several melancholy scenes surrounding the death of one of Cain's best friends. It set a darker tone than appealed to me. I almost put it down at that point, not because it wasn't well written, just because I wasn't really in the emotional place to want to deal with it.Still, I kept reading, and I was relieved that at least the melancholy waned relatively quickly.I thought it was going to be good from that point. I liked Cain, even though the rock-n-roll romantic hero isn't a favorite of mine. I liked Maggie, too, even though she's a single mother and that theme also isn't a favorite of mine. I loved her son Michael. I absolutely adored him. More, I was completely and thoroughly enamored with the depth of love in the relationship between mother and son. It was one of my favorite things about the read.Cain's relationship with Michael was another huge high point. It never once felt forced or awkward, or a footnote just to appeal to readers. It felt truly organic to all the characters involved.The plot didn't break any new grounds, which normally isn't a huge criticism of mine. It's contemporary romance, and as a fan I expect some formula. Still, there could have been more depth and the last fifteen to twenty percent of the book was almost painfully predictable. I saw the conflict climax coming from the moment Maggie's past is revealed. Other story elements and character choices did provide pleasant surprises throughout the narrative, so I was disappointed that the end truly didn't.And I began having a problem with Maggie late in the book. She's a very secretive person. Her past is filled with trauma and as a result she doesn't share anything about herself or that past. At all. With anyone. For awhile, I was fine with that, but the longer she was in the relationship with Cain and the more he opened up to her without any reciprocity, my struggles with her character grew. Because she was such a closed book with everyone, even her closest friend in town, I began to have a very hard time maintaining an emotional connection to her character.That's when it became more than frustrating, it became detrimental to the story.I also had trouble with the scenes that featured shifting points of view in a congruent timeline. It's a narrative style that rarely works for me because it can and does breed timeline inconsistencies like the one that occurs during the book's climax. For a detail-obsessed reader like me, those sorts of inconsistencies completely derail an intensely suspenseful or emotional scene.Also, I know he was a secondary character and so not a tremendously big factor in the main story arc, but I had a huge problem with Jake. I don't care how close a friend a person is, or how long our history, if I hear them speaking to another friend of mine (and in this case a grieving widow) the way that Jake speaks to Raine in this book, I'd have his guts for garters. I was infuriated that no one deigned to address it or even made an attempt to rein in Jake's increasingly unconscionable behavior towards that poor woman.There were just too many things that went awry for me in this book. And I had a lot of unanswered questions, which is uncommon for me in this genre. Unfortunately, they're the sorts of questions that can really compromise the effectiveness of a romantic resolution. Like...is Maggie still married? If not, when, exactly, was her divorce final, because unless I missed something, the way the scant details were divulged, there didn't seem to have been time and she sure didn't seem to have opportunity.Between of those sorts of questions and my other issues, it was all just too much for me to really enjoy this read. The characters, especially Cain and Michael, were completely lovable, and I even liked Maggie throughout most of the book. And even with my issues, I thought a good portion of the romance between her and Cain was very sweet and incredibly hot.Maybe with some distance I'd give a second book in this new series a try, but if Jake's going to be the male romantic lead in that one, I'm going to have to wait for awhile to see how the reviews shake out first.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Sourcebooks Casablanca publisher Sourcebooks via NetGalley.

"It's been twelve years since Lucy Sullivan's parents left Donovan Circus and took her to live in the human world. Her parents are gone now, both dead before their time, and Lucy wants to return to her roots...and her own kind. Donovan Circus, one of the few places in the world that shelter and provide for gifted supernaturals like Lucy, is the only place where she can embrace what she really is: a Firestarter.She's fitting back into the circus life well enough, making friends, even met a guy she likes. Then the first body is found. One of the circus' own has been brutally murdered. And then another. And another.As the death toll rises and panic spreads through the circus family like fire from Lucy's fingertips, it is the newbie who is blamed for the crimes.She came looking for her place in the world, but someone is intent on burning that world to the ground around her, and Lucy is going to need all the help she can get to keep herself - and everything that matters to her - from going up in flames.~*~This fun, unique story by Long isn't perfect in plot or execution, but with its X-Men-meets-Ringling-Brothers theme, fire-licking suspense, and an eclectic mix of likable, memorable characters, it is a very entertaining read. To be honest, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. It's got a very New Adult feel to it, despite Lucy being around twenty-five (if my math was correct), and I don't normally enjoy either Young Adult or New Adult fiction. This one I did.I liked Lucy a lot, but have to admit, her character was prone to a lack of maturity and a tendency towards emotional melodrama. She rocked the martyr complex way too often for my taste. Still, I was pulled into her story from the very beginning and couldn't help but admire the world that Long created here. By the end I was fully invested and rooting wildly for Lucy and her friends.The best part of the book, I think, was the circus itself. I absolutely love the idea of Donovan Circus and its coterie of quirky supernaturals. It just totally worked for me on every level, and it put a fresh and unique spin on a well-worn genre. The whole concept of a circus of supernaturals doing their thing for unsuspecting humans was fantastic.The plot threads of external conflict were great too, though. The mystery surrounding the deaths of the circus workers and the growing threat to Lucy tied in nicely with the lingering mysteries about her father's choices and actions before he died, and it created a solid framework of story around Lucy's re-entry into circus life. Brimming with action and danger, rife with suspense and tragedy, this was an all-around solid read.Not everything worked perfectly for me, though. There was a love-interest triangle that did nothing for me (though to be fair, they never do). I'm so tired of the ubiquitous love triangle in urban fantasy that even the slightest whiff of one turns me off, and there was significantly more than a whiff here, especially at the end, when I was rolling my eyes at the timing of some pretty heavy-handed relationship confrontation.Though...I do have to say...Team Gabriel. And that's all I'm going to say on that.There were some minor technical problems in the book. As a whole the story felt a bit overwritten to me and could have benefited from a tighter story edit to trim down the superfluous and streamline the narrative. There were also a few timeline issues in the plot. It wasn't clear in places, and in other spots there seemed to be some contradictions. And I felt the pacing in the latter half of the book suffered from an overabundance of long, dialogue-heavy scenes lacking in action.None of those were deal breakers for me, though. I liked the story and the originality of the concept to such a large degree that the weaker elements just weren't a major factor at all. This was a fun, highly entertaining, and utterly original story with a great cast of characters I heartily enjoyed. I just hope there will be another chance to stop by the Donovan Circus soon, because Lucy and her friends (and Long) put on one hell of a good show.Disclosure: A copy of this book was provided to me by the author for review.

"~* 2.5 Stars *~The mayor of Maggie's Grove, Dragomir ""Dragos"" Ibanescu, has a problem. Actually, a host of them. Four weeks after his town barely survived an attack by a psychopathic witch with a vamp obsession, the residents of the town are still trying to pick up the pieces and heal from the damage. Some of his people have gone missing. His father, a male Dragos has more than just an acrimonious relationship with, has contacted him for the first time in centuries. His ex-bed partner is stirring up trouble and teetering close to the line of black magic, if she hasn't crossed it already. And his sotiei, the dyrad queen Mina, who suffered the most under last month's vicious attack, not only isn't healing, but she refuses to even speak to him.And that alone is enough to make his inner bad boy want to roar with frustration.Being stretched thin isn't a new feeling for the vampire, but if Dragos can't convince Mina to at least give their relationship a try, the rest of his problems are going to disappear under the avalanche of destruction his inner beast will leave in its wake, and there is absolutely nothing Dragos will be able to do to prevent it.~*~It didn't take me long into this book to guess my feelings about it were going to be in the minority, because my biggest issue with the story is related to my personal preferences for my romance heroines. I have a very low tolerance for exactly the sort of wallows-in-her-misery damsel that Mina was for far too long in the book, and she just never redeemed herself enough for me to find her tolerable. And if I don't like one of the romantic leads, I can't like the romance.Mina, who by all accounts should be one of the strongest females in the series as the queen of her people and the ruler of the Throne of Oak, just didn't cut it for me in this book at all. I would have had no problem being sympathetic to the grievous wounds she suffered if she'd been more proactive about dealing with them, but she wasn't, and every attempt by friends and potential loved ones to assist her was rebuffed out of a mix of fear and pride. I found that very unappealing.As much as I love Dragos and enjoy the world that Bell has created for the series, with its imaginative mythos and fun, often funny, always quirky cast of characters, Mina alone was enough to temper the majority of the enjoyment I could have felt with the story.But she wasn't the only problem. Like Dragos, I had a host of them.Over two years have passed between the release of the first and second book in this series. That's a long time for a reader to remember details from a series debut. Maybe that's why Bell spent so much of the first part of this book outlining the events in that one...if outlining is the right word. To me it felt more like I was being force-fed a condensed version of the debut with all the info dumping that was in the first several chapters here. Much of it was completely tangential to this story's plot and characters, so it became a quagmire of unnecessary minutia that slowed the pace of the narrative to a crawl and distracted from the story threads that were being introduced here.And tangential is the word of the day, too, because the narrative had a bad habit of trotting off on useless tangents rife with superfluous information throughout the whole book, a habit I found particularly annoying during several pivotal scenes. Something serious would be going down and everything for the characters would be tense or emotionally charged, then the narrative would veer off into a long-winded dissertation about something else completely unrelated to what was happening. Yes, details like those provided can add to the tapestry of world-building for the series, but in the wrong place it just yanks me out of the story and hinders the emotional impact of a scene. It was far too often in the wrong place in this book.I also had issues with the plot's jerky timeline, abrupt transitions, and lack of relationship evolution in Dragos and Mina's romance. There was also a dearth of character definition, most notably but not exclusively when it came to secondary and ancillary characters.Thing is, though, there were also several things I truly enjoyed about this book. I love Maggie's Grove and the imaginative, creative history of the town. I thought Dragos was a great romantic hero, and even though I never warmed up to Mina, I'm glad he got his HEA. The secondary characters, though two-dimensional, were another source of entertainment. That's where most of the humor was found, and I'm very fond of the sort of humor that Bell excels in weaving into her stories. There were a lot of lighter, chuckle-worthy moments that I enjoyed.And of course the sex is always smoking hot. Bell gives great smutty good times, and she doesn't skimp on the number of them.As a whole, though, the good bits didn't provide enough balance to the less favorable elements for me to be okay with this one, and I was pretty far removed from liking it. I still have hope for the series. There's a lot of great story potential and a cornucopia of characters I would love to see mix it up in their own books. I just think there has to be a tighter, more controlled execution of the plot and a bit more depth given to the characters and their romantic evolution before any of that awesome potential is reached.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley.

"Kane has always been a walking disaster. Literally. The Lord houses Disaster, a particularly vile demon that revels in making Kane's life hell. Then Kane actually ended up in hell, suffering horrible torture and rape for weeks on end until he was rescued by a strange female with one particularly odd request for her assistance. She wants him to kill her.Still lost in darkness from his ordeal, wrecked in a way he's having a hard time dealing with, one thing is absolutely clear to Kane. He's not killing the feisty, adorable half-fae Josephina Aisling. He's going to rescue her instead.Then he's going to finally kill the demon inside him. Even if he has to die to do it.~*~I feeling oddly ambivalent about this tenth installment of the Lords of the Underworld series. After Paris' book, which gave readers some much-needed resolution to the nagging problems of the Hunters and Cronus and Rhea, I figured this one would have to be a transitional book. Transitional books tend to not be my favorite books in a series for a lot of reasons, but I've always felt they were a necessary evil and dealt accordingly.Had this book actually offered some transitional series arc plot development or given any attention to the lingering issues generated by the big battle that ended the previous book, I think I would have been fine with this one in that role. My problem is that it really didn't. In fact, Kane and Josephina's story didn't do much of anything to establish a new, Hunter/Cronus-free direction for the Lords and their allies for the series, nor did it do much to progress the plot line about the hunt for the Pandora's box - though that did receive a bit of attention with the kick off of Cameo's story threads and the return of a character I was really hoping to see again in this series.As for the romance, that didn't really wow me with character or relationship evolution of the main characters, either.I like Kane. I've always felt bad for the guy (pretty much the standard for the pre-mated Lords), even when he served as little more than comic relief at the start of the series. It was nice getting a closer look at how he deals with Disaster. I also enjoyed Disaster being given a far more sinister presence than the demons of the other Lords have been given. Disaster just seemed more actively evil than some of the others have been. Not a bad thing, either. I liked it.We've had a couple of books now, seeing Kane's story unfold, and much of that was pretty horrifying, so I also liked that he got some happiness. What he didn't get, what none of the characters in this series get much of lately, is character depth and complexity or realistic character evolution, and that, along with my issues with the stories themselves, is bothering me a lot in this series.Yes, Kane is tormented by his time in hell, and rightly so, but that seems to be the sole defining element of his character, and that's just not enough to make him well-rounded and realistic to me. Josephina, maybe because she's new to the series, got a bit more character evolution, and I liked her more for that, but again, her role in her family was her defining characteristic and there wasn't a huge amount of depth to her beyond that.But depth of character and complexity of internal and external conflict have never really been something this series has really offered, and I'm just now starting to remember that. Hellaciously sexy times, yes. Action and adventure, even breath-stealing emotion, yes. Summer-blockbuster-movie amounts of fierce battles and wicked villains, sure. And like those summer blockbusters, not a whole lot of coherent, well-written story surrounding it all.On a brighter note, I thought the beginning of this book was awesome. I loved when Josephina tried to get Kane to keep his end of the bargain, then turned to Lucien and Sabin when they showed up. I love the idea that the fae were huge fans of the Lords, whose antics they follow as rabidly as the paparazzi dog the Kardashians. I loved Cameo's cameos and Torin's plague-filled drama. And there was other stuff that I truly enjoyed as well.Kane and Josephina's extended time in the fae world didn't add to the fun. It bored me. And they seemed to spend an awfully long time there, because this was an awfully long book. That's a lot of boredom. Boredom mixed with perplexity, because for the two previous books in this series, several critical things were brewing relating to Kane's fate and the fate of the world, and those threads were just butchered in this book, with no justification or supporting development.Kane was supposed to start an apocalypse...marry one of the Horseman or the woman who housed Irresponsibility. Or both. Josephina had nothing at all to do with one of those fateful threads and Irresponsiblity had almost nothing to do with the other. Not in anything but a completely transitory way. So what was the point of even having those threads in the previous two books if you're just going to pull in some extremely tenuous threads of suspect connection to go around all of it?Not deal with it, mind you, completely go around it. Two very different things.None of that worked for me at all, and all of it, including several threads of resolution seemed way too convenient and contrived. And the end of the book, with the resolution, was too-typical of Showalter in this series. Completely unsupported by previous development and utterly abrupt, repetitive. Seriously, how many books has it been now when an angel (who I guess we're calling Sent Ones now) has stepped in at the critical moment in the climax and flicked his wings (or, you know...fiery sword...whatever) to solve all the problems for the main characters and expedite the HEA? More than once is too many. Three times is appalling.And one other thing: I loathe the, ""Oops, I was wrong,"" explanation to force feed a conflict resolution and fast track an HEA and Showalter uses it All. The. Time. Call it a deus ex machina, a plot contrivance, or whatever, it's that moment when you're reading a story that's been written into a very clearly defined and concrete corner only to have the author decide the room is round so the problem is solved. Argh! Drives me absolutely crazy.The one at the end of this book was particularly heinous, too.There are just too many things going wrong for me with this series lately, so many that I'm starting to wonder if the two year hiatus I took from the series between Amun's and Strider's books was, in fact, long enough.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SQQSEEQ19CC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373777752#wasThisHelpful","R3SQQSEEQ19CC7","A2E9HDZXQORZLA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9HDZXQORZLA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as bad boys go, you don't get much badder than Michael Garland, convicted serial killer and all-around bada--. He's the worst sort of guy for someone like Dr. Charlie Stone. Rude, ridiculously self-interested, arrogant and totally alpha-male, Michael should be the antithesis of everything she wants in a man. He's certainly nothing she needs.And that's beyond the fact that he's been dead for the past eleven days, so not exactly primo long-term relationship material.None of that changes the fact that when the renowned psychiatrist and authority on serial killers sees Michael sprawled out on her couch four days after he saved her life then disappeared from it, the relief and happiness almost takes her to her knees. It's wrong, he's wrong, and his continued presence in her life is no good for either of them, but damn it if she isn't so very glad he's back.You see, Dr. Charlie Stone studies serial killer psychopathy, but her real gift is her ability to see ghosts. Though...when it comes to Michael, it's still a toss-up as to whether that's a gift or a curse. She's conflicted on that one.Before Charlie gets a chance to really work out her wildly fluctuating feelings about Michael's continued presence in her life, horror slams into her back door. Horror in the shape of a terrified and bloody young woman screaming for help and begging to be let inside before the man chasing her can catch her and kill her. And with the turn of a knob, against Michael's strenuous objections, she might add, Charlie becomes the focus of another serial killer.The Gingerbread Man, so named for the notes he leaves in the wake of his sadistic, murderous games, has set his sights on Charlie, and this time, neither the ghost she wants, Michael, nor the man she wants to want, FBI Special Agent Tony Bartoli, may be able to save her.~*~When Robards introduced Michael Garland in series debut The Last Victim, it was love at first snark. I absolutely adored everything about him. Vibrant and flagrantly alive...despite being a dead guy...he stole every single scene, and the back-and-forth between him and Charlie was my favorite part of that book. I loved the tension and heat between them, and Charlie's struggle to cope with her growing feelings for a man she thinks is a serial killer was awesome. Oh yeah, and there was also a pretty good psychological thriller going on around all of that, too.In this book, and despite a spectacular start filled with scorching sexual chemistry, gut-clenching emotion, and grim horror, the pieces weren't quite so shiny and wonderful for me.I still love Michael. He's absolutely one of my favorite characters in an ongoing series right now. I totally dig everything about him, flaws and all. But this time, the heights of my adoration for him was matched, even exceeded, by my annoyance, aggravation, and frustration with Charlie.Instead of comporting herself like the respected psychiatrist she is, Charlie's behavior towards and about Michael was immature and borderline ridiculous in several places in the book, and that's when she wasn't being stubbornly conflicted or obviously petulant. And her hypocrisy and inconsistency bothered me a lot.She spends most of the time when he's around doing everything within her power to ignore him or treat him like crap, then panics and freaks out when he starts to flicker out of her reality. And the cycle repeats over and over again throughout the story, subsuming other important plot elements and squashing anything resembling relationship evolution.Yes, Michael is often a pain in the butt and obviously delights in pushing Charlie's buttons, but the guy was convicted of crimes he said he didn't commit and sentenced to die for them, only to end up shanked by a fellow inmate. Now he's doomed to be either stuck as a ghost or slip into the bad place that wants to claim him. You think a little patience and empathy for the guy wouldn't be completely out of line.But because Charlie is so disturbed by her growing feelings for the arrogant, all male, possessive, protective, sexy, totally yummy ghost, she's willfully and purposely dismissive of him and cavalier about how her actions affect him. It made it hard not to loathe her. And her whole ""if you can't love the one you want, love the one you're with"" philosophy when it came to pursuing Tony as a love interest - right in front of Michael - not only diminished the significance of her feelings for Michael but also wasn't fair to Tony, who is...if a bit dull for my tastes...a genuinely decent guy who deserves better than to be forced to serve as the metaphorical ""screw you, Michael I can do who I want"" in Charlie's little self-absorbed world.Lest I forget, which would be pretty easy to do, actually, there's also a race to find a vicious and manipulative serial killer before he takes his next trio of victims. The Gingerbread Man is a sadistic psychopath, just the sort of villain I like most in my suspense reads. It would have been awesome if the plot threads into his identification and apprehension hadn't been totally overwhelmed by Michael and Charlie's seemingly never-ending battle of emotional immaturity.I love the story potential in the arc of their romance. There's a real star-crossed lovers theme going on here that I enjoy, especially when partnered with the against-all-odds, anything-is-possible relationship potential offered by the paranormal romance subgenre. And to be honest, I even understand why Charlie is completely conflicted about her feelings for Michael. I just wish their relationship in this book had some measure of actual evolution throughout the narrative and that it had been better balanced with the suspense threads of the plot.So long as Michael stays on this side of the hereafter, though, I absolutely plan on sticking around for what comes next. Love. Him.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Ballantine Books publisher Random House Publishing via NetGalley.

"Sometimes it just doesn't pay to get out of bed in the morning. Unfortunately for Ali Winters, that sentiment spans more than just a single morning. It wasn't just getting dumped by her scumbag boyfriend Teddy, though that did suck. It just didn't suck as bad as actually catching him cheating on her, then getting a break-up text from him before she has a chance to dump him first.To add insult to that particular injury, the text message kindly informed her he hadn't renewed the lease on the rental home they shared and she had to be out by the end of the month, which was, you know...yesterday. Now Ali has no home, no boyfriend, and a whole lotta rage. Not really a surprise that the police think she stole the $50,000 that went missing from Teddy's office after she left a very...detailed...note on his desk - and a voice mail or ten - letting him know just what she thought of him.Returning to Lucky Harbor for some much-needed alone time after his latest case ripped his life apart, San Francisco cop Luke Hanover didn't expect to find a gorgeous, almost naked, and seriously brassed off woman squatting in his house. He wanted her gone so he could be miserable all by himself, but one look at the injured yet defiant Ali and he finds himself doing things he had no intention of doing.Things like allowing her to stay at his place, or, when the police treat her like a suspect in a pretty major crime, getting involved to help her out. Which is the absolute last thing he wants to do. He just can't seem to help himself.Yup, sometimes it just doesn't pay to get out of bed in the morning.~*~Another fun, feel-good Lucky Harbor romance! Shalvis' Lucky Harbor series is my favorite of the ongoing contemporary romance series I read. It's consistently entertaining, often flat-out delightful, and it's chock full of a wide variety of wacky and weird and wonderful characters who are so easy to adore. And of course, the romances between the heroes and heroines in each book are fairly awesome, too.In this one we meet the irrepressible Ali and the inscrutable Luke as Shalvis kicks off her third set of loosely connected in-series trilogies, this one revolving around the boys of Lucky Harbor, three childhood besties who have grown up all kinds of hot, sexy, and heroic.Lest I forget, you can't have a Shalvis romance without a quirky, fierce beauty to give the guy's heart his forever home, and I loved Ali. She's a spitfire. Dealt some pretty hard blows at the beginning of the book, Ali responds to each with her chin up and her fists clenched in proud defiance. She's strong and highly independent, but she's also got a softer, more easily bruised side that was very sympathetic. In fact, she sort of stole the show.That's not to say that Luke isn't a tall dish of sexy goodness in his own right. Brooding, taciturn, and more than a little dented by life, Luke is the quintessential reluctant hero on the outside but total alpha male problem-solver at heart. He got sucked into the dual vortexes of Ali and Lucky Harbor and couldn't quite get himself free, no matter how hard he tried (which, well...wasn't really all that hard). He's a far more internal male lead than we've seen so far in the series, and he doesn't say a whole lot, but his actions speak volumes. I loved him.As a couple they were a sometimes volatile and always impressive mix of hot sex and sweet, heart-tugging emotion. A very good pair to follow after the nearly incomparable Grace and Josh.There was a suspense element in this storyline that the other books haven't had, and I liked it a lot. It didn't take a large chunk of story focus away from Ali and Luke's relationship arc, but it added a romantic suspense flavor that I enjoyed. Not that the Lucky Harbor series needed additional elements to improve it, or was lacking in any way, but I definitely thought it brought a new dynamic to the series that I appreciated.But maybe it took something away, too, because I have to admit, the humor wasn't as prevalent as it was in the previous three books and I didn't feel there was as large an influence of Lucky Harbor residents as I'm used to enjoying. There were several included, obviously, and of course Lucille was up to her usual shenanigans, but overall on a lesser scale than I would have hoped for. Lucky Harbor's Facebook-loving geriatric brigade is always good for a smile or ten.I also wish that Luke's problems with his job and the threat that brought to his life had been afforded a larger role in the story, with a more comprehensive resolution. Ali's issues, personal and legal, got significantly more page time, so the story lacked the sort of balance between the characters' personal evolution that other books have had. That was a little disappointing, especially as I had gone into this book looking forward to this three-book set in the series focusing more on the men and their lives and friendships, like the sisters in the first three and the female best friends in the second set.But a little disappointment doesn't make this book a bad bet by any means.Nothing about this book or this series is a bad bed. Shalvis is clearly at the top of her writing game and keeps cranking out touching stories that deliver on the sexy good times as well as the sigh-worthy love stories. For pure romance reading fun, you just can't do any better than Shalvis and her Lucky Harbor series. And if I ever find the place on a map, I'm so moving there.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group via NetGalley.

"Half-human and half...not, investigator, courier, assassin, and general jack-of-all-trades Kit Colbana is probably the happiest she's been in her life. She's got the Alpha of the cat clan as her lover, enough steady jobs to keep her occupied and paid, and she hasn't had to kill anyone lately. That's about as good as it's ever been for a woman who is still haunted by the vicious nightmare that was her childhood.She really should've known the happiness wasn't going to last.When she's approached by Banner cop and ex-lover Justin with a case Kit can't refuse, she is furious. And frantic. Someone has been killing council members of the Assembly of Non-Humans and all evidence is pointing to cat clan Alpha and her main squeeze, Damon. If Kit can't clear his name, or provide evidence that the kills are legally justified, Banner will put out a kill order on him and Damon will be executed. In days.To make matters just that much worse, Justin, one of the most powerful witches in the country, puts a binding spell on her so she can't talk about the case with anyone, including the one man she would give anything - including her own life - to save. She can't ask for help, she can't warn anyone what she's doing. She's completely on her own.And her life may very well be exactly the price she ends up paying after all.~*~If Daniels (aka Shiloh Walker) intended to write a book that would rip the bloody and still-beating hearts out of her readers' chests, then grind them into weakly throbbing pulp under the crushing weight of a titanium-soled heel, then she overachieved the hell out of that goal in the last quarter of this book. Wow. Talk about some viscerally devastating reading. It was an incredibly dark, powerful, gut-wrenching conclusion that is going to make me scurry off to find some light fluff for my next read.I can do nothing but heartily admire any author who can put my emotions right where he or she wants them to be, and Daniels did exactly that. It wasn't fun, it wasn't even something I'd consider entertaining, but it was very well done. For that portion of the book alone, I liked this read.The rest of Kit's story in this book, though, wasn't quite up to that level.I like Kit as a heroine. She's tough but deeply damaged, she kicks ass but she's still haunted by her past. She's never warm and fuzzy and a bit too often she takes the smart-ass route when diplomacy could net her less damage. She's unapologetic and sometimes she's terrified, but she does the job anyway. I like her a lot.I just wish she was given more to do in this book then race around getting chewed up and spit out, then painfully healed, only to turn around and do it all over again. Unfortunately, as soon as the main arc of the plot started to really get going, it felt like that was the majority of what I was reading. Toss in some nightmares about the grandmother from hell and you have 90% of the first three quarters of the book.The other ten was time with Damon, and I have no issue at all with that beyond the fervent desire for it to be a larger percentage.Even when Kit's frantic race to work the case had her following leads or questioning witnesses, we didn't really see her do much of that. Too often we were brought in after the fact, when things had gone balls up and Kit was getting chomped. I found it all a little odd, and the focus seemed to remain on Kit's thoughts and the panic she was feeling to get this job successfully completed more than on the steps she took to complete it.Well, that and the sometimes repetitive internal monologue, which was too often stuck on the alternating thoughts of how much stronger/faster/better she is than anyone ever guesses, and how her grandmother's torture shaped her. And not for nothing, but there sure seemed to be a lot of ringing phones in the story.The final quarter of this book was emotionally devastating. Reading it was incredibly painful, but I literally could not tear my eyes away. In part because I like Kit as much as I do, and love Damon fiercely, I was just emotionally wiped out at the end. Wiped out and cursing the long wait to the release of the next book in the series. Had the rest of the story arc at least held its own against that, this would have probably been one of the best books I've read all year, and one of the best urban fantasies I've read in a long time. It didn't do that, but it was still a worthwhile read.Not fun, by any means. But deeply affecting.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by the publisher via NetGalley.

"Eight years after leaving Bloomington, Texas in the dust, Storie Bell is back to make her mark in the only home she ever knew. She had to, she had nowhere else to go. Okay, so finding out that Reid Malone was also back in town was not the best news she'd ever heard. Not when the last time he saw her he almost caught her using her magic, and not when the memory of that long-ago night, and the incendiary moment they shared, still had the power to leave her breathless.So she'd avoid him. That shouldn't be too hard to do, even in a town as small as Bloomington.Reid may be stuck in his podunk hometown for now, but as soon as he helps his father find the secret ingredient to his moonshine recipe, he'll be long gone. Sure, having Storie back in town is a heady distraction, and her renovation of the old gas station next to his father's bar is putting a serious crimp in his search for that special oil her father used to give to his old man, but he's not going to let that get in his way. Memories of the night they shared eight years ago would just have to take a back seat to his father's ambitions.He just had to find a way to worm his way into her life, and really, that shouldn't be too hard to do in a town as small as Bloomington.~*~I had so many problems with this book, I'm not really sure where to start. It started well enough. The flashback from eight years ago provided a strong beginning. Unfortunately it was all downhill from there. There wasn't much in the way of world-building, the characters were two dimensional, the plot was very limited, the narrative was repetitive, and the relationship between the two main characters never evolved beyond rampant lust.The building blocks were there. I liked the brief look of eight-years-ago Reid, and I liked Storie pretty well throughout most of the book. Current-timeline Reid, however, was fairly reprehensible. Not only was he actively deceiving Storie so he could steal from her for his equally reprehensible father, the justification of his actions left me cold. This is a rich, self-made man who couldn't figure out a better way to help his crook of a father? Really? He had to take advantage of a perfectly sweet woman just trying to set up a life for herself? And he's supposed to be the hero of the book. Sorry, no.Their relationship, such as it was, was acrimonious, so this may appeal to enemies-to-lovers fans, but for this theme to work for me, there has to be a better evolution of the characters as the story progresses and a better foundation for that evolution. All Storie and Reid had was that oft-mentioned night eight years ago. And I got sick of hearing about it. I can't even tell you how many times it was brought up in the story. Every time they so much as thought of each other, they would refer back to that night. Between that and how often Storie reminded herself that witches can't be with mortal men, the narrative seemed painfully repetitive.And while it was easy to believe the lust they felt for each other, though the significance of that lust after eight years was a bit of a stretch, nothing in the plot at any point in the story indicated any greater depth or complexity of emotion. There just wasn't room for it to develop, no matter what readers are told. But just saying it's so doesn't make it so.There was also a plot twist that came out of nowhere late in the book and further hampered my enjoyment of the read. The twist struck me as heavy-handed and emotionally manipulative, and instead of garnering sympathy for Storie, I ended up questioning her ridiculous decision-making. I could no longer justify caring for a character who would leave her best friend - her only friend in the whole world - completely in the lurch with nothing more than a hastily-written letter because of some inexplicable sense of responsibility to people she's never met.Family of the heart deserves better. Her best friend and that friend's two little girls deserved better. As a reader, I felt I deserved better from a heroine of a story. And that's above and beyond how painfully contrived the whole situation seemed to be.I was also left wondering if I was supposed to take that sweeping romantic conclusion seriously. Up until the end, the story had been consistent about the toll Storie's magic took on her, enforcing and reinforcing the fact that it was failing, that even the smallest spell drained her to the point of needing a nap. And then, after wielding some hefty mojo in the climax of the conflict, she's not only still conscious, she's able to toss around a few get-naked-now spells as she gets busy with Reid without so much as a yawn for her efforts. That inconsistency on top of the sudden declaration of previously unsupported everlasting love just put the final nail in this book's coffin.It's a fast read, and there were elements of the story that had appeal. Storie's friend was a solid secondary character and her two daughters were precious and precocious. I even liked the idea of Storie's bookshop cafe and could have embraced the otherworldly elements if they had more definition or explanation. In the end, though, there were just too many negatives for me, and the two biggest were Reid and Storie. That's two pretty insurmountable obstacles.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Covet publisher Entangled Publishing, LLC via NetGalley.

"You'd think finding out you're an empath and monsters are real, then dispatching a deadly incubus and saving the lives of countless women would have granted wedding planner extraordinaire Zoey Donovan at least a small reprieve from the crazy, but no. No such luck for the intrepid helper of the Hidden. Between delivering sea monster babies and doling out love advice to closet monsters, keeping half her life a secret from her best friend, and pining for her missing sorta-boyfriend, EMT/not-so-grim reaper Riley, Zoey's life has not just taken a turn for the surreal, it's parked there and grown roots.Now she's managed to annoy Death.Apparently Zoey has the extreme misfortune of still being alive, despite being slated to die on two separate occasions. Death gets mighty cranky when that happens. Throws the whole cosmic balance out of alignment. Now she's got to deal with Riley's supervisor and a craptastic bit of bad mojo tripping her up at every turn. If she survives the next two weeks she'll get taken off death's To Do list, but it will out her as an Aegis to the Hidden head honchos.If that happens she'll be snatched from her life and everything she knows and be consigned to work for the Hidden council for the rest of her life, so it's sort of a whole damned if she does, dead if she doesn't sort of situation. Which...when you consider just how Zoey's life has been going lately...isn't really all that surprising when you think of it.Just another day in the life of Zoey Donovan and her creepy coterie.~*~It was love at first paragraph. Seriously, all it took was the first paragraph of the first book to know I would adore this series, and the kicks and giggles just keep on rolling in this second installment. I love the characters, I totally dig the author's voice, and the stories keep me entertained for hours of pure reading bliss.Zoey is so much fun as the heroine. She's wacky, weird, and wonderfully socially challenged. With a heart as big as Texas and a penchant for trouble, she's easy to root for when her life spins out of control. Which it does. Constantly. Love it!Even more than my appreciation for Zoey is my absolute worship of her inner circle of monsters and other non-human creatures. Maurice! Molly! Iris! It doesn't matter how much page time they get, they steal every scene. Especially Maurice. I was even more bummed than Zoey when Maurice went to visit his estranged wife for so much of the narrative. And don't even get me started on Andrew's fennec fox, Milo.No, really, do not get me started. I'm still struggling with forgiving Naquin for that. Bad author! No cookie for you!We get to see some new faces in this one, of course. As the title suggests, we meet a wonderfully pervy little pooka who, while not as universally appealing as Maurice, did add a good amount of chaotic amusement. And then there were the gremlins. I loved the gremlins. Bump and Glob and Bink were in what? Two scenes? They stole the book, I swear. So cute! So fun!With this wonderful cast of characters, I have to admit, the story doesn't really need to be that spectacular to keep me entertained, which is probably a good thing, because in both books, the external plot conflicts were my least favorite parts of the books. And this one was just a bit less engaging than the last. I love the chaos of Zoey's life, but for about three quarters of this book the storyline centered around her surviving all the bad luck thrown her way.It was fun, sometimes hilarious, it was even occasionally heartbreaking, but it wasn't exactly layered or complex. Towards the end of the book the plot starts to add some interesting elements, and there are some twists and turns I wasn't expecting as the book rolls towards conclusion, but it ended up seeming almost like an afterthought, or some heavy-handed foreshadowing of a more meaty conflict for the next book. It didn't quite fit as seamlessly into this one as I would have liked.I have one more slightly dissatisfied confession, too. Despite my rabid fandom of romance, Riley didn't work for me as Zoey's erstwhile romantic interest in this book. We met him in the first book and I liked him just fine there, but in this one he just seemed more of a character appendage than the story contributor he was in book one. Most of the time here he pops up looking wild-eyed or acting worried for Zoey, is good for a lip lock or two, then slips beneath the surface again until the next time he is brought into a scene. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for romance man candy, but he just didn't offer me much beyond that in this story. I hope there is more done with his character in the next book.It certainly goes without saying that I'll be slavering to get my hands on that next book. I can't wait to see how the developments in this one translate to upcoming events in the next. I can't wait for more of Zoey's wacky day-to-day life, either. That's some of the absolute best of both books!Speaking of both books, I think new readers could probably start the series here and catch up to what's gone on with little trouble. Naquin explains previous events well enough, and she has an ease with reminding readers what went on before that I appreciated. I wouldn't recommend you do that, though. Start with the first book. Don't miss out on any of what went before. You'll thank me for it. Trust me.QUOTABLES:Friends don't let friends get felt up by the supernatural.~*~""Did you ever hear the song, 'Don't Fear the Reaper?'""""Sure.""""Did you ever think that song wouldn't have been written if people didn't already fear them?

"There may be a myriad of things Phenex would rather be doing than entertaining the haut monde in a hoity-toity vampire club on a Friday night, several thousand of which pay a hell of a lot better...literally, but when you're a demon-hunting Fallen who used to be the Angel of Song, the gig at least gives you a chance to connect with the very music that called you into being eons ago.The night starts looking up when Phenex catches the scent of blood. A lot of blood. Definitely a bad omen in this particular club, which sits above the underground haven of the supernatural community he's tasked to defend. Looks like he'll be pulling double duty as entertainer du jour and otherworldly ass-kicker after all.Emergency room nurse Sofia Rivera is on a mission. Her roommate and best friend hasn't been home in days, so she sneaked into the club where she works to talk to her and make sure she's okay. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but that was before she caught sight of her friend in the crowd, followed her into the bathroom, and tumbled headlong into a horror movie. Some freak was...biting her friend...drinking...he had fangs...Before Sofia could really process the reality of the situation, she's defending herself against an actual vampire, and if that isn't enough to make her brain take a fast train to Looneytown, the huge guy with the big set of wings and the really serious sword who slams into the bathroom and cuts the vampire in half right in front of her sure helps pack her bags.Now Sofia's got to contend with a group of rogue vampires who aren't fond of letting witnesses live and a pushy, arrogant...and, okay, gorgeous former angel as a self-assigned bodyguard making sure she does.~*~As a huge fan of Kendra Leigh Castle's Dark Dynasties series, I was thrilled to see this new series debut. I was a little perplexed when I started reading it, though, because it sure didn't read like a first book. In fact, it very much read like the third book in an existing series. Turns out, there's a good reason for that. Though released by a different publisher, there is an earlier novel and a short story/novella set in this world with some of the characters that show up in this book. That created some problems for me in this story because I definitely felt like I was missing something whenever those characters were mentioned or their histories discussed.It wasn't an issue of not being able to follow the developing events in this book, or the world not being sufficiently defined. It was just a niggling sense of being out of the loop that pervaded while I was reading. I hate that feeling, but I tend to be fairly obsessive about reading a series in timeline order to begin with, so it's likely it bothered me more than most.Setting that aside, though, I liked this book very much. Castle creates lovable characters. Her heroes tend to be alpha males who are deliciously flawed or tragically wounded in some way but with big squishy centers for their heroines, who themselves are feisty, independent, intelligent females and very easy to like - a plus for me, because I'm picky about my book heroines. Phenex and Sofia were right on trend and I enjoyed them both very much. They had depth of personality, fantastic chemistry, and each complimented the story and each other.I mean, come on, Phenex had flower boxes! Loved that!The plot lacked some of the complexity and definition of her Dark Dynasties series, and the storyline leaned more heavily on the romance and relationship between the main characters than on the external plot conflict, which often felt more like an afterthought. That was a shame, too, as I really enjoyed the world and the idea behind Terra Noctem, the underground city of nightwalkers. I would have loved to see those expanded with a meatier plot.Fortunately, the characters were strong enough and their romance compelling enough to support the book without it. Phenex and Sofia had a great relationship, and the ups and downs of its evolution were truly driven by the people they were and the lives they had lived to that point. I've gotten so tired of stumbling across contrived relationship conflict in romance. It's boring and trite. The conflicts that crop up between Phenex and Sofia were natural consequences of their personalities, their passions, and their pains.Sofia in particular endeared herself to me with an unshakable strength of character and determination to be true to herself in the face of ravaging heartbreak. I loved the hell out of her for that...though I did want to give Phenex a kick in his sexy tush for putting her into that position.The book also has a solid cast of intriguing secondary characters with a truly unique, and sometimes contentious, dynamic. There lies a wealth of story potential and I can't wait to read it. I definitely want to spend much more time with them and in Terra Noctem in future books. I don't expect this series to approach the depth and dimension of Dark Dynasties, but with Castle at the helm, I have no doubt I'll be highly entertained and fall in love with each Fallen on their rocky road to redemption.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Covet publisher Entangled Publishing via NetGalley.

"Since his mentor John's sudden death a year ago, it's been a daily struggle for Zach Goldman to keep up with the construction business he inherited. He's getting by though, clawing his way through. Until someone leaves an inscrutable note on his door one morning. It asks just one short question. ""Where is she?""When Zach figures out John's daughter is missing, he's rocked by self-loathing and fear. He'd promised to take care of the woman who was like a sister to him. Obviously, he failed, but he's going to do everything he can to bring her home.Boutique shop owner Sloane Swift isn't too concerned when Zach first shows up to ask about her friend and employee Ann. She's too shocked by the pleasant zap to her psychic senses when they touch and too overwhelmed by healthy, normal lust for the gorgeous man. When they meet up at Ann's house later that day, though, Sloane finds out just how bad things really are, for Ann and for her own closely-guarded secrets.She can tell something very, very bad has happened even before she comes in direct contact with the negative energy around Ann's front door. Actually touching the doorknob hurdles her into a dark and terrifying psychic vision that makes her violently ill. Now she's got to explain the inexplicable to someone who doesn't look real long on embracing a bunch of woo-woo stuff, because one touch tells Sloane that Ann's time is very limited, and if Zach wants to find her, he's going to need Sloane's help to do so. No matter how desperate she is to keep her secrets.~*~Have you ever read a book that introduced you to a secondary character with such presence on the page that you're desperate for that character to get their own book just so you can spend more time with him or her? Maybe it was the scars and damage that the character has that drew you to him/her, or the honor with which he/she lived despite it. Maybe it was just the sheer intensity of his/her personality. Whatever it was, it caught you by the throat and almost superseded your feelings about the book in which he/she was introduced.Then you get that next book, the one in which the secondary character you met and fell for is now featured, and it's fantastic, giving you a more detailed look at the character, more definition to his/her personality, and the sort of thorough backstory that both breaks your heart and makes you fall even more in love with the guy...or girl. It's everything you were hoping it would be and leaves you feeling excited and satisfied for that character.That is exactly, to the letter, how I felt about this book and Zach's character. I loved him intensely and enjoyed finding out a bit about his past and the people in his life who helped shape him into the sexy, strong, sometimes self-doubting but noble man he is. A far better man than he thinks he is. There's just one problem with all that awesome.In this case, there was no first book. In fact, as far as I know, this book isn't a part of a series at all. It's a stand-alone novel. And yes, that's a big problem.See, I think there actually is a first book. There has to be, even if that book has never been published or the story exists only in the author's mind. This one is just too quintessentially a second book in a series to ever convince me that there isn't something, somewhere, written or not, that featured Zach's friends Twyla and Archie and their relationship. A story in which John is still alive, at least in the beginning, and Zack is the brooding guy with a tragic past that offers up a kidney to his best friend's terminally ill wife because he can't imagine not doing everything he can to save the life of the woman who has come to mean absolutely everything to the man who is closer to him than a brother, regardless of the danger to himself.Because that is who Zach is. That's the awesome character we meet in this book. And we get all that delicious detail about his past that fleshes him out and makes him real, if in too-brief snapshots of a rough childhood and heartbreaking young adulthood. What we don't get is the foundation, the building blocks of the character and his key relationships to the now-deceased John, to Twyla and Archie, to Morgan, and most notably to Ann.It felt very much like walking into a movie theater twenty minutes into the featured presentation.Therein lies the largest stumbling in this book for me, particularly as it pertains to the suspense elements of the plot. Ann was a complete non-entity to me throughout the story, with no real impact on my emotions one way or another. As a result, I didn't care beyond the level of passing curiosity what happened to her, or if Zach and Sloane would find her before her ugly demise. I was more affected by what happens to a character we do meet in this book, yet that horror never really seemed to have much of an impact on either Sloane or Zach after the initial hit, which puzzled me.Here's the thing though, I still liked this book, despite what is a pretty serious problem. In fact, I liked it a lot. The elements I couldn't connect with were far less significant to me than all the wonderful things to which I connected brilliantly. Like Sloane, who I absolutely adored.Despite her tendency to burst into tears a bit too often for my tastes, I loved her. She had some personal issues and a tragedy in her past which provided some nice layers to her character. I appreciated that. What really made me love her, though, was her unerring eye for judicious pragmatism in the face of pretty disturbing goings on and the way she dealt with Zach's inherent alpha male-ness. She not only held her ground with the overprotective and occasionally stubborn male, she had no qualms about telling him exactly where he could stick his attitude when it started to choke her healthy independent streak.I believe the term she used was seismic jackass, and I loved every second of it.They were great together as a couple, and their chemistry hit hard, fast, and was totally off the charts. Maybe it wasn't always appropriate to their surroundings or what was going on in the story, and their relationship progressed to love way, way too fast for me given the timeline of events, but I couldn't help but absolutely love them. And I was a huge fan of Sloane's psychic abilities and how they were introduced and utilized in the story.Now, about that story...As a reader, I don't have to feel particularly connected to the victim of a crime to be able to fully enjoy the pulse-pounding action and thrilling danger in which the main characters get themselves embroiled. That's a very good thing in this case, because this book was an absolute roller coaster of emotion (in Zach and Sloane's relationship), danger, mystery, and suspense. I had no idea who was responsible for Ann's disappearance until the moment of reveal and the plot twists after that reveal made my gut clench. Did not see that horror coming at all.For me, this book was absolutely a high-octane thrill ride of paranormal romantic suspense with great characters and a sizzling romance that wowed me in a lot of very awesome ways. It's just not a stand-alone novel...despite the fact that it is.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Ignite publisher Entangled Publishing via NetGalley.

"~* 3.5 Stars *~Three hundred years ago, Olivia Hollingsworth watched a monster slaughter the only man she ever loved, then was forced to become a monster herself. She's never quite gotten over it.Sure, being a vampire has its perks, but mostly Olivia just tries to keep her coven, those vampires she's turned and the humans she's saved, safe and gainfully employed at her night club. In all that time, through every thing she's seen and done, with every soul she's saved...one way or another, she has never forgotten the man she gave her heart and body to all those years ago.For the past two decades, against everything she knows to be true about her kind, Olivia has dreamed of that man. Her Douglas. The one she couldn't save. And then he walks into her club, alive, breathing, and decidedly human, and Olivia's reality takes a quick trip to the land of surreal.Homicide detective Doug Paxton has a grisly case on his hands, a victim who looks like he was mauled by an animal, the blood drained from his body. All evidence points to the night club near where the body was found. Meeting the owner, however, rocks Doug to his core, because for all that he knows he's never met the deliciously gorgeous Olivia before, he's seen her almost every night for as long as he can remember. In his dreams.Two souls separated by centuries, divided by more than surface differences, are destined to complete each other in ways neither had ever dreamed. If the forces working against the city's inhabitants and the vampire race itself doesn't kill them both first.~*~I had some trepidation when I picked up this book. I wasn't a big fan of Humphreys' Amoveo series debut and I was a little worried by this book's title and cover, which gave me the impression of this being a fluffier book than I favor for my paranormal romance. Fortunately, however, that impression was wrong. This is more the sort of darker-edged story that I prefer.In fact, neither the story nor the characters are anywhere in the vicinity of fluffy, and for almost three-quarters of the book I was highly entertained by the foundations of the gritty world that Humphreys started fleshing out here, as well as the deadly plot and intense characters. I enjoyed the role reversal in the power structure of the relationship between Olivia and Doug. For all that Doug is quite obviously an alpha male, he is human when he's introduced as a character and Olivia is not. She's a former warrior and current savvy business woman, fiercely independent and more than a little jaded about her kind.She is the power in the relationship and I liked that dynamic between them very much. I was less fond of her three hundred year celibacy, but that was more in how it kept being mentioned. After three hundred years, one would think the subject would be played out, that it would be a moot point, just a fact of Olivia's unlife or whatever, so it didn't feel natural that it kept coming up in the narrative. I get that readers need to be made aware, but a more organic way would have been appreciated.That was a relatively minor hiccup in my fondness for Olivia's character, however. She's keenly intelligent, loyal to her family, and struggles with the darker side of her nature. I found her interesting and wish the story had provided even more depth to her character, delving into more of her issues with the dark impulses of her kind. She's obviously set herself up as an outsider in her world, and her entire coven are misfits, all survivors of one tragedy or another. I would have loved to have a more comprehensive view of all of that.With so strong a female lead, I was surprised to find myself liking Doug as much as I did Olivia. Humphreys tread a delicate line in their relationship. Olivia was strong in ways that didn't undermine or contradict Doug's own strength of character, and that thrilled me, but he was also quite endearing, mostly for his butt-over-brains reaction to coming face-to-face with the woman of his dreams. He was so adorably poleaxed by Olivia I couldn't help but be charmed. That he was also a no-nonsense homicide detective with a hella amount of sexy going on just upped his appeal.Well...I did for most of the book, anyway. My appreciation for Doug as a character in general and as the romantic hero went through a very large change right around the same time he did. Frankly, I thought he was more than a little bit of a douche bag at times in the latter half of the book, and he spouted off some pretty unpalatable plans to address his new condition.I think I could have accepted that as a part of his character evolution, though, had there been a corresponding evolution of the romance arc surrounding it. As it was, I just couldn't engage in any of the sexy good times between Doug and Olivia so soon after he tossed himself on the not-so-metaphorical pyre and acted like a judgmental, ignorant wanker. And there was a disappointing lack of addressing that issue throughout the end of the book.Unfortunately, that downturn in the romance coincided with a couple of elements of the external conflict in the plot that didn't appeal to me. For the majority of the book, this was a nicely woven, darkly suspenseful tale with a strong thread of romance tying it all together. Then things went just a step too far down the road of implausible, illogical, and abrupt and I had to shake my head a little.Beyond my issues with the not-so-fabulously changing Doug, the conclusion to this book was not to my taste. The resolution of several of Olivia's and Doug's life-threatening problems got handed to them on a silver platter that came out of nowhere, and it included some very odd story developments and awkward attempts to hash out a few more quick bits of world building and shady explanation. In a few pages, what had been a dramatic Sword of Damocles hanging over their heads morphed into into a quick, way-too-convenient and tidy conclusion. It was a very uncomfortable deus ex machina that left me feeling confused and a little frustrated.It was still a better read than I was expecting, though. I didn't have a lot of luck with the Amoveo series. It just wasn't my cuppa, and I was worried this book would also fall short. It didn't, really, even if the ending was too abrupt and clean for me. The larger portion of the book was a lot better than I was expecting and highly entertaining for it all. I may have absolutely no idea what direction the series is heading in - not after that conclusion - but I'd be interested in finding out.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Sourcebooks Casablanca publisher Sourcebooks via NetGalley.

"He was her best friend. She was his world. Then tragedy struck and tore Summer Abrams' life apart. Crippled by grief and forged by loss, Summer ran from her hometown of Ocean Beach. She ran from the loss of her father. She ran from the suffocating emotion of her family. She ran from the strength and importance of her friendship with Joe Walker. She ran, and never stopped running. Then the call came.Twelve years after the warehouse fire that irrevocably altered her life, the beast has struck again. The first time drove Summer away. The second brought her home.She hadn't expected her return to OB to be easy, not after so many years, but her family's chilly reception still hurts. Summer is determined to reconnect with them, to reforge the bonds she had once cut so cleanly no matter how uncomfortable she is with the effort. She's just as determined to reconnect with her former best friend Joe, who has grown into a fine specimen of manhood.The longer she stays in town, however, the more she feels pushed out the door. Her mom certainly doesn't seem to want her around, and Joe, now a fire marshal and investigating the fire that brought her back, is no more welcoming. Maybe it's been too long. Maybe time doesn't heal all wounds.When another fire breaks out and almost takes Summer's life with it, she is forced to face another grim possibility. Maybe her return has stirred up ghosts that someone is desperate to let lie. Maybe, just maybe someone she loves wants her gone...permanently.~*~I've pretty much come to the conclusion that if a book has Jill Shalvis' name on it, I'm going to enjoy the read. Of course some books I like more than others, but the sheer consistency of entertainment her books provide sets Shalvis apart and is a large part of why she's one of my favorite authors. And this re-release of a 2005 title just goes to show she's been good for a long time.The sticky widget with re-releases is whether or not they'll feel dated. That can quickly ruin a read for me. Fortunately, that wasn't a problem here. The big reveal during the book's climax felt a little old-school and a trifle cliched because of it, but nothing really struck me as completely anachronistic.This book has a much stronger suspense plotline than I was expecting. I'm used to, and love, Shalvis' contemporary romance novels, especially the Lucky Harbor series (which absolutely should not be missed), but they're lighter than this one so the emotional depth and darker elements in this story took me by surprise. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. I love romantic suspense, and felt this was a solid example of one.I fell hard and fast for the fabulous Joe Walker. Shalvis sure didn't go easy on the poor guy, but he's a great character. His horrible childhood and the emotional detritus from his struggles with weight as a teen made him such a sympathetic hero. And I'm a total sucker for a guy who's loved a girl his whole life, even after she ripped his heart out. The fact that he is now a totally hot, if often emotionally unavailable firefighter was just icing on a very delicious cake. Sexy, strong, and oh-so-endearing, I adored everything about him.Summer, on the other hand, was a bit of a harder pill to swallow. My feelings about her are far more complicated. On one hand, I appreciated her for her flaws and damage. I find flawed and/or damaged characters intrinsically more interesting and believable than their picture-perfect counterparts. Not necessarily more likable, just more interesting. Summer definitely wasn't always likable.In fact, through most of the book she struck me as wounded but selfish with it, and her self-involvement was often cruel, albeit unintentionally so. I felt for her yearning for family bonds and struggle to fit in, but shuddered at her casual dismissal of Joe's plainly-spoken boundaries and the legitimate reasons for them. Too many times and for too long into the story I felt Joe deserved a lot more than Summer was willing or able to give. And emotional cowards have always been a major turn off to me. That made it hard to really embrace her in her romantic role, even though I heartily appreciated those flaws in regards to her family issues and the suspense elements of the plot.I had some minor quibbles with one or two other elements of the story, and I was a little disappointed that Joe and Summer's fight before the first fire was never really addressed, but mostly I was thoroughly entertained by this book and totally smitten with Joe. I haven't read the preceding books in the series, but can happily say that had no impact at all. This read like a stand-alone novel.

"Trish Muffett, investigator for the Fairytale Management Authority, just finished working a brutal crime scene when she's attacked by the two vampires responsible for the victim's death. For a Tale like Trish, vampires aren't unusual, but the two who attack her in the alley feel different than normal Tale vamps. And she has no idea why.It's not like she has time to figure it out, either, what with trying not to die and all. Fortunately for Trish, not dying gets a lot easier when Chicago's very own vigilante, The Spider, comes to her rescue.She is stunned when she recognizes the Tale to whom she now owes her life. The Spider is none other than Nicky ""Little Boy"" Blue, a man who left Chicago two years ago to track down Vlad Dracula, the Tale responsible for his wife Juliet's death. Oh, yeah, and he's the only man Trish Muffett has ever loved. Awkward!It's even more awkward when Trish is attacked again, this time in her own home by an obviously pissed off poltergeist, and it's Nicky Blue who once again saves the day - and her sanity - when he shows up in her living room. Wait...Nicky Blue broke into her apartment. When he thought she was sleeping. Uh...yeah, someone's got some serious 'splaining to do.Teaming up when they discover that the new vamps are Dracula's handiwork, Trish and Nicky race to catch the literary fiend. Whatever his master plan, Vlad is turning Ordinaries and they're killing Tales. He's got to be stopped. Unfortunately, their investigation has them practically tripping over agents from the Agency, the Ordinaries' elite Men in Black squad.As tensions between the Agency and the FMA heat up and unrest grows in the Tale community, Trish and Nicky have to find the one monster at the center of it all and close his book for good. Unless he ends them first.~*~My feelings are completely conflicted about this book. I love the world SeRine created with this series, and though I didn't read the second book, I mostly enjoyed the first in the series, Red. This one, despite being an overall better story with a more engaging and complex external conflict, had elements that bothered me a lot while I was reading. And they were pretty important elements, too.This is one of those books - and series - that walks the line between paranormal romance and urban fantasy. It's a hard line to tread and I've read few that could pull off both aspects with equal aplomb. This one didn't. Not for me, anyway. The first person point-of-view narrative was my first problem. It just isn't a favorite of mine in conjunction with a romance arc. And that romance arc was far more prominent in this story than it was in the first book.Normally that would be a good thing, but between the POV and Nicky, who I didn't like as a character nearly as much as I did Nate in Red, that put the final kibosh on the appeal of the romance in general.I don't know what it was about Nicky, really... I liked him just fine as an ancillary character in Red.  As a heavily involved secondary character in this book, he began to wear on me by the halfway point. Everything from his name, which struck me as too-cutesy after being mentioned as many times as one would expect for his level of story involvement, to his very vaguely defined criminal enterprise (I would have liked a lot more explanation about just how criminal that enterprise was), to his odd relationship with his dead wife Juliet and his sudden spurt of emotional connection to Trish, just started to rub me the wrong way and never quite smoothed out for me.And if he called Trish ""doll"" one more time, I was going to scream. Suffering through his dialogue was like being dropped into a bad prohibition-era mobster flick. Not my thing.I liked Trish a lot more than I did Nicky. In fact, I liked her a lot period. She was a little inconsistent at times, and she wavered a bit between take-no-prisoners badass chick to squealy damsel-in-distress, but overall, I found her to be a very palatable heroine. Much more so than Red in the first book. She definitely wasn't the stereotypical, emotional-commitment-issue-having, gun-toting, sarcastic, ass-kicking heroine, a fact that I was most grateful about, but she managed to mostly hold her own when she wasn't screaming or fleeing danger in terror.Mostly because of her appeal and despite my issues with Nicky, I was very much engaged in the first half of the book. The story started strong and the plot had a lot going on from the beginning. The two main threads of external conflict, the growing issue with the Agency douche bags and the search for Dracula, provided a nice, meaty bit of drama for the characters. Much danger and mystery surrounded it all.I was about halfway in when I started to feel like the storylines got a little lost. There weren't a lot of answers to be had at that point, just growing badness with the Agency and with Dracula, and Trish and Nicky seemed to be spinning their wheels a little in both areas. The book seemed to lose a lot of its momentum at that point, and I started growing more and more frustrated by some things, most notably the Tales' lack of action against the Agency for some pretty heinous actions.That was also about the time the romance went completely off the rails for me. Given all the backstory with Juliet and some pretty startling revelations about her relationship with Nicky around the time of her death (which I didn't like for several reasons), I did not expect, nor did I enjoy, the seemingly abrupt about-face in Nicky's feelings for Trish. I just couldn't buy it. Not without a more detailed foundation and or some emotional resolution concerning his dead wife.And the problems I was having with both the romance and the external conflicts plagued me throughout that whole third quarter of the book. It got so bad at one point that I almost put the book down. Nicky gives Trish a gun as they get ready to walk into a dangerous situation, then tells her to expect the dangerous people they're going to meet to take it from her. When Trish asked a very valid, ""well then why give it to me in the first place?"" Nicky's response was something along the lines of him wanting to make an impression.I just stared at that passage for a while feeling not just a little gobsmacked. Because of course, when you're walking into a very dangerous situation to meet very dangerous people, bringing a gun that you know will be taken from you is an EXCELLENT idea. Obviously, these people need to have MORE weaponry at their disposal to end you should your presence miff them.Brilliant plan, douche bag.I was so disgusted at that point that it didn't matter what happened in the scene they walked into. I was already predisposed to hating it. And that's the problem that I had with that whole middle part of the book.It got better, though. In fact, it got a hell of a lot better. When the pieces (finally) started to fall together and the answers started coming, the external conflict picked up speed and intensity as the climax approached. I loved the last twenty percent of the book. Action packed, emotional, dangerous, even a little tragic in very surprising ways, the end of the book was definitely a very high point of the read for me.Therein lies the conflict. There were parts of this book I liked, parts I loved, parts I didn't like, and parts I hated. That definitely makes rating it difficult.I love SeRine's world of Transplanted Tales. I do. It's unique and intriguing and the characters are diverse and fascinating. I even love SeRine's authorial voice, which resonates with such clarity in the narrative. Unfortunately, I don't always like what that voice is saying to me, and it leaves me feeling very torn about the book and the series both.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Kensington Books via NetGalley.

"The first time they met, they hated each other. Then Matt Scanlon, an MLB catcher riding a self-destruction rocket to rock bottom, got traded to his rival team, the San Francisco Blaze, and comes face-to-face with Kelly Maxwell in a professional capacity. Maxwell is the publicist for the Blaze.Second impressions - for both of them - were no better than the first.All Matt wants is to be left alone while he tries to pull his life back together after a long, painful year of bad decisions and worse actions. He refuses to talk to the media vultures clamoring for an interview, no matter how intently Kelly badgers him. If pushing her buttons and being an ass keeps her off his back about it, well, that's not exactly a hardship. Especially when it hits him that Kelly Maxwell, professional ball buster, is pretty damn gorgeous when she's riled.He's the bane of her existence. The insufferable, boorish jackass is making her job hell. Kelly doesn't know why Matt suddenly went from being the golden boy of baseball to a self-made pariah, nor does she care. She's stuck with him for now, so she'll do whatever it takes to get him to tow the publicity line. And if it just so happens that doing her job forces her to get in that shockingly handsome face of his at every turn, well, maybe that isn't so bad after all.Matt never expected that sparring with the fiery Kelly would become the highlight of his day. He's not sure what that means, exactly, but he knows one thing. If he can't convince her that he's sorry for their past and he's genuine in his interest in her, she'll toss him out of the game before he can even make it to the plate.~*~I like sports romance and I love the enemies-to-lovers trope, so I have to admit, I was predisposed to enjoying the heck out of this sexy, fun little reading treat, but Packard really went above and beyond for her readers with this one. Not only were the characters fairly awesome, especially the tomboyish, foul-mouthed (though she's working on that) Kelly, but the plot had enough meat on its bones to satisfy even the pickiest reader.Baseball isn't really my thing as a sport (I'm a football fangirl), and I don't know much about it, but even my untrained eye was impressed by the authentic-feeling touches Packard put into the story. There wasn't a huge baseball element (a fact I appreciated), but what was there felt very much like it was written by someone who not only understands the sport more than I do but likes it. That was a particularly nice touch and, oddly enough, fairly rare in the sports romances I've read.Kelly and Matt had a nice bit of depth as characters, too. Kelly, who deals daily with the harsh realities of surviving an eating disorder, isn't your typical romance heroine in form or function, and I liked that about her. Matt, probably the more stereotypical of the two of them, didn't make any better a first (or second) impression on me than he did on Kelly, but allusions to the cause of a lot of his personal demons kept me from writing him off precipitously and he evolved rapidly enough after that to win me over.That was a good thing, because he had a lot of evolving to do. I've rarely read an enemies-to-lovers themed romance in which the ""enemies"" part of the plot was so completely justified. If any man ever spoke to me the way that Matt spoke to Kelly on their first meeting, I don't know that I would've been as violence-free as she was. Kudos to Kelly for her ability to handle him with a vicious verbal volley that reverberated long after their initial encounter.And kudos to Packard for divulging that scene when she did, because if it had come at the beginning of the book, I can't say I would have continued the story long enough for Matt to redeem himself.My only disappointment with the read came, unfortunately, at the end of the book. The relationship conflict was predictable, obvious, and cliched, and the resolution was downright unsatisfying. After such a great buildup, with a slowly evolving romance and a positively wicked amount of sexual chemistry between Kelly and Matt, the end felt more like a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am and it left me a little agog. A few dangling secondary plot threads lent it an unfinished feel, too, which didn't help matters.I could have handled the lack of satisfactory resolution on those plot threads, because there was setup in this book for another story in that world (though nothing I could find about this being a series, despite the character connections to Packard's debut novel, Love in the Afternoon), but the romance resolution left a mark. Just about everything that preceded it, though, was great - some was even more than great. It was certainly enough to make me a fan of both the book and of Packard's writing, if not the sport of baseball (nobody is that good).Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley.

"With an inheritance of 100,000 pounds, being politely boorish and kindly offensive enough to ward off the interest of titled men seeking a fortune in a wife is exceptionally hard work for Miss Jane Fairfield. It's a desperate balance on a tightrope over the chasm that is the indentured servitude of marriage. Until her sister reaches her majority, however, it is Jane's reality. She will do anything, be anything she needs to be to save her sister. Even make herself a laughingstock. A punchline. A blight.As plans go, hers is working quite well until the day she is introduced to Mr. Oliver Marshall. No matter how gauche her gown or how rude her behavior, Mr. Marshall obstinately refuses to be anything but gracious to her. Even amused at her most reliable devilish tricks.Well...that certainly won't do.Oliver only wants one thing in life: everything. Ambitious and proud, he's on the cusp of finally making his mark in the political arena. His efforts in fighting for the rights of the common man hearken to the modest origins he's worked so hard to rise above. The one thing he doesn't need in his life is a woman like Miss Fairfield, no matter how clearly he sees through her ruse and how enchanting he finds her. She's everything that would close and lock the doors he desperately needs to be opened, and certainly the very last woman on the planet he'd marry. Friendship, at least, he can do, and given the pool of sharks she's swimming with, she definitely needs one.Even if he happens to be one of those sharks. And is desperate to take a bite of her.~*~I loved this book.Jane and Oliver were wonderfully unconventional characters, and that lack of convention fell neatly along my preferences for the genre. Jane is intelligent, cunning, and strong, and about as far removed from a proper society debutante as a character can be, willfully and knowingly being brash and socially inept...while staying within the bounds just enough to keep her uncle from intervening. Some of the most entertaining moments were seeing her pit her skills against the deadly polite and back-biting scions of high society, where backhanded compliments are an art form.That her efforts took a toll on her made her sympathetic, that she did it anyway because of her love for her sister made her a hero. I adored her. She was a brilliant balance of flagrant self-possession and shadowed pain, of casual confidence and weary insecurity. She knew herself so well she was able to make a weapon of her inadequacies, to make lemonade out of the lemons her life has given her.Oliver was a bit of an odd duck himself, and I loved him despite...or maybe because...he was really the antithesis of heroic throughout most of the book. Where Jane was a quintessential nonconformist, Oliver has survived by having conformity beaten into him to the point where he doesn't even realize he's no longer the man of integrity he has believed himself to be. He is his ambition, and some of the things he does, or debates doing, for that ambition were definitely less than heroic.For all that, though, he still has a conscience, and Jane first pricks it, then sets it ablaze the longer they are acquainted. She is everything he once was and is no longer, and he's parched for her thirst-quenching presence. The effect they have on each other is fantastic and deliciously ominous as the conflict between their opposing goals reached its climax. It was very compelling.The whole story was compelling, and wonderfully rich in plot and character. Secondary and ancillary characters were vibrant and real and regardless of how short their time on the page, they left their mark. There was even a nice secondary romance featuring Jane's sister that was fraught with emotion and complexity, and plot threads surrounding Oliver's colorful family that rounded out the book nicely. I was especially enamored with Oliver's aunt. She had a brief role, but it packed one hell of a punch.Truly, this one is the whole package. Great characters with faults and foibles easy to embrace (or loathe, as the story dictates), a wildly satisfying and emotional romance, and a plot with wonderful diversity and depth to weave it all together. It pulled me in from the start, gripped my heart hard, and refused to let go until the last page was read. My Happy Reader buttons were flashing in contented bliss when it was all over.One might even go so far as to say I was tickled fuchsine by the whole thing.And okay, it taught me a valuable lesson. I won't wait so long to pick up another Milan book next time, especially if we're going to see what's going on with Oliver's cousin Sebastian in the next book in this series. There's story there. I want it.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by the author via NetGalley.

"SHE FLED TO THE END OF THE EARTH...When she was a child, Shay Morgan survived the sort of brutality that leaves the deepest scars and the most terrorizing nightmares. To protect herself, she stays off the grid, living in Earth's End, Alaska. She has few true friends and the one man she loved dumped her because she could never open up to him, no matter how much she wanted to. Her life is a lie told to perpetual strangers, the truth too shattering to ever be revealed.Two weeks after a serious car accident, Shay has finally recovered enough to start to getting back to her life, but a trip to a friend's bookstore brings her face to face with her ex-boyfriend Elliot Winter. On its own, their conversation has the power to leave her hurting and shaken, but it's what she sees on the bookshelf beside the man that rocks her to her core. A signed copy of the latest thriller by author Shane Neil.The problem with that seemingly innocuous discovery is twofold. Shane Neil is a very carefully guarded secret of Shay's. The name is her nom de plume. But she sure as hell didn't sign any of her new books...for that bookstore or any other....IT WASN'T FAR ENOUGH.The closer Shay looks into the mystery of who signed the books she authored, the more troubling her life becomes. Facebook, Twitter, and online outlets everywhere have been impacted by this impostor in a detailed and disturbing case of identity theft that threatens to expose Shay to the very man she's been hiding from her entire adult life even as it targets Elliot, the man she still loves. But when identity theft turns out to be the very least of the perpetrator's crimes, Shay may no longer have the luxury of worrying about her past. Her present has become deadly enough.~*~One of my favorite things about Shiloh Walker's books is her gift for creating truly damaged characters who have been through hell and are flawed and/or broken as a result, who are then, through the plot of the book, put through more hell before they get a chance at redemption or happiness. That gift is sometimes a double-edged sword, though, because occasionally her characters have gone through so much and are going through so much more that I can sometimes find the journey from Point A to Point HEA a little too dark and depressing, or the level of damage a character has is so severe that it makes it hard to relate to them and really embrace them in their full role.That was the case for me in this book.I struggled quite a lot with Shay as the main character. I loved the concept of the story, and could understand and sympathize with why she is where she is geographically as well as emotionally at the start of the book, but somewhere around the middle it started to really drag me down. I couldn't quite connect with the story or the romance because of just how much Shay was going through and how deeply damaged she was.I liked Elliot, and I thought the story was scary for just how easy it was for the Big Bad to infiltrate Shay's life and completely take it over. She had worked so hard to hide that she managed to create the perfect opportunity to be victimized yet again. Given the proliferation of social media in our daily lives, it's eerily easy to imagine everything that the Big Bad was able to do. That's actually a little terrifying.It didn't create a good foundation for the romance for me, though, and I need to be on board with both the romantic elements and the suspense elements for a romantic suspense novel to really work for me. I just think Shay needed some serious therapy and as good as Elliot was to her (eventually) and for her, I don't think he was enough to truly heal the sort of wounds Shay has.None of that makes this a bad book. Walker writes extremely good suspense and very hot romance, and the combination of the two couldn't possibly be bad, as far as I'm concerned. It just wasn't quite something I could fully connect to and enjoy, either. Walker's Ash Trilogy worked much better for me in that regard.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Ballantine Books publisher Random House Publishing Group via NetGalley.

"~* 1.5 Stars *~Peyton Lockhart was six years old when she met Finn MacBain. She was dying at the time. Though he was only fourteen, he dove into the pool in which she was drowning and pulled her out, then gave her CPR to get her breathing again. She owes him her life, and for every one of the birthdays she's had since that fateful day, she's thanked him for it.Now all grown up and working on making a career in the food industry, Peyton lands herself a job at a prestigious foodie magazine. Unfortunately that job puts her in the crosshairs of a sexual predator. Her boss. When efforts to handle the issue within the company prove fruitless, Peyton takes control of her own fate and gets out.She doesn't get far before it becomes clear that she's in a lot more danger than she realized. Her boss has no intention of letting her go and risk ruining his power-grabbing plans for the future. He wants her dead. And he's got the power and money to make it so.It's been years since Finn has actually laid eyes on Peyton, and seeing her again at his brother's wedding knocks him for a loop. She's definitely grown up, and she's incredibly beautiful with it. Since the night he saved her life, Finn has achieved much. He's won Olympic gold medals, earned a law degree. He's even become a decorated FBI agent. Through all of it he's never been as affected by anything as he is by Peyton Lockhart's smile when she walks up to him before the wedding.Or by her request to do what he has done once before: save her life.~*~This installment of Garwood's long-running Buchanan-Renard series had a few cute moments and a few nice scenes, but for me, they were way too few and far between. There were several times throughout the book, especially in the middle, when I got so frustrated with the manner in which the story is told I seriously contemplated putting it down and not finishing it. I ended up persevering, but I'm not actually sure if that's a good thing or not.I'm leaning towards not.It started so well, which was one of the reasons I slogged through it to the end. I loved the beginning. The prologue caught my attention and sucked me in. I enjoyed meeting the young Finn, his beleaguered parents, and his audacious brothers. I loved the scene where Finn saves Peyton, and the subsequent scene in which Peyton's parents go to Finn's parents to tell them what happened was awesome.The narrative of the prologue was fast-paced and the storyline concise, but with just enough detail to flesh out the backstory and give some surface definition to the characters. I thought it was the perfect execution of a short prologue. Things started to go bad for me relatively quickly after that, though, when the book switched over to a present timeline and started to introduce the plot arc of Peyton's trouble with her boss.The narrative style which worked so well for the prologue was far less successful throughout the rest of the book. Plot points and story elements continued to breeze by at a break-neck pace, lacking depth or anything resembling detail. Occasionally the story would jerk to a stop and toss some more badness Peyton's way, but then it raced off again, twisting and turning along a path that was laden with superfluous silliness and downright odd developments.Honestly, throughout most of the book I just felt like I was being pummeled by a chaotic mess of wildly divergent, often random plot threads and heavy-handed attempts to instill a lighter tone to the external conflicts and the relationship arc. The concept of the plot was solid, the beginning impressed me, but man, the execution throughout the rest of it drove me crazy.When things go that bad for me during a book, I try to focus on other elements, but even the characters made me struggle. I like Finn well enough, I suppose. He wasn't exactly a well-rounded character, but he wasn't bad. Peyton's inconsistency bugged me. Her character wobbled and tottered back and forth between displaying an appalling lack of intelligence and wisdom to being decisive and competent or playful and witty.Plus, she was a virgin before Finn got a hold of her, which rarely appeals to me in this genre. And there was no good reason given for such a stunningly beautiful (according to the male contingent in the book), supposedly intelligent, world-traveled young woman to still be a virgin at that point of her life beyond providing Finn a pristine landscape to plunder.A couple of the secondary characters provided some color to the story, and I even liked one or two of them, but none of them had any more depth or detail than anything else in the story. In fact, Peyton's sister Lucy was such a painful caricature of a shrieking harpy whenever faced with the minutest amount of stress that I loathed her intensely. I won't even get started on the wing nut of a cousin, whose behavior went past absurd to beyond the pale.Despite the great start and the potential in the story concept, too much about this book either didn't work for me or ticked me off. There were brighter glimmers here and there, even a few passages that made me smile, but overall, I just ended up thinking Hotshot was one hot mess.The Cute Moments:""You might need to stay another night.""""No, I won't stay. People die in hospitals. They check in just fine, and - wham - they get some horrible disease and die.""Finn was trying not to smile. ""If they're just fine, why would they check into a hospital?""He was being logical, and she was having none of it. She wanted to go home. ""It happens,"" she insisted.""I'm here because you need me."" It was an outrageously arrogant thing to say, and he knew it was going to rile her, but he didn't care how upset she became. She did need him.""I do not need you. I'm a capable adult, and I can take care of myself.""""Where's your car?""""You know it blew up. I just told you.""""And where are you now?""""In the hospital, but--""""So, taking care of yourself... How's that working out for you?""""You have to set a trap,"" Peyton told them.Both men looked at her, and Finn asked, ""What do you have in mind?""""I don't know. That's your area of expertise. I'm a chef. If you catch him, I'll make you a souffl.""~*~*~*~Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Dutton Adult publisher Penguin Group via NetGalley.

"~* 3.5 Stars *~Out of everything in the world she could possible have, all Tara Collins wants is one thing: a normal life. A normal life that doesn't include twenty-two years of living a lonely, secluded existence with a sheltering, secretive aunt. A normal life to be found beyond the borders of a small town in the middle of Nowhere, England, one that includes friends, a formal education at an actual university, and breaking every single rule her aunt had drilled into her head as she was raising her.To have that normal life, Tara has to first find out exactly who she is, but for that she needs professional help. Five minutes after meeting private investigator Christian Roth, Tara has no doubt he can help her find the truth about her identity. She's less certain, however, that she can afford the answers.From the moment Christian catches the tantalizing scent of Tara Collins he wants her. In over five hundred years as a vampire, he's never smelled anything quite like her, certainly not anything human. And if nothing else, his senses tell him Tara is very human.Of course, that begs the question of why demons are trying to kill her.Delving into her murky and suspect past, Christian is forced to face one grim fact. It's no longer who she is that matters. It's what she is. Unfortunately, the answer to that puzzle will definitely kiss goodbye any hopes of her having a normal life. Right before it kills her.~*~Even after giving it some thought, I'm not totally sure how I feel about this book. On one hand, it's old school vampire romance, which I've always enjoyed. On the other, the plot was predictable to the extreme and neither the world, the characters, nor the narrative itself had much in the way of depth or detail. I even found the dialogue painfully pedestrian in places.As far as the story goes, it wasn't bad, it just didn't bring anything new to the table, and while the characters had their moments, there were also several times I could have cheerfully throttled both of them. By the halfway mark, if Tara complained one more time about wanting a normal life, I would have been thrilled had Piers just eaten her and been done with it.Still, I managed to like them well enough, and I was particularly fond of how Croft keeps her vamps from being paragons of virtue. They're not evil exactly, but they're sure not fluffy bunnies, either. They fit comfortably into that gray area where I find the most interesting characters in fiction. With more detail and definition, they could have been really spectacular.Despite my annoyance with Tara's perpetual insistence on a normal life, she was my favorite of the two main characters. She had a nifty habit of being pointedly sarcastic, irreverent, and dismissive of danger. It didn't always balance out the moments when she came off as an insipid victim, but there was enough there to keep me interested in what happened to her. Christian was a fairly typical alpha male, but his tendency to make decisions based on his opinion of Tara's best interests is a hot button of mine and kept me from really embracing him as a romantic lead.One of the more frustrating aspects of the read was the unrealized potential. The secondary characters were interesting and diverse, but without really having anything to do besides stand around and glower, or pop in and out when the action was low, they didn't get a chance to really add much to the read. The predictable plot could still have been fully entertaining if the climax hadn't been so abrupt and anticlimactic and the resolution so odd. The romance could have been hot and sexy and completely satisfying if the main characters had a bit more to say to each other that went beyond the surface.Too many COULD HAVE BEENS and not enough WAS was my biggest problem, and it kept me from fully enjoying the read. There was absolutely nothing that was so egregious that I was totally turned off, but neither was their anything specific that wowed me. I was mostly entertained, and the book was a lot of fun at times. Just not quite often enough.QUOTABLES:""I love you,"" he said, and she went still at his words.

"Danny Van Doren sees dead people. In fact, that's all he sees. Blind since the accident that stole his sight, his lover, and his career, the writer has been working with Phoenix PD, helping them solve the cases of the spirits he sees.Unfortunately that help has drawn a lot of attention from media types who want to neatly label him as a charlatan or a fraud. It's making Danny popular for all the wrong reasons and in all the wrong ways.Ghostwriter Logan Riley works for a publisher who wants Danny's story, and they're willing to pay Danny a lot of money to let Logan hang around and write it. What Logan doesn't tell the man is that his publisher prefers when he digs up the most scandalous and salacious bits of interesting people's lives and puts all the gritty details in print.Some might - and have - said that makes Logan no better than a pack of paparazzo, but Logan doesn't care about the sensationalism of his subjects' lives. He just cares about finding the truth. Truths like whether or not the seemingly earnest Danny is a con man or just mentally ill.Because Logan knows he doesn't really see spirits. They don't exist.And he's steadfast on that stance right up until a pissed off poltergeist decides he's getting a little too cozy with the handsome ghost detective.~*~There's something intrinsically appealing to me about heroes or heroines who manage their lives despite having a disability of some sort, so the idea of a blind guy who sees ghosts and helps the cops find the monsters responsible for them sold me on trying this book. I'm glad I did. Well-written and fast-paced, flavored with spooky ghost activity and two hot guys who were totally into each other, this was a great read. I especially appreciated the nice touches in keeping Danny's blindness realistic and believable while still providing a balanced, descriptive narrative.The depth of character in both male leads and a solid and nicely layered plot kept me entertained as it provided a few touches of horror, some chills and thrills, and some temperature raising sex scenes. I liked both Logan and Danny. They had genuine chemistry that hit fast and burned deep. Each has inner demons that impacted the evolving relationship as the story progressed, creating realistic, organic conflict and romantic tension.I wasn't expecting the level of detail and complexity provided in the main characters' backstory. It built slowly, with little bits and pieces of their past disclosed as it pertained to the growing external conflict with the freaky-deaky poltergeist. And there were a couple of secondary characters I really enjoyed. There was even a very subtle secondary romance thread between Danny's sister and her ex-husband that tickled me. All of these elements worked together to create a balanced, well-rounded story.The romance arc was the only thing that caused me some problems. As much as I enjoyed Danny and Logan together, the timeline of the story was short, with everything happening over a handful of days, so I had some problems with how quickly they became as important to each other as they were. It was the only thing about the read that didn't work for me, and unfortunately, it hampered my appreciation of what was supposed to be a sweeping romantic scene towards the end of the book.It ended up coming off as cheesy to me instead of romantic.I loved the epilogue, though. It was set long enough into the future that the issue I had with the romance arc was resolved and the strength of Danny and Logan's commitment to each other was sweet and endearing. As a whole, I felt this was a meaty, entertaining novel that fully engaged and entertained me, even with my issues with the romance arc. I look forward to reading more from Hunter Raines in the future.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley.

"Lauded researcher Steven Campbell is off his game. Way off. Normally as suave and charming with women as he is with research sponsors and financiers, he blames a brutal schedule and work overload for his lack of interest in...well...pretty much everything he normally enjoys - including sex. Or he does until a mental image of Connor, his best friend and research partner, pushes Steven over the edge into an intense climax during a bit of self love.As if the angst about his sexuality at this point of his life isn't enough, Conner certainly isn't available. He's happily committed to someone else. Steven's journey of self discovery is going to be a painfully difficult and lonely one.Then a chance meeting with a male escort changes everything, and Steven learns that it's never too late to find peace and happiness within himself.~*~This wasn't the story I was expecting. It's not what I would consider a romance, first of all, and it's so short that there isn't a lot of room for a satisfying, self-contained story arc. What's there is well written, but it's just not my cuppa for reading entertainment.I hate to say it, but I was not at all fond of Steven in the beginning. He was shallow and self-involved, and didn't have much to recommend him as a decent human being. It's a testament to Grant's writing ability that by the end I was actually sympathizing with him. Not liking him, per se, but definitely feeling for what he was going through.I do consider this short novella quality M/M fiction, and a short but solid evolution of a flawed character into self awareness and acceptance. It may not have been to my personal taste - I seriously disliked the male escort element and there was no romance in the read to speak of - but the writing was strong, and I admire the author's talent.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Riptide Publishing via NetGalley.

"Medium Rachel Miller is pulling double duty, serving Vancouver in her job as a member of the Order of Rescue Mediums and acting as a supernatural sensei to newbie rodach Kit Eckeles, the young man she saved from being exorcised a few weeks previously. Of course, the ORM doesn't know she has the sometimes-wraith living with her. That would definitely be awkward to explain.It's also the least of Rachel's problems, because three bodies have turned up at the Vancouver General Hospital morgue. Nothing unusual with that on the surface, but their cause of death is a problem. Each victim had their souls violently ripped out and eaten, and each were members of the supernatural community.Vancouver had a reaper on its hands, a voracious killing machine that may just be stronger than anything Rachel can throw at it. And that's if she can keep from being its next entree.~*~It makes no sense that the short novellas of this series are so damned kick-ass good, with their rich world building and well-developed tales, but Hoar has a true gift for packing a hell of a fictional punch in very small packages. This is the second in the urban fantasy novella series, and I am absolutely a total addict. I love the plot, I love the world, and I am totally wild for the characters.Despite the short length, the backstory, mythos, and plot threads are finely crafted and delivered in such a way that the story feels like it's a lot longer than it is. Hell, I've read full novels that don't have the same level of detail and complexity of world and characters, so this is a true treat.There's even a lot going on in the background, characters with their own agendas working for and against Rachel as the main plot arc of the story unfolds. That sort of sub-plotting and subtle foreshadowing is virtually unheard of in stories of this length. I wouldn't have thought it could be done quite so well if I hadn't read it myself. Plus, Rachel is a great main character, strong, independent, and capable in her job, so she makes an excellent heroine. There just isn't anything that I don't love about this story or the series.Oh. Wait. Yes, there is one thing. This second installment is it for the foreseeable future because there are only two published stories in the series, and according to the Hoar's blog, the third is a work in progress. Who knows when or even if it'll be available any time soon. What?! NO! I need more of Rachel and her ghost-kicking, rodach-teaching, Vancouver-saving life! What a total bummer it will be, not to mention waste of spectacular writing ability, if this awesome series doesn't continue soon.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley.

"Space pirate Aurelia Popkiss has issues. Then again, so does every member of her crew, so she fits right in as their fearless leader. It works for them.Finding a stowaway in with the booty of their latest haul adds a new wrinkle to their lives, though. Aurelia doesn't trust the young Kateryn, but even she couldn't guess the price her and her crew would pay by having her aboard her ship. She has a sneaking suspicion that the young woman has her own agenda. What she doesn't know is that agenda might put a permanent end to Aurelia's pirating days and to the lives of the crew that have become her family.~*~Short and fast-paced, this novella wasn't as much fun for me as I'd hoped it would be. I liked the characters and the premise of the story quite a lot. Female captain of a crew of space pirates; what's not to like? Unfortunately, there was so much going on in so few pages that the plot just ended up seeming chaotic and rushed, and the ending was pretty abrupt.The strongest part of the story for me was the characters. I really enjoyed Aurelia and her crew. I liked how they interacted, and their relationships felt very organic and real. I would've been happy to have more backstory and more time with them without the wackadoo stowaway Kateryn. I also wish the romantic elements between Aurelia and Keys had been a larger part of the story, because the little bit I got at the end just wasn't enough to make this really feel like the romance I thought it was supposed to be.There just wasn't quite enough in some areas and way too much in others for me to really like this one. It was okay, and not a bad way to spend a couple of hours reading, but ultimately I think this one will be largely forgettable.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley.

"~* 4.5 Stars *~Dedicated bad girl of the chocoholics, the three best friends who bonded over cake and a natural disaster weeks ago, waitress Amy Michaels came to Lucky Harbor to find the hope her grandmother once found there years ago. It had taken her six months, but she was finally searching for it in the mountains that surrounded the town, following a map and the notes from her grandmother's journal. Amy needed to find that hope. The peace her grandmother wrote of wouldn't be bad either.She didn't want any part of that pesky third thing. Heart. That's the one that tough girl Amy wants to keep well away from her. Anything to do with her heart. She's been burned in that area too many times.That's why she's so darn cranky when forest ranger Matt Bowers shows up to help her down from the very mountain on which she managed to get completely lost. It's not that she doesn't need his help. She so does. She just doesn't want to need it. And she definitely doesn't want him to be the one to give it to her. He's far too tempting in that damn heart department.Matt had been circling the tricky Amy ever since she blew into town. There's just something about her that tugs at him. He's been careful, though, because her attitude screams her hands-off stance towards men in general and him in particular. That doesn't mean he can't enjoy goading her a little when she's finally in a position to need his help. Matt's biggest concern, though, isn't getting her off the mountain safely. He can do that in his sleep. It's getting the woman into his arms that's proving to be the biggest challenge.But Amy Michaels may just be that one challenge that's worth risking everything to win.~*~I love this Lucky Harbor series so much, and Shalvis just keeps delivering the fun, witty, charming, sexy good reads. Her books, and this series, are even better than brain candy, they're chocolate for the heart. At Last may just be my favorite in the series to this point, and Amy and Matt are two of my favorite characters.I think the plot of this book had a little more meat on it than its predecessor, too. Or maybe I just related to it better. I was immensely entertained by Amy's search for hope, and thought the addition of Riley's character added all sorts of nifty little elements to the read as it did its work in opening Amy up a bit more and giving her and Matt another point of connection.And the depth and complexity awarded to both main characters, as well as the nearly perfect chemistry between them, just flat out worked for me in every way.The friendship between the chocoholics really started to click in this book, too, and the ancillary characters had more impact on the narrative. In a lot of ways, the friendship between the three women appeals to me even more than the relationship between the three sisters in the first three books in the series, but this is the first time I can say I felt the potential for this set of three to be even more entertaining than those.Shalvis once again secures her position as one of my go-to authors for guilt- (and calorie-) free, sexy, contemporary romance fun. There are always a few serious elements, or things that lean more towards the darker end of the spectrum to add depth and dimension to the story (Lance's cystic fibrosis still kills me), but overall her books just make me feel good as they reliably deliver their heart-warming Happily Ever Afters. This one is absolutely no exception.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Forever publisher Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group via NetGalley.

"With the obligatory year of mourning for a husband she despised now behind her, widow Daisy Ellis Craigmore finally feels free to slip the last lingering shackles of her abusive marriage. She yearns to live a little, feel a little, and experience...more than a little. That's how she finds herself in the alley beside the home of a friend, on the arm of an amorous young gentleman intent on showing her the sort of pleasure she's spent long, painful years without.Instead, Daisy finds only horror.Her friend, the host of the party she was attending, lay on the ground like a shattered doll, broken and bloody, and the...thing responsible was still bent over her. Eating. The scream that rips from her throat can do nothing to help her dead friend, but it does draw the attention of the monster that killed her.Disenfranchised with his long, lonely life, lycan Ian Randulf is running the streets of London when he first catches the scent of blood, then smells the werewolf responsible for it. Before he can process either, he's goaded into action by the screams piercing the air and the sound of flesh being torn. By the time he reaches the source it's too late. A man and woman lay savaged, but a young woman hidden beneath one of the bodies is still alive.And her scent tantalizes him in ways he hadn't felt in far too long.Getting her away from that nightmare and into his home is his only thought, but when he finds out who she is and what she saw, Ian fears that a rogue werewolf may be the least of his problems. Saving the delightful Daisy Ellis may very well end up being the very death of him. Then again, there were worse ways to go.~*~I was pretty blown away by Firelight, Callihan's first book in the Darkest London series. It was so utterly original, with a deftly-woven and unique story that captivated me. It appealed to me to such a degree that I prepared myself for the likelihood that the second book in the series wouldn't have quite the same impact, and in truth it didn't, but it did provide a hell of a good read and a couple of characters I really enjoyed.I loved Ian. In fact, I adored him. He was so deliciously burdened by his past and wounded by his present, yet he had a solid, good, and decent heart. He was even a bit of a helpless git at times, poor thing, especially when he was being disconcerted by Daisy's unpredictable nature. He was a great romantic hero.Daisy wasn't quite so universally appealing to me. I liked her, and I did love her pert attitude when dealing with Ian, but she was fairly traditional for the genre. Her character lacked a bit of the devastating charm that Ian managed so effortlessly. I did like them together, though, and the arc of their romance was very nicely done.I wasn't thrilled with the plot line of the werewolf, but that may have been more an issue of my expectations. I was so thoroughly impressed with the mythos and storyline of the first book that a second installment featuring werewolves and lycan just seemed a bit pedestrian in comparison. It wasn't bad, and without a doubt, Callihan weaves a complex and satisfying external conflict, but it lacked a bit of that wow factor.The end of the book, however, was a real problem for me. The climax and subsequent resolution had elements that just seemed a bit too convenient, and the ending depressed me. I truly wish there had been another road chosen for Daisy's character. I won't give away spoilers, but it just didn't sit well with me. Combined with the epilogue, which was also a pretty big downer, the book ended on a lower note than it began.Still, I love the Gothic tone of this world and Callihan crafts a truly authentic-feeling historical with three dimensional characters and a dark, edgy narrative. Despite the few issues I had, I still enjoyed the bulk of the read and Ian handily supplanted Archer as my favorite character of the series. I'm looking forward to the next installment.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Forever publisher Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group via NetGalley.

"Even at five, Zoey knew monsters weren't real. Sure, she was terrified when she thought she saw a monster in her closet as she lay in bed at night, but when her mom came in and opened that closet door, turned on the light, and shooed that imaginary monster right on out of there, Zoey knew that her mom was being the wonderful mother she was, humoring her and taking her fear away by being silly. Monsters aren't real. Everyone knows that.And for twenty-three years that was merely a fact of life. She grew up, lost her mother, then her father, went to college, even started up a wedding planner business with her best friend. She was a normal, if slightly fashion-challenged adult leading a normal life in the real world. Right up until the morning she wakes up to the tantalizing scent of coffee and finds her closet monster, larger than she remembers, calmly sitting at her kitchen table, drinking coffee and reading the paper. His name is Maurice.Normal pretty much flies out the window for Zoey at that point, never to be seen again.In fact, her head hasn't even stopped spinning from one massive paradigm shift when she gets a closet monster for a roommate, starts providing a halfway house for a family of brownies, has a skunk ape on security detail, and an incubus who wants to devour her in all the worst possible ways. Yeah, that last one's got her shaking in her stylishly purple Doc Martins.And as if being hunted by a sadistic sex demon intent on gobbling her up isn't bad enough, the bastard starts killing women she's been in contact with. No amount of hiding under the covers and squeezing her eyes shut is going to make this particular monster disappear. That's up to Zoey. The wedding planner empath with a heart of gold.~*~QUOTABLES:Of all the possible weapons I might have grabbed, I chose a toilet brush. The men's boxers and oversized Hello Kitty t-shirt I wore reinforced my feeling of absolute stupidity. I made a mental note to buy myself a baseball bat, should I live through the next few minutes. And maybe some grownup pajamas.~*~Best opening paragraph in a book ever! And what a great kickoff to a totally fun read. I'm so happy I tripped over this little gem, because I can't remember a time I've had such a delightfully good time reading about someone else's issues. It wasn't that it was a comedy, though it did have its moments. It was more that it was just a totally awesome cast of magical characters (both human and Hidden) with quirky foibles and immense heart, and all were just too easy to adore.Zoey was awesome. Loved her. Her narrative was a bright, engaging good time fraught with so many amusing social faux pas that I couldn't help but tumble helplessly into rabid fandom. And I loved Maurice even more. From his first words I knew I would adore him for life. To the point that I was all angsty about the potential for him going back to his estranged wife. The gargoyle who may or may not be cheating on him with a bridge troll. HA!Balancing out the warm fuzzies and all that delicious weirdness was a Big Bad with some serious teeth. There was nothing fun or easy about Sebastian. I liked that mostly because it kept this book from swaying too much towards the lighter end of urban fantasy, which is always hit or miss for me. No, this certainly isn't a dark and moody piece, but it's not fluff fantasy either. A sex demon hunting Zoey and killing women while taunting her with their deaths definitely adds the gravitas.It was a solid plotline, though not my favorite part of the book. Critically, it lacked depth and complexity and never quite seemed to become a primary plotline of the story. I found that troubling given the severity of the danger and felt it should have been more of a focus. At times it got overshadowed by other things in Zoey's wacky new life, and I'm not sure I could totally justify that, despite how much I enjoyed Zoey's wacky new life.That was really my only issue with the read, though. Had the plot threads of the external conflict melded a little better with everything else going on with Zoey, this would have been an absolute grand slam for me. It was still a completely fun, entertaining read with absolutely memorable, lovable characters. I can't wait to get my hands on the next chapter of Zoey's life and spend more time with her extended and expanding family of monsters.~*~QUOTABLES:Any day that started this rough should be ignored until it went away.~*~""There is no way in hell you're getting married in a graveyard. You'll get married in a church like a normal person. I won't have it. Getting married surrounded by dead people. What is WRONG with you?""Spider gave her mother a dramatic, condescending sigh.

"~* 3.5 Stars *~He fled his home world to avoid the marriage triad his father, the Ankylos Emporer, had arranged for him. R'kos had always known he was not like other Ankylos, but it wasn't until a recent ambassadorship that he realized how different he really is. Instead of his own kind, it is the scent of human males who stir his mate instinct. So R'kos returns to Elora Ki as soon as he can, intent on finally indulging his unlocked passions.Perfect timing.Occasional thief and trader Damien is on the run from the thugs of the drug lord he'd stolen from and he has to get off Elora Ki as soon as possible. Or, you know, sooner. Those drugs are too important to those who need it for him to fail. Just as he's about to be caught and likely killed, a robed figure comes to his rescue and offers him a chance of escape. All he has to do is trust a complete stranger.Damien isn't any bigger on trust than he is on sharing space with the large, robed man. Until the cowl of the robe is pushed aside and Damien's lust is stirred. Suddenly trusting this alien who came to his rescue is worth reconsidering. Especially if R'kos will go with him as they flee.~*~With nicely rounded out moments of cuteness and flares of sizzling heat, Damien and Ricky's romance appealed to me on a lot of levels. It's not terribly long at about 129 pages, though there are enough plot elements to keep it from feeling overly abrupt or shallow. I was pleasantly surprised by how much goes on between the two main characters in the space allowed, and how the various external conflicts are nicely spread throughout the book.None of those conflicts and plot elements had any particular depth or detail, but neither did I feel that they were being plowed through in a race to the finish line. I would have preferred one or two less elements, though, so the remaining plot threads could have been expanded and fleshed out more.I thoroughly enjoyed both characters, and some of their early scenes in which they explore each other's different physiology were amusing and highly entertaining. Burn kept the heat between them at high levels, and their chemistry worked for me, as did the arc of their romance. At least, right up until the climax of the tale.I'm not sure what it was about R'kos when he goes back to his home world, but his actions and choices seemed to contradict what I'd thought I knew about him both as a possessive alpha male and a thoughtful individual to that point. That left Damien in a vulnerable position and not surprisingly, he was confronted with some unpleasantness that I couldn't imagine Ricky, given everything that led up to it, allowing to happen.My issues with that, and with the quick resolution at the end, tarnished the read just a little, but overall this was a perfectly enjoyable short novel/long novella that had moments both sizzling and fun. I wish I'd read the first installment in the series first, but not because this one needed that setup - it doesn't. It reads just fine as a standalone. I just think I would have enjoyed the characters and their story like I did this one.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley.

"It was just a crazy dream, right? That's what Beth Brown kept telling herself, right up until she locks eyes on the three men she'd dreamed about the night before, men she saw die as they fought the hijackers of the plane getting ready to board from gate C18.Was it really a dream...or was it a premonition of death and destruction the likes of which Beth could hardly comprehend? One that showed her a man whose name she knows and whose face is as familiar to her as the back of her own hand despite never seeing him before in her life. A man who would fight violently against the carnage that was coming. And lose.Navy SEAL Lieutenant Commander Zane Winters wasn't looking forward to wasting three days of leave flying to Hawaii for a wedding, but when his gift suddenly descends on him and thrusts him into the bloody visions of the imminent deaths of his platoon buddies and traveling companions Rawls and Cosky, all thoughts of leave evaporate like so much smoke.Moments after being swamped by those disturbingly fleeting and not terribly helpful visions, he turns and meets the eyes of a woman who stirs more than just his psychic abilities. Everything in him recognizes her as the one he's been waiting for his entire life. The mate of his soul.As if seesawing from intense battle-ready concern to yearning need in five clicks or less wasn't enough, his woman is sitting at the gate of the very plane that is obviously doomed to disaster. Unless he can save the day for them both.~*~I'm not sure what I was expecting when I originally picked up this series debut by McCallan, but it certainly wasn't the slightly chaotic and weird story that I got. At times it almost seemed like the book suffered from multiple personalities, as the tone of the plot wavered between the lightly humorous, the sexy and combustible, and the cold, clinically orchestrated violent. Not to mention the dark, vile acts of unspeakable horror.There were moments that made me grin and chemistry between the main characters that made me sweat. Other moments entertained for their tense action or intriguing ingenuity and complexity of conflict. Then there was the scene that gave me a brutal kick in the gut and left me shaken and disturbed.Still, this is a paranormal-flavored, military-themed romantic suspense with an imaginative concept, solid writing, and likable characters. And as much as there were moments when I was thrown by the wildly vacillating tone, or distressed by the lack world-building and absence of a satisfying conclusion, I did enjoy the read. More, honestly, than I thought I would based on that whole soul mate thing. It is in no way a favorite plot device of mine and it's one that smacks readers in the face from the very beginning.I think McCallan was extremely smart in handling that, though, because while ber-alpha male Zane revs hot and hard as the chest-thumping, possessive male he is as soon as he sees Beth, she is having none of it. In fact, Beth considers the reality of alpha males just a half-rung of evolution above complete troglodytes at best and the idea of a romance with one laughable. She fights her attraction to Zane and dismisses his claims on her. She certainly doesn't feel the same soul mate compulsion he does.That highly amusing conflict was what saved the beginning of this book for me and kept me reading.The deeper I went into the book, the more surprising and entertaining I found it. Despite some issues, the storyline felt fresh and the writing kept me guessing with neat little touches here and there that lent an original and unique - and yes, weird, but not really in a bad way - flavor to the story. It wasn't perfect, no, and I did have one big beef with the timeline of the story and the arc of the romance within that timeline, but McCallan won me over.Taken with the well written, creative storyline and fun main characters, the things that are normally big hot buttons of mine didn't bother me so much that they prevented me from liking this read as a whole. I'm intrigued to see where the series is planning to go next, but I do admit, I'm hoping for a more consistent tone, more realistic timeline, and a more self-contained plot arc with a better conclusion.Note: This review is based on a previously-released version of this book, which may differ from the version released 9/4/2012.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BRNXW332DWPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007X4TP8O#wasThisHelpful","R3BRNXW332DWPG","A2E9HDZXQORZLA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E9HDZXQORZLA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was supposed to be over. She was supposed to have closure. In the six months since her cousin and best friend Joely Hollister had been viciously brutalized and slaughtered, and the monster responsible identified and killed, Nia Hollister was supposed to have been able to heal a little. Move on a little. Get over it...at least a little.Supposed to matters not at all when you can't get the terrified, agonized screams of your last remaining family member out of your head, even if they are imaginary.The thing is, the facts didn't quite add up, no matter how many the cops in Ash, Kentucky had shoveled at her. The timeline was...just a little off. Nothing too bad, nothing so out of whack that it couldn't have happened the way she was told it did. But definitely in a way that left Nia with a feeling of hopeless incompletion and unassuaged grief. Definitely in a way that compelled her to risk everything to find answers. To rip away the blinders and hunt for a killer she believed was not only still alive, but still hunting women.That meant returning to the small town of Ash, Kentucky. It also, apparently, meant accepting the help of the one man she thought, at one time, was responsible for Joely's death. Because once Law Reilly sees her again, he makes it clear there is no way in hell he is going to let her stir up trouble for herself without watching her back.~*~It had to be big. After three long books, the only way for this trilogy to come to a successful conclusion for me was that it had to be big. Walker did not disappoint. At least, not in the suspense and psychological thriller aspects, because man, the killer in this trilogy is one sick, twisted, horrifying monster and readers get more than a glimpse into his blood-stained, murderous mind with several chilling and disturbing scenes from his point of view - including the dehumanizing rape and murder of some of his victims.Not for the faint of heart, that.The way Walker keeps readers guessing with a couple of well-placed red herrings and slick hidden-in-plain-sight twists and turns was especially well done, though, and one of my favorite aspects of this book and the trilogy as a whole. Well, it kept me guessing anyway, as my list of potential subjects kept spinning like a terrifying Rolodex since the start. And I like being kept guessing very much.Again, Walker's gift for complex and damaged characters sets this book apart from others in the genre. Nia's pain over the loss of Joely, along with her control issues and stubbornness, gave her dimension and depth, even as it sometimes made her a little difficult to like. I have to admit, there were moments where I wanted to shake her for her frustrating behavior even as I was relating to her, knowing I wouldn't have done much different in her situation.Nia wasn't the only one who occasionally gave me fits. Law, who was a calm, rational presence in the first book but stumbled a little in the second, seemed to go overboard on the caretaking for me in this one. And I had a hard enough time accepting these two as the romantic main characters to start with, because I still hadn't gotten over the way Nia showed up at Law's with a gun she intended to use, or Law's subsequent response to that incident, in the previous book (bros before hos, man, even if your bro is your female best friend).Maybe because of that, their evolving relationship never really seemed truly organic to me, and it lacked a certain depth of emotion that could have elevated it beyond what ended up seeming a purely physical, lust-based physical attraction. Their relationship just never really clicked for me, the largest stumbling block - in fact, the only stumbling block - of this read.For romantic suspense lovers, though, this is definitely a trilogy I'd highly recommend. True, not every single element in every single book was to my personal taste. A handful of the various antagonists' (the Big Bad and lesser antagonists in each book) actions and decisions didn't work for me. The main characters, while diverse and damaged and wonderfully complex, didn't always fit together as neatly as I would have liked. When it comes to the trilogy as a whole, though, any issues I had with individual books ended up being relatively minor. And for the record, I loved the first book (a rare five-star gem), liked the second (four stars), and because of the excellent conclusion to a very dark and disturbing suspense arc and an okay, if not spectacular romance, more than liked this one (four and a quarter stars).Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Ballantine Books publisher Random House Publishing Group via NetGalley.

"1930's pre World War II and Naval Lieutenant-Commander, Owen Bradwell, freshly returned from the China station, has just been diagnosed as colour blind. A disorder apparently acquirable at a later stage of life given appropriate stimuli, and in this case, a writer's  raison d'tre for the commander having to resign his post. This leads to Bradwell becoming tied up with the secret service and Nazi spies.The language is that of a bygone time, lending a certain piquant attractiveness to the story. Somehow it colours the thrill of the chase with a different brushstroke to what we are used to. I did feel like I'd fallen into The Thirty-Nine Steps or Foyle's War. Owen Bradwell's belief in his sidelined new life is given a certain cachet. His task is dangerous yet honourable, for 'King and Country.' As Bradwell refelects, he is looking forward to the 'prospect of lending a hand in this desirable and highly patriotic task.' Today the language used would not be politically correct in terms of referencing people's antecedents.There's plenty of action, tempered by the leisurely use of punts, mysterious murders and blackmail in this 1940's thriller. Amusing and  stylish complete with the requisite evil doers, traitors, Whitehall types, and a budding romance.A NetGalley ARC","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15I1FOW4SCEID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141RDS7O#wasThisHelpful","R15I1FOW4SCEID","A11M21SEZANTV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11M21SEZANTV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This compilation of two early novels by Jane Ashford is a treat. Well crafted and engaging, you can see the Heyer influence, particularly in some of the secondary characters such as Emily Crane's mother. Both novels are succinctly written and still a pleasure to read more than 15-30 years on.First Season 1983A young widow, Lady Anabel Wyndham, joins her mother for the London season. Having married at a young age she has never experienced the social whirl and gaiety of this social event. A confirmed rake, Sir Charles Norbury is attracted by Anabel's looks and conversation. Here is no simpering chit out of the school room or jaded widow. He sweeps Anabel off her feet. Much to the disgust of her young children and the chagrin of her long time friend, Christopher Hanford. Christopher has loved her from afar and been a stalwart companion in her time of need.Christopher is determined to leave London but something is not quite right about how Anabel is with Norbury. The children take matters into their own hands bringing things to a head. Young Susan Wyndham and her cat are indeed forces to be reckoned with!Bride to be 1999Having parents who have shunned the life of the ton to pursue their own interests make for a different upbringing. Emily Crane certainly is an extraordinary young woman, quietly able to cope with more than her fair share of harrowing situations. When she rescues a handsome stranger from being killed she little knew that they would meet again in the ballrooms of London, and that their circumstances would enforce an engagement. Apart from feeling guilty about the engagement, Emily becomes concerned that the 'accidents' that continue to happen to Lord Richard Sheldon are more than that, and sets about investigating them. The engagement continues--just in order to find out what's going on! As Lord Richard and Emily continue their charade, both become aware of stronger feelings, which of course they hide from each other. Which leads to even more complications!A NetGalley ARC","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E7ZAYB4BLBQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWMC7AO#wasThisHelpful","R2E7ZAYB4BLBQS","A11M21SEZANTV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11M21SEZANTV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ursula Blanchard, illegitimate half sister to Queen Elizabeth, is once again called upon to serve Queen and country. This time the requirement is to marry for political reasons. Ursula has already buried three husbands and remarriage is not on her horizon--although it seems to be taken for granted by those arounds her, Sir Francis Walsingham being the main proponent. Ursula is already fighting off neighbours with an eye to her lands and possessions, and now the court takes a hand.The proposed alliance is with Count Gilbert Renard, the illegitimate son of King Henri II.A big question for Ursula is just how much does she have to keep giving, how many times is her life to be disrupted due to her relationship with the Queen. The dangers of childbirth for women, including Ursula and the Queen are referenced. Other issues include the problem of succession, the place of Catholics under Elizabeth's regime and the reality of courtly marriage being just one more move on the chessboard of national or international relations.Ursula's reasons for acquiescence are as complex as she is. Her complex relationship with the Queen  is the leading one.It seems that there is a French spy at court and that particular worry invades Ursula's haven, along with all the other matters. One of her servants is murdered, another disappears, and the life of an English spy in France is being threatened.Intrigue and fast action thread the pages and Ursula's pleasing life is sorely disrupted and threatened from all sides.As the plot unravels we are treated to insights into at a strong woman, wary of her position, with no illusions about her value to the court, who somehow maintains her understanding, insights and compassion.A fast paced, very human, historical mystery.A NetGalley ARC","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KIHWTH7U8RJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144FPSTO#wasThisHelpful","R1KIHWTH7U8RJ4","A11M21SEZANTV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11M21SEZANTV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok, I really enjoyed the beginnings of this space opera. A tad midshipman Honor Harrington meets a young Herris Serrano.I know the plot is somewhat familiar but that didn't lessen my enjoyment one iota.It's 2040 and war is on the horizon for those with eyes too see between two empires, the protectionist Commonwealth, a loosely democratic empire espousing free trade, and the Theocracy governed by religious fanatics whose main object is to convert the masses to their religious beliefs at any cost including of course mass death and destruction. (Nuttall's comments on social engineering were illuminating.)Katherine 'Kat' Falcone, daughter of a powerful industry magnate has fled the family trappings to carve out her own destiny as a naval officer. Kat suddenly finds herself in command of the navy's latest warship 'Lightning' having been leap frogged over others higher up the rung by her father's machinations. Her command is being sent to Cadiz, a nation recently annexed by the Commomwealth for its own protection from the Theocracy.  Before leaving Kat's father has secretly given her data about the situation at Cadiz. What she finds is chilling. The naval battalion stationed there is in virtual stand down and not at all battle ready thanks to incompetency or the deliberation of the assigned Admiral.Kat has to lead her ship, convince her officers that she's capable of command, look for a way around the Admiral to bring the stationed battalion up to scratch, and investigate the battle readiness of the Theocracy's fleet. Of course things quickly go to 'hell in a hand basket' and Kat is faced with huge command decisions that might see her drummed out of the service--if she survives.I am certainly wanting to see how things evolve and the forthcoming challenges that face Kat and her crew.A NetGalley ARC","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R153738WJ5K45Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXX5BLM#wasThisHelpful","R153738WJ5K45Z","A11M21SEZANTV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11M21SEZANTV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The greatest plague to ever bedevil mortal man, the greatest threat to his peace, the most fiendish source of undeserved humility is his sister, and spinster sisters are the worst of a bad lot"". With this opening salvo we are given a hint that Nicholas Haddonfield, Earl of Bellefonte, is stretched to the limit by actions of his sister, Nita Haddonfield. All this just as wealthy wool merchant  Tremaine St. Michael, who has called to discuss sheep, strides into the Earl's parlour.Before long we witness the dance between Tremaine, his desire for Haddonfield's sheep, the desirable Nita Haddonfield and Nicholas' loving endeavours to marry off Nita. The story line is peppered with truly delightful lines, such as when Nicholas persuades Tremaine to stay for a few days and then proceeds to remind Tremaine that he is 'an eligible bachelor, and therefore, a doomed man.'When Nicholas declares that the 'Haddonfield womenfolk are like faeries. A man falls into their clutches and life ceases to have meaning.'  Tremaine fleetingly recalls his Scottish grandfathers adage, 'avoid faeries as if your life depends on it.'Fortunately for us Tremaine doesn't heed his grandfathers advice and we are treated to a searching, searing story of love's challenge alongside discovering self worth.Nita is a determined woman with the gift of healing who cares for those under Nicholas' care. Nicholas wants more for her.Tremaine meets all those requirements but what are Lady Nita's? Nita is determined to eschew marriage so that she can continue what she says as her life's work, the care of the sick and less fortunate. How can she do that and marry?Of course there's an obligatory blackguard in the wings. His fate is both satisfying and a little surprising. Still one should never be surprised by the way Burrowes works her lyrical narrative magic.One last mention. I was not disappointed. The 'foot' once again becomes an endearing romantic opportunity. When Tremaine helps Nita off with her woollen stockings, the tenderness of the action with its sensual overtones is a delight. Thank you Ms. Burrowes!Tremaine and Nita's story is both consummately challenging and exquisitely satisfying.

"I so love the Wherlocke stories. This offering of Sir Bened Vaughn and Lady Primrose Wootten's tale of travail is no disappointment.We originally met Bened Vaughin in the first book of the series, 'If He's Wicked', then later his skills as a tracker are mentioned several times in 'If He's Wild.'So now this gorgeously protective man has his own story and he finds himself drawn willy nilly into the mystery surrounding the vibrant Primrose. In search of her brother Simeon, pursued by ruffians employed by her wicked aunt Primrose has only her wiles and now Bened to stand between herself and disaster.Bened is drawn to Primrose, first seen waving a pistol at him. Their race to find Simeon is dangerous and exhilarating and charged with the tensions of the attraction they feel towards each other. Along the way, Primrose confronts repressed memories, hidden pages from her childhood, uncomfortable and telling. The bond that grows between Bened and Primrose is tested in more ways than one. Not the least of those being as Lilybet so succinctly puts it 'male idiocy.'A taut and exciting entry into the Wherlocke family annals.A NetGalley ARC","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C8ZEUOW3HTW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P53BXNK#wasThisHelpful","R1C8ZEUOW3HTW8","A11M21SEZANTV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11M21SEZANTV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sybil is attending her friend Margaret's wedding when she encounters the groom's best friend, Liam MacBride. Sybil didn't go through four London seasons looking for the right man in a ballroom, and certainly didn't intend to discover him in a Scottish castle.Liam's mother has been harassing him with marriageable females to marry and get an heir for the clan, but her plans definitely do not include a hated sassenach.But then the furthest thing from Sybil's mind had been the undeniable attraction that sparks between herself and the dangerously attractive Laird.When Sybil consents to a visit to the MacBride holdings, the sparks of romance fan into a raging forest fire of desire, yet Liam and Sybil's relationship seems doomed to be doused by the cold water of hatred Liam's mother holds for the dreaded English.A NetGalley ARC","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B8R44TR4UXJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7USAE2#wasThisHelpful","R3B8R44TR4UXJG","A11M21SEZANTV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11M21SEZANTV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Missing children along the River Thames, a daughter trapped inside the tower with an unaccounted for past and tales to explain why she must never leave the tower. Moss, the Executioner's daughter is on the verge of an awful truth.Stolen moments lead to outside the tower through a hidden way, stolen boots lead towards a new and unlikely friend.What is the mystery of the Witch of the Rivers and what does Moss have to do with her?Set against the backdrop of the Tower of London, Hardstaff weaves a story that gathers together, in the language of legends, a world bordering the reality of those who live outside the tower. A world where reality, superstition and witches meet on the eve of Anne Boleyn's downward path from Queen to traitor. A place where children are warned against being taken by the Riverwitch into the depths of the Thames.Moss's meeting with Anne is a lovely vignette of the doomed Anne whose flame might be fluttering but whose determination and character is very evident.Moss was born and saved from drowning by the Riverwitch, who in giving her back declared that she would come for Moss in twelve years. Moss it seems is bound by that utterance. She is haunted by the apparition of the Riverwitch glimpsed beneath the icy Thames. Only she can in the end calm the ravages of the Riverwitch.Hardstaff's  language is strongly evocative. I felt the terror of the beheadings, the dank sliminess of the tunnel under the tower, the icy coldness of the river edges in winter, and the insidiousness of the faceless figure that nearly catches Moss.A fascinating read portraying the Tudor times from a different perspective.A NetGalley ARC","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFI1X7KZYIB2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRZURCM#wasThisHelpful","RFI1X7KZYIB2F","A11M21SEZANTV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11M21SEZANTV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ramon de Segrave newly appointed Baron by King Richard is sent by his king to the marshes bordering Wales. He is to marry the widowed Isabel of Camoys, the Lady of Thistle Keep.Isobel is anything but gracious about the plans others have for her. Strong wills clash igniting the fires that lie below the calm surface of the Lady of the Keep and her robust Knight.Having been given in marriage before against her will Isabel is reluctant to give up her independence. Richard has taken her garrison to the Holy Lands. Now she is defenceless, except for Ramon. Then there's her husband's dastardly brother Jaques Raeburn who wants the family lands back, at any cost. King Richard plays a part here. Richard's need for monies for his crusades has allowed Jacques to be elevated to a baron. (Ramon reflects somewhat sourly on the fact that he earned his baron status alongside Richard in war whilst Jacques bought his.)Whilst Isobel may be able to protect her lands and people by agreeing to Ramon's terms, can she protect her heart? Certainly Isobel is faced with her own sensuality, something that has lain hidden until now.Mary Wine gives us a fascinating look into practices in these Medieval times and the role of women, particularly of the nobility. I was fascinated by Isobel's methods of collecting and protecting her geese and their feathers, essential for the arrow shafts needed by Richard, the bathing customs of the day and other little tidbits about daily life at the keep.I was also struck by the inner battle of Jacques' servant sent to spy, Donald. He has sworn before a God to carry out his Lord's orders but what to do when they conflict with his conscience? Donald's struggle highlights the strict religious aspects of feality and medieval practices.Ramon and Isobel's fate may be dictated to by a King but ultimately they decide upon it by themselves. The choice of the how's is up to them, with a little help from circumstances and duty.A NetGalley ARC","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NCSEE4TOQT21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFZ0BYQ#wasThisHelpful","R3NCSEE4TOQT21","A11M21SEZANTV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11M21SEZANTV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A truly poetic reflection of life, love, marriage and it's challenges.Poetic in descriptions of Nevada, in the many aspects of the interaction between the women portrayed and their situations, and Callie's interaction with the mustangs.At first I wondered what I had wandered into. The more I read, the more I became immersed in the changing stories of a younger Nash, Callie McBride her niece and then Nash as the elderly quixotic ranch owner. Not just any ranch, but a divorce ranch of the 50's. This was fascinating stuff!Callie's call from her mother to investigate what's going on with her Aunt Nash becomes the catalyst for Callie's leaving of her husband. At the ranch Callie comes face to face with what has been happening or not, in her married life.And then there's the mustangs! Callie may have wanted to capture them on camera, Canetti certainly captured them with words. The symbolic hues of the mustangs are many throughout this interesting story.I loved this description of them, a description that segues into other happenings.'...their eyes were manic and their tales stringy. They were an entire street corner of scary men shouting that the end of the world was coming. They were beautiful and dirty, alluring and repelling, a reminder that nothing is ever one thing, as much as you wish it.'The connection between Callie and Kit, the Forest Protection Officer is a beautiful momentary thing, a growth experience, a meeting of souls if you will. Two people crossing paths at significant moments.The novel is chock full of wonderful reflections on life and wants and the journey of marriage.

"Lady Imogene Saunter is a young woman entering her first season. Little does she envisage that she'll will become involves with two dissolute rakes. The Duke of Blackbern and the Marquess of Norgrave place bets against each other over everything including who will be the first to seduce Imogen.  Both men are licentious members of the ton. Norgrave,  is a twisted nefarious blackguard whose does little to keep his towering rages or his sadism control. Blackbern is as much a cad, except he falls in love with Imogene, who's a starry- eyed young thing looking for love and adventure.The rules of the time were very strict and Imogene courted disaster. Admittedly she didn't know that the Marquess of Norgrave was an outgoing sadistic knave who uses women and then throws them away. The more innocent the better.Tristan, the Duke of Blackbern falls in love with Imogene and now he has to head off Norgrave, his childhood friend and longtime companion in dissolute pursuits.However, in a rage at being 'bested' by Blackbern in their competition for Imogene's affection, Norgrave attacks Imogene, the woman he has supposedly become protective about. Brutality and rape are Norgrave's tools of seduction. Imogene confesses to Blackbern that maybe, in some twisted sense and against her will, the interaction with Norgrave was charged. Unfortunately, the idea that Imogene enjoyed the situation appears to be perpetuated here.These are two disturbing Regency knaves, contemptuous of women, who have crossed the line. They may be touted as Masters of Seduction but they are unconscionable sexual predators.Blackbern does redeem himself through his love for Imogene that transcends the treatment she has suffered at Norgrave's hands. He doesn't judge her or push her away as most would in these times in this social strata. A hard story to be comfortable with as it deals with the darker dissolute side of regency times, and of all times where predators abound.A NetGalley ARC","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MP5GNLI1ISLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6AVG28#wasThisHelpful","R1MP5GNLI1ISLG","A11M21SEZANTV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11M21SEZANTV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Good heavens, cried Virginia, as Anthony Cade explains to her the identity of the person sitting dead in her chair.  Is this [in essence, are you] Sherlock Holmes?  In a way this is apropos of this mystery. Mr. Cade seems to have all the answers to whatever one seems to throw at him but from the readers perspective nothing is at all clear in this whodunit by Agatha Christie; because it isnt just a whodunit but a whodunit and who is it that got done in!And even the people who you think you know arent themselves.  Interesting, though, they are, as Agatha Christie adds parenthetically: After all, that was what one came abroad for---to see all these peculiar things one read about in books. And yes, this is a very readable book, but when the enigma code of who is who and who did what to whom is revealed the reader is left with an open mouth, having been blindsided by just about everything that just passed by way of an explanation.Herein Colonel Melrose asks of Superintendent Battle: What do you think?To which Battle responds: I dont know what to think. And thats a very disturbing state of mind.I suppose that this mystery is a bit akin to Murder on the Orient Express, but in that story the reader is immediately encouraged to be suspicious of everyone. In the Secret of Chimneys, it is the opposite, however. And the ending of The Secret of Chimneys isnt appreciated as aha, that was interesting. Rather, it is more akin to OK, well, that was that, then. Book finished.

"This book is full of the stories of tyrants. To the Greeks, a tyrant was merely a man, good or bad, who had gained control of the government without legally inheriting it or being elected to office. But like with the case of many of these even the ones who started out benignly or even positively, eventually became corrupted by the power which they had come to exercise. That could be the theme of this walkabout through history led by the author John Van Duyn Southworth.A sub theme of this (very readable and otherwise competently written) book is that empires and other dramatic events gets one into the history books. The author herein writes much about ancient Egypt and Greece, for example, but then barely mentions them again while discussing hundreds and thousands of succeeding years in history. That is what is both good and bad about this walkabout through history. The author covers a huge amount of big events but usually has nothing to remark upon about many places otherwise. That is the perennial problem with broad works of history, is it not?But, notwithstanding the above praise, some things the author says are said rather oddly. Of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which brought an end to the Russian involvement in the First World War, the author superfluously adds that it was signed by Lenin reluctantly. Obviously, Lenin didnt relish signing away a huge chunk of territory. And after agreeing to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Stalins swallowing up the Baltic States is explained off as: Soon Stalin took other steps to protect and expand his countryand made these three little Baltic countries parts of Russia.  What kind of explanatory sentence is that? And whence Stalin helped himself to eastern Poland the author characterizes that as thus insulating Stalins borders from the Germans. Later on, he seems proud of the notion that: Today, most of the leading countries of the world respect the political and property rights of their women citizens without saying whether the USSR and China merit inclusion in such a category and if they do then what about their treatment of people in general? It is interesting to note, too, that he has not a word to say about the modern Islamic world in reference to such issues, either.And then finally, after 469 pages of empires, tyrants, mayhem and assorted historical happenings, the author 'concludes' his version of The Story of the World with just 3 simplistic sentences: History is and must be an unfinished story. It can never have a neat, conclusive happy ending, nor an unhappy ending either, unless the hydrogen bomb should write one. As of the time these words are written [the book was published in 1954], the entire question of international peace and perhaps of mans very survival hangs in the balance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QGXYB7QEMLNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006AU0I6#wasThisHelpful","R2QGXYB7QEMLNH","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Countless processed food packages triumph Less Salt 50% Lower in Salt, etc. indicating that salt now is often seen as an unsavory character. For the longest time, however, it has been lauded as a God-send; it has long been highly valued to preserve food (before the advent of refrigeration and canning) and without a generous supply of it hunter-gathers would not have been able to even consider embarking on agricultural endeavors. Tappable supplies of salt make agricultural societies and the husbanding of livestock supportable; successful production of which in turn encourages trade and trade encourages development.The author herein speaks much about the importance of fish, specifically herring and cod. Only when massive quantities of fish can be preserved is it worthwhile to consider the massive harvesting of suchand that, in turn necessitates further trade development. And trade encourages trade. It is like dominos, in some respects; not the conventional game, but the tipping of one to engineer the fall of as many further ones that can be lined up afore it.  Salt, per se, wasnt the first domino, but rather the plentiful supply of it could have been the first domino. After which the whole world in effect started to speed up! The book gives many examples of such. I will give several that I find interesting:Transportation: First great Roman road was the Via Salaria, the Salt road.Cities: Most Italian cities were founded proximate to saltworks, starting with Rome and  made Venice a huge trading, then banking, power.Politics: Salt revenues allowed the Qin dynasty in China to build the Great Wall; precipitated the French Revolution; and even helped Gandhi bring about Indian Independence.This book is not a comprehensive history of salt, but it illustrates the fact that ""The story of salt,"" actually, is the story of significant pieces of our world and this readable book makes that apparent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2693JQ45H305/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142001619#wasThisHelpful","R2693JQ45H305","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That this film was made for television is not at all apparent when experiencing it. (It was made, by the way, with support from the Irish Government.) This isn't an action film or a war film, though. There are some battle scenes, but the film is mostly about Kipling's son trying to get into the army and then the family trying to get information from the army about his whereabouts once he goes missing in action during the First World War. The hand behind the camera is consistently accomplished and you will be hard pressed to locate a false shot, camera angle, or delivered line of speech in this film that does not belong. The acting, likewise, is studied, deliberative, and sincerely moving. Daniel Radcliffe is convincing as Jack Kipling and Kipling's family is well represented by David Haig (as Rudyard Kipling) and Kim Cattrall (as Caroline Kipling) as they await any news of their son. The film ends with Daniel Haig reciting Kipling's poem:""Have you news of my boy Jack?""Not this tide.""When d'you think that he'll come back?""Not with this wind blowing, and this tide.""Has any one else had word of him?""Not this tide.For what is sunk will hardly swim,Not with this wind blowing, and this tide.""Oh, dear, what comfort can I find?""None this tide,Nor any tide,Except he did not shame his kind -Not even with that wind blowing, and that tide.Then hold your head up all the more,This tide,And every tide;Because he was the son you bore,And gave to that wind blowing and that tide.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKW8J42QHEA28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHBCYD8#wasThisHelpful","RKW8J42QHEA28","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is primarily about Saint Patrick and secondarily the men who followed in his proverbial footsteps, men such as Columcille, prince of Clan Conaill, born in Gartan on December 7th 521. His Romanized name was Columba. He established a monastery at Iona (off the coast of Scotland) with a small band of brothers. After it reached his cutoff of 150 monks he directed that ""12 and one monks would set off to establish another foundation in a new setting."" ""By the time of Columcille's death in the last days of the 6th century, sixty monastic communities had been founded in his name along the jagged inlets and mountainy heights of windswept Scotland.""These monks were great scribes, having copied many historic texts, and were rather unique, the author argues: ""In truth, the art of the scriptorium was virtually unknown in the indigenous monasteries of Italy and Gaul. Monastic manuscript art had traveled from the workshops of Syria and Egypt by way of Ireland and Britain and, at last, to the continent of Europe."" And this is the Mr. Cahill's answer to How the Irish Saved Civilization; Irish monks having saved such learned books that might have been lost to history otherwise.However, this work is much too short (at less than 200 pages of large font type) and less than a quarter of this book is concerned with the actual story of Columcille) but it is food for thought as people contemplate whether civilization now is advancing or is in danger of being lost or almost lost yet again. The author thinks that such a danger is large and concludes this work by pointing out that ""More than a billion people in our world today survive on less than $370 a year, while Americans, who constitute five percent of the world's population, purchase fifty percent of its cocaine."" By a 10 minute perusal of the internet, however, it seems that the main reason the USA consumption of cocaine seems so high is that it is one state compared to the 28 that constitute the EU. On a per capita basis the `civilized European populations' of Denmark (1.4%) and Italy (2.2%) consume almost as much cocaine, per capita, as Americans do (2.4%) according to the UN drugs report of 2011. For Spain (2.6%), England & Wales (2.5%) and Scotland (3.9%) the percentage is actually higher and the numbers for the places that this author champions herein---Northern Ireland (1.9%) and The Republic of Ireland (1.7%)---are almost as bad. Consequently, to end such a book, which is primarily about Irish monks having some hand in possibly saving some major religious texts of European Civilization, to take a swipe at the USA (which is far more religious than most European countries today) is rather odd, I think, and makes me question the author's scholarship on this topic.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R158YZRJYW04N7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385418493#wasThisHelpful","R158YZRJYW04N7","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Ken Burns documentary is about a small school in Vermont that seeks to educate boys (11-17) with language-based learning disabilities. The Gettysburg Address is employed at this school as a challenge to learn, as a means to get students to deal with public speaking, and as an idea of new beginnings. Students begin trying to memorize it at the beginning of the school year and in February the school throws a gala social function where parents come to see their children (it is primarily a boarding school, which costs $65,000 a year to attend) recite `The Address' before everyone and compete for who does it the best. Everyone who succeeds without mistakes, however, gets a school commemorative coin as a token of their development.Most of this video focuses on the students learning the vocabulary of the speech and the meaning behind it, as well as much video of their playing in the Vermont snow, paling around with one another, interacting with teachers in class and playing music.Why so employ the Gettysburg Address?  I will use the words of one student named Ian: ""When you are angry it is never good but when you have grit and perseverance, you can get through stuff a lot more. This year I'm reciting the Gettysburg and that's huge for me. It just tells people that I'm not stupid. I'm not dumb, I'm not, like, worthless. Every kid that has been bullied excessively, their life is a battlefield and every time you're shot down, you just get---you try to get right back up, but then they just keep shooting you and shooting you. When you're down for the count, either a devil cries and you're done, or the angels sing, they lift you up, they heal you. I want to go up there, I want to nail it, I want to get off, I want to shake [teacher] Stewart's hand and I want to get that coin.

"The author herein declares that ""I prefer my archeology, like my friends, to be human, fallible, and hard to explain."" But he himself has no doubts concerning the replacement of Roman-era people with Anglo Saxon invaders after the collapse of the Roman Empire; arguing that ""it goes against common sense to believe that the [archeological] changes we are witnessing here reflect the replacement of one population by another.""Moreover, ""It also patronizes the indigenous people, because it assumes that the post-Roman inhabitants of Britain would not have been capable of ""inventing"" England themselves.""  The local indigenous population deserves much more credit, he argues; that the changes in language and culture and the changes in the archaeological record of eastern and south-eastern Britain over this time was not the result of new blood, so to speak, but ""are better explained by `acculturation' than migration."" ""Acculturation,"" he adds---aided by the internet and other means, ""is the process behind, for example, the coming together of Britain and the United States today."" So, you see, it's all rather simple: The story of the `Anglo-Saxons' and their invasions is but a myth, according to Mr. Pryor, ""an essential part of England's origin myth."" And ""the changes attributed to the arrival of Anglo-Saxons were usually caused by people changing their minds, rather than their places of residence.""Well, that's food for thought, certainly, and it is intellectually stimulating to contemplate such new takes on old issues, but not meaning to patronize the inhabitants on England circa the 5th & 6th centuries I nevertheless wonder how Sussex, Middlesex and Essex (to name but a few) came to become known as such; communities (which mean) `land of the southern Saxons,' `land of the middle Saxons' and `land of the East Saxons,' bereft of a significant influx of Saxons.

"""Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp."" This quote from Robert Browning may be the theme of this work; that schools need teachers to encourage students to aspire to this. But that is obvious, is it not? But the writer of this work, a teacher who taught in the NYC public schools, illustrates herein (in this novel based on her experiences) that that is easier said then achieved.This novel is actually an assemblage of students' thoughts from a suggestion box, memoranda from school administrators (usually in double speak that shows the school's fixation of filling in reports and passing and reading directives that have nothing to do with teaching), and letters from Bea Kaufman's alter ego, a fresh teacher of English by the name of Sylvia Barrett. Often Miss Barrett is writing to her college friend Ellen about her trials in teaching: ""Congratulations on the baby's new tooth. Soon there will be another tooth and another and another, and before you know it, little Suzie will start going to school, and her troubles will just begin. Though by the time she gets into the public high school system, things will be different. At least, they keep promising that things will be different.""Many students in this high school can't put together sentences without mistakes, can't express themselves, and apparently have nothing to say anyway (or is it because the lack of the former makes the latter impossible?). The book was written in 1964, yet it just as easily could have been written last year. Think of that, a half century later and this book still rings true!Perhaps the problem is the assumption behind the theme of this book, that ""Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp."" That is an achievable goal, perhaps, if all students are at about the same level. But how can a teacher seek to increase the reach of the gifted students (or students from intellectual households who have a leg up on others) when the majority of students can't put simple sentences together nor do so without serious mistakes in grammar and an assortment of spelling mistakes? But then if the teacher focuses on such fundamentals they will lose the gifted ones to disinterestedness. How, in short, can a teacher teach to 2, 3, 4, or even 5 varying levels of students when they all populate the same classroom? That's the conundrum that this book highlights. Either a way has to be found to do that (and to recruit the teachers skilled enough to lead the way---perhaps by opening the doors to the teaching profession a bit wider?) or students need to be grouped less by chance and more by metrics that can gauge their individual levels so as to group them accordingly.  Then, perhaps, Ms. Kaufman's goal of stimulating students to reach beyond their grasps can be made more universal.

"Near the end of After the Funeral (originally entitled Funerals are Fatal) Hercule Poirot announces: ""I came here originally to solve a riddle.  The riddle is solved."" And he did it not knowing anything more than you do as a reader. That's what makes Agatha Christie so interesting, I think. Her mysteries are sometimes awfully challenging to solve, but they are possible to solve.  You don't need any scientific, medical or any particular specialized knowledge to be able to point an accusing finger at some character and be fairly confident that your suppositions will be borne out by Monsieur Poirot (or by Miss Marple) in the end.At one point in this book Poirot mentions something that someone said, but shouldn't have said. ""That was stupid of her, wasn't it?"" asked Rosamond Shane, a niece to one of the deceased characters herein.Poirot shook a forefinger at her. ""It shows you, Madame, the dangers of conversation. It is a profound belief of mine that if you can induce a person to talk to you for long enough, on any subject whatever, sooner or later they will give themselves away.""And in this book it was something one person said which could not possibly be true and once you realize that, that this person is the murderer, the explanation of the crime falls rather easily into place.  Of course, if you miss this one sentence then you will find yourself in big trouble as to who did what to whom.  Of course Poirot, unlike readers such as myself sometimes, never misses anything.Thus, near the end of this book Poirot has wrapped up everything very nicely: ""Let me, first, go over the various points which were brought to my attention by the excellent Mr. Entwhistle. First, Mr. Richard Abernethie dies suddenly. Secondly, after his funeral, his sister Cora Lansquenet says, ""He was murdered, wasn't he?"" Thirdly Mrs. Lansquenet is killed. The question is, are those three things part of a sequence?All I can tell you, the prospective reader, is yes and no, and suggest that you read this enjoyable Agatha Christie book yourself!

"If you want something for emergencies and/or desire a phrasebook to use for its written sentences/requests/words; with an intention of showing such written words to others when you need help, THEN a Rough Guide Phrasebook IS NOT FOR YOU. (In such a case consider a Berlitz or Lonely Planet phrasebook---both of those are better for worst-case emergencies such as going to a doctor, etc., but if you want to say I want 2 beers. How much is this? Do you have this in Red? Go THAT way to a taxi driver and you want to eat in a non-tourist restaurant then Rough Guide Russian will be more useful to you. (This phrasebook also includes MP3 audio to help you practice useful phrases too.)Rough Guides are structured completely different from most phrase books: The first several dozen pages give you numbers, days of the week, time, etc., and a 20 minute course in grammar. Oh no, you might be saying, but it is presented very simply. For instance it presents a handful of common verbs and their conjugations. So on one page you can see how to say ""I have,"" ""he has, ""etc. and ""I like,"" ""he/ she likes,"" etc. The rest of the book is split between, in this case, an English-Russian dictionary, a Russian-English dictionary (to show to others if need be) and a 20 page menu reader. What makes the English-Russian dictionary pages unique, though, is that most every other page (at least) has dialogue boxes relating to the most useful word(s) on that particular page. For instance, when you thumb through the book for the word ""live,"" you get the word itself, but also the phrases ""I live in..."" and ""Where do you live?"" It'll take you 10 minutes to find such a phrase in Berlitz or Lonely Planet in their ""getting to know others' section. But because Rough Guide is structured as a dictionary, with hundreds of really useful phrases highlighted in boxes within, you can access something you want to say rather swiftly...and actually deliver it just a minute or so after looking for it. Add the grammar section, where you learn useful verbs and the number section, and you can learn easily to chat with someone about where you are from, where you are going, where you have traveled thus far, what you like/liked, and so on.If still not persuaded, next time you're in a bookstore compare a Berlitz, a Lonely Planet, and a Rough Guide language phrase book side by side. Lonely Planet Russian, for example, is basically several pages of basic grammar followed by many sections of phases you won't likely ever use. For instance, the guide provides several pages each of lists of occupations, nationalities, items of stationary, colors, insects, flowers and so on. Also provided are pat phrases to employ at a hotel's front desk, at a doctor's, at the optometrist, and eating out, among other mini-sections. The book, in effect, is set up to be taken out to be used once a day, if that. It's an improvement on Berlitz phrase books, but not by much. (Berlitz simply divides their books into 10 or so color coded sections such as: ""sightseeing,"" ""relaxing,"" ""shopping,"" traveling around,"" ""money,"" ""eating out,"" etc.)So, if you just want a book for emergencies (say, breaking a leg, etc.) then Berlitz and/or Lonely Planet phrase books will serve you well...in your pocket until you are faced with such a situation, since they do have many more specific terms (like 50 different parts of the body), but if you really want to be able to say some things in Russian on a daily basis during your trip you'll be much better served by Rough Guide Russian.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CVBV3YF8383W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848367422#wasThisHelpful","R2CVBV3YF8383W","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Hepburn is playfully fun ala her role in 'How to Steal a Million' and Walter Matthau is an additional stand out, giving a superb performance ala his in 'Charlie Varick,' displaying his serious determined side of his acting talents.  This film has nothing obviously in common with 'The Great Escape,' but like that film wherein different people have their favorite character and will wait until that character's next appearance on the screen this a hard movie to change the channel on, since you want to see each succeeding scene and want to see the chase wrapped up even though you may have seen it 10 times and are thoroughly aware of how that occurs.

""They realize when it's unwise to say or do something because of the person or persons who are taking in what you say, and because of the kind of character that those people have. But as I say, Alison Wilde never thought of anyone else but herself---She was the sort of person who tells you what they've done and what they've seen and what they've felt and what they've heard. They never mention what any other people said or did. Life is kind of a one-way track---just their own progress through it. Other people seem to them just like---like wall-paper in a room.""

""No, I don't,"" said Miss Marple. She sighed. ""But it's always interesting when one doesn't see,"" she added. ""If you don't see what a thing means you must be looking at it the wrong way round, unless of course you haven't got full information.""  Chrisite's Police inspectors are seemingly always afflicted by the former and it's a challenge for the reader, as well, to try to see things the right way round; that's the whole point of reading detective stories, but it is even more true for an Agatha Christie book.In the author's own words:Cherry ""You're always surprising me,"" she said, ""The things you take an interest in.""  ""I take an interest in everything,"" said Miss Marple.Cherry: ""I mean taking up new subjects at your age.""Miss Marple shook her head. ""They aren't really new subjects. ""It's human nature I'm interested in, you know, and human nature is much the same whether it's film stars or hospital nurses or people in St Mary Mead...""So all it really takes is for one to look at things `the right way round' after having absorbed a number of lessons concerning human nature.  Miss Marple, I'd conclude consequently, epitomizes why genuine life experience is valuable, but only if one tries to consider looking at things from varying perspectives. Otherwise, getting to see things `the right way round' becomes a frustrating exercise of futility.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIPB7QY7TNKAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062073672#wasThisHelpful","RIPB7QY7TNKAG","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I'm Peter Carmody,"" said the boy to the Police inspector: ""Do you like detective stories? I do. I read them all, and I've got autographs from Dorothy Sayers and Agatha Christie and Dickson Carr and H.C. Bailey.""I can't say I agree with young Peter, though.  I don't `read them all,' speaking of detective writers. I am sure there are many other fine detective writers, but I am first and foremost an Agatha Christie fan when it comes to books in this genre. I am a bit more inclined to reach for a Poirot novel over a Marple novel, but Miss Marple's manner of speech is just so much to the point and insightful that most everything she does say (and in some works it isn't all that much) makes you stop and take notice as Agatha Christie thereby suggests that what you may have been assuming or supposing is probably all wrong.The Body in the Library is a tough nut to crack and Christie has the reader going over so many possibilities herein that Christie finally has Miss Marple say rather apologetically: ""Such curious things happen, don't they? If I were to say that this particular plan went wrong because human beings are so much more vulnerable and sensitive than anyone thinks, it wouldn't sound sensible, would it? But that's what I believe---and---""And later: ""And if you care I'll give you a hint. The trouble in this case is that everybody has been much too credulous and believing. You simply cannot afford to believe everything that people tell you. When there's anything fishy about, I never believe anyone at all! You see, I know human nature so well.""  And that's what makes Miss Marple such a talented creation and ""her novels"" a delight to read; though, when it is suggested in this novel by a character that Miss Marple is so talented that she should write detective stories Christie has her answer: ""Oh no, I'm not clever enough for that."" I suppose such is one of the few times that Agatha Christie called herself clever and talented. In the various interviews that I have heard her speak she comes off as a rather, seemingly normal, modest lady---i.e., not unlike the character of Jane Marple herself. But both ladies seem to know an awful lot about human nature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25T9VA9VE7SIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062073613#wasThisHelpful","R25T9VA9VE7SIA","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Five Little Pigs"" is an obviously simple but at the same time is a most interesting set-up for a murder mystery. As Poirot herein observes: ""One resurrects the old tunes, the old stage turns, the old costumes. One resurrects, too, the old murders."" And that's what Carla Lemarchant, the now grown-up daughter of Amyas and Caroline Crale desired to do. Carla had been sent to Canada upon the imprisonment of her mother for the murder of her father. Miss Lemarchant remained convinced, however, that her mother did not murder her father 16 years ago while Carla was just a child and shows Poirot the final letter she received from her mother, a letter in which her mother declares her innocence.Hence the title of the American edition of this book (first published in 1942) as ""Murder in Retrospect.""So Poirot sets out to find out the truth for Miss Lemarchant, but how do you reconstruct a crime so many years later with almost nothing to go on? (Note to reader: I do not identify what the truth is herein so you can continue reading here and also enjoy the book for yourself.)Agatha Christie, of course, often provides her readers with simple but fascinating methods for accomplishing this and thus has Poirot visit the five people present at the scene when the murder of painter Amyas Crale occurred. As Poirot explains herein to incredulous Police Superintendent Hale  ""I am going to visit these five people---and from each one I am going to get his or her own story.""To which the Police Superintendent answered, ""Man, you're nuts! [perhaps one of the few times Poirot has been called nuts!] None of their stories are going to agree. Don't you grasp that elementary fact?  No two people remember a thing in the same order anyway. And after all this time! Why, you'll hear five accounts of five separate murders!"" ""That, said Poirot, ""is what I am counting upon. It will be very instructive.""And by visiting each of these five individuals and then having each write out whatever each can remember of the day of the murder and comparing such recollections Poirot is able to break the case 16 years after the actual murder.The 5 parties herein (with their chapter-heading characterizations by Agatha Christie) included:Philip Blake, contented pig/ stockbroker/golfer, neighbor of the murder victim (This Little Pig Went to Market...);Meredith Blake, the more traditional and reclusive brother of Philip (This Little Pig Stayed Home);Lady Elsa Dittisham, the extremely young girl who was the painting model and love interest of married Amyas Crale at the time of the murder (This Little Pig Had Roast Beef)Poirot: ""And you are sure it will not pain you to go over those days in detail?""Elsa: ""It won't pain me at all. Things can only pain you when they are happening.""Miss Cecilia Williams, the governess in the Crale household at the time of the murder (This Little Pig Had None)Miss Williams: ""The best thing for a child, I am convinced, is to have what I should term healthy neglect on of both its parents.""Poirot: And it occurred to him that of the five people in whom he had become interested as a result of his investigations, those who might have been said to start with the fullest advantages were not those who had actually wrested the most success and happiness from life. Elsa, who might have been said to have started with all advantages---youth, beauty, riches---had done worst. She was like a flower overtaken by untimely frost---still in bud but without life. Cecilia Williams, to outward appearances, had no assets of which to boast. Nevertheless, to Poirot's eye, there was no despondency there and no sense of failure.  Miss William's life had been interesting to her---she was still interested in people and events. She had that enormous mental and moral advantage of a strict Victorian upbringing, denied to us in these days---she had done her duty in that station of life to which it had pleased God to call her, and that assurance encased her in an armor impregnable to the slings and darts of envy, discontent, and regret.  She had her memories, her small pleasures, made possible by stringent economies, and sufficient health and vigor to enable her still to be interested in life.And the final so-called Pig herein was Angela Warren, the much younger sister of Mrs. Crale, disfigured by her sister when very young (This Little Pig Cried Wee Wee Wee).As with most Christie books finding out who the actual murderer is is only a part of the pleasure of reading her books.  I find the above quoted characterizations to be extremely concise and to the point. And I love reading her sentences and especially her sentences that contain nuggets of psychological interest and/or wisdom.  Take this further example: I can understand of excuse his faults, Carla sort of says about her father and her father having many flings with other ladies while married and living with her mother.... ""He couldn't help it---he was made that way. And he was a great painter. I think that excuses a lot.""  And, in the eyes of many people, this is not an untypical judgment. Many people do excuse ""great artists"" of much that wouldn't be tolerated or excused if engaged in by quote unquote ""normal individuals.""  But the genius of Agatha Christie is that she rarely opined why people do this or something else and leaves it to her readers to gauge how true (or not) such may be and why if it is believed to be true why in fact people do this.  You needn't take such psychological asides of Dame Agatha to heart, after all, but so many of them are fascinating to contemplate that I often stop every 10 or so pages while reading a Christie work to say hmmm, that's interesting and consider if it's true or not and why it may be or no, before moving on with the story as presented by this wonderful writer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QI9RUCZA32I2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062073575#wasThisHelpful","R2QI9RUCZA32I2","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""A few paces from me---on a lawn flanked by green raspberry canes---stood a tall, slender girl in a striped pink dress with a white kerchief on her head.  Four young men clustered round her, and she was tapping them one by one on the forehead with those small grey flowers---I do not know their name, but they are well known to children: these flowers form little bags and burst loudly if you strike them against anything hard. The young men offered their foreheads so eagerly, and there was in the girl's movements (I saw her in profile) something so enchanting, that I nearly cried out with wonder and delight, and should, I suppose, at that moment, have given everything in the world to have those lovely fingers tap my forehead too. My rifle slipped to the grass; I forgot everything; my eyes devoured the graceful figure, the lovely neck, the beautiful arms, the slightly dishevelled fair hair under the white kerchief---and the half-closed, perceptive eye, the lashes, the soft cheek beneath them...""That's about all Turgenev has the main character say about that character's infatuation with the above mentioned female in this short story. Yes, the story is only about 85 pages of not fine print so there isn't a lot of meat in this book, but from a story entitled ""First Love"" I expected more about why Turgenev's character even liked the gal named Zinaida herein.  Almost the only interesting thing about this story is the following:  Turgenev wrote this story about the first love of a 16 year old young man when he was about 42. Turgenev's father died at age 42 when, what a coincidence, Turgenev himself was 16 and in this story the main character's father sort of double crosses his son's dreams. Turgenev, too, never married.  In other words, the story seems to have been written to address, in some way, the author's feelings about his father; and, I guess, this is why so little detail is given about Zinaida herein and why, after reading this work, I had no more interest in her at the end than I did when I read the words above at the beginning of the story.  If you like Turgenev already I am not going to say don't read this tiny book.  It will only take a few hours to read, after all (and you can find it online for free, by the way, too).  But for others interested in reading some fine Russian literature try something by Dostoyevsky or Tolstoy or, if familiar with those titans already, I'd suggest trying something by Bulgkov, Pasternak, or even Boris Pilnyak or Fyodor Sologub if you want to read Russian literature wherein the characters are a lot more alive and interesting to read about.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LB524G87FNO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0141034858#wasThisHelpful","R1LB524G87FNO9","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can say, hey, I loved this film and you will too and leave ""my review"" at that and collect my votes, but instead I will tell you what happens in this film (and, most likely, collect negative votes instead). This is what happens in this film: a piano owned by Holly Hunter's character is left on the beach when she arrives to be Sam Neill's wife. Why does Neill's character take much care with Holly Hunter and her daughter and her bags while totally ignoring the piano? Because the writer/director wants to show us that her mail order husband (Sam Neill) is not a caring person. He has dozens of men working for him, but leaves the piano on the beach in the surf because he can't be bothered, it seems. Neill then sells her piano to consecrate the idea the idea that he is unfeeling. Harvey Keitel's character realizes the importance of the piano to this woman and to manipulate her he trades his friend for this piano and then later offers to give it back to Holly Hunter for sexual favors (an offer which is accepted by her without words since she doesn't speak in this film, her only ""voice"" being the keys of her piano). During this we see Harvey Keitel graphically nude and Holly Hunter topless. Sam Neill, of course, gets jealous and resents ""his wife"" sleeping with his friend. Because the director/writer has not been successful in persuading the viewer that Sam Neill is such a brute of a man after 90 minutes of film she has Sam Neill, in retaliation for Hunter's adultery, attack Holly Hunter's character, graphically cutting off one of her fingers as she struggles to get out of the muck and mud of a swamp-like area. Thus it takes 90 minutes of this film to generate any sympathy for Holly Hunter's character. Add endless overcast skies (wonderfully filmed, however) and finally we see Holly Hunter's character basically choosing to go overboard from a canoe-like boat. When she does go into the water you may have more sympathy for her and be emphatically moved, or maybe not. Hunter's character herein is lifeless (some would argue that's the point of this film; nothing is said how she ""lost"" her first husband or why she has to travel around the world for a new man to take her), but because she is lifeless watching her sink in the ocean is rather anti-climatic. As I have said, if you have seen this film and liked this film my words ought not be especially relevant to you. But if you haven't and don't relish watching needlessly graphic nudity (which could easily been obscured, making no difference to the film)and needlessly graphic violence (the index finger being hacked off with a tree axe herein) then maybe this film is not for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18W13RVRHUMC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064MT1NU#wasThisHelpful","R18W13RVRHUMC8","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In North by Northwest Cary Grant thinks he knows what's up and down, but we, the viewers, don't as Grant's character rushes across states to clear his name. In Spellbound, however, Alfred Hitchcock drags us through different states of mind and we, the viewers, likewise are not sure what is up and what is down.The beginning of Spellbound takes place in a psychiatric institution as a Dr. Murchison (captivatingly played by Leo G. Carroll) yields control of the place to new blood. Thence a patient named  Mr. Garmes (played by Norman Lloyd, better known a half century later as Dr. Auschlander  in the TV drama St Elsewhere) confesses to the new director of the institution: ""You see, I'm convinced I'm not suffering from any hallucination, but that my guilt is very real. I know, Dr. Edwardes, that I killed my father.""Dr. Constance Petersen (played by Ingrid Bergman) in the presence of Garmes contradicts him speaking to Dr. Edwardes (Gregory Peck): ""Mr. Garmes fits perfectly into your chapters on the guilt complex"".Garmes:  ""I have no guilt complex. I know what I know. I killed my father and I...""Dr. Peterson: ""No, you didn't kill your father. That's a misconception that has taken hold of you.""  ""People often feel guilty over something they never did.""Later, Dr. Peterson's former professor warns her that these people are dangerous. ""We are speaking of a schizophrenic and not a Valentine.  ""We are speaking of a man,"" she responds, speaking this time of Dr. Edwardes.How Dr. Edwardes has become the patient herein is pure Hitchcock and makes Spellbound an adventure to watch, akin to North by Northwest, but this time through states of mind.

"""I want too much."" ""I hate living here. I hate living in a house that is exactly like hundreds of other houses.""  ""And, what's more, I know why I hate it; because it is all so common."" So says Kay Walsh as Queenie Gibbons to her father in ""This Happy Breed."" To which he responds: ""One of these days when you know a bit more, you will find out that there are worse things than being just ordinary and respectable and living the way you've been brought up to live."" ""We don't like doing things quickly in this country,"" Robert Newton's Frank Gibbons explains later. ""It's like gardening. Somebody once said we were a nation of gardeners. They weren't far wrong. We like planting things and watching them grow.  It suits us alright. It always will."" ""It's up to us ordinary people to keep things steady."" And that's what Mr. Newton and Celia Johnson (who plays the wife and mother herein) so effectively accomplish herein, as we watch their lives evolve in an ordinary row house in anywhere Britain between 1919 and 1939.Is there anyone there, is there anyone there? One rap for yes, 2 raps for no. So asks Margaret Rutherford's eccentric representation in Coward's ""Blithe Spirit.""  Unfortunately for Rex Harrison, somebody is there; his ex-wife, or rather her ghost.  But he instigated it himself and then has to deal with the consequences in the lively word and sentence fest that is ""Blithe Spirit,"" in large measure (like This Happy Breed) still a stage play albeit filmed for the screen.1940s wartime Britain is also represented herein, particularly when that island stood alone. That is a hard mood to capture, but ""In Which We Serve"" succeeds herein. It presents the gravity of the era (1939-1941) in which it was shot (1942) in almost real time; when Britain was hanging on precariously as the Royal Navy kept it afloat, so to speak. Showing bravery, British mettle, and presenting British resistance against Hitler's Nazism is patriotic sure, but this is a British film, made from a British perspective, made during the war. ""In which we Serve"" is consequently a film which captures an era well & for anyone who wants to understand the British perspective of that era (viscerally even) one would be well served by giving it some of your time.Self-respect and decency, or rather the fight to uphold them against the wind, against happenstance and simply time is also the subject of ""Brief Encounter."" We get Celia Johnson again, this time to battle the notions of decency and carry ""Brief Encounter"" with almost just the expressions and countenance of her face.  Sentences like this, though, also help: ""She talked and talked and talked. I wanted to strangle her. Still she meant to be kind. Isn't it awful about people meaning to be kind.""Comedy, love, romance and the stiff upper lip of the happy breed that makes Britain great and makes the British Navy what it is are all here thanks to Noel Coward. These films accomplish what so many films fail to---reflect the era in which they were made (or the era that they are supposed to represent), and far from being horribly dated, still resonate.

"Sure reading Agatha Christie is a bit of escapism; to see if you can guess the killer, solve the puzzle, but I think she's a bit better than that. Let's ask another question. Why read books at all? ""...I liked him very much. He was gentle and polite---and he knew a lot really. Things out of books, I mean."" That's one reason why we may read, but what about novels, why read those? Those are not ""books"" in the sense of learning things. OK, maybe you can fudge the category and point and include novels (at least classic novels that seem to have lessons or wisdom in them), but detective stories? It's hard to include those herein too. But, at least in Miss Christie's case, I'd make an exception here even though on the surface detective stories, mysteries don't merit inclusion in the books the likes of Dickens and Dostoyesky wrote. Sherlock Holmes and many other detective stories, I'd suggest, are a lot more escapism in the simple sense of that phrase. And while many good books have nuggets of insight and interest in them I think Agatha Christie consistently has more than several in most of her books. Man in the Brown suit: A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other people---but not one's own."" Mrs. McGinty's Dead: ""What a wonderful dispensation it is of Nature's,"" thought Hercule Poirot, ""that every man, however superficially unattractive, should be some woman's choice."" Murder of Roger Ackroyd: ""Les femmes,"" generalized Poirot, ""they are marvelous! They invent haphazard---and by miracle they are right. Not that it is that, really. Women observe subconsciously a thousand little details, without knowing that they are doing so. Their subconscious mind adds these little things together---and they call the result intuition.""Take this from Mrs. McGinty's Dead:""I don't see what you mean.""Poirot: ""Perhaps I do not see myself---not yet. One works through darkness towards light.""Poirot: ""You look forwards, not back?'Deidre: ""I don't know that I look anywhere...I mean, today's usually enough, isn't it?""Lines that these make passing international flights more bearable. That's why I like to read Christie on long flights. You read things like this and put your finger between the pages you have just read, cast a glance out the window 35,000 feet above daily life and contemplate it for a few minutes. Hmm, interesting; she is, Agatha Christie's take on things. It's not deep philosophy, but food for casual thought...if you pause long enough when reading her to savor these gems. As in travel, the journey is often more interesting than the dnouement of the trip. So, Agatha Christie is a great writer? I'm not saying that and Agatha Christie never pretended to be: ""I will confess here and now that of the two things that have excited me most in my life the first was my car: my grey bottle-nosed Morris Cowley. The second was dining with the Queen at Buckingham Palace about forty years later. Both of these happenings, you see, had something of a fairy-tale quality about them. They were things that I thought could never happen to me: to have a car of my own, and to dine with the Queen of England."" Agatha Christie, in other words, was rather ""normal."" And it was interesting to read this autobiography to see just how normal she was (even though she once did have a doctor called Stabb---how apropo). I rather just enjoy reading Christie and enjoy the way she characterizes people and life, normal life. Normal is good...as long as a person at least tries to look at things a bit differently sometimes. Agatha Christie always had a fresh way of looking at things. Too bad other ""normal"" people often have nothing to ""say.""

"If you want something for emergencies and/or desire a phrasebook to use for its written sentences/requests/words; with an intention of showing such written words to others when you need help, THEN a Rough Guide Phrasebook IS NOT FOR YOU. (In such a case consider a Berlitz or Lonely Planet phrasebook---both of those are better for worst-case emergencies such as going to a doctor, etc., but if you want to say I want 2 beers. How much is this? Do you have this in Red? Go THAT way to a taxi driver and you want to eat in a non-tourist restaurant then Rough Guide Mandarin will be more useful to you. (This phrasebook also includes MP3 audio to help you practice useful phrases too.)Rough Guides are structured completely different from most phrase books: The first several dozen pages give you numbers, days of the week, time, etc., and a 20 minute course in grammar. Oh no, you might be saying, but it is presented very simply. For instance it presents a handful of common verbs and their conjugations. So on one page you can see how to say ""I have,"" ""he has, ""etc. and ""I like,"" ""he/ she likes,"" etc.  The rest of the book is split between, in this case, an English-Mandarin dictionary, a Mandarin-English dictionary (to show to others if need be) and a 20 page menu reader. What makes the English-Mandarin dictionary pages unique, though, is that most every other page (at least) has dialogue boxes relating to the most useful word(s) on that particular page. For instance, when you thumb through the book for the word ""live,"" you get the word itself, but also the phrases ""I live in..."" and ""Where do you live?"" It'll take you 10 minutes to find such a phrase in Berlitz or Lonely Planet in their ""getting to know others' section. But because Rough Guide is structured as a dictionary, with hundreds of really useful phrases highlighted in boxes within, you can access something you want to say rather swiftly...and actually deliver it just a minute or so after looking for it. Add the grammar section, where you learn useful verbs and the number section, and you can learn easily to chat with someone about where you are from, where you are going, where you have traveled thus far, what you like/liked, and so on. Likewise, knowing have to say ""have"" makes it easily to ask whether a hotel has rooms, whether the room has a shower (after thumbing through the book for the word for shower), etc. And when the answer comes back that the hotel doesn't have it (in Mandarin this sounds like ""may- yo""), or does have it (in Mandarin this sounds like ""yo"") you can actually catch what they are saying.If still not persuaded, next time you're in a bookstore compare a Berlitz, a Lonely Planet, and a Rough Guide language phrase book side by side. Lonely Planet Mandarin, for example, is basically several pages of basic grammar followed by many sections of phases you won't likely ever use. For instance, the guide provides several pages each of lists of occupations, nationalities, items of stationary, colors, insects, flowers and so on. Also provided are pat phrases to employ at a hotel's front desk, at a doctor's, at the optometrist, and eating out, among other mini-sections. The book, in effect, is set up to be taken out to be used once a day, if that. It's an improvement on Berlitz phrase books, but not by much. (Berlitz simply divides their books into 10 or so color coded sections such as: ""sightseeing,"" ""relaxing,"" ""shopping,"" traveling around,"" ""money,"" ""eating out,"" etc.)So, if you just want a book for emergencies (say, breaking a leg, etc.) then Berlitz and/or Lonely Planet phrase books will serve you well...in your pocket until you are faced with such a situation, since they do have many more specific terms (like 50 different parts of the body), but if you really want to be able to say some things in Mandarin on a daily basis during your trip you'll be much better served by Rough Guide Mandarin. And don't miss trying spicy food (spicy sounds like ""la"" in Mandarin--lada? Is is spicy? Bu la---no, it isn't)!  If going in the summer check out pretty much anyplace, but go someplace other than Shanghai and/or Beijing, as well (if you want to see the real China). If going in the winter between December and March don't miss the crazy ice sculptures that the Northeastern city of Harbin is renowned for. PS: Chinese folk call their version of vodka ""white wine."" It is more akin to lighter fluid. Try it, but be aware that it is nothing like wine and have a beer handy and at the ready to wash it down.

"To deal with one's daily problems one has to relegate yesterday's problems to the back burner, but is that completely possible?  Stephen's father in this novel entitled `spies"" (lower case s on my copy, but upper case on images here) thinks it is.  What his son, Stephen, thinks is rather different, however, but we don't really come to know what Stephen really thinks in this book.  Yes, the whole novel is Stephen's story and he's telling it, but he's doing so from 50 years on and he's not sure himself what he actually thought about things as they happened during the eventful doings covered by this book.If there is a point to this book it is that, as Stephen waxes, that ""just by looking at things I shouldn't have looked at, I've changed them.""  But that can't be the point of this book; not to look at such things; or can it?  Actually, I don't think that this book HAS a point so what to make of this novel I'm not really sure.  Michael Frayn's writing style isn't particularly interesting, but he does put his story together well so that by page 120 or so you've become very interested to find out the answers to all the questions that seem to baffle Stephen and his best friend Keith.  It's a bit unfortunate, however, that you have to read more than half of this book before you are at all interested in it.This book was recommended to me so I read it, but until I read maybe 60% of it I was not at all interested in anything about it. Then I became quite interested as the story's developments began to break in sometimes unforeseen ways.  Would I myself now suggest it to another?  I'm not sure. There's one protagonist character herein---let's call the person `yellow' so as not to ruin anything for you should you yourself decide to read this for yourself---whose actions don't make much sense.  And if you take out this character you no longer have any story so while developments are spun and woven in an interesting way it is only interesting if you don't question the setup presented by Mr.Frayn.Moreover, I don't think there's a really likable person in this story.  Actually, I haven't thought about this until just this moment, but on second thought I still think it's true.  Of course, such is not a requirement for a book to be likable, but notwithstanding that I don't see much reason to give Mr.Frayn another chance to entertain, captivate, and or move me in some way or another.

"Sure reading Agatha Christie is a bit of escapism; to see if you can guess the killer, solve the puzzle, but I think she's a bit better than that. Let's ask another question.  Why read books at all?  ""...I liked him very much.  He was gentle and polite---and he knew a lot really.  Things out of books, I mean.""  That's one reason why we may read, but what about novels, why read those?  Those are not ""books"" in the sense of learning things.  OK, maybe you can fudge the category and point and include novels (at least classic novels that seem to have lessons or wisdom in them), but detective stories?  It's hard to include those herein too.  But, at least in Miss Christie's case, I'd make an exception here even though on the surface detective stories, mysteries don't merit inclusion in the books the likes of Dickens and Dostoyesky wrote.  Sherlock Holmes and many other detective stories, I'd suggest, are a lot more escapism in the simple sense of that phrase.  And while many good books have nuggets of insight and interest in them I think Agatha Christie consistently has more than several in most of her books.  Man in the Brown suit: A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other people---but not one's own."" Mrs. McGinty's Dead: ""What a wonderful dispensation it is of Nature's,"" though Hercule Poirot, ""that every man, however superficially unattractive, should be some woman's choice."" Murder of Roger Ackroyd: ""Les femmes,"" generalized Poirot, ""they are marvelous! They invent haphazard---and by miracle they are right.  Not that it is that, really.  Women observe subconsciously a thousand little details, without knowing that they are doing so.  Their subconscious mind adds these little things together---and they call the result intuition.""Take this from Mrs. McGinty's Dead:""I don't see what you mean.""Poirot: ""Perhaps I do not see myself---not yet.  One works through darkness towards light.""Poirot: ""You look forwards, not back?'Deidre: ""I don't know that I look anywhere...I mean, today's usually enough, isn't it?""Lines that these make passing international flights more bearable. That's why I like to read Christie on long flights.  You read things like this and put your finger between the pages you have just read, cast a glance out the window 35,000 feet above daily life and contemplate it for a few minutes.  Hmm, interesting; she is, Agatha Christie's take on things. It's not deep philosophy, but food for casual thought...if you pause long enough when reading her to savor these gems.  As in travel, the journey is often more interesting than the dnouement of the trip.  So, Agatha Chrisite is a great writer? I'm not saying that and Agatha Christie never pretended to be: ""I will confess here and now that of the two things that have excited me most in my life the first was my car: my grey bottle-nosed Morris Cowley. The second was dining with the Queen at Buckingham Palace about forty years later.  Both of these happenings, you see, had something of a fairy-tale quality about them.  They were things that I thought could never happen to me: to have a car of my own, and to dine with the Queen of England."" Agatha Christie, in other words, was rather ""normal."" And it was interesting to read this autobiography to see just how normal she was (even though she once did have a doctor called Stabb---how apropo). I rather just enjoy reading Christie and enjoy the way she characterizes people and life, normal life. Normal is good...as long as a person at least tries to look at things a bit differently sometimes. Agatha Christie always had a fresh way of looking at things. Too bad other ""normal"" people often have nothing to ""say.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28FVKWUZH5WFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0006353282#wasThisHelpful","R28FVKWUZH5WFZ","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are new to Ballykissangel this is a fine show, but it is not the place to jump into this entertaining pastiche of small town Irish life (real or idealized). Season four is not just the fourth year of this program, but really is just the first of several attempts at trying to reinvent itself after huge cast changes. Bit players Liam & Donal who did their job well as hapless hired hands to the focal character of the show (Brian Quigley) have had their roles upped several fold during this year. Thus we see them dredge for gold balls in one of the water hazard's at Quigley's golf course. One of them mysteriously (with no explanation) becomes the guardian of a ""pet"" bear; a bear, who obviously then wreaks a bit of havoc. The eccentric uncle (making his first appearance) of this Donal character also does likewise with the town in the season's finale. New faces are also introduced. The town has a new priest (who brings his sister), a new farmer (with his teenage daughter), and the old farmer's presence is complicated by the arrival of his nephew (also a young adult who predictably catches the eye of the new gal in town). In short, a lot is new herein & it takes a bit to absorb all of it since all 5 newcomers are introduced en masse. 3 of these, incidentally, are flat-out successful in the roles and add much to providing much needed ballast after the 3rd season lost the program's 2 central characters. Father Aiden, as the new understudy to Father Mac, helps to re-center the plot and his sister provides much needed liveliness. If you pick up the show with this season, however, it'll be odd to go back to the first 3 seasons. So do partake of the initial 3 seasons (whose episodes, generally speaking, don't significantly suffer much with repeated viewings) first, then delve into and give this selection a try. (And, if you haven't seen it yet, do treat yourself to seeing the very Irish and funny film ""Waking Ned Devine"".)

Father Aidan's return, in my opinion, is crucial herein. After 3 years of Father Peter Clifford, it's welcoming to have the same local priest around for a second year running. The priest is, generally speaking, the central focus of this drama set---and filmed---in Ireland; in Avoca, in case you're in the Dublin area. It's not too far away for a glass of stout in Fitzgerald's Bar if you're driving south. Interestingly too, Don Wycherley, who plays Father Aiden is Tina Kellegher's (Niamh) real-life brother-in-law, providing an extra dose of natural emotion in this warm-hearted program.Change is represented by the arrival of a new police Guard to town, and the character is a winning one---a woman this time, going by the name of Frankie, but she's attractive and capable in the role; but also rather more of a ""tough guy"" than Guard Egan (though also likable) ever was during the first 4 years. Ambrose Egan's widow, the aforementioned Niamh (who can be seen in the fine Irish drama by the title of ""The Hanging Gale"" with the fabulous Michael Kitchen starring), is the star of this season. Tony Doyle, who plays her father Brian Quigley remains the character around whom the show really revolves; or his schemes, doings, etc. are responsible for many happenings in this series, as per the norm with previous seasons of BallyK.And also returning, fortunately, are the characters of Sean Dillon, and Orla. So there isn't much to complain about regarding season 5 (well, of course, there are some things, but not worth harping on here as they aren't that troublesome). I wish the same could be said about season 6, but unfortunately, that's when a slew of characters leave the show. So, enjoy this season all the more!

"This drama set in a small town in Ireland is less significant for its substance than for the days-gone-by nostalgia feel of it. It is a wonderfully simple program; a sort of Andy Griffith Show foundation enlivened by modernity. We see an attractive barkeep who has vague qualms with the religion into which she was born begin to respect the new priest in town as he jockeys with his older generational priest-supervisor. Through this prism we can see what we want of Ireland's more recent development. The program encourages us to take sides between the traditionalist (sometimes selfish) church of the past, and a more lively (but less absolute) version of it, as evinced by this young priest from afar who stirs up this town a bit. It's not at all a religious program, mind you; just an overly unrepresentative portrayal of idyllic Ireland in which you cannot fail to include religion. Full disclosure: I like this show, but I also have Irish blood. I say this because this really is a program which appeals to a particular sort of individual; to one who either has Irish blood and/or for those whom Ireland has some draw. Ireland has an inherent appeal to many such people from around the world. Even if you have never visited it, can you not right now visualize vast green fields and rolling hills bordered by stone walls, snugly cozy pubs filled with glasses of Guinness raised, and smiling faces? Of course, I'm exaggerating here, but you must grant that Ireland is a far more attractive place than many others, at least in a theoretical quality-of-life sort of way. It's thought of as the sort of place where stress is not as prevalent as where one finds oneself; having a bygone character to it (notwithstanding this not to be as true in actuality, but like in many other things, imagination often persists over reality). If I am making any sense to you with this, Ballykissangel may be to your liking. If you are familiar with Garrison Keillor's pubic radio show, ""A Prairie Home Companion"" (Saturdays 6pm across the USA), Ballykissangel is to Ireland what the fictional town of ""Lake Woebegone"" is to the American heartland. I recommend both. Both evince what a part of us long for (if you are a nostalgic sort of person, regardless of your age--even a 25 year old can long for previous eras) and even though such may not suit us, it does make us inclined to enjoy programs like ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and ""Ballykissangel"". I hope this review of sorts was of use to you. Cheers! P.S. If you do give this program a try and find it to your liking I'd like to let you know that the ""set"" of Ballykissangel isn't one at all; but rather is an one-street town (called Avoca) that was occasionally commandeered for filming so that you can actually travel to it! To have a drink in its pub, visit its church and so on is a somewhat surreal experience; as you walk into ""the program"", so to speak, that you have enjoyably watched from afar. Now, where else can you do something like that!

"This drama set in a small town in Ireland is less significant for its substance than for the days-gone-by nostalgia feel of it. It is a wonderfully simple program; a sort of Andy Griffith Show foundation enlivened by modernity. As the series begins we come to know an attractive pub owner who has vague qualms with the religion into which she was born. In time she begins to respect the new priest in town as he jockeys with his older generational priest-supervisor. Through this prism we can see what we want of Ireland's more recent development.

(And whether you will enjoy season six comes down to the sort of person you are; whether you relish variety or prefer the TV shows, musical artists, actresses you like to be recognizably the same over their runs, careers. The answer to that will determine whether you easily accept the loss of 3 huge cast members---one of whom passed away in real life necessitating major changes---with 3 other supporting players moving on as well---that series six tries to recover from, and thus is not especially representative of the proceeding years of this still welcoming program to watch, but at one and the same time, just not the same anymore absent the fulcrum (raison d'tre even) of the whole program.)Season four, in this sense, is not just the fourth year of this program, but really is just the first of several attempts to digest huge cast changes. Bit players Liam & Donal who did their job well as hapless hired hands to the focal character of the show (Brian Quigley) have had their roles upped several fold during this year. Thus we see them dredge for gold balls in one of the water hazard's at Quigley's golf course. One of them mysteriously (with no explanation) becomes the guardian of a ""pet"" bear; a bear, who obviously then wreaks a bit of havoc. New faces are also introduced. The town has a new priest (who brings his sister), a new farmer (with his teenage daughter), and the old farmer's presence is complicated by the arrival of his nephew (also a young adult who predictably catches the eye of the new gal in town). In short, a lot is new herein & it takes a bit to absorb all of it since all 5 newcomers are introduced en masse. 3 of these, incidentally, are flat-out successful in the roles and add much to providing much needed ballast after the 3rd season lost the program's 2 central characters. Father Aidan, as the new understudy to Father Mac, helps to re-center the plot and his sister provides much needed liveliness. Change in series 5 is represented by the arrival of a new police Guard to town, and the character is a winning one---a woman this time, going by the name of Frankie, but she's attractive and capable in the role; but also rather more of a ""tough guy"" than Guard Egan (though also likable) ever was during the first 4 years. Ambrose Egan's widow, the aforementioned Niamh (who interestingly too, was Father Aidan actor Don Wycherley's real-life sister-in-law, providing an extra dose of natural emotion in this warm-hearted program & who can be seen in the fine Irish drama by the title of ""The Hanging Gale"" with the fabulous Michael Kitchen starring) is the star of this season. Tony Doyle, who plays her father Brian Quigley remains the character around whom the show really revolves; or his schemes, doings, etc. are responsible for many happenings in this series, as per the norm with previous seasons of BallyK.After having viewed this series several times I am almost tempted to suggest newcomers to the series to start with season 4 and then ""flashback,"" in effect, to the first 3 seasons so as to end with the most dramatic episodes of the entire series (which are the last 2 of season 3).P.S. In case you're in the Dublin area one day, do take the time to visit the ""set"" of Ballykissangel, which isn't one at all actually; but rather is an one-street town (called Avoca) that was occasionally commandeered for filming. It's not that far from Dublin, where you can have a glass of stout in Fitzgerald's Bar ; and/or visit BallyK's church, as you walk into ""the program,"" so to speak, that you have enjoyably watched from afar. (And, if you haven't seen it yet, do treat yourself to seeing Assumpta's Leo in the very Irish and funny film ""Waking Ned Devine"".)

"Hooray for Capt. Spaulding, the comedic exploring national treasure.

"""Who's there?"" the priest, candle in hand, in his darkened church, demands.  Such are the first words of this film, before we see a seemingly contrite face; a face known to the priest, a friend.  ""I must confess to you.  I must tell someone.  I want to make a confession,"" says this one before they go into the confessional and he then admits to a heinous crime.  Thus far (8 minutes into this black & white film) all is well.  Even a further 20 minutes in, Hitchcock is still working interesting camera angles, scenes, juxtapositions.  Unfortunately. there's not much follow-through after this.  The film thence becomes a rather simplistic vehicle whose sole purpose in stretching things out is to continue peppering the viewer with ""will he, won't he"" anticipation; will the priest herein break the sanctity of the confessional once he himself is suspected of the crime in question, or no.  Anne Baxter as a blonde doesn't help much either.  The blonde look just doesn't seem to work on her (not for this part, at least), or perhaps it's just that Baxter wasn't up to the job herein.  Mongomery Clift is far more believable as the priest, but Karl Malden, who plays the police inspector, seems just too overly anxious to collar (pardon the pun) Clift.  There you have it for this film set in Quebec (seemingly, for no apparent reason other than to throw in a bit of French here & there); another play turned into a film by Hitchcock and, as is too typical of this otherwise super talented director,  an unsuccessful effort with such adaptations.  Watch ""Dial M for Murder"" instead for Hitch's best effort in turning a play into a film; unless you just have to see everything Hitchcock has made (which is the reason I sought this film out myself).

"Why bother with this product?  It is comparable to Microsoft Office and is about as easy to use as Microsoft Office (assuming you think Microsoft Office is user-friendly), but it is hardly demonstrably better. It's like the old Betamax versus VHS.  Yes, Beta was better, but VHS wasn't terrible and VHS fast became much more commonly the standard.  Likewise, it doesn't make much sense to use a system if it is only a bit better here and there if you are using this system to share work with others.  If it was 3x better than I'd say it's worth it, but it's like 20% better than Microsoft Office, if that, and while it is about half the price of MS Office it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to utilize a program almost nobody uses when Microsoft Office, the standard, is passably useful and convenient.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UX5LVG6GH0CB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017I8NQM#wasThisHelpful","R2UX5LVG6GH0CB","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anne Boleyn, who hasn't heard something about this woman?  In the historical drama of Henry VIII's violent break with the Vatican and the creation of The Anglican Church in Britain this woman played a central role. In Alison weir's view, ""She had been accused, probably falsely, of the vilest of crimes, and lost nearly everything that mattered: her husband, her brother, her power, her married status, her friends, her possessions, and her reputation.""But despite Anne being beheaded was this woman actually guilty of anything? Biography and history of folks are more comprehensive in 1000 page tomes but I am not a particular fan of such works of scholarship.  There is often just too much information in such learned historical treatments.  I prefer the 250-400 variety of biography wherein key issues of periods are examined and a lot of a person's life is glossed over or ignored to some extent.  This book is such a book as I like.  It deals with 3 years of history and only several months of events.  It brings the time to the reader and serves its purpose to encourage the reader to contemplate the period as if she he is sort of there......without making the era too complicated by delving into other material way back in time or with less relevance to the actual happening of the time.The author, thus, goes into much detail about how Anne rose and fell in favor and, in particular, the specific happenings that led to her fall, or rather how her fall was engineered. It is the author opinion that ""The circumstances of Anne's fall strongly suggest that she was framed.""  She was accused of having betrayed the King by having slept with other men; incredibly even with her brother.  But the author argues that it was not very likely that the charges made against her were true considering ""...the fact that no female attendants (without whose cooperation Anne could not have contrived any illicit meetings with her `lovers') were arrested with her."" Moreover, her executioner (swordsman) had been summoned well before the trial of Queen Anne.It might have been King Henry's ""idea, but the author of this book thinks that this ""idea"" was played out by one of the king's men.  ""As far back as early 1535 he [Henry 8] had privately inquired if his second marriage were annulled, whether his first would thereby be considered valid, and he'd asked Master Secretary Cromwell whether it would be possible to set Anne aside without returning to Katherine.""But, according to the author, ""The evidence therefore strongly suggests that it was Cromwell, rather than Henry Vlll, who was the prime mover in the matter.""""His [Cromwell] words to Chapuys [the Imperial Ambassador] were crucially significant, as they prove that it was Cromwell's determination, rather than any evidence, that brought about Anne's fall, and that it was Master Secretary who instigated the political coup that has been called `one of the most audacious plots in English history.'""And this book is basically a supposition of how this individual engineered what he thought King Henry desired.  Whether King Henry actually believed any of it or just welcomed the charges as convenient to him and let them proceed because of such is another matter that the author really has no evidence to say one way or the other.Either way, Henry doesn't come out of this well no matter how you see it, but it is a fascinating story; a story almost too fantastic to be true, which is apropos since it was more fantastic than true.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31GL6S6ZVHTZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345453220#wasThisHelpful","R31GL6S6ZVHTZE","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tension fills this 2 hour plus film notwithstanding that there's not much real action in this classic western starring John Wayne and Dean Martin. The film was directed by Howard Hawks, but if someone told you that it was really directed by Alfred Hitchcock you might, after watching this film, say hmmm that's interesting; in short, you might half believe it.  It's a character study of several book-ended by a dramatic opening confrontation and a rousing concluding showdown.  It's hard not to compare this film with ""High Noon"" because that film too seems to to be a spring that is continually coiled until everything is unleashed at its end, but nobody is really particularly likable in ""High Noon"" and while the tension builds one doesn't really come to like more and more the players herein as one might in ""Rio Bravo.""  The tension continues in ""Rio Bravo"" but you never have the feeling that an hour glass is generating it which inclines one, I believe, to not so much as look forward to its conclusion as enjoy each minute of the film and, to some extent, not welcome the moment when the film begins to wrap things up for you. It's theatrical in the sense that it is just plain good theater and the characters, albeit on a screen and not on stage in front of you, are just enjoyable to watch as you grow to like and respect more and more of them over the course of this ensemble performance. It's a film, moreover, that one can watch over and over which bespeaks that this is one fine film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CABW2SBB17GK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045HCJSK#wasThisHelpful","R3CABW2SBB17GK","A2BIK37ZMXKW91","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BIK37ZMXKW91?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased the Strand Study Bible on Amazon, so it should be an Amazon verified purchase.This Bible is a storehouse of information relevant to Bible study.  It is well organized, has plenty of room for your own notes, and covers all sorts of relevant historical background information as well as theological comments and helps.I have a pretty wide collection of study Bibles.  This is one of the very best.  It is a large heavy book which is packed with information. You probably won't want to carry it to church, but it's easy enough to handle in a comfortable chair. You do need to take a look at the description of how the notes are organized so as to benefit fully from it.I notice in many reviews that there are ""partisan"" reactions to the Strand Study Bible.  Let's get real.  Many of us are members of different denominations.  There are variations in theology.  There are often differences of opinion about dating systems, prophecy, and more -- even within denominations and Bible study groups.  Discussions about these differences of opinion is often what makes groups interesting.  People who THINK will not always agree.  We need to consider various opinions -- to test the validity of our own assumptions -- to study to learn the truth about what the Bible means.  The ultimate aim is not to pick what WE think.  It's to understand what GOD thinks.The Bible is clear in its teachings.  We are not always clear in our understanding.  We begin as babes in Christ and are told to learn of God and mature in our faith.  There are essential core beliefs that make a person a Christian.  Yet there are many areas of disagreement.  God never said we all had to achieve infallible knowledge to be Christians, but He tells us to study. The Bible tells us as follows:  .2 Timothy 2:15 (KJV)15  Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.I would like to suggest that we all study -- and discuss what we are learning with courtesy.  In the meantime, no study Bible is infallible.  The Bible is inspired by God.  The footnotes are not.  However, good footnotes put together by person or persons who have a grasp of the history and the truths presented in the Word of God can be tremendously helpful to the person who is not so knowledgeable.I, for instance, think the Strand Study Bible system of dating is one of the best -- BUT NOT PERFECT.  I have differences of opinion regarding some of the dating information.  This does NOT mean that I can't benefit from using this Bible.  I do not have ANY study Bible that I agree with completely -- and I have some study Bibles that I strongly disagree with.  I read those to understand divergent viewpoints.I also concur with Mr Strand's choice of the King James Version as the best translation to use for the reasons he enumerates in a short summary.The KJV was based on the manuscripts most in use in the Christian church for many many years.  At the risk of sounding like an old fuddy-dud, I would add that the KJV has been the old reliable standby in the study of God's Word for a very long time, and it has been the translation used by many of the most dedicated Christians who ever walked this earth.  It doesn't take that much effort to look up a few old words in order to benefit from it.  I would add that the beauty and majesty of the King Jame Version -- as well as its graphic accuracy-- is unmatched by any other translation.I would add that such an information packed study Bible in this old and beloved translation is a very great blessing -- especially to those of us who just love and enjoy the King James Version.This is one of the best and most complete study Bibles I have ever seen, and I highly recommend it.  Mr Strand believes the Bible is God's Word and he treats the Bible as if it is inspired by God.  If you are looking for a study Bible that downplays the authority of God's word, you won't like this one.If you are looking for a study Bible which is encyclopaedic in its approach to supplying you with helpful information and where the notes reflect reverence for God's Word, you won't be disappointed.I, for one, am thoroughly enjoying using the Strand Study Bible.  It's well worth the money to purchase a copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UMMADXV1X8DY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0984108106#wasThisHelpful","R1UMMADXV1X8DY","A31DOFN12H9NB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31DOFN12H9NB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good product.  I purchased it to keep ME cool as well as my computer.  I routinely work on my laptop in my lounge chair, and the gadget I was using for a lap desk was inadequate.  I settled on this one, and I'm very pleased with it.  It has many choices for elevation with  more than adequate height.  The rim of the board is holding my machine comfortably in place, but I am mindful of the fact that I need to be careful with it, when I put the lap desk holding the computer on a table to go do something.The fan plugs into a USB port and works well.  It can be easily disconnected if you need to use the port.  I did read about broken fans in a couple of reviews.  The first time I went to handle the upper portion of the desk, I went to grab it, and I realized I had put my hands in a position that would put pressure on the fan. You can certainly break the fan especially if you have large hands and make this mistake.  It's plenty easy enough to do whatever you need to without getting your hands in the fan -- but you do need to think about it at first.  Reasonably careful handling will avoid problems.This has a comfortable pad that it sits on.  The ventilation is excellent.  The height is good.

"This book is completely fascinating -- tales of archaeological discoveries made in earlier centuries while settling, farming, ranching, and building this country, which unfortunately were neglected or ignored at the times of their discoveries. Often the significance of the discoveries was unrecognized, but, just as often, the discoveries seem  to have been deliberately ignored by some who should have been more interested.  Even if there are some tall tales in the book, there is ample indication that men and women of good faith honestly reported facts about the things they found -- including definite evidence of a culture that pre-dated the American Indian culture as we are aware of it from the experience of the settlers arriving from Europe in the late 15th century to this day.  I highly recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BCPR0PLZ33MQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDGKYS2#wasThisHelpful","R1BCPR0PLZ33MQ","A31DOFN12H9NB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31DOFN12H9NB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had written a positive review about J&J Comfort Sheer bandaids.  I just deleted it.I had serious issues with the adhesive on their other bandaid products taking the skin off my hands.  I thought this Comfort Sheer adhesive was better.  I had good luck for a while.  HOWEVER, I have recently had two very bad experiences with the adhesive sticking to my skin almost as if it were super glued.  It took patches of skin off my hand -- which leaves an area that takes a long while to heal, much like a burn when the blister breaks-I do not particularly like the design of Nexcare's bandages.  HOWEVER, I have finally had it with J&J Bandaids.  I think J&J must have quality control issues with their product, because I used half a box of Comfort Sheer with no problems at all -- Then all of a sudden I used 3 Bandaids which damaged my skin badly enough to be painful and vulnerable to infection.  I now have more problems than I had when I originally used the Bandaids -- the original wound, plus the damage done by the Bandaid itself.I can't imagine using this product on a child, for instance, and having something like this happen.  I have tried J&J's Bandaids enough, and the intermittent problems are unpredictable and a serious nuisance..I am going to buy the larger Nexcare bandages.  If they are too large or if there is too much adhesive, I will simply trim the bandage to size with scissors.  Nexcare's adhesive sticks when it should and it comes OFF when you want to remove the bandages.  So far when I have used Nexcare's products, I have not had any skin problems from the adhesive.  I hope my luck with them continiues.If you are having problems with adhesive, consider trying Nexcare's products.  I, at least, have had better luck with them.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9TLGHK86R2M1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBKHJ06#wasThisHelpful","R9TLGHK86R2M1","A31DOFN12H9NB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31DOFN12H9NB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Small wonder the film-maker went on to bigger things, but this just might be the best thing he ever did.  The story is authentic.  The actual settings  --  many of the actual eye witnesses describing their experiences.  It gives you a real feel for the people, the culture, their homes -- and the strange events as they transpired and as the people who lived through it describe them. You will certainly wonder just what it was they saw.  I expected an amateurish monster movie.  Instead I was awed by the beauty of the place and the personalities of the people.

"It's a standard thriller plot.  Not a bad read.  However, the author is trying to sell the idea that Octavian Augustus Caesar is the model for the Christ of the Gospels in the Bible.  If you believe this, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn for sale for a tidy price.  The author  has a Yale PHD, but common sense doesn't seem to be his strong point.He thinks the fact that Virgil has written a passage which sounds Biblical means that the gospels are based on mythology.  However, Virgil came AFTER the Old Testament prophecies of Christ, and that passage simply indicates that he was thoroughly familiar with the Hebrew scriptures.  The passage could have been compiled straight out of the Old Testament.  There's nothing mystical about Virgil's knowledge of the prophecies.The author believes that because there are myths about the Dying God that Christianity is based on these myths.  He does exaggerate the so-called evidence.  There are many myths, I agree.  However, God has been revealing truths to mankind for a long time.  The Bible we have begins with the writings of Moses, and since the Exodus from Egypt occurred circa 1450 BC when Moses was 80 years old, we can date his writings within a reasonable time frame.  For those of you who may be interested, the Exodus seems to have coincided with the volcanic eruption on the island of Thera, known today as Santorini, which would have made a bit of a mess in Egypt.  The eruption was enormous.  It packed substantially more of a punch than Krakatoa, and the prevailing winds were toward Egypt.Years ago, scholars believed that the wandering Israelites were ignorant nomadic shepherds.  However, archaeological evidence indicates that the civilization Abraham left, when he headed for the Promised Land, was a highly cultured society with the ability to write and keep records.There are plenty of indications in the book of Genesis, the events of which  predate Moses, that Moses was drawing on written records in order to compile Genesis.  This isn't the place to go into detail about that.Today historians and geologists recognize the reality of catastrophic events occurring in the earth's history.  The idea of a catastrophic flood which wiped out most of mankind and changed the topography of the world is not far-fetched at all.  It could well have coincided with a collision with a comet, asteroid or other heavenly body.  Noah was one of the survivors, and he is described in the New Testament as a ""preacher of righteousness"".God's revelation to mankind came early.  God's revelation to mankind precedes the myths.  The mythology of the Dying God is actually based on a distortion of God's revelation -- the actual product of verbal transmission being somewhat garbled as time passed.  The myths are based on God's revelation, BUT the myths don't have it straight.  In addition to that, there were many different rulers in different kingdoms who decided to claim the position of God and/or God's Son.  They personally claimed to be the fulfillment of the prophecies about the coming of the Son of God.Men who love power often have delusions of grandeur.  It does boggle the mind that men who get sick and die, unable to prevent their own deaths, decide to imagine they are gods.The author claims that Jesus of Nazareth never lived - that He was not a historical character- that the gospels are actually based on Octavian August Caesar's claims to deity.  Now that is simply silly.  You may or may not believe that Jesus is the Lord, but to deny His historical existence is so far removed from actual history as to be bizarre.There is no rational way to equate the Jesus of the Gospels with Augustus Caesar.  They  aren't even playing on the same street.  I strongly suggest that anybody who is going to swallow this wild tale should READ the gospels and see if you think that Caesar is the basis for the person of Jesus Christ.In the meantime, this book is a standard formula thriller plot -- not a bad read, if you are able to ignore the nonsense.  I'm not going to give away the plot for those of you who want to read the book.I wasn't always a Christian.  Once a long time ago, I wondered if Jesus was even a historical character - and I researched the subject to find out.  I had no intention of basing my life on a lie.  I picked up this book knowing it would be a direct challenge to the Christian faith.  My faith is based on historical facts, and it would be totally worthless if it wasn't fact and it if couldn't hold up to challenges.  It's a real knowledge about a real Person who lived, died, and rose again.  And the man I know as Lord and Savior is definitely not Augustus  Caesar.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKBZXPQAEY5NZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZJL4TK#wasThisHelpful","RKBZXPQAEY5NZ","A31DOFN12H9NB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31DOFN12H9NB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To fully enjoy the use of this camera,  YOU NEED TO READ THE MANUALS, BOTH OF THEM.  YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE ADVANCED MANUAL AND READ IT.  This camera has amazing capabilities.  The zoom capabilities without reverting to the use of the digital zoom are awe-inspiring.  The Intelligent Zoom is better than a digital zoom, and it extends the zoom capabilities to more than the 60x figure.  I have used both.  The intelligent zoom will give you a photo with fewer megapixels, but the distortion common to digital zooming is missing.  Since you're starting with 16.1 mp, you can well afford to reduce the mp for the purpose of getting a long shot, but you don't even have to do that if you use the zoom attachment you can purchase with the adapter.I also have the adapter for the zoom attachment and the close-up attachment.  I was using a FZ100, and the same accessories work.  For the record,  you can use the regular zoom AND the intelligent zoom with the telephoto attachment which allows you to get magnificent zoom capabilities without using a digital zoom.This camera also has good wide angle capabilities as well - at least as wide as I ever want.  It doesn't do fisheye.It has macrofocusing down to 1 mm AND macro zoom focusing, which is delightful and will enlarge the subject.  And I have the close-up attachment as well, although so far the macro zoom has produced pictures I'm happy with, so I haven't used it.  .It has many different focusing choices.  You need to see what they are and see which one works for you.  The flexible focus is my favorite.  Uses a bit more battery, but it is faster continuous focus than the one labeled continuous focus.  This is why you have to read the directions.  There is also manual focus.  And standard focus.They have skimped on not making the vewing screen moveable to different angles.  If you want to take a time exposure, you mght want to use the timed shutter release to avoid camera movement, since there is no input for an external shutter button.  And yes, those things would have been nice, BUT I couldn't afford the camera if they hadn't kept the price down.  This is a hobby of mine, not a profession.This is one whopper of a camera for the price.  I think they economized in the right places and spent the money on the best kind of image stabilization that you can get - a necessity if you are going to use such a zoom.I have set my camera to limit the shutter speeds (found in the camera menu settings) so that it can't automatically go to too slow a speed.  Panasonic recommends a tripod -- and it's very true that a good tripod helps - but ninety nine percent of the time, when I want a photo, I either don't have my tripod with me, or it's not set up -- so I am handholding shots that should be on a tripod -- because the deer will leave -- or the birds or small animals are active -- I'm often taking a walk, and I use the zoom to photograph wild flowers I can't get close to without getting into poison ivy or some such thing.My advice for handheld shots is to use the shutter speed limit, so the shutter speed can't go too slow on you.  I often use shutter priority, risking the shot being too dark, but there is also an option in the setup stuff. Often, even if a picture is too dark, you can improve it with software.The camera also had editing capabilities, but I use Corel's software on my PC.I take LOTS OF PHOTOS.  If you think you can't hand hold the camera, snap as many photos as you can, and try.  Hold your breath and get your elbows close to your sides -- really - it steadies you -- or find something to lean on, if possible, and do your best.  Sometimes it doesn't work, but often if I take a lot of photos, at least a couple of them will be sharp, because I snapped the picture at just the right moment.The beauty of digital photography is that you don't have to pay for your flops.  You can just delete them, and keep the good ones.This is not a professional photographer's camera, although I would bet that pros would have one whopper of a good time with it.  But I don't have the money to buy a pro's camera, nor do I have the ability to carry the camera equipment I used to -- nor do I have the money to spare for excessive film and processing.SO I am as happy as a hog in a mud waller with this camera.  It take good pictures.  As with any camera, you need to get used to this particular one.  I have a particular combination of metering and exposure that I usually use -- you could vary your choices to suit yourself, BUT YOU WON'T DO THAT IF YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD THE ADVANCED MANUAL AND READ IT.I went to the trouble to print out the manual, because I studied it in odd places in order to cover the information.  It is convenient to have it on your computer, too, but I wanted a print out.  I printed it one section at a time.This is a wonderful camera for the money.  If I could afford the setup the National Geographic photographers use, I wouldn't be able to carry it anyway.  This camera is a great deal of fun, and if you will take the time to master the vast number of choices you have available, you will surely enjoy it.I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BX533746RQAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DY2Y28M#wasThisHelpful","R3BX533746RQAU","A31DOFN12H9NB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31DOFN12H9NB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good adventure mystery.  It deals with the real sleaze of the use of kids by pornographers.  It makes the horrible nature of the industry clear without being overly graphic, which makes it a good and thought-provoking read.  It certainly would encourage awareness of a serious problem in the context of fiction you don't want to put down.  That awareness should encourage people to make kids and young people aware of the dangers around them.It's a good mystery, interesting characters, and an adventure.

There are real dangers that are discussed in this book.I personally read books that I don't always agree with -- I can often learn from people who have ideas I haven't considered.  So if you are dealing with psychic healing in any way, reading only a few pages and then trashing the book is certainly not being tolerant or open minded.  People are entitled to disagree with you, just as they are entitled to disagree with me -- and considering the ideas of people who disagree with you is NOT a negative.  It is a way we sharpen our minds.I am a Christian who believes the Bible to be the Word of God in written form.

"I am able to see George Washington's faith expressed in his own words.  Skip the introductions.  Read Washington's prayer diary, and you will see that he was a Bible believing Christian who trusted Jesus Christ as his Lord and Saviour.  He was NOT a deist.  He was a believing Christian.  Don't just stop at the beginning.  Read the whole diary.Our society's educational and other media has chosen to MISREPRESENT the actual beliefs of our founding fathers.  That is intellectually dishonest.  I was pleased to hear what Washington thought in Washington's own words -- the intro is written by somebody else, obviously.I was also fascinated by the fact that George Washington as a high level Mason was a believing Christian, and he apparently saw no clash between the two.  I think that Masonry is often a reflection of the beliefs of the men who participate in it.  It is, as far as I understand, an organization which welcomes men of differing opinions who choose to behave responsibly.  A man should believe in a Creator God to be a Mason, but Masonry is a fellowship of Christians, Jews, and others.I know a great many people consider Masonry to be incompatible with Biblical Christianity.  I see that George Washington had a different opinion.  And there is no doubt at all about the depth and Biblical nature of his Christian faith.  Many of the references in his prayer diary are references to the Bible's teachings.  You do need to be familiar with the Bible to realize that.I have found this book to be an excellent piece of primary source material.  I highly recommend it.  You don't have to become a Bible believing Christian to acknowledge the fact that George Washington was one and to respect his faith.  I am a Bible believing Christian.  You don't have to be one to be intellectually honest about historical facts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R153Y7BLYUZ6EL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JEREYC#wasThisHelpful","R153Y7BLYUZ6EL","A31DOFN12H9NB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31DOFN12H9NB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Serve over ice, obviously.  Enjoy.Highly recommend -- oh -- when I brew green tea, I bring the water to a rapid boil, let the water stop bubbling, and drop my tea bags into the water.  Green tea needs this slightly more gentle method to retain good flavor, in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BXYM7P0FYLON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F4DKAS#wasThisHelpful","R2BXYM7P0FYLON","A31DOFN12H9NB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31DOFN12H9NB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The replacement pads give you one plain and one carbon embedded pad for each change.  This is working very well to keep my 5 gallon aquarium clean.  I have tried three other filters -- This one is actually keeping the water in very good shape.  My betta is in excellent health with fewer water changes.  I think this is due to my using Azoo's own filters.  The carbon impregnated pad is very effective at removing impurities.When I change the filter media, I change both the plain and the carbon pad, AND I add API's Quick Start, Stress Coat, and Stress-Zyme -- all three just as if I were starting a new setup.  This puts the startup bacteria into the filter, adds extra bacteria which do clean up, and protects my fish as I am normally adding fresh water at that point -- sometimes due to water change, sometimes due to evaporation.I am also very happy with the Azoo filter that these pads are used in.

"I really like this printer.  Print quality is excellent.  As for paper jams, which people have been complaining about, HP paper works very well with only an occasional instance of printer pulling two pages at once -- something every printer I have ever owned has done.  I learned quickly NOT to mix different types of papers.  That does cause a problem.  Thumbing your paper before you load it does help.There is a place to choose your paper type.  It is important that you do this.  One choice is HP paper -- There is also a choice for OTHER printer paper.  I think it's wise to make the correct paper selection so as to avoid problems with paper feed.  I have had very few problems.  This printer is doing its paper feed as well as any.Print quality is excellent.  I am VERY happy with this machine.

"I find this man's books fascinating.  He was writing in the 1800's, and it is incredible what perceptiveness he shows on the subject of prophecy.  He has simply taken his Bible seriously, refused to over-allegorize it, and he has missed some of the errors in prophecy that were made back then, because they were not looking at today's current political alignment in the Middle East.  A lot of prophecy students back then completely missed the fact that Israel would actually return to the Land and become a nation again, because before 1948, it just seemed so incredible.  I have read a couple of Pember's books now, and I highly recommend his writings.  He is a careful thinker, and even though you may not always agree with every one of his conclusions, you will have to admire his clarity and careful analysis.

"I have had a remarkable experience with HP's service, and I am impressed.  They are TERRIFIC.  My machine arrived with a defective dvd drive.  I registered the machine before I realized this, which I now realize was a good thing.  HP's service is exemplary.  They promptly shipped me the replacement drive.  It is now installed, and  the machine is running very well.  I could have returned the machine for them to replace it, but I knew I could get this done, and it saved time. I am so pleased with my purchase and the service I received that I recommended HP to a family member who purchased one of their other machines.For the price this machine is exceptional.  I am not into games or graphics, so I can't comment on how it would perform in that category.  The USB3 ports are fast.  The machine has a comfortable keyboard and a good screen.Windows 8 hides things.  I have been told that their next update or upgrade (not sure which) will put the start menu back.  You have to poke around to find things.  Try right clicking in different places.  Menus change with small changes in the cursor location.  I uninstalled a lot of the stuff that was unnecessary and which was offers to buy stuff.  Windows 8 is not a bad program EXCEPT that it's hard to FIND things at first.  If you are determined, you can learn this program reasonably quickly, but I have been doing computers since Dos 3.11 before Windows was ever invented, so I do have a bit of an edge.  The aps page isn't bad, but I move to the regular desktop which is where I normally work from.  However, if you want to go back and forth from that to the aps page, it's easy to do and very helpful in many situations.Also in Windows 8, the right hand pop out menu changes depending on where you are, and from the aps page, if you move your cursor to the right to open the right pop out, then click on ""tiles,"" you can tell it to open a bigger list of aps, and you can find a lot of the programs that do machine maintenance, etc.  However, if you are a beginner, be a little careful with those.  Also, you can find stuff in the programs directory from the file manager.HP HAS DONE SOMETHING WONDERFUL.  If you are a keyboard user and do a lot of typing, it is VERY handy that the touchpad can be turned  off with two light taps on a little indentation in the upper left corner of the touchpad.  Can be turned back on the same way, so you don't have to worry about what you are typing suddenly changing size or taking off into the wild blue yonder.  VERY handy.  Kudos to HP.The Windows 8 email program is horrible.  It seems to work well until you go to forward something, and then it gets messy.  As best I can figure out, you have to select what you want to forward, and that is like pouring molasses in January.  Then it doesn't always work.  When I tried to move something into a special folder, which should work, the machine froze.  If the email is open, and it seems to be open ALL the time, then I got an error message when I restarted the machine that windows couldn't access something.  That wasn't helpful, since the message disappeared so quickly I couldn't read it.  Without that email program set up, I don't get an error message.  Without the email program, the machine is working great.My suggestion is to delete all your email accounts, if you have set any up.  Use your email provider's web site, or, if you want to do your email on your machine, get a different program.  There are two reasons for this:  1. security  and 2. the program is lousy.About security, the very first thing I do when I turn on my machine is update my Norton's Internet Security.  If you have set up an account using the Windows 8 email program, you machine is online before you can get a security update, and you are not as fully protected as you should be if email comes in, as it almost surely will.I have already said the program drove me nuts, because it didn't work well.  I am perfectly happy working on the web site for my email, and that also avoids downloading a lot of spam and risking hostile files or viruses getting to your machine.  If you do use a machine based email system, I highly recommend Norton's security programs.  They have stopped bad emails from getting to my older machine, where I was using machine based email.  Obviously you have to do your own thinking about phishing emails, but Norton will stop hostile files and viruses fast.I hope this review helps people deciding whether or not to buy this machine.  It is an excellent machine for normal activities.  For running high end graphics, you need something bigger -- and more expensive -- but this machine is faster and does more than older desktops, and I like it a lot.If you have a problem, contact HP support.  They have a regular specified routine they go through, and if you will bear with them,they will help you as fast as they can.  Have a little patience, and they WILL solve your difficulties.  They certainly have done a wonderful job for me.  And it's not their fault you are frantic because you machine is pitching a hissy fit.Hope this review is helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11HWODZ6XN7YR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AU2JIC#wasThisHelpful","R11HWODZ6XN7YR","A31DOFN12H9NB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31DOFN12H9NB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have religious freedom in our country, and every man is entitled to his own religious views.  However, quoting the Bible OUT OF CONTEXT is essentially misrepresenting the actual message of this fascinating and historical document.  You are perfectly free to accept or reject the message of the Bible, but, at least, be accurate about what that message IS.This book quotes the Bible, BUT, in so doing, it misrepresents the Bible's teaching about the second coming of the Messiah.  If you read this book, and if this book stimulates your curiosity about the end times and the second coming of the Messiah, don't accept this false picture of these events.  The first time the Messiah came, He came as a carpenter and rabbi.  The second time He comes, He won't be hard to identify at all.Try reading Zechariah chapters 12-14, especially chap 14, in the Old Testament for an idea of what it will be like when the Messiah returns -- When He touches down on the Mount of Olives the Mount will split in two.  Not an inconspicuous event.  Maybe if your interest in piqued by the genuine article, you'll find Biblical prophecy an interesting subject to investigate.In Matthew 24, the Messiah Himself warns against searching for false Messiahs in the deserts and secret chambers, and He Himself says that His second coming will be like lightning shining from east to west --Portraying the returned Messiah as a drunken musician, who is totally confused about his own identity and who, oddly enough, spends time in the desert, is not an accurate presentation of what the Bible predicts.Matthew 24:23-27 King James VersionThen if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.I've used the King James Version in my quotation, because this version is obviously in the public domain.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ1TOQFNBX2I0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C8V7YVC#wasThisHelpful","RJ1TOQFNBX2I0","A31DOFN12H9NB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31DOFN12H9NB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a beautifully constructed book.  Even the cheapest edition is amazingly flexible and a delight to handle.  HOWEVER:1. I was extremely disappointed in the print.  It could be much darker and more distinct.  Don't say they couldn't do that because the paper is so light in weight.  I have a Cambridge Cameo KJV which is even smaller than the Clarion and which has very thin paper which has DARKER PRINT of a comparable size and which is easy to read.It's possible that part of the problem is the line spacing.  Not sure -- but this is nowhere near as easy to read as the Bibles printed the old fashioned way, meaning not computer printing.They did NOT make the mistake of having the ink run out in the printing process, so the printing job is well handled in that respect and was carefully monitored.2. I was disappointed to discover that they have left out some of the references which were included in their older Bibles.  They had room.  Just left the refs out.  It's not a matter of whether it's side or center column reference.  They had ONE COLUMN to use, and they didn't use it.  I like a reference Bible with a complete set of refs, especially for this price.  For example, in the Cambridge Cameo KJV which I have, there is a reference at 1 Thessalonians 5:18.  There is no reference for that verse in the Clarion edition.  An unnecessary deletion.3. The other disappointment was in the information in the combined concordance and encyclopedia type information in the back of the Bible.  I was startled to read that the Apostle Peter did NOT write either of the two books attributed to him by name in the Bible itself.  The commentator believes that the books were written by some guy who claimed to be the apostle Peter at a date when Peter would have been dead.  If this were so, then the writer of these two Bible books would have lied about who he is and would have LIED ABOUT BEING AN EYE WITNESS TO HIS MAJESTY as he claimed in 2 Peter.If the writers of sacred scripture are liars about who they are, what they saw, and when they lived, WHY should we believe anything else they say?  In my humble opinion, the Bible is God's word, and Jesus, who said ""I am the way, the truth, and the life,"" is NOT going to sponsor lies -- nor is the Holy Spirit going to inspire lies.I was well aware that Cambridge notes and encyclopedia entries often lean toward liberal interpretations, but this was egregious.I think it's important for Bible believing Christians to know BEFORE they buy this Bible that the notes in the back are not consistent with belief in the truth of the Scriptures.  NOW, that said, if you aren't going to rely on the notes, if you do enjoy the kind of type and the paragraph format -- then you would be purchasing an exquisitely crafted edition of the King James Version of the Bible.Superior construction of the volume.  However, the print is not up to the standard they could have achieved simply by dint of using more ink, and the notes in back are not consistent with conservative theology.Those are the reasons I have only given it three stars.  I hope this information is helpful.  I rarely do negative reviews, but it seemed to me that purchasers of a book that is this expensive might appreciate this information.  If, knowing this, you choose to purchase the volume, at least you won't be surprised in a negative way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUU9DFPR4CT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052122862X#wasThisHelpful","R2FUU9DFPR4CT","A31DOFN12H9NB5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31DOFN12H9NB5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first 25% of this book was a bit of a bore. There was a lot of unnecessary description and not enough action. And through it all I was distracted by the inconsistent voice of out narrator Mayme. The tragedy during which our two main characters lost their families and were then drawn together was a chaotically powerful part of the story. I was drawn in when Mayme and Katie were gettig to know one another. But the last 30% of the book seemed redundant and the conflict was not really resolved.

This book is not one of those memoirs and Carolyn Maull McKinstry is not one of those writers.

"There's nothing really though-provoking about this book. It doesn't really teach any life lessons or make you reconsider your views on the world as you know it. But it IS chock full of quirky characters and zany situations. So much so that you'll laugh out loud.The story is narrated by Jane, a 30-something HR professional who is (not so) secretly stalking one of her neighbors, taking care of her 20+ year old goldfish Sparky, and dodging calls from her prying mother Pat1 (not to be confused with her dad, Pat2). Along the way we meet her hopelessly romantic brother and his ditzy but well-meaning fiance, a chain-smoking co-worker, a promiscuous friend, a latin lover, a couple of gay best friends, and a TV newscaster (among others).Pros: The narration is executed in such a way that it's like having lunch with an old friend. The dialogue is down-to-earth and believable, even if the plot developments aren't always. The characters are all unique and fairly well-developed, considering just how many characters there are.Cons: There weren't any major plot developments so while the characters and situations were fun, the story overall got a bit stale near the end. I'd have left happier if the book had been about 25% shorter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FJS13FS2FMKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C5TOQ7M#wasThisHelpful","R3FJS13FS2FMKC","A2Y5780JCZLKJG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5780JCZLKJG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise of the book is pretty straightforward.... Four 50-something women reconnect at a class reunion, reminisce about the past and take a hard look at their futures. Their bond was formed back in grade school simply because they are all named Linda (and consequently all opt to go by their middle names) and life has taken them in four very different directions. Yet they pick up as though they hadn't spent any time apart at all. And apparently no one--kids, spouses, fellow classmates--knew they were even friends. Odd...The characters were trite, the dialogue was completely unrealistic, and the plot chugged along at a snail's pace.

"Having recently (3 1/2 months ago) given birth to our first child, I thought this book would be a fun read and give me a glimpse into what my hubby went through during my pregnancy. And based on the handful of other customer reviews, it was sure to be funny, too...bonus!The book is a series of diary entries penned by our narrator, Graham. His audience, he assumes, are the aliens who will someday find his diary (?). Graham talks candidly about his fears and excitement as his girlfriend progresses through the months leading up to his fatherhood. The story has the potential to be funny. It has the potential to be poignant. It was neither.I think the humor was just lost on me because I'm not British and, clearly, the author is. (Perhaps some of the ""funny"" was ""lost in translation""...?) That aside, very little of the content was believable. I find it hard to believe that any 29-year-old man is as ill-equipped and aloof as Graham seems to be. He came across as flaky and, sadly, unlikable. So much so that in my mind, it was Russell Brand's voice narrating the story. (Have I mentioned that I can't stand Russell Brand?) I digress.

"I don't pre-make bottles, which means there's no refrigeration or warming required. And when we're on the go with our daughter, these dispensers are perfect to throw in the diaper bag. We can still make her bottle immediately before she's ready to eat it AND we don't have to cart the whole can of formula along with us.We also use them when bringing our daughter to daycare or any other time someone will be watching her for us. That way we know it's measured correctly and again there's no carting a whole can of formula around.I've tried other formula dispensers and hate how you can't ever seem to get all of the formula out. That's not an issue with these, though. The covers come in 2 pieces: a lid and a cap. To fill the dispenser, you remove the lid (which leaves the entire top of the cup open). To empty the dispenser, you remove the small cap (which opens a hole in the lid). The lids are curved on the inside, creating almost a funnel shape which allows you to get all the formula out easily. And since the opening covered by the cap is small, it keeps you from spilling the formula while trying to empty it into your bottle.The only negative thing I can say is that I wish they were slightly larger. The packaging says they are big enough to hold enough formula to make an 8-ounce bottle but they're not. I can fit 3 scoops of formula (enough for a 6-ounce bottle) but can't imagine where you'd squeeze another whole scoop. Still, I'd recommend them in a heartbeat!CORRECTION ADDED 11/19/13: We have since started using these formula dispensers for our 8-ounce bottles and the formula does, in fact, fit! After adding the third scoop, I tap the container on the counter a few times to allow the formula to settle a bit. And then I'm able to get the fourth scoop in. The size is absolutely perfect!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31C5LXQ1S55C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IM8PDU#wasThisHelpful","R31C5LXQ1S55C2","A2Y5780JCZLKJG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5780JCZLKJG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He's one of the managers at Village Books, an independent bookstore facing its doom as a bigbox corporation prepares to buy them out. Along the way, we meet an eclectic mix of employees a la Empire Records.The only (somewhat) negative comment I can possibly make about this book is that the plot is nothing special. You won't find any suspenseful twists. It doesn't raise any social, moral, or any other kind of question. But it at least flows. And ultimately, the plot doesn't matter because the dialogue (including that between the narrator and reader, thanks to the first person narration) is often hilarious and constantly witty.

"I'd venture to say that billions of people--past and present--have kept journals or diaries. And I'd even venture to say that many of them were written during a time of great historical importance, as this one was. However, just because a journal was written during (and/or about) an important historical period does not mean that it warrants publishing.Two words I'd use to describe the story as presented are disjointed and unengaging. I was completely bored when the author listed off her relatives; I would have preferred to hear about only those relatives that we'd learn more about during the story like her parents, grandmother, and brother. There are random ""editor's notes"" sprinkled throughout the narrative that are a complete distraction from the story (and often unnecessary, as they simply restate what the author has already said). And the writing itself is only about as good as can be expected from an amateur teen girl.The Holocaust was a terrible period in our world's history. And the atrocities committed by the Nazis during that time are downright repulsive. I fully understand the importance of making that history known so I'm not trying to diminish the subject matter in any way. I'm sure these journals are a treasured family heirloom. But to publish them...? If this family's intention was simply to share Nonna's story, perhaps a family member should have used her diaries to create a more cohesive book *about* the contents of the journals.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH7IVITODZ9V4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Y35J5S#wasThisHelpful","RH7IVITODZ9V4","A2Y5780JCZLKJG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5780JCZLKJG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"...I would certainly try another book by this author. A troubled marriage, a tragic loss, and a widow trying to pick up the pieces; the story had all the makings of a solid dramatic novel. But then unexplained things began happening and the main character begins to think she's losing her mind. Several other reviewers commented that the story was predictable but I have to disagree. I had no idea what was going on and even after the big reveal near the end, it still didn't make sense of all the odd occurrences along the way. I liked the themes in the story. I liked Howzell's writing style. And I felt that she did a good job of painting a portrait of grief. But the ""mystery"" in the story came across as a bit to far-fetched (even fantastical) for my taste.One other thing bothered me about this book. The author made it a point on several occasions throughout the story to bring up the fact that Nicole (the main character) is black. I thought it was an odd choice because each time she interjected it, it stuck out like a sore thumb. Her race had nothing to do with the story or the emotions behind it.

"This story drew me in from the first few pages. From the get-go, readers have a clear understanding that Christmas is important and Malone continues that theme throughout the book by highlighting family milestones and events in relation to Christmas time. The story follows the characters over the course of about 40 years and the readers get to see them grow and evolve.About halfway through the book, I started to get annoyed with the style. Malone lost me with all his ""recapping."" Since we only checked in with the characters at Christmas (and often with years in between chapters), he was left listing off all the events the reader missed in between chapters. It left me feeling disconnected from the story and the people it was about.But I kept going. And by the end, I was weeping--thank goodness I finished the book at home where only my husband and dogs could see/hear my tears! When the book ended, I was confused at my reaction. If I wasn't feeling engaged by the style of the book, then how could I have such a strong emotional reaction to the end? What could the author have done differently to keep me engaged throughout the book--not just at the beginning and end?I think the book would have been more effective for me if the chapters were not set with Christmas day as the ""present"" every time. Yes, Christmas was an integral part of the story. But I think the same would have been true regardless of what date each chapter was told from. Getting to see some of the big events that we missed between chapters--rather than just reading a brief recap of what had happened since the last Christmas--would have kept me more engaged throughout the book. But I'm probably just being nit-picky.I'm giving this book 4 stars overall because it got me to cry. So clearly the author did something right, in my opinion.

"I scooped this book up immediately after finishing Perry's book ""Playing for Keeps"" (which I really liked). Based on my first read by her, I was expecting this one to be much the same; an entertaining ""romantic comedy"" storyline with likable characters. Unfortunately, the book just didn't deliver.The main characters were not especially likeable (or believable) and several of the plot developments had me scratching my head wondering on what planet this would actually happen. The supporting characters were one-dimensional and cliche. And Perry failed to create the chemistry between the protagonist and her love interest that I had loved so much in her last book. (Ditto for the chemistry between the characters involved in the secondary romance that develops partway through the book.)Based on this book alone, I would have rated it one star. But I gave it two stars because I see now that it's book three of a 4-book series.

Her books are perfect when you want to unwind, be entertained, and not have to think too hard. My one complaint about this book is that readers are introduced to a fairly large cast of characters and I, for one, had a hard time keeping everyone straight. The three sisters at the heart of the story, for example, were very unique characters but it took me about half the book begin to remember which name went with which character.

"Based on the title, I was expecting a book about cloth diapering and maybe some yummy home-made baby food recipes. I got something completely different. Instead, the authors talked about ""elimination communication"" (letting your baby go diaper-less from even before his or her first birthday), ""baby-led weaning"" (from what I can gather, the concept that you should go directly from breast milk to solid foods), and ""co-sleeping"" (allowing your child to share a bed with you until he or she makes the decision to sleep alone). Overall I found most of what the authors said to be a bit too new-agey and unconventional for my taste. But perhaps I was biased by the section on breastfeeding.I am at the end of my first trimester during my first pregnancy and the concept of breastfeeding is creepy to me. I hoped that this book would discuss the pros and cons and open my mind to giving it a try. Discuss, it did...roughly 20% of the book was dedicated to lauding the benefits of breast milk. But open my mind, it did not. After much soul-searching and considering the ""facts"" (which seemed like anything but at some points), I have concluded that it's not for me. But my personal preference doesn't change that the authors were throwing around some absurd-sounding information to woo readers to their side. My personal favorite was around location 1735 when the authors said, and I quote, ""Breastfeeding mothers, due to hormones, are most in tune with their babies. Compared to bottle feeders, they tend to move babies to safer positions, including on their back, away from pillows. Breastfeeding mothers are also more likely to position themselves in ways that prevent overlaying."" I was offended by the implication that by bottle feeding, I am risking smothering my child in his or her sleep.

"**SPOILER ALERT**I usually try to not include spoilers in my reviews but I can't talk about this book without addressing my dissatisfaction with the ending (and the build-up to the ending).I really liked Tekla in the beginning. She came across as ambitious, responsible, and mature. But my opinion of her changed pretty quickly when she took a job tutoring two entitled teens, Xander and Gemma. At first, the job seemed completely in character for her; she needed extra money to take care of added financial responsibilities related to her school, room, and board. But when she started the job, she realized that the kids didn't want help with their homework--they wanted her to do it all for them. And their parents and Tekla's boss from the tutoring agency supported that opinion. She whined to herself about how wrong it was, yet she continued to do it anyway.Next thing you know, her job is taking up far more of her time than she expected, thanks to Xander and Gemma's absent parents, and suddenly Tekla is shirking her responsibilities on Law Review as well as in her own studies. So what does she do? She lets her would-be boyfriend Markus--the ""good guy"" she's not interested in dating--do her work for her. After finishing the semester strong (thanks to Markus), she lands a coveted internship where she is asked to write opinions for a judge--again, hired to do all the work for someone else. It's a depressing premise that in ""the real world"" it's necessary to sell yourself out just to pay rent.There was a bit of a love triangle involved in the book. Tekla didn't seem to want anything more than friendship from Markus yet fawned over Julian, the personal assistant to Xander and Gemma's famous photographer mother. Julian is the stock ""bad boy"" whose sole job in the story it is to show Tekla that she really wants the good guy. Julian completely embodies all the ideals Tekla claims to be morally opposed to--selling oneself out for a paycheck. And by all rights, Tekla is ""supposed to"" end up with Markus in the end, based on the standard love triangle formula. But the author leaves it completely open-ended in the last chapter, referring only to a ""boyfriend"" but not his name.The author has created some very quirky and memorable characters, each with a strong and distinct voice. I would have liked to have seen more of a conclusion at the end. Based on several other reviews, though, it seems that this novel is perhaps the first of a series...? If so, I'm glad to know that readers may get more of a conclusion to this story. But even so, I'm not sure I'll be picking up book 2.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHUKAQ3AM4JMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008600RF4#wasThisHelpful","RHUKAQ3AM4JMG","A2Y5780JCZLKJG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5780JCZLKJG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It begins with a widow winning the lottery and offering her two 30-something commitment-phobic children $8 million each if they produce grandchildren for her within a year.

"It really is a shame that E.L. James' trilogy is linked to this novella. I read the original ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" and loved it. And after reading the stellar reviews of ""Fifty Shades of Silver Hair and Socks"" I figured I'd be in for a laugh-out-loud treat. I figured wrong.This book had all of the elements that readers were so appalled by when E.L. James wrote them--including explicit sex scenes and an ""untraditional"" relationship. Which I'm perfectly okay with, by the way. However, this story also lacked all the good attributes that made the original ""Fifty Shades"" so popular with its readers. The character development was about as good as it's going to get in a not-quite-60-minute read. Which means I didn't get to know the characters enough to really care what happened with them. The plot was completely lacking and the pacing of the story didn't adequately build any sort of tension or mystery.On the up side, I did chuckle out loud once during the story when I read the ground rules.

"This was the first Stephanie Bond book added to my library and certainly won't be the last. It was the perfect blend of suspense--kept me guessing until the end!--and romance--boy, was I rooting for Butler!Bond did a great job of painting three very distinct, very memorable characters in Beatrix, Natalie, and Ruby, which was important because the story was told from all three perspectives. The plot moved right along and I wasn't bored at any point.I'm giving this book 4.5 stars simply because the conclusion to the murder mystery was a little lackluster, in my opinion. Other than that, it's an enjoyable, light, even zany read. But take it for what it is. It's not a police procedural--don't expect a very realistic investigation of the murder.

And then the author randomly jumps into the future of our main character's life and introduces us to his extremely unlikeable girlfriend. And the heart warming story deteriorates into a cheesy Lifetime movie with a predictable ending. I fail to see any connection between the first half of the book and the second half of the book.

"I loved the idea of this book...Caleb and Maggie were dynamic characters who displayed a lot of very relatable emotions. Their relationships with their families seemed believable, though a little overly-dramatic at times. The thing I found distracting was the layer Elkeles added by including scenes at school. The relationships between Maggie and Caleb and thier friends--current and/or former--came across as unlikely and at times outlandish. The story could have been more effective if the author spent more time developing the handful of main characters (and their interactions with one another) than pulling in a motley crew of supporting characters. I also felt that much of the dialogue was forced and not very true-to-life. Finally, several of the ""twists"" were predictable by about 30% into the book.

"This light read packed a big punch! The author took on so many themes and emotions central to 20-somethings growing up and growing into the people they were meant to be. And while several of the plot lines and twists were trite, It was an enjoyable read. Though, I think younger readers--I'm 28--would likely enjoy the book more than I did.One topic I saw several other reviewers mention was the author's use of ""episodes;"" most seem to find the book choppy as a result of the brief scenes. I felt very much the same as I began reading but I quickly realized that the vingettes were effective in conveying a mood.

Perhaps the most baffling part is how this book managed to earn 4- or 5-star reviews from all its reviewers before me....","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J4QP8PEIGXI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ARSNDQ#wasThisHelpful","R2J4QP8PEIGXI6","A2Y5780JCZLKJG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5780JCZLKJG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think (I HOPE) that Aunt Lydia's character was meant to be absurd. So thinking about her in that light, she was wonderful and truly the (only) saving grace of this novel. Other than the wackiness that ensued whenever Aunt Lydia entered a scene, there was nothing good about this story.The conflicts presented (abuse, oppression, sickness, alcoholism, etc) were handled in a very elementary way; the solutions offered up by the auther were all very predictable and didn't really leave me anticipating finding out how the book would end.Despite the fact that the story was predictable, I had a hard time finding anything believable in the book. I thought much of the dialogue was forced. I just could not picture anyone actually talking as these characters did...especially the women when they were discussing their abuse and/or marital problems. Same goes for the events in the book. For example, while psychic nights were hilarious to me, I couldn't see them happening in real life.Finally, the characters were unrelatable for me, personally. I didn't really connect with the women--almost all of whom are (or had been) abused. I found the women as a whole to be weak, which I think was exactly opposite what the author intended. And I didn't really care for the men who all fell into one of two categories--abuser or savior of women.The ONLY reason this book eked a second star out of me was because of the comedic relief sprinkled (sparingly) throughout.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HNBI3J3K5SK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OVLIJ2#wasThisHelpful","R1HNBI3J3K5SK9","A2Y5780JCZLKJG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y5780JCZLKJG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a sweet story. It's an easy read, with initial angst that was resolved without getting dragged out or continuously twisted. The writing was engaging and pretty tight. The story could perhaps have been fleshed out (although I like it as it is) and on a scale of great romantic prose, this perhaps only deserves a 4-star rating. However, it just left me feeling lighthearted and with a smile on my face, so I gave it one extra star.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD13QQGNO6HL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2O0WBA#wasThisHelpful","RD13QQGNO6HL0","AA5HLEE8ND8TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA5HLEE8ND8TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first time reading from this author. I did however hear good things about her work and anted to see it for myself. This young lady is one of the stars of literature in my eyes. She was not only able to tell a good romance story, she did it without going over board into erotica and the temptation that many of  our authors have these days to go over the top. This is the story about cultures and human emotions. The struggle between love and loyalty. What do you do when things are supposed to be one way but your heart wants it another? There are a lot of questions and answers within the pages of this book. There are a lot of moment where your eyebrows will raise and moments that will catch you off guard. This book builds you up through a romantic emotional roller coaster and it drops you off where you would never suspect to be. The book s fun and written in a way that is both entertaining and engaging. This author is on the top of her game. I salute her and give this book 5 stars because that is the maximum. If I could give more I would.

"This book is not only motivational but it is a fun book too. It is filled with different facts about nature and how the different animals respond to challenges that life throws at it. The book examines our thinking offering practical solutions to help us live better lives. There is so much to learn from this book. You learn about habits of the Mayfly and the eagle. You also learn about sharks. Fascinating tips of living and leaving. You learn when to run and when to stay.The book is written in an easy to read and understand style. The author explains the examples in ways that are mind opening. The pace is fast and the tone is very joyous. The author knows what it is the audience needs. One of my favorite sections in the book is when I learned that everyone who is a master was once a disaster. This hit home because I recently had the pleasure of looking at some of my earlier movies (I am an independent film producer) and wow, it was quite painful to watch at times. But when I think of where I am from where I was, I realize that yes I was a disaster but now I am a master.There are many people who struggle with life's issues day by day and some of them struggle for a long time. The author introduces us to cicadas. These creatures stay underground for 17 years. They work and toil. Then when they emerge they are ready to achieve their life mission. I found this example to be very inspirational. All in all, I recommend this book highly. I give it 5 starts!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23OJER5166LY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMR2456#wasThisHelpful","R23OJER5166LY4","AA5HLEE8ND8TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA5HLEE8ND8TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bill Ward has done it again. Another fast paced, suspenseful novel that has your heart pumping. This is a book that is about espionage and danger. After 16 years of being split from his brother, Pete Hammond must return to the UK to find out what happened to his now murdered sibling. This introduces us to a variety of interesting characters including his sister in law who he was once in love with and her boss who is very ominous. Ward has his own style in revealing his story. Though high tech and many things happening, we are able to easily follow the story and the motives of each and every character. The characters are well developed. We believe we know their motivations and what makes them click. It is here that the master of thrillers catch us and hit us with many twists and turns that make you stop for a moment, catch your breath and dig in once again. I am a former private investigator and love to figure espionage stories out before the book ends. I am normally right in 90% of the cases. Not so here. There are clever twists and turns.

"The greatest thing about poetry is that when it is done right, it can touch your very soul. Timeless Clock is one of those books. a collection of poems that covers many topics. There are many poems that send you through a multifarious amount of emotions. There are several poems about love and relationships. Then again some of the relationship poems are not about good relationships. They are about hurt, pain and anger. There is a lot of rejection within these words. There is a lot of screaming, a lot of crying. They become raw and gritty. Ms. Poindexter digs from within. One particular poem that lingers in my mind is one that she wrote to her father. Let's just say he was not the best parent in the world. She speaks to her lovers. She speaks to the world around her. Each poem identifiable in the inner emotions of being human. There are also poems of triumph and achievement. Tieless Clock is a timeless book that I recommend highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H1T3B1JD4V7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J35FC42#wasThisHelpful","R3H1T3B1JD4V7E","AA5HLEE8ND8TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA5HLEE8ND8TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is absolutely one of the best books of 2014. I was pleasantly surprised that the book was detailed, well researched and entertaining at the same time. A young woman marries a distinguished gentlemen and it seems like it will be  match made in heaven. It is exactly the opposite. The story takes off like a supersonic jet. It coasts at first but before long we are breaking the sound barrier. It is well written and very visual. So visual that this reader was captivated and became part of the story itself. As a movie producer, I could easily see this book turned into a motion picture. It takes you on an emotional roller coaster. It is written is such a way as you are always wanting to turn to the next page.The characters are well developed also. Joseph may be one of the best written villains in a long time. Ceila is also well developed. The author created them in a way where we understand their motives,who they are, what they want. These are three dimensional, flawed human beings trying to cope with the realities around them. This realism made this reader care about the predicament of these characters. Hoping for the best. Cringing at the raw brutality of one. Shaking my head at the choices of another.All in all, a well written not to be missed mastery of historical fiction literature! I highly recommend this book and enthusiastically give it 5 stars. This is an author you must look out for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F0N0HRVQJJD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FALY27Q#wasThisHelpful","R1F0N0HRVQJJD9","AA5HLEE8ND8TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA5HLEE8ND8TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all let me say that i juice all the time. Two to three times per day. I've experimented and have come up with great juicing formulas. I've read dozens of books on juicing. So when I run across a good juicing book, I become very enthusiastic and excited. This is a good juicing book filled with lots of recipes, lots of information. It is easy to read and explains things in a simple manner. The juices and smoothies taste great and are real. There is information that can help you choose which juices or smoothies is right for you. This book takes away much of the guess work as to which smoothie or juice to make for certain health benefits. I hgighly recommend this book for anyone interested in losing weight or gaining better health.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ULMOM8YILNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K704H98#wasThisHelpful","R20ULMOM8YILNT","AA5HLEE8ND8TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA5HLEE8ND8TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is a horror story that is packed with all the elements of a good horror story. It is well developed and surprisingly visual. It is written in Joan's unique style. It is clear cut and easy to read. It is suspenseful and chilling. Horror fans will not be disappointed and should pick up this entertaining book.

"I really never understood what gothic really meant. Heck, I'm a guy and not really into romantic reads. As I started to read I started to understand. It is a fast paced world filled with twists and turns. The images are so dark yet vivid. The story rolls by at a heart thumping fast pace. The author has mastered this style of writing and before long you are taken into this world. Fast paced and exciting filled with lots of romance and adventure. At times the book became hot & steamy. At other times mysterious. At other times scary. I found myself totally immersed in the story. Things build and then just when you want more, you realize there is more to come.In addition to being a great story the author developed her characters so well that you actually care about them. I wanted the best for Dante and Samantha. Even though there is an unhuman, erer immortal, I found myself concerned with what will happens to each character. There is something very believable and fresh about her choices for them. There are a few points where I cringed at the choices they made but I cringe at the choices I make in life too. A very good read, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NOX9XLGWN5CF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FVWNM0W#wasThisHelpful","R1NOX9XLGWN5CF","AA5HLEE8ND8TJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AA5HLEE8ND8TJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jessica Kong has done it again. This tale of two lovers from totally different worlds (literally) makes a bold statement about multicultural love and romances. The moral or lesson of the story is not an in your face type of way. There is no preaching or sermons, just two beings totally into each other. Their relationship and love is real. The obstacles they face because of it is telling.  It's a commentary on race relations, mixed cultures and everything that loves that is opposite on the outside. Our heroes must fend off many challenges in the entire world. The science fiction is intriguing. The story is engrossing. This book has all the elements of a great science fiction and romance mix.

"30 days of Romans, 30 days of God's magical, mystical words. There is power in this book. It is a ministry in itself. Not only does this book has selective verses from Romans to help you get through and entire month, it also has explanations of what these verses are actually saying. It is a positive book filled with Romans to help you make it through the day. It can be used for early morning food for thought. A great way to start the day. It can also be used before going to bed. In this society our souls are sick and injured through the repetitiveness of negative information coming at us through television, radio, news, gossip etc.  This is a great way to counter act these negatives.

"I'm very happy with this diffuser. It's cheap for what it does. Everyone who buys this wants to know how it compares to a Sto-Fen. The short answer is that the comparable sto-fen does work a little better. I'll explain why.The reason the sto-fen is better is because the sto-fen works more like a light bulb. The reason you buy these, is because you're trying to turn the flash into a light bulb instead of a light beam. This item is more like a semi-clear plastic box cover for the flash.. It projects more directional light out of the diffuser than the omni-directional sto-fen does.This item will still be better than a plain flash head if you are doing nightlife or night club photography. But you will lose more light to the ceiling than with the Sto-Fen.I still recommend this, because it's pretty good for the price. But just be aware that you'll get less lateral illumination with this than you do with a Sto-fen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9I65IV0UVOM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051XDOZO#wasThisHelpful","R9I65IV0UVOM9","A1C82BC5GNABOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C82BC5GNABOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So this is an amazing find. This is possibly the best album I've stumbled upon in the last 6 months. To preface my perspective, I loved the EDM remix of Lana Del Rey's Summertime Sadness. That was great, because it put her on the map for me. I noticed that the original cut of the song was a slower ballad, but I preferred the remix. Now that I've listened to this album twice, I think this is a great artist, and I will start to look into her earlier work since many people indicate that her other albums are equally as impressive or better. Shades of Cool is my top pick.

"I have received this battery case as a review sample, and I will provide an unbiased review.After a week of use, I found this battery case an essential accessory for my workphone.Here are some basic thing you need to know about this battery case.1. 3500mAh battery, this would be good enough to provide an extra full charge to the S6, you may get some power left depends on how you use the phone.2. Durable material with an excellent bumper design.3. Sync through capability, meaning you don't even need to take it off.For those of you who only want it for power, you will have two more additional ways to take off this case with ease:Method 1:1. Put the case face down, locate the small tab on the bottom left hand side corner.2. Separate the two pieces of the battery case.3. Slide the phone out of the case after removing the top piece of the case.Method 2 (if you have a long fingernail like me):1. Slide your fingernail between the phone screen and the bumper on the LEFT hand side of the case.2. Pull the bumper away from the case UPWARD3. Slide the phone out of the case.Be gentle when you slide the phone off the case, so you won't damage the port (as far as I can experience, people who are hasty may get the case damaged)I have included a few pictures here to show the case, it makes the phone looks tougher and durable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R311HFFEGVE4AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHOO5TK#wasThisHelpful","R311HFFEGVE4AH","AD4Y67RM8720J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4Y67RM8720J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I finally settled on this one after browsing on Amazon for a while. I can say I'm very happy with my decision. It has a sort of cushion to prevent your screen from getting scratched which is really nice. As far as the lens quality, they're pretty well made. Nothing like the movie studios use but they still capture nice shots. When I first tried the wide angle lens I was a little confused on how to make it work. I soon figured out you need to attach the macro and the wide angle lens to get the wide angle effect. All in all, this is a fantastic product and works well with my iPhone 6 plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HX6SKESJQYTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7S3MUQ#wasThisHelpful","R1HX6SKESJQYTW","AD4Y67RM8720J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4Y67RM8720J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was provided with a sample from the company and provide my unbiased review.The color of the actual case is slightly darker than the photo but, looks great. It fits well with the phone. The buttons and ports are all accessible.The charger cable that comes with the phone works fine. The case is slim but does not feel cheap. It slips in and out of a jean pocket without any problems. It feels good in my hand. It's smooth but not slippery. It has a high enough lip on the edge so if you lay the phone face down your screen is protected.I have not dropped the phone yet but I am also not worried though if I do based on how well this case feels in my hand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2453YMRQNOIEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VU707N2#wasThisHelpful","R2453YMRQNOIEI","AD4Y67RM8720J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4Y67RM8720J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It does make the phone a little bulky and slightly heavier as some may have stated but honestly, but it feels secure in my hand. I have no problem with that at all. It is just as sturdy as can be. One of my concerns before I purchased was that it would interfere with the signal but that is not the case. It is very easy to understand the mechanics behind the device. You'll notice that when all 4 LED lights are solid, you have a full charge, 1 LED means it is 25% charged and so forth. When you run out of battery on your phone, you simply press the button under the device to start the charge. It takes about 1.5-2 hours to fully charge as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R70P6BCVFH2BI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QW9ED88#wasThisHelpful","R70P6BCVFH2BI","AD4Y67RM8720J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4Y67RM8720J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this battery case for my new iPhone 6 plus a few days ago and I started to like this case.The case is very easy to snap on and off, making it simple to remove the phone when the case isn't needed. I also like that it comes with an extra bumper, so you can choose which one to use with your phone.The battery life was very good, and I was able to get my phone to a full charge within a short amount of time without having to carry around a separate battery booster and charging cable.One thing I have noticed that the USB cable came with the case is higher quality than others. I tried to use the cable I have from other brand with this case in my car but didnt work, when I switched and use the Zvolt one and it immediately turned my cars stereo into an iPodI give a high rating for this case, for the convenience of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKHJS8KD2Z7KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S01L348#wasThisHelpful","RKHJS8KD2Z7KZ","AD4Y67RM8720J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4Y67RM8720J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Alpatronix BX140 is one of the best I have received so far.I travel often and use my iPhone constantly. I've tried portable chargers and other battery cases.This design perfectly aligns with my phone, and doesn't impede or reduce effectiveness of any button functions.It has consistently given me a 100% charge, (though it is still new). The protective frame has rounded corners that send the phone into a slide upon impact. It also has a velvety texture that makes it comfortable and secure to grip. An added benefit, the standard micro USB adapter allows you to charge both iPhone and BX140 without a FireWire adapter.As I have a few different battery cases in hand, I am unsure which one would be the best one, but this Alpatronix BX140 has done an excellent job to protect and powerup my phone.One note...it came with a screen cover which I tried, but discarded within days. The raised edge on the BX140's cover frame is enough protection for me. It prevents the iPhone screen from touching when it's placed faced down.I would recommend this for my friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OUR0MUCKULEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPIPTQO#wasThisHelpful","R2OUR0MUCKULEJ","AD4Y67RM8720J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4Y67RM8720J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:42 Mins I have already done an installation video for the one I got on my iPhone 6, this video is made with my brother's iPhone 6 plus, again, I will take you through step by step on how to put the screen on. I strongly recommend this product to other clumsy people out there.To install:1. Start, by using the alcohol pad to clean your phones screen. Make sure you clean it well, any little trapped pieces of dust can create unsightly air bubbles later.2. Use the Micro Fiber cloth and dry the screen as thoroughly as possible.3. Next use the dust absorber and blot across the screen to pick up any last traces of dust left behind.4. Lay the screen protector face down (the removable film should be facing down) on the phone screen. Adjust the position until you have it just the way you like it.5. Take the guide stickers and press them over the edge of the phone. This will help hold the screen protector in place. You can use all three if you want, but I usually just use two.6. Now flip the screen over so the removable film is facing up and peel off the film.7. With the sticky side revealed, flip the screen protector back over and carefully place it into position. The guide strips should be doing most of the work for you.8. Use the micro fiber cloth to firmly press down, trying to keep air bubbles from rising. You can always use a credit card to help work out any air bubbles that do appear.If you have any questions or you want to see how this screen gets put on please feel free to leave any comments below and I will answer them for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L1FO85FFDWMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QW50G10#wasThisHelpful","R2L1FO85FFDWMN","AD4Y67RM8720J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4Y67RM8720J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 5:40 Mins This powerful 3000mAh battery case provides enough power to more than double the battery life of the native iPhone 6 battery. After doing some testing on my iPhone 6, my battery was able to last almost a full three days with fairly extensive use. That is incredible for a battery case.What set's the DX apart is its seemingly limitless amount of features. The simple fact that the battery case weighs only a couple ounces coupled with the thin frame is only the first plus that I saw from the case.The DX comes in 3 different colors, matte black, metallic red, and a glossy white.Additional features of interest are:-A raised lip which circumnavigates the screen, this allows you to place the phone face down on a table and not have to worry about the physical screen touching the surface.-Audio extender, screen protector, and micro-fiber cloth are included-Easy access to all ports and buttons-LED Power indicator with color defined lights-Ergonomic design for easy hand-holding-No rubber backing (means no sticking in your pocket)-Case can sync and charge so removing the case is not necessary-The battery case is Made for iPhone Certified by AppleA couple things have changed on the DX from previous models including:The battery case now charges itself for the first few minutes then charges the phone, this ultimately helps with battery life of the battery case itself.To turn the battery case ON or OFF, you must PRESS the power button for 2 seconds then RELEASE. This helps with accidentally turning the case on in a pocket or purse.Overall, the case has been great so far. The design is flattering for the phone, no extra bulk, and I appreciate the thought UNU has put into their product. I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV1HMRPSZ8SYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QN1TCDQ#wasThisHelpful","RV1HMRPSZ8SYO","AD4Y67RM8720J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4Y67RM8720J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:48 Mins Here are my thoughts:Design: One of the main reasons I decided to purchase this case is due to its size. True to its word, this battery case offers a helpful amount of additional power in an extremely thin size. While it does add some additional thickness, by no means do I think that it is bulky or large. It still can easily slide in and out of my pocket and still conveniently fits in my hand. The round curvature of the phone case helps the aesthetics of the case and makes it feel even smaller.Another nifty feature of the case is that it has a secure locking bumper. I previously had a phone case that had a removable bumper before and every time I dropped it, the case, bumper and phone flew apart on impact with the ground. Of course, I would probably drop it at the most inconvenient times and you could see me scurrying around to pick up the pieces. However, the battery case is made with a additional latches (for lack of a better word) which keep the case attached even when I drop it. No more running catching pieces of a case.Function: Overall, the function of the case is pretty straight forward. It charges my phone by about 100%, that's two times the charge (or in my case, a full days worth of power). If you are not a frequent user as I, you probably could get a full two days worth out of the phone + battery case.The case also is fairly protective. It covers all the corners and sides, and the drops/bumps I have had with it so far so seem to indicate that the casing is overall quite durable. There is also a small lip that goes around the screen which keeps the screen from touching the ground when placing the phone facedown.Overall, I think this UNU new battery case is a quality case. It's thin, lightweight, and provides me with enough power to at least get through one full day before I need to recharge, which is priceless when you're on the move all day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N9JWX4CWJ4J9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QN1T6NM#wasThisHelpful","R3N9JWX4CWJ4J9","AD4Y67RM8720J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4Y67RM8720J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had these cables from their last deal for a month already, based on my great experience with this product and I noticed people are having some issue with their product. So I want to do a quick review and share with all the users out there.1. The plugs are larger than the original iPhone 5 cord, but for me that is a big plus. I don't have dainty fingers. So for me it's always been a bit of an issue pulling the plug from my iPhone 5 as it is such a small plug. In contrast the Protak plug is beefier. Much easier to grip much easier to insert and remove. The plug size might be an issue for some iPhone 5 cases. I have the OtterBox commuter and this Protak cable fits without any issues whatsoever, and I can't imagine a case that would be problematic. Still, it could be an issue for some.2. The cord itself is thicker and heavier than the original iPhone 5 cord. This might be a negative to some. Being a man it speaks to my animal instincts. The cord feels more durable, sturdier. Only time will tell if that is true or not.So far these three Protak  Cable I have gotten have worked well for charging and syncing. I have seen a couple of reviews where people have complained that the plug was pulled away from the cord. My suggestion would be .......... don't pull out the cord by the cord. Pull it out using the plug! And with this beefy plug there's no excuses for using anything but the plug.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37WQN9WEY6875/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZZNZI6#wasThisHelpful","R37WQN9WEY6875","AD4Y67RM8720J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD4Y67RM8720J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know from having put many cat trees together that they work best built from the floor up. I tried it with this tree, contrary to the directions, and it didn't work at all. I couldn't put the last bit together because screwing the piece unscrewed the other end. I ended up having to take it completely apart and rebuild it from the top, which then left me with a heavy, awkward thing to bolt to the bottom board. The weight torqued pieces into positions that didn't work with the predrilled holes, so a fair amount of cramming was required. Definitely a nice unit IF you can get it together, though, and I'd consider it a medium-sized tree--definitely not a skimpy little one. My bad boys have not managed to turn it over yet, which is remarkable.PS--The shelves and non-vertical surfaces are covered with soft fabric, rather than carpet. No shedding shredded carpet all over the place! Time will tell how well the sisal on the vertical surfaces is attached; sometimes it comes loose and dangles dangerously.

"This carrier is very large and very open; in fact, it's the biggest of this type I've ever seen, and it's about the size of a medium to large plastic crate. The openness is cooler, but many critters, especially cats, may not be happy without less visibility (feeling safer in a hidey hole). On the plus side, this comes with a thin fake sheepskin pad, and the insert that gives rigidity to the bottom is unusually sturdy. As a species, however, my experience with soft-sides is that they don't stand up to claws or pee (corrosion of metal fittings) very well, so time will have to tell on that.

"I received this book as an ARC for an honest review.In this book we expand on Scott and Harlow's story. In this book after all they have gone through to just be together you would think that it would be smooth sailing, ya not happening. In this book Scott and Harlow are still trying to recover over the loss of their baby. Harlow is coming out of her depression but it is taking time. Not only is she having her emotional battles with herself she is also working both at her mom's cafe and Indigo. Not only is all of this going on but she is trying to make sure that she is there for Scott while he is dealing with any and all of the problems with Storm.Scott misses his woman and wants her whole. He is constantly feeling like he is being pulled in so many directions that in the middle of all of this Harlow is getting the short end from him. Scott feels he should be doing more to help bring back the woman he loves more than anything. He keeps wondering if he should push her more or will this cause her to pull back from him again. He is not sure what the right thing to do is but he knows that he can't loose Harlow again to her depression like he did before and he will do anything to make sure that doesn't happen. The only problem is the rest of the world didn't get that memo.This book is amazing it has so many twists and turns I want to tell you about but as a reader I want you to experience them for yourself. This will be another book in this series that you will read again and again. This book can be read as a stand alone but I recommend that you read it with the rest of the series to really understand what is happening in some parts. This book is amazing I am so impressed with how the author not only writes about the miscarriage from a woman's point of view but also how a man feels about the loss of a child. As well as what he must watch the woman he loves go through just to come back to herself again. This book will have you on the edge of your seat from the first word to the very end.

This is what has happened in this first book after taking a group on an sky diving exertion, her assistant tells her there is a new group that wants to take an extended camping trip in Canada.

"I received this book as an ARC for an honest review.In this book we meet Darlene and Erik. Darlene has spent most of her high school years feeling like she is less than her stepbrother. She feels like her dad and stepmom care more about what her stepbrother does and no matter what she does good or bad she will never be good enough. One day however that isn't the feeling she has when her father calls her and lets her know that her stepbrother has been injured in Afghanistan. Darlene wants to still hate the golden child but there is a part of her that is really worried. The real question she has to answer is what happens to them all when he comes home?Erik had a plan it was to be in the Marines until he was old and had to retire. This was not what he saw happening to himself. While on a mission one of the trucks incurs an IUD though the people in the truck are ok a second shot is fired in the general direction they are at. Erik thinks everyone made it out unscathed until he looks down and sees his leg in one spot and his foot in another. Erik has seen it happen before so he believes he will get the prosthetic, learn how to use it and be back in the field. However the military informs him that is not the case. Now Erik has to deal with life as a civilian. What is he going to do now that his plan has literally blown up? Also what does he do with the knowledge that his step-sister hates him, when all he wants is her?This is a great story about dealing with what happens in war and how all the members in a family might deal with it. This story really shows us also that people who have gone through some addictive things though they think they have it all figured out can slip into old destructive patterns very easily. I was very impressed with how as the book goes on it really deals with many dynamics in this family and really shows us with love you can see things in a different light.

"I received this book as an ARC for an honest review.In this book we meet Willow and Kane. When this book opens up we meet Willow as a young girl who has been in the same car accident that killed her mother. Her father can't stand her and her sister wants nothing to do with her so what's a girl to do in this situation? Stuff it all down an hope that at some-point it will get better. Next we see that life didn't get better for Willow it just changed as to who was verbally abusive to Willow. After she marries the first guy to show interest in her she realizes her mistake but isn't sure she will ever meet anyone better. So now we are where Willow is getting a divorce after she caught her husband and sister in bed together. Willow has learned with the help of therapy that she deserves better but can she really accept going for more in her life. When she stands up in her lawyers office spills the contents of her purse and falls down from catching on the broken strap. Willow finds that there might be someone out there willing to actually accept her and give her that more.Kane sees Willow in the lawyers office and immediately feels protective and wants her to be with him. However the more he looks at her the more he knows that to get the girl of his dreams he is going to have to tread lightly and give her the time to see him like he sees her. Kane wants to give Willow the world but to watch her retreat into herself while she is around him is not acceptable. He is determined to get his woman and to make her whole again, no matter how long that might take.This book is amazing. It really shows us life can be better if we are willing to open up to the possibility of something more and something better. This book also shows us that you can't always judge a book by it's cover sometimes even the most put together people on the outside are the ones that are falling apart on the inside. This book will show you about love, acceptance, and the chance to really fight for that something more. This book is for anyone and everyone.

In this book we also find out who Chloe feels about herself and what her relationship has done not only to her self confidence but also the way that she sees her body.Gabe knows there is more to Chloe than what he is seeing her become he just wonders if she is to rapid in this guy James to see what he is doing to her. Gabe wants to rush in and save the day as well as be Chloe's hero but he knows he can't do that. He knows there is still that strong brave woman in there he just wants to be there when she needs a hand as she saves herself.I was very impressed with this book. I have been a big fan of the way that J.S. has written her books to show not only what domestic violence can do to a woman's body but also to her mind. I am also impressed with how she shows how it isn't something that will go away overnight just like it doesn't start overnight. In this book we see what James mental abuse has done towards conditioning Chloe to do what he wants when he wants it. I also like how she shows that any of us can give an help no matter if it is time or money we can all help make a difference in this growing problem. This is an amazing book that not only touches on what abuse can do to a person but with help how they can come out the other side. I would highly recommend this book and all the books that J.S. has done in this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16ZEA0K1K4S2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCJYHLW#wasThisHelpful","R16ZEA0K1K4S2Z","A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When this story starts out we find a young Tegan running from a Rhino-beast and unable to call upon his dragon to help him get out of the situation. Tegan was dropped off when he was young and was never properly taught how to bring forth his dragon so when he needs it most he has problems bringing it to the forefront. On this day though another dragon happens to be flying by and sees Tegan's problem he stops to help the young boy and the more questions he asks the more he learns how alone this boy is. Grey is not the type of man or dragon to leave a young-ling on his own so he takes him home to be a part of his clan. Tegan is not sure what to do with such kindness but vows to make the man proud that he took him in that day. Years later Grey's clan has made a pact with the human clans that have sprouted up in the area. They will trade protection from other dragons for goods. Grey knows something has happened though and he is to old now to go investigate on his own so he asks Tegan to find out and bring the information back to him.

"I received this book as an ARC for an honest review. I will start this out by saying I have yet to find this author put out a bad book and this one is no exception.In this book we meet Storm and Raylin. Raylin is on the run from the mob who believe according to her brother and father have the two million dollars that they borrowed from them. Raylin never had the money but knows if they catch her they want more than money from her. She is carrying more secrets than the one of her family but who can she trust. She is always more worried about others more than herself in fact when she thought the mob figured out who she was she ran from her home with her roommate Maggie (girlfriend of Rafe from the men of ink series) just to protect her. She ends up in Boca and breaks into a home that looks very run down. On her first day there she sees a very attractive man working on a fence she can't help but stare but draws up short on letting him catch her. Ray is sure that no one will want her for her so when she does finally meet Storm she is leery of his intentions.Storm has his own secrets like the first being his real name. He is not sure what to make of this woman he just met but his feelings for her are so sudden and so possessive he knows he can't let her go. Storm also knows that she is lying to him for two reasons first she is an open book and can't lie to save her life, second he knows the place she claims to be house sitting has been sold and the old owners are suppose to come and remove their stuff soon. In the short time they spend together Storm knows that he has to find a way to keep this woman for always not just for a short time, but will she leave him when she finds out he is keeping secrets as well?This is an amazing book about love, acceptance, and fighting for what you want. I thought this book is amazing and keeps you on the edge of your seat from the first word to the very end. This is the fist book in at least a three part series. I believe that you will be able to read them all on their own but you should really read this story to understand who all of the main players will be in this series. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Also after the author notes look for a short story about the first time Maggie and Ray get to see each other. Even if you haven't read Maggie's and Rafe's story this will have you smiling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GF81JQMQU06A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WKG9P2#wasThisHelpful","R1GF81JQMQU06A","A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this book as an ARC for an honest review.In this book we find out more about Ellie and Jax. When this book opens up we find out what happened happened to Ellie after she and July are taken from the farmhouse. Ellie is taken to the hospital to get her re-hydrated and to allow her to sleep. The problem with this is all Ellie can think about is her daughter Hope, and the need to make sure she is safe. Ellie doesn't know what to do now that she is safely out of the kidnappers hands since it was her own mother who sold her to them in the first place. Knowing that she isn't safe at home doesn't make her feel that being with Jax is any better of a solution. However she finds out while living with him that even though she isn't sure about them as a couple this is possibly the safest place for her.Jax has always known about the boom. He and his cousins had heard about this from their uncles for as long as he can remember. However he didn't expect to feel like this when he met her. The day he sees Ellie coming out of that farmhouse is the day he knows that he has found his boom. The thing is how does he make her realize that she is not only his right now but his future as well. He knows everyday he is with her the more he wants to be with her. He knows to get the girl he has to make sure that she and her little girl are safe from the people who took her. The more he learns about these guys the more he knows he has to keep her safe.This book is another hit out of the park for this author. Jax's is the first story in the Until Him series that looks to be as good if not better than the original until series books. In this book we find a book about love, acceptance, and a chance to hold on to something amazing when life tries to take it at every turn. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone and everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F7DRCEGOSZJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015EPMZ0I#wasThisHelpful","R2F7DRCEGOSZJP","A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this book as an ARC for an honest review.This is the third book in the Fire and Steel MC book. In this book we meet Nora and get the rest of the story on Thrash. When this book opens up we find Thrash at an art gallery looking at both the paintings and one of the artists that seems to be in the gallery that day. Nora can't seem to take her eyes off the man in the gallery not only is he hot but he also is interested in her art not just the way she looks. When he tells her he wants to purchase on of her pieces she is happy because she is a struggling artist. When she is offered a commission to paint a mural in the club house she is ecstatic. This will not only give her money to pay her current bills but also to help her get ahead the only problem is trying to constraint with Thrash around.The instant Thrash sees her he thinks she is hot when he speaks with her he knows that there is more to her than meets they eye though. When he finds her in his clubhouse to paint a mural he knows he has to find out all he can about her and make her his. The problems with this is his club doesn't leave him with much time for flowers and romance. He also isn't sure once she knows the real him if she will really want to stick around.This book is amazing. It can be read as a stand alone but I would recommend reading the first two just so you understand all of the people in the story as well as why they are fighting their fights right now. This book also asks the questions can two people from different backgrounds really be together for the long haul? Or will series threats break them apart. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39EOQYQAKILRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QN5PUU#wasThisHelpful","R39EOQYQAKILRK","A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this book as an ARC for an honest review.In this book we get to find out more about Griff and we meet Sophia. In this story we learn why Griff is so quite and how he came to be with Storm. We also learn about all of the infighting since the death of Marcus and what it is doing to not only Scott but Griff as well. Griff is a private man but in this book he learns where his real family lies and what he will do for them. Griff is given the gift of a woman who not only sees him for the bad-ass he is but also the side that wants a family of his own one day. However in this quest Griff got burned really bad by a woman and is now leery of all woman and figures the one and done method is all he is after. That is until he see a woman one night that have him wanting to know more about her.Sophia hasn't had a life filled with love and flowers she has had a hard time. 6 years only Sophia found a piece of her family that she had never known existed in a sister named Megan. Sophia has always wanted to love and be loved and if she can have a family to call her own that would be the icing on the cake. However finding that love has left some scars that have her looking for the real thing or nothing at all. So when Sophia meets Griff one night she learns he has his one and done method is all he is after and she is looking for the real thing.The question then is asked can two people who have been hurt in the past really find the future they are looking for in each other? As well as with all the storms (no pun intended) brewing in the club can Griff and Sofia find a way to balance a possible future both inside and outside the club?This book will have you hooked from the first word to the very end. It is a stand alone but I would recommend reading the other books in this series to make some of the references make sense because they occur in other books. There is so many things that happen in this book that I want to tell you about but as a reader I want to find them out on my own not have someone tell me about it and be looking for it and miss other great parts in a story. Pick up your copy today you will not be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PIUSD32Q49XB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPCLT0S#wasThisHelpful","R3PIUSD32Q49XB","A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this book as an ARC for an honest review.In this book we meet Howard (Hawk) and Alexis (Alex). Hawk and Alex have been friends since they were little but when they were in high school their feelings changed but neither had the guts to tell the other. A couple of weeks before graduation Hawks mother dies of a heart attack or at least that is what the official report says but he knows it was something more and confronts his father about what he learns. His father threatens him and makes sure he leaves town the hard way. 6 Years later he is back and ready to finally claim his woman and make sure his father feels his full wrath.Alex missed and needed Hawk all those years that he has been gone, but there is no changing the past now. Alex knows she has to stand on her own two feet and stand up for herself and her sister. The appearance of Hawk can mean nothing now. As long as she keeps telling herself that right.The beginning of this book was a little hard for me to get into but one I was able to really get into the heart of the characters I was unable to put it down. This book has many twists and turns to it. It will have you on the edge of your seat to the very end as well as saying who did what? There is so much I want to tell you about this book but feel it would ruin the overall story-line the author is going for. This book is part mystery and part romance. Over all it is an amazing read and I would recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5JE7VAZ1WUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143195J8#wasThisHelpful","R2E5JE7VAZ1WUE","A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UQGX6YMQ5BAL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was sick and went to use my digital thermometer and the battery was dead . Was quick thinking and used my laser thermometer for heating , cooling and mechanical work then ordered these batteries . No expiration date but worked great . Have 9 extra for the price of buying 2 in town and having to spend $6 on gas to get them . Make sure you put them in the right way usually the lip goes down print up ...usually . Put the extra in the drawer and made sure I turned the thermometer off after using it .

"Some of the reviews were kind of sketchy saying they were thin , low quality , and shed allot . I found that was not the case . I usually buy Calcott which are very expensive unless on sale . Calcot towels are high quality and were full price when I needed a set while these were on sale . It was a great buy . They do fluff up and become softer overtime . While I did get some lint it was normal . Stitching and design band was very good quality . These are nice towels for everyday and the bath sheets are huge . For some they may be too large for everyday use and hard to towel off with . They may even take up too much room on a towel bar . However they are fine for me . The 30 by 54 inch bath size are nice too . I am very pleased with my purchase . These are nice for other uses also  I plan on using one bath sheet across the rear seat of my car and two smaller bath size on the front seats for protection plus to always have towels in my car that match the upolstry  if needed for drying it after a wash  , or the beach . I will be ordering more .","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RINSOBAGP686/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DAPNLI0#wasThisHelpful","RINSOBAGP686","A22QKNGN59XYZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22QKNGN59XYZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best deal in Brake Controllers and the type of unit you want proportional not timed . It adjusts itself to up and downhills and proportionally to how hard your braking . The price was heavily discounted when I purchased so it was a no brainer . However the full price is not unreasonable . The only item this does not have is pocket mounting . In other words you have to mount it in with a bracket and screws . However it is only 4 or two to remove . Some have a bracket that mounts to the vehicle and you can just plug in and put the controller in the pocket mount . When you are not using the controller you unplug the back and pull it out storing it inside out of the heat or cold . You mount a pocket bracket on each tow vehicle you have thus needing only one unit for up to several tow vehicles . I will be ok as I primarily have one heavy tow vehicle though all my vehicles are set up to two any trailer I own . This was nice because Curt also makes plug in adapters for controller ready vehicles which my 94 Ford Van is . I just pluged in the pigtail into my wiring harness and then into the back of the controller . I had this installed in 10 minutes all one needs is a drill , a 1/8th inch drill bit and a phillips screw driver or 1/4 inch socket . With a nice new drill bit it took only 20 seconds to drill each screw hole for the mounting bracket . You mount the bracket to the controller then it has the dash or other area mounting holes on the outside of the bracket so you can drill it in place then place and tighten the screws . You just make sure where you are drilling there are no wires or items you could damage . It could not be easier . I am disabled and had it done and working in 15 minutes they do ask you disconnect the negative battery cable while installing . That takes a few minutes and a 3/8 wrench in my case and it is a good time to clean the terminals with a cable end cleaner which should be done yearly before winter . I have found Curt hitches and other products to be truly higher quality then other companies products including Reese and Draw Hitch both big players . I recommend Curt very highly . In my case if a car is prewired and can take the pigtail I mount the controller if it needs to be wired I have the dealer do it and it costs $250 here with the controller included in the cost .

"Purchased on sale so very pleased on price . Product is as advertised . Lasts well too but they suggest you touch up or reapply when you clean the inside a few times a year . Spills will bead up . Further other nasty's will not stick as easy and whipe up easier like chocolate , lipstick , the things that shouldn't but do come in contact with interiors . I suggest buying a few extra cans just store inside at room temp . I like to do the humps between mats . Did the two light coats with a day between and leaving the windows down in the garage overnight . Just as good as paying $250 for fabric protection at the dealer and the time to put it on is when the seats are new , clean and not stained . If you ever eat in your car then this is a must have ..period . You will be happy the first time you spill anything . Even works on the floor carpet but again you will seal in dirt so everything must be as clean as it can get before applying .

"I am very pleased . I wrote already under comments while waiting for these . I have no worries about them lasting longer then the 2 year warranty . They are marked SUV truck mats . I put them in a 2000 Mercury Grand Marquis they fit the front perfect , and the back were too large going up the back rail . I prefer not to trim and just want to protect the carpet and am very pleased . Worth $10 more which I more then saved  on gas and time . Measurements are exact and they are 3/8 to 1/2 inch deep as one poster measured . Very good Mats I bought a can of 3 m car fabric protector and for $35 treated the front area and put mats down to protect my low mileage car and keep it like new . I treat the seats then put down towels to match across the rear and both buckets . Yes they move and I just straighten them out . These mats wont they fit tight in my vehicle . However they should be fine and worst case put a tac through down into the carpet fibers to hold in place . Unless these are too big for your car they are the ones you want if protection and keeping water off the inside is your desire . They are not ugly but also not the flashy pretty type either . You could not get better unless you spent $100 for weather tech laser cut for your specific car . Also a worthy choice . For my Grand Marquis I think these are as good . The weird pattern is so you can trim them easily for other vehicles .","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29CDKWGN97OWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMMCI38#wasThisHelpful","R29CDKWGN97OWQ","A22QKNGN59XYZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22QKNGN59XYZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found these to be the best filter for my home . You do not want to restrict air flow and they do when getting dirty if left in for too long . I am do that accidently often so anything stronger would be a huge mistake for me . These have better flow then the 300 amazingly . They are stronger then other filters and slide into tight places better due to no criss crossing or wire mesh . Yes they cost a little more but I believe their worth it . I make sure I write on a index card mounted to the furnace when I change them . My mind is a mess becuase were often off . I try to change this every 3 months . You can hold them up to a light and if you cannot see through obviously its too dirty to use . I like buying these 6 packs on amazon you wont find a better price and with prime its here in two days or 4 over a weekend . I also have a humidifier that says change the filter yearly . I have learned to do it every 6 months . Water system too . My house requires allot of filters and you do get what you pay for .

"This worked very good for me . You must add up both your draws and make sure your power supply is strong enough . I used these for a 60 degree IR Lamp that lights up everything to about 20 meters outside my home from inside . This lamp is under $20 here . However I wanted to be able to see further so I bought the 48 LED illumiator that is about $12 but has a tight spectrum it pushes out to about when paired with the 60 degree wide spectrum to about 100 feet or a little more with a narrower focus on the long end  but enough to light up something passing through to film or for me to see it which is what I need . IT is as good as a single 96  LED lamp that are used in parking lots that are narrow beam but get out 130 feet  and perfect for me . The reason being  is the 48 led round cameras take 2 inch 48 LED circuit board replacement parts easily found for $3 each so you can repair them easily because none of these lamps last like they claim . The other important point is if one dies your still illuminated where if you use one and it goes out your blind until you catch it . So it is worth $36 instead of $29 for a single 96 led lamp for all the parts to have 2 illuminators to get  96 leds with wide spectrum .  I would  say normal life is about 1.5 years for a IR lamp used daily  . The 196 lamp is $89 both these cost $38 with $4 for the splitter and will run on a quality 2 amp dc power supply . I have done it on the 1 amp but they get warmer so i use overkill especially when drapes are near . This works for me . I have only one window where I like the 300 ft lamp but otherwise am very happy with this set up and the splitter . Those 54 LED 60 degree IR lamps are perfect for indoor rooms . I use one in the garage . People just think their covered in darkness if they turn on the lights you see them better .","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20FUAFG1LGGX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01220T7BS#wasThisHelpful","R20FUAFG1LGGX0","A22QKNGN59XYZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22QKNGN59XYZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I still have so much more to learn but I love it. You find things you never will if you do not study and it is set up so you can quit and then start anywhere or where you left off each time . Installs right on the machine and you do not need the disc to use it after you have registered the product . I did have to put in a code key which is included . With windows 8 you have to have a microsoft account too just to set it up . I hadn't used mine since they had euchre online based on XP which was eliminated when they upgraded to Vista due to the expense of redoing everything . In fact games online have really never recovered from then we still keep a xp computer to play our old hasbro and other games written for it .","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N56I57CFMK7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLA5P5M#wasThisHelpful","R3N56I57CFMK7O","A22QKNGN59XYZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22QKNGN59XYZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not used this bulb enough to give a real review but there was some information that needs to be given . First this will work with most Magnetic and Digital Ballasts . Second it will not appear very bright because it has red and orange spectrum's overbalanced to the white or daylight range because it promotes fruiting and flowering . I have tried this in my Iolite digital ballast because their bulbs keep cracking ..they do not last long but are also good while they do and a fraction of expensive bulbs some of which do not work with both ballasts . I do not understand it but all bulb makers will tell you these MH and MPS bulbs use more electric as they age so your better off changing them more often . They usually recommend every 2 years . These bulbs are about 1/3 the cost of the high end offerings so if they did burn out and they all do you will still come out ahead if yeilds are equal . On that be your own judge but I have found the incremental difference is not proportionately justifiable . Good luck may your gardens grow healthy organic produce that is State Fair quality .","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IYH9C9PMHW5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006TX06UG#wasThisHelpful","R1IYH9C9PMHW5Q","A22QKNGN59XYZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22QKNGN59XYZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not thrilled with this . The most important feature to me was range . I have Yard decorations that are about 60 ft from my back porch so I hoped this would reach if I went out in my PJ's and just stuck my hand out the door in winter and pressed the button to turn things off when high winds come through . Sadly I have to  go outside in the snow and it only reaches about 15 ft . Still better then having to pull plugs but not what was described . Also the design calls for mounting on a wall or stake above ground . Rain can short it out not acceptable for a outdoor component . I kept mine because at the price I paid it would of cost as much to send it back netting me zero for returning it . I have been using it . I had a couple of the SVAT remote switches in the past and they were fine just didn't last long about a year . I could get better range out of them and they never shorted out in rain just sitting on the lawn . I even used them inside with my old airconditioner that didnt have a temp switch on it . That one could handle the amps though I found a better switch with a plain thermostat in it later that was a better fit . . If you just have Christmas lights and can put this where you can walk up inside the house within 15 feet of it go ahead and buy this if it is cheaper . Otherwise I would order 2 SVAT  Remotes 1 to use and another for when it fails . They are handy . I use them for yard decorations and lights year around . They are handy when camping also . Wake up in the middle of the night just hit the key fob and turn on a string of lights hung around your screen patio and tent . You can a fob where everyone knows where it is too if your sharing a tent . Nice way to make a remote lamp in a garage too . Just plug a  hanging lamp into it and plug it into a outlet . When you need a light just reach in your pocket for the key fob and push the button . The SVAT ones had a few frequencies so you could have more then one when I purchased them . I think there were three but it was just dumb luck not to get a match . Drive way Patrols are the similar too though in some applications different frequencies are not necessary . Woods makes good products . I use their power chords and love their timer switch which I put on my electric bike chargers.

"I use the woolite dry cleaning sheets to do my dry cleaning at home but still love to have washable dress pants . These are so nice with the expansion waste that is all self adjusting . The pants are lined down past the knee with a high quality lining . The pockets are shallow but the wallets have buttons . It has a button at the top of the zipper / fly . Hemming was spot on no issues and you do get a cuff . I have lost weight and it has been expensive this year as last years clothes won't fit . These were a affordable great new addition to Church and Work pants . Very pleased I love the material too for dress and with the lining it is fine year round . I highly recommend these affordable dress pants at the full price which I paid .

"Decent head lamp . I prefer the 135 and 200 lumen ones they make and keep one in all the vehicles as well as a go to spot on every floor should the power go out . We use them in place of flashlights too as well as for going for walks etc . I even use the 200 lumen for when i go on bike rides as a backup I carry in my pocket . My regular headlamp has a t-9 bulb and lithium batteries with a charger built in . There cheap now they used to be near $100 and they have been about $15 lately so I bought one for each bicycle . I always carry a spare though because I always forget to keep the batteries charged and there is nothing worse then being either stranded needing to work on something in the dark or having to peddle home on a bumpy road with potholes and no way to see them . The switch on this is a good one a push in not a slider . The sliders are junk they will turn on in your pocket and leave you with dead batteries . Never buy one with a slider switch . Some of the energizer headlamps have them and are junk . Now remember the stronger the lamp the less hours you get but these use AAA batteries easy to keep in your pocket and if you haven't already found out very affordable after the initial expense when you switch to rechargeable batteries . The  Panasonic Enuloops ( they bought out Sanyo ) will take 2100 charges and keep 70^ of their charge for 5 years in storage . You can't beat that . You can even put the AA's into adapters to work in D and C cell applications .","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHM3B0MLYWTW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XVW83U#wasThisHelpful","RHM3B0MLYWTW6","A22QKNGN59XYZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22QKNGN59XYZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking for a new sock in black . One I could wear to the office or Church but comfortable unlike paper thin dress socks . I bought a pair of Thorlo's  Walking Crew socks that were very expensive 12 a pr and these 3 for 16 bucks . I wanted to see if there was a difference . They both are nice material and well made . I like the stitching on the Asics better but they advertise high padding / cushion and that just is not true . They are nice lightweight socks and will be my go to hot weather black pairs . For comfort and most of the year I will wear the much superior Thorlo walking crews in black . They were what I would call medium weight socks with very noticeable cushion / padding . They had a nice sheen and no wording or contrasting grey that shows over the top of your shoe just a little . These are not bad socks but I wanted a true cushion at the heel , toe and laces . I wanted something heavy enough for winter and these are just about as thin as a dress sock . Not quite but darn close . I bought x large and wear 12.5 or 13's and they were a good fit . Have a little room for shrinkage . Will update as I learn more about durability and shrinkage . They are nice material and feel above average . They look nice . They will work well when cool is more important then comfort . Of course then I might just as well wear the super thin dress socks .

"I have always bought my socks from Hanes , Walmart etc but no longer . They have a 30% off coupon for Christmas 30CLOTHING right now is the code . They come to 7.83 a pr for the XL which are perfect for my size 12.5 feet . I like the larger ones and my feet are not wide . They fit so nice . I love the feel of the material and extra padding . I was wearing dress socks in my Keens for Church and they were too thin . These are perfect so my shoes fit better . My feet are more comfortable and warmer and of course with the extra padding they last longer as I am guilty of always walking around the house in my socks wearing them out quick. I bought one pair first and was so pleased I bought another right away . I was a little worried but these are fine for Church or the Office as long as you have room in your shoes for the extra padding and their not that heavy . I would say medium weight so as long as your shoes are not tight in dress socks you will be fine . Very nice shine to the material I have only had them a short time so I will comment later on durability and shrinkage . I know I will be fine I order size XL which is mens 13 to 15 . I have a 12 and do wear a 13 in some footwear so I went with the larger size and they are perfect . I am 6ft 1 in 190 pounds also .These are very nice socks though very expensive .  God Bless .Here it is a little while longer . I want more but I just can't afford these at the regular price . I keep checking back to see if they have a sale like they did at Christmas so I can get a few more pair . After wearing these I find myself wanting to wear them everyday . I also learned a big lesson that the big box socks that are always size 8 to 12 are too small I need the 13 to 15 or XL size here . Keeping my fingers crossed they have a sale again like before so I can load up and buy a pair for every day of the week . No more cotton socks for me .","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GWRCA2C1TPAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A77VGPO#wasThisHelpful","R3GWRCA2C1TPAO","A22QKNGN59XYZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22QKNGN59XYZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a fantastic price for all the 46 plus minute episodes 111 of them with some extras . Michael Landon and Victor French both  outdid themselves with this series . Every show teaches life lessons and is suitable for all ages . The perfect show for family tv night . Do up a little popcorn or fruit and cheese slices and enjoy . Clean shows no worries though some may entertain subjects that are difficult for even adults to ponder though  they are suitable for all ages . Important values are taught through often heartwarming story plots based on Christian beliefs as you follow Angel Johnathon along his travels with his friend Marc . This is tv the way it was meant to be . Shows after the first year are edited for TV time slots but absolutely wonderful .

I wish the pockets had zippers but the description said they did not . They are decent though I will use a fanny pack for my wallet and keys after having them fall out before . Very sharp I would not feel out of sorts wearing these when running up to the store like regular sweats . Slim fit with plenty of stretch for big guys .

"I really enjoyed reading Vindicated.  It was a well written book with an interesting storyline.  The characters were easy to like and root for.  Karly came from a troubled past and was working two jobs trying to go to college so she could make her life better.  The only highlight in an otherwise tough life was her sister Emma.  Until she runs into a one night stand she had had six months past. Still noting the heavy attraction there for Randy they started a cat and mouse relationship.  Randy couldn't commit since he had been burned in a previous relationship.  He too had a troubled past and a dark present.  The author does a great job of telling their story and bringing things together.  They each had to work through some serious issues to find love.  I enjoyed the secondary characters and what was going on with them.  It just added so much more to the overall story.  Great book and great read.  I highly recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCY6FIQ8I0J6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P86LPFA#wasThisHelpful","RCY6FIQ8I0J6H","A38I2YE5DPF9PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38I2YE5DPF9PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Both managed to go on with their lives and it wasn't until one long flight to London that they met up again.  Bobbi is the Captain of the 747 and was taking a break when she walked by and was very shocked to find Mack looking up at her.  Mack couldn't believe his eyes.  He hadn't seen Bobbi for over 40 years and here she was standing in front of him.  They find that fate has thrown them together again after all this time but both have secrets they aren't ready to share.  Will spending time together enable them to capture what they once had?

"Rough story full of all kinds of evil and danger.  Through all that danger is the beginning of a love story.  Hard to believe any love can be born out of evil.  Star is witness to murder and taken by a biker gang.  Remy is compelled to keep her safe and alive.  The author does a good job of telling their story.  Its full of a lot of emotion.  Can Star survive and can Remy save her?  Will have to read part two to see how their story continues.  It was a very dark kind of read and not something I think I'll be reading on to find out what happens.  Just too dark for me.  I'm more of a happy kind of reader.

Lily is doing this to help keep her dad out of prison due to health issues.  I just wish we would have known a little more about Aidan and what made him the way he is.  We get bits of his story but not enough to totally understand where he is coming from.  Lily I get its her need to help family that puts her in this situation.  As Lily gives herself over to Aidan and his needs she is finding it harder to keep her feelings out of it.  Aidan feels for her more than he has ever allowed himself to feel and he is not liking what she makes him feel.  Not sure if the story was enough to make me want to read the next book in this series or not.  Just didn't do that much for me.  The sex scenes were good but its all its based on.

Lila and David come together with a bit of humor and end up leaning on each other after they try and work through all the emotional turmoil they are both going through.  The author does a great job of telling their story.  We get to learn what it is that Lila and David have issues with and how it affects their relationship.  The storyline has some danger that they have to face as well as all the emotions they have to work through.  I really enjoyed how they managed to work things out to reach their HEA.  All the characters were well developed and easy to follow.  Was just a good heartwarming feel good story and I highly recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G8ODO0T66EQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JM4CLFW#wasThisHelpful","R3G8ODO0T66EQT","A38I2YE5DPF9PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38I2YE5DPF9PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed reading The Omega's Heart by R. E. Butler.  Jeremiah is a man/wolf that comes with his own set of problems.  Mostly the fact he has never been able to shift to a complete wolf and feels less of a man/wolf because of that one DNA flaw.  Honey is running from her family problems and just wants to start over somewhere safe.  She takes refuge with Jeremiah's pack and agreed to move on after the full moon.  That is until she comes in contact with Jeremiah and realizes he is her mate.  Together they overcome the baggage they both have to find the love that mates have for each other.  But it doesn't come without a bit of danger.  The author did a great job telling their story and bringing it all together for the reader to get the HEA needed.  The characters were easy to connect with and follow.  Overall it was a very entertaining story and one I would highly recommend to readers who enjoy a good shifter story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRRHI43WFWEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6ZJKBM#wasThisHelpful","RRRHI43WFWEK","A38I2YE5DPF9PT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38I2YE5DPF9PT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Tucker knows the moment he meets her that he wants her especially after hearing about her for years.  Now he just needs to convince her it's what she wants too.

" 7:46 Mins The Boruit RJ-5000 is one heck of a headlamp.  It shouldn't even be called a headlamp, more like a head flashlight because that is what it feels like.  I do want to disclose that I was provided a sample for review purposes.  Take what you will but this is a solid little headlamp that has the power of a flashlight on your head.Amazon limits videos to 100 megs, so I have left a comment with a link to the high resolution version of this video.Ok, so let me get right into it.  This headlamp is heavy, 14.4 ounces to be exact.  At first, that was a huge turnoff for me, I will have to admit.  It was big, bulky and heavy.  Not exactly friendly words to the hiker, backpacker or weekend warrior.  It is huge and heavy but you know what, it is also incredibly ergonomic.  I quickly got used to the large plastic mold in the front and the ever so slightly curved battery pack in the rear.  After walking around with it for a few minutes I got used to the weight and thought this isn't so bad after all.  The weight is pretty nicely distributed throughout as well and with a 3 band design you can be assured that this headlamp is fully adjustable and will not easily fall off your head if you set the bands to the correct lengths and tensions.Next came me using it.  I was blown away by how bright it was.  I did not like the large center light because it had a large hotspot right in the middle.  However, the side flood lights were awesome.  Due to their positioning and optics, they did not produce a hotspot and actually did a great job of providing a nice wide illumination area with no hot spots.  Then I tried all three and that was pretty bright, almost too bright, until I went outside in total dark.  That is where this light really shines.  It beats every other headlamp I have ever had or seen.  It actually takes a little getting used to but if you can bear with it for a little time hopefully it will become your preferred headlamp as well.  I quickly found myself using the two side floods and walking around my backyard with no problems whatsoever.  I took this lamp camping with me and that is where the three lights all on at the same time was useful.  I also used the three lamps on when I helped my boss put in a recessed can in his attic.  His attic had no lighting and I had no problems with seeing up there.You get (2) 4000 mAh Boruit Lithium ion batteries, which can hold a lot of juice, are rechargeable and you can easily find extras on Amazon.  You get two chargers, a USB one with a smiley face and an AC one.  They work fine and I like how the company gives you the USB one.  I would expect the AC charger, which is faster but the USB charger is really nice.  You could pair this with a USB battery charger on your trip or charge it from your car.  It just opens up a whole lot of options for ease of convenience in recharging.The one thing I did not like about this light, in addition to the center hot spot and the weight (which they can't really do anything about) is the way they chose to seal the battery compartment.  It is just a fitted rubber cap with a little connector so if it comes loose it won't fall off.  I would like to see a flathead screw that your could turn with your hand to a sealed, gasketed compartment.  Let's face it, people go camping, get a little crazy, leave these things laying out and they eventually get rained on or soaked a little.  A little water to the battery compartment would corrode the batteries and rust the contacts.  Just be careful with this and you should be fine.I did also want to mention the nicely tensioned fully adjustable positioning of this headlamp.  Sometimes you want straight down and sometimes you want tilted up - well you can easily do both with this lamp.I have gotten more and more used to this headlamp over time and it is now my go to headlamp for late night grilling, trash night, picking up toys in the yard or doing odd jobs around the house.  If you can get the straps positioned and tensioned correctly, are ok with the weight, then you will eventually fall in love with this headlamp because it truly is like having a bright flashlight on your head.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WKM0P9QX47EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBC4E8Y#wasThisHelpful","R1WKM0P9QX47EN","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 7:46 Mins The Boruit RJ-5000 is one heck of a headlamp.  It shouldn't even be called a headlamp, more like a head flashlight because that is what it feels like.  I do want to disclose that I was provided a sample for review purposes.  Take what you will but this is a solid little headlamp that has the power of a flashlight on your head.Please note that this version of the headlamp does not come with batteries.  Amazon limits videos to 100 megs, so I have left a comment with a link to the high resolution version of this video.Ok, so let me get right into it.  This headlamp is heavy, 14.4 ounces to be exact.  At first, that was a huge turnoff for me, I will have to admit.  It was big, bulky and heavy.  Not exactly friendly words to the hiker, backpacker or weekend warrior.  It is huge and heavy but you know what, it is also incredibly ergonomic.  I quickly got used to the large plastic mold in the front and the ever so slightly curved battery pack in the rear.  After walking around with it for a few minutes I got used to the weight and thought this isn't so bad after all.  The weight is pretty nicely distributed throughout as well and with a 3 band design you can be assured that this headlamp is fully adjustable and will not easily fall off your head if you set the bands to the correct lengths and tensions.Next came me using it.  I was blown away by how bright it was.  I did not like the large center light because it had a large hotspot right in the middle.  However, the side flood lights were awesome.  Due to their positioning and optics, they did not produce a hotspot and actually did a great job of providing a nice wide illumination area with no hot spots.  Then I tried all three and that was pretty bright, almost too bright, until I went outside in total dark.  That is where this light really shines.  It beats every other headlamp I have ever had or seen.  It actually takes a little getting used to but if you can bear with it for a little time hopefully it will become your preferred headlamp as well.  I quickly found myself using the two side floods and walking around my backyard with no problems whatsoever.  I took this lamp camping with me and that is where the three lights all on at the same time was useful.  I also used the three lamps on when I helped my boss put in a recessed can in his attic.  His attic had no lighting and I had no problems with seeing up there.You get (2) 4000 mAh Boruit Lithium ion batteries, which can hold a lot of juice, are rechargeable and you can easily find extras on Amazon.  You get two chargers, a USB one with a smiley face and an AC one.  They work fine and I like how the company gives you the USB one.  I would expect the AC charger, which is faster but the USB charger is really nice.  You could pair this with a USB battery charger on your trip or charge it from your car.  It just opens up a whole lot of options for ease of convenience in recharging.The one thing I did not like about this light, in addition to the center hot spot and the weight (which they can't really do anything about) is the way they chose to seal the battery compartment.  It is just a fitted rubber cap with a little connector so if it comes loose it won't fall off.  I would like to see a flathead screw that your could turn with your hand to a sealed, gasketed compartment.  Let's face it, people go camping, get a little crazy, leave these things laying out and they eventually get rained on or soaked a little.  A little water to the battery compartment would corrode the batteries and rust the contacts.  Just be careful with this and you should be fine.I did also want to mention the nicely tensioned fully adjustable positioning of this headlamp.  Sometimes you want straight down and sometimes you want tilted up - well you can easily do both with this lamp.I have gotten more and more used to this headlamp over time and it is now my go to headlamp for late night grilling, trash night, picking up toys in the yard or doing odd jobs around the house.

" 9:53 Mins Feilun has hit a home run with the FT009 RC Racing Boat.  I have been watching some other videos that users have posted but I don't think they really capture how fast this little boat really is or how much fun it can be.  It goes about 15 mph on a full charge for a few minutes.I do want to state that I was provided a sample for review purposes but my thoughts and comments are my own, so take from this what you will.  Also, Amazon limits reviews to 100 megs, so I will leave a link to my high resolution video in the comments section.Feilun has done a lot of things about this boat right and not a lot wrong.  Let me start with the boat itself.  It comes with a powerful water cooled motor which does a great job of keeping the motor cool.  The boat also has a great watertight seal which is crucial to keeping this boat functioning and working properly.  I reviewed another small RC racing boat and on two runs it got water inside the hull both times.  That will kill a RC boat, so the fact that I had this boat upside down and drove it under water in reverse and water did not get in is a testament to how well this boat was designed and engineered.  The 1500 mAh Li-Po battery will last 10 - 15 minutes depending on how hard you run this boat and how many breaks you give it.  I found that if I took the little breaks that when I did gun it again it would really go full throttle just like the battery was new.  If you look online, you can find replacement parts pretty easily as well as a bunch of pretty solid reviews for this boat.  This is another advantage of buying a hobby grade level product instead of a toy that you just throw away once it breaks.  This is hobby grade but entry level as there are other RC boats out there which are a lot more expensive and go a lot faster (like 60+ mph fast).I do wish it came with a second battery.  This way you could take both batteries with you to the water.  The water cooled engine does a great job at keeping the motor cool and if you gave it a 10 minute break in between runs you wouldn't burn up the electronic speed controller and receiver.  I also noticed that this boat would make nice, sharp right turns but make less sharp left turns.  I found this out while I was making figure 8's in the water.  I wonder why this is as sharp left and right turns would really be a lot more fun.  I suggest the manufacturer look at this and their rudder servo to see if they can find a way to make this boat carve it out a little better.  The transmitter is nice, nothing fancy but gets the job done.  It does require 6 AA batteries so be prepared to provide that upon receiving this boat.  Would be nice if they came with the boat but this is pretty typical, especially when 6 batteries are involved.  I would also like to see the transmitter beep when the boat gets close to being out of range and when the battery on the boat is nearing low voltage cutoff (LVC).  Basically, this would prevent you from having your boat stuck out in the middle of the lake when your battery dies.  You should be able to avoid this with good common sense, your boat will slow when it is running out of juice.  Also, it does have a pretty good range on the 2.4 GHz transmitter, I think the manual mentioned 300m but you should never have the boat anywhere close to that far away from you.  Again, these are just suggestions to make a better product - not really negatives as common sense plays into operating this boat.This boat has a rudder servo which controls the rudder.  The servo gives the user proportional left and proportional right, so the harder you turn the controller the harder the boat turns, same with the throttle.One feature which this boat has which is key is the self-righting capability after capsizing.  If you quickly flip the boat from full reverse to full throttle and then back to full reverse and full throttle if you catch the timing just right the boat will flip itself over.  This is a key, key, key feature and should not be overlooked when deciding what RC boat to choose.These are my thoughts on this boat.  I like it a lot and I am not just saying that because I got a free sample.  It is a very solid little boat and I encourage you to research it and you will see what I am talking about.  They also make a smaller version of this boat, the FT007 and a brushless version the FT012.  You can also pick up an extra battery for about $12.  The boat also comes with nose guards which are a good idea and I think the graphics are pretty sleek and sharp.  This boat does a lot right and very little wrong but has some room for improvement.  If you are looking for an entry level RC racing boat, don't really want to spend a lot of money, want something that will work and that you can find replacement parts for pretty easily, this is going to be a good choice for you to get started in the hobby.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUGRHJWL5QZF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU7ADY8#wasThisHelpful","RUGRHJWL5QZF5","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 5:19 MinsThe PowerCore+ mini is an upgrade to Anker's hugely successful 2nd Gen Astro mini.  They kept all of the things that people liked about the battery charger and have added a few new features.  The biggest change that one will see is that the on-off button is now gone.  There was a clear plastic label over the end of the charger that tells the user to press in to turn on the unit.  The power button is now an LED indicator light letting the user know how much charge is now left in the battery.  The LED indicates red, yellow or green - pretty simple and intuitive.  The other change is that they have improved the efficiency of the battery.They kept the size and capacity the same.  I was able to charge my iPhone 6 from 40% to 79% in 40 minutes.  It is only a 1A power charger, not the full 2.4 A but I guess this is the best they can do at this size now.Anker also kept PowerIQ technology which detects what type of device is connected and optimizes charging speed up to 1 A.I have tested several battery chargers and Anker's are among the best out there if not the best.  If you won't take my word for it, just look at the other reviewers out there.  I am a little curious as to why thy chose to first release this charger in pink instead of black, but the manufacturer tells me that other colors will be released at the end of June 2015.At 3350 mAh, with a nice aluminum case, LED functionality - this charger provides the perfect blend of power, capacity, style and functionality to make it an ideal portable charger for a lot of folks.I was provided a sample for review purposes but this is a great charger and I have no problems recommending it.  If you need a larger charger, search through Anker's product listing as they make several sizes and capacities for whatever you might need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8WX0JFHHBGDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9W280W#wasThisHelpful","R8WX0JFHHBGDG","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:39 MinsHoly Stone's F181 quadcopter is a great entry level quadcopter for folks just getting into the hobby of flying drones.  I got bitten by the bug a couple of months ago, so I am still learning the ropes but this is a good one to start on if you are considering getting into the hobby.I also want to let everyone know that I received a sample from the manufacturer for evaluation and review purposes.  I try to be as candid as I can in my reviews and will let everyone know what I did and did not like about the quadcopter.  Amazon limits videos to 10 minutes and 100 megs, so I will leave a comment with a link to watch my video in high resolution.Quadcopters are addicting because they are very easy to fly.  I have always wanted to fly planes, helis but I didn't have a big field, a ton of money or any experience.  Enter 2015 and the boom of quadcopters on the hobby market.  These toys are durable, easy to fly and even come with cameras to take videos and pictures of your flights.  I taught myself to fly quadcopters over a weekend and you can too.Onto the F181, here is a quick summary of the PROs and CONs about this quad.PROs-Durable, suggest installing propguards until you get comfortable with flying the quad-Easy to fly, not too fast, variable pitch angles allow user to grow with the quad-Camera takes pictures and video, needs to have no wind and be in a good hover for a nice camera shot or video.  Camera has an adjustable angle so you can tailor the view that you are recording.  Comes with a 2 gig TF card, which is nice to be provided with the quad-2.4 GHz, this quad has a pretty good range but be careful of getting it up too high in the wind.  Two things will kill this quad, flying it above trees and flying it in wind.  Please use common sense when learning to fly this quad, your neighbors don't want it stuck in their tree and it is a lot windier above the trees than down on the ground, and if you are not careful the wind will catch this quad and take it away and out of range.-Trims with memory, trim out this quad indoors to make sure it isn't flying left or forward and then the transmitter will save these settings.  This is a key feature of this quad because it is super annoying to have to trim out a quad each time you fly it.  Some of this quad's competitors do not have this feature.-Comes with (2) large 750 mAH Li-Po batteries.  These give a flight time of around 5-7 minutes.  Very important is to give this quad a 10 minute rest between flights.  Failure to do so could overheat the electronics or prematurely burn out the brushed motors.  The temptation is to just swap out batteries but you need to be patient if you want this quad to last.-Flips, this quad comes with autobatics.  You can flip in any direction, just make sure you have enough elevation to allow you ample room for recovery.-Battery cover and an ON-OFF switch.  Nice for not having the battery fall out and the on and off switch is just convenient-Nice LEDs, let you fly at night, maintain orientation, blink when it is time to bring the quad in for a landing-Excellent customer support.  As I mentioned above that I received a sample for review purposes, the manufacturer really bent over backwards for me.  He sent me one quad and a motor burned out.  This was most likely my fault for taking it on a baseball field and getting all the baseball field dust in the motors.  Then he sent me a replacement unit but this got lost by Lasership.  He then sent me a third unit and this is the unit I ended up doing the review on.  The manufacturer even puts his e-mail on the packaging in several places.  He is responsive when you e-mail him and he wants you to enjoy this product or help you if you have any problems.  These folks get it.-25%, 50%, 75%, 100% pitch adjustments.  Lets you control how fast you fly and how much control you can exert over the quad.  Conveniently placed on the left bumper button for easy access.CONs-It is durable but you still have to be careful.  Always move the throttle down before crashing.  Even a soft crash in the grass can burn a motor out if you don't throttle down as the motor will want to continue to spin when the prop can't move in the grass.  Always inspect the craft prior to reflying, make sure no grass or debris is twisted around a blade.  Also keep this quad away from water, heavy moisture and dust and dirt - they will get in the motors and cause them to prematurely burn out.  Just use common sense where you fly this and how you fly this and you should get a lot of life from the quad.-Could recover better on flips.  Like I said before, you need to put some elevation under your quad to give it time to recover from the flips.  Also, you need to be careful when going from a full throttle to no throttle in the air.  The quad will drop and if it is nearing the end of the battery won't be able to recover.  This could be the death of your quad if you get it over a tree and high up and try to lay off the throttle and bring it back down.  It won't have enough juice to catch the quad and let you redirect it away from the tree.  If you do get it caught in a tree, I suggest a fishing rod and some treble hooked fishing lures - time for some tree fishing.-Battery charger - be very, very careful with this.  Mine melted but it was because I hooked them up to a high-current USB charger.  I see the manufacturer has added a warning about this in the description.  Heed this warning.  They included chargers are only intended to be used on a computer and will take a long time to charge up the Li-Po batteries.  I suggest you get a high current charger, I will include a comment which links to this product.  I suggest the manufacturer include this charger with future updates to the product so the user will get better performance and also so the user will be safer.  You also need to educate and learn about Li-Po batteries, they are great batteries but at the same time you need to be very careful around them and never leave them charging unattended.-Camera - The video is 720P but if it is windy can be choppy and have a jello effect.  Camera shots are decent in no wind and with a good hover.  The quality is what you would expect for a product at this price point.  If you want quality video, you will spend hundreds to get high quality aerial photography.  Just be aware of this...that's all I am saying.  The camera is a nice add-on but you should not be buying this quad if that is all you are interested in.-I did have to replace some motors on this quad and it is quite a lengthy process to get to the board.  I suggest fewer screws and using motors that come with connectors that pop in and out so it is much easier to get to and change one of the motors.  You will eventually burn out a motor or a prop will stop spinning as it should.  You will need a $10 soldering iron.  You unscrew everything, order some new replacement motors, keep track of the orientation of everything and it is pretty easy.  You heat up the soldering iron, pull out the old wires and then heat up the solder and place in the new wires.  It is only two wires but it is a process to get to.  I got four new motors for $18 from Amazon, just make sure they are listed to work with the F181 and you will be ok.  You also need to replace red and blue and black and white motors with the like kind.  It is simple to do, just takes some time and I think it is a worthy investment in order to keep this quad up and running.  Eventually you will need to do this, so just be aware of it.  You will need to do this on every quad you fly, some are just easier to disassemble and some have places where the motors just snap in and snap out.This is a great quad for beginners to learn on.  It also has a headless mode which keeps your orientation regardless of the way the keys are pressed but I did not test out this feature.  There are some cons but mostly pros.  Probably the most important thing I can tell someone looking to get into this hobby is to use common sense.  Do not fly this above trees, do not fly it high, do not fly it on windy days, do not try to fly it really far away from you.  Just keep it safe and simple when learning.  Go to a wide open area and keep it in close range.  In short, never put the quad in a place where you can't get to it and always throttle down for those crashes.  It is very, very tempting to get this quad up high in a residential area but it is super easy to have the wind take it (it is much greater above the trees and homes than you think) or to have it come down or get stuck 50' up in a tree.  I cannot emphasize this enough...the camera footage is cool but you will never know because you have lost your quad.  Take my advice, it isn't worth losing your quad over, the footage isn't that great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HY1DZ4OMHAG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SAUAP5C#wasThisHelpful","R3HY1DZ4OMHAG4","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:49 MinsI was provided a sample for review purposes but my opinions are my own.  Amazon limits video reviews to 100 megs, so I will include a link to my higher resolution video review in the comments section.  Also, this review is for the Tempo boat but the Venom is just a different color.UDI RC's Tempo/Venom boat is a ton of fun.This boat is awesome and I like lots and lots of things about it.  Let me start with the boat itself.  The hull is very, very fast and it can go up to 15 mph in the water no problem.  I did get some water in the boat on my first two runs but did not get any in on my next two runs.  You need to really make sure you have sealed the top down into the grooves and have pressed it down and have sealed it as tight as you possibly can.The boat is very stable in the water and I tried to flip it but could not.  However, should you flip it in the water, have no fear as this boat has an automatic flipping feature.  That is by far the best feature of this boat as it means that you can run it virtually on any water surface and not have to worry if it accidentally gets flipped over.The rudder is nice and big and the servo that controls it is nice and smooth.  Servo based control means that a little left is a little left and a lot of left is a lot of left.  It is proportional to how much you turn the steering wheel which is a great thing.I found the transmitter which requires 4 AA batteries very easy to use.  When you put the boat in the water, I suggest you just go straight out first and adjust the trim settings so the boat travels as straight as possible - this will help you for the whole time you run the boat.  I did not receive two boats so I cannot comment on if two boats can be synced up at the same time but the manufacturer states that you can do this I think with up to three boats.  2.4 GHz transmission is hobby grade and I had no range issues at all with this boat.  Apparently when the battery gets weak the transmitter will start to beep, so this is a good safety feature that the manufacturer has built in.The batteries are robust and you get about 6-8 minutes of runtime with each battery pack.  You can tell when the batteries are getting close to dying because the boat slows down considerably.  Do not let the batteries run all the way down, they are lithium ion and this will really damage them if you continually fully drain them.A note of caution, supposedly the prop will stop turning when the boat is out of water.  I noticed that it still turned occasionally when it was out of the water - so just be careful.  Your best bet is to turn off the transmitter and then remove the boat from the water so you don't have an accident.Last but not least, this boat is not built for saltwater, so don't take it to the ocean or it will quickly get ruined.  One last tip that I want to pass on is to make sure you are comfortable getting into the water you drive your boat on or that you can access it with a boat.  I caught mine in some weeds about 10' away from the bank of the river and luckily the boat had enough steam to motor on in.  However, had this been far out I would have had to go swimming, get a boat or be prepared to say bye-bye.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QS7WKRMR1GGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2SXTNY#wasThisHelpful","R3QS7WKRMR1GGV","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 5:28 MinsFinally someone has done it.  Welcome to 2015, where Mpow has finally solved the age old riddle of how to put out an economical set of Bluetooth headphones that not only sound great but stay in your ears.  You hear that, that is the sound of my silent applause for Mpow's team of dedicated professionals.Let me also get this out of the way.  I was provided a sample for review purposes by Mpow.  I say what I want to say though, the good, the bad and sometimes the ugly.  Take it for what you will but I need to disclose this to the loyal Amazon review community.Now, let me get into the headphones:THE GOOD-Lots of different size earbuds are provided both for the parts that go in your ear and for the parts that help to secure it into your ear so it doesn't fall out.  Experiment with this folks, it may take some time but you need to get this fit as good as you can as your sole enjoyment or hatred of these headphones will depend on how well you get the fit.  I cannot overemphasize this enough.-Once you get the fit, the bass will sound good and they will actually stay in your ears while you are jogging and sweating.  Unbelievable I know but I tried it myself.  I move my head a lot when I jog and I sweat a lot - and I was happy with their performance.  Just shove them in, get them situated just right and don't touch them.-Very easy to use the buttons on these to turn the volume up and down or to go forward or back with track selection-Impressive sound quality and bass-Relatively inexpensive for what they do and how they soundTWEAKS/HACKS -- Cord sticks to my neck when placed behind my head.  When I turn my head, the cord pulled on the earbuds and pulled them out/loose.  The tweak/hack for this was to just let the cord lay in front of my neck instead of behind it.  No problems with the cord in front.- When you put the headphones in and run with the cord in front of you it bumps around and into things.  This causes a ""stethoscope effect"" for lack of a better word with the headphones.  You hear everything and it gets magnified.  My tweak/hack for this was just to tuck the cord into my shirt neck opening.  This secured the cord thus stopping the sound transmission into my ears by all of the bumping around.If Mpow could make these headphones with no cord they would be better.  I don't know how they would do it but I am sure it is possible.  It would be great to finally go jogging with no cords - not even one between the earbuds.I did get some crackling when my iPod nano was in my pants pocket.  It was more noticeable at first but even faded away to less and less.  It wasn't a deal breaker - I also had a media pocket in my vest next to my shoulder that I put my Nano in and this really cleared up any crackling problems.  I wish they could build a playback buffer into the music stream as that would really help and allow you to place your music player really anywhere.So, that is my take on these headphones.  I didn't want to call my tweaks/hacks the bad because they are things that you would probably run into with any set of cord connected Bluetooth headphones.  I told the manufacturer I was curious to test these out and am glad that I did.  Let's face it, you just want to get the right fit, put these in, have them be comfortable, bob your head up and down for hours, profusely sweat and have these things stay in, sound great and be comfortable.  You also don't want to pay a small fortune for them either.  If you have any concerns about the fact that I received these for review purposes - read the other reviews from folks who did not receive a sample for evaluation purposes - the verdict is in and these headphones rock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K1VS8TBBTDCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QWRN2KK#wasThisHelpful","R2K1VS8TBBTDCX","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:32 MinsI was provided a sample in exchange for my review.  My comments below represent my views and opinions of the product.This light rocks...plain and simple, just get it and you can thank me for it later.  Look at the other reviewers if you don't believe me - the reviews speak for themselves.This light rocks in so many ways but let me get started.  It is bright, like 500 lumens bright.  Most other LED lights on the market go up to 100 lumens, I see some for 140 lumens - this one is 500 lumens.  When you get up at 5AM to run on a trail there is no light, as in the moon and that is it.  The difference between a 500 lumen light and a 100 lumen light is night and day.This light also features a unique, distinctive, optical zoon feature that is just eons ahead of its competitors and unlike anything I have seen yet.  The level of zooming in and out is pretty amazing, when I am walking down the street, it is so wide you really can see everything.  This is a great feature from people out late walking their dogs to runners looking to illuminate a trail or road.  Not only will you be able to see everything but people and drivers will be able to see you.  When I run, I have to turn the light down so I don't shine it in oncoming driver's eyes.  I feel very safe both from seeing everything to everyone seeing me when I run with this light.  If you don't want this giant wide beam, just slide the top portion up and you can quickly customize this light to just the size you need.The light has different settings, low, medium, high, strobe and SOS.  The strobe is a real eye opener.  Some other feature of this light is that it comes with a wrist strap, a traveling case which is perfect for a glove box, an accessory that allows it to run off of 3 AAA batteries and of course the rechargeable Lion battery.  Since the light is so bright, and I run for 45 minutes or so, I do have to charge it up at the end of each run.  It is still on at the end of the run but its lighting output is a little diminished.  I keep 3 AAA batteries and this light stored in my glove box in case I ever need it for general use or an emergency.  I think that is a great little feature that again sets this light apart from every other LED light on the market.It is gasketed, IPX-6 rated, so it is fine for use in heavy rain.  Even the travel case has ben well thought out and executed.  Everything is foam lined and organized so nothing bumbles around making a racket in your car.  I have a few suggestions for product updates.  The first is to put a lock on the wrist strap, just like the one on the Wii.  Users can ignore this if they want but since I run I would like this added protection plus it would eliminate the strap from flinging around.  The second is to put some rubber into this product, to protect it from accidental drops and to take some weigh out of it.  As it is now, everything is metal so if you drop it, you ding it.  I am not even talking about changing it from all metal to all rubber but around the ends would be nice.One final point to note is that this light uses a high quality CREE LED that is good for 50,000 hours.  Two companies right now, CREE and Nichia, are putting out the highest quality LEDs.  CREE is US based and is really the leader in my opinion and everyone else is chasing them.  It is just a final note of quality that the manufacturer has put into this light.So the brightness, the wide optical zoom, the ability to use 3 AAA batteries and a very nice travel case is what really set this light apart from the rest of the field.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRU93LWR1EHT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JE329YO#wasThisHelpful","RRU93LWR1EHT9","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:14 MinsI was provided a sample in exchange for my review.  My comments and opinion are my own, take them as you will.  Look at the other reviews though as these are some very nice grooming brushes for your pet.  If you have the time, I encourage you to watch my video as I demonstrate using them on my mini dachshund.This review is pretty straightforward.  I will not be using or reviewing the dematting rake because my pooch has short hair and that is not necessary.  It does look like it would get the job done though.  I will defer you to other reviewers for comments on that one.The undercoat rake did a nice job at pulling up the dead skin on my dog's back.  There was a noticeable difference between the two-sided dog brush and the undercoat rake.  I noticed a lot more dead skin coming up from the undercoat rake.My advice would be to start with the dematting rake if that applies to your pet.  Next, I would use the undercoat rake and then I would go to the metal side of the two-sided dog brush.  Finally, I would finish with the bristles on the two-sided dog brush.I really liked all of the rakes and brushes and my dog did too.  I have used these on him a couple times now and it not only calms him, cleans him, probably feels like a massage but it is some good bonding time too.  My only comment for an improvement is for a notch for my thumb on the two-sided brush and the undercoat rake, which would make these brushes a little easier to grip and control.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27Q4AUCK8N0VD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI2GM36#wasThisHelpful","R27Q4AUCK8N0VD","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:12 MinsI was provided a sample for review purposes.  All comments below are my own and represent my opinion of this product.I am very happy to be able to review this product because I could have used one of these devices a few months ago.  I did not know that these DVRs are widely being used in Europe and Asia. I lost an insurance claim when another driver did a three point turn in front of me that forced me to swerve into a ditch on the right.  This camera would have turned the tables in my favor because it would have spoken for itself.The camera is 1080P, which is what you need for resolution and to pick out license plates.  I had some video of what actually gets recorded but could not integrate it into my review because they are at different resolutions.The DVR was easy enough to operate, the suction cup is powerful, the video looks great once you move it to your computer.  Please note the DVR does not come with a transflash card, so you will need one of those before you buy this.  It continuous loops video and just records over the old video.  It also has motion detection and my favorite, just starts and stops when you turn your car on and off.Everything was easy to operate and I am very happy with my DVR.  I wish the connector was micro USB and not mini USB.  I wish it connected at the bottom and I wish there was an easier way to pop on and pop off this device not only to be able to get at the video but also to keep it out of temperature extremes in my car which will damage the device and battery.I would recommend this device to anyone in the market for one of these.  There is room for improvements but overall this is a really nice unit that will get the job done for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJHO2LSI2YWPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UA29I2E#wasThisHelpful","RJHO2LSI2YWPP","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:30 MinsI received this product as a sample for review purposes.  With that being said, all thoughts and comments below are my own opinion of the item.I did receive this for a review, yes, take it for what you will but this is an awesome cable. Look at the other reviews if you don't take my word for it.  I like several things about this cable.  I like that it is offered in multiple colors. Not only does this offer a little bit of something for everyone but it makes it super easy to distinguish among the myriad of cables that are now part of everyone's daily life.  The second thing I like about this cable is its length.  I thought a 6' cable would be too long but it turns out to be a great length.  I use this in my car to charge my phone when I have it on my windshield for navigation.  Turn out it is better to have more length than not enough.  The cable is flat, which I guess is good because it is less likely to get pinched/damaged and is also easier to thread through small openings.The only thing I did not like about this cable was that it was a little stiff and plasticy feeling...these are very minor and did not affect durability or performance in any way.Bottom line this is a solid cable that looks great, is functional, Apple certified and will stand up to lots of bending and connecting and disconnecting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F1S5K4A3QZZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TP0S6QG#wasThisHelpful","R1F1S5K4A3QZZE","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was provided a sample for review purposes.  With that being said, I like this scale but it is not perfect for me...let me explain.In my opinion, this is a scale designed for women.  It is a nice scale, the auto identify users work well, women will love a pink scale (I got the white one) and if you are ok with the BMI system than that is great.  I really like the tempered glass top and the beautiful display as well.  This review will not get into a BMI discussion - it is what it is and the scale uses it.  It is a nice scale, there is no doubt about it and it is accurate as well.Now, here is why it isn't perfect for me.  I am a big guy and have size 13 feet and my feet hang over this scale.  If I had smaller feet or was a woman it would be fine.  I just don't like my big feet hanging off of this scale.  If you have smaller feet or want a smaller scale than this is for you.My only other comment is that I wish Surpahs did the bottom corners like they did on another scale that I have reviewed for them.  They were completely covered, thus water and dirt could not get inside the scale and it wouldn't get caught in between the tiles on the floor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJSYWAJ82XI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KF1Y6C2#wasThisHelpful","R3PJSYWAJ82XI5","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was provided a sample for review purposes.  With that being said, here is what I think about the cable.I have been testing this cable out for a few weeks now and really like it, scratch that, love it and not just because I got it for free either.  It is sturdy, the connectors are reinforced and you can just tell that it is a quality cord by the way it feels.By being Apple certified, you can rest assured that it will work with all of your products.  I actually am using this cord to replace my original Apple charging cord on my laptop at work.  My original Apple cord has worn through the outer sheath just below the connection point from all of the connecting and disconnecting - that is the weak point of the cables that come with Apple products.  This cable fixes this design flaw (in my opinion) by its reinforcement of this key stress area.I also like the length because sometimes you need a 6' cord.  My only comment for iClever is to offer this same cord in a 3' length.  They have a great design going but they are missing out on that segment of the market.Take a look at what other reviewers are saying but this is a great cable.  It is worth the extra money and I would recommend this item to my friends.  This is actually a very easy review for me to write.  Just make sure you will be ok with the 6' length before ordering and you will be ok.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X4MVZS048KOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QER4GIA#wasThisHelpful","R2X4MVZS048KOR","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a 30 oz. rambler for Christmas and have been testing it out over the last few days. I have a 22 oz. stainless steel Hydroflask and like that equally as well. But, they are different designs. Both are vacuum insulated but the Yeti keeps ice cooler for longer which is amazing considering the Hydroflask is fully vacuumed sealed and gasketed. The reason for 4 stars is because of the design of the top lid.I think Yeti could have made a screw on lid that is vacuum insulated but has a rubber plug that goes into the mouth port with no opening for the air port. I knocked this cup over on the rug the first day I got it and didn't notice it at first - needless to say the rug was all wet. I would like to see different types of tops for this cup so I can purchase them separately, they all will be interchangeable, and if I want to fill it with soup and seal it in my backpack then I can. The cup is huge, ice fits in easily, the plastic lid has a nice seal and it fits in my car cup holder perfectly.I would also like to see the cup and the lid dishwasher safe so I could just throw it in. I would give 4.5 stars if I could...almost perfect. I know I am being picky but maybe it is something the folks at Yeti will give some thought to for further revisions of this product. Also, without the mouth and air ports the fluids will stay cooler or hotter longer.I can tell I will get many years of great service out of this cup but will be careful when I choose between my Hydroflask and Yeti Rambler as my function changes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BFJRAEV7EKQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JP9ALW4#wasThisHelpful","R1BFJRAEV7EKQT","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I want to let everyone know that I did receive a sample for reviewing purposes.  Now, with that being said, I don't think it is the perfect case but it is a very good case.Having had an Otterbox Defender case for my iPhone 5 and a Commuter Series case for my iPhone 6, I will admit that I was a little bit intrigued when offered this opportunity to review this case.  Anker does make great products and they back them with an 18 month warranty.  Just search for Anker on Amazon and a couple quick checks will let you know that this manufacturer is putting out high quality products that most everyone likes.Now for the case, at first I didn't like the way the rubber felt around the case.  However, after having consulted with the manufacturer, they injected polycarbonate into the rubber for greater impact resistance.  When you take the case apart, this is evident because the outer rubber case has some rigidity.  This is what you want, I wanted a soft silicone based rubber but the impact resistant rubber actually provides better protection for my iPhone.The next thing I noticed about this phone is how well the plastic part snapped around my iPhone.  The bottom of the plastic case is actually rounded to go along with the curvature of the iPhone.  This really snaps this baby tight in place and there is no wiggling.  There also isn't any room for dirt and debris to get in under the screen protector.  The screen protector is meticulously cut.  The holes are exactly where they should be, Anker took great pains to get their tolerances correct here and it is evident in their product.  All of the holes on my sample aligned perfectly.The next thing I noticed is how well the plastic inner case snapped into the outer shell.  The case fits in there just right.  Not too tight that you can't get it out and not to loose so it falls out.  I have used it for a week or so now, carrying it around in my work bag and no dirt has managed to get in.  Junk always used to get into my Otterbox Defender case, I am not going to have that problem with this case.  There is a little lip on the outside of the inner plastic case and the outer edge catches nicely on this.Here is the part I relaly like.  The speaker and microphone cut outs at the bottom.  Anker has done it just right.  The holes are precisely cut for only the openings.  The headphone jack and the lightning port don't just have a cover but they have pieces of rubber which go into those ports to further protect them.  I like this for the headphone port, because I don't use it a lot but don't think I like it for the lightning port.  You have to push the tab down kindof funky to jam the rubber nub back into the port.  I like this better on my old case because I just had to snap it up.  I am thinking about modifying my case by just cutting of this rubber nub out.  You have the option to do that, which is a nice option to have.Now, for the part I don't like.  I didn't like the back case.  I asked Anker why the back was depressed in and they told me so the phone wouldn't slip around.  At first, I thought this was to hold change in my car.  I could see how this would help the phone from slipping but I just don't like the looks or the design of this.  Hence, the 4 star rating and that is my honest opinion.  I think if it was just a straight flat gray back I would have given it 5 stars.  I think Anker could have done a lot of other things with the back of this phone to make it more attractive.  While I don't love the back, it gets the job done and covers the phone.I also want to point out that this case is extremely thin.  One of the reasons I switched from the Defender series to the Commuter series was because of how bulky the Defender series is.  Anker crushes Otterbox here, their case has the impact resistance and protection but does so in a very slim frame.  So you get the best of both worlds, the protection and the sleek case.I would also like to see Anker make this case in a couple different colors, at a minimum one to complement the space gray iPhone and one to complement the white iPhone.Again, I was provided a sample for review purposes but this is my honest take on this case.  If they fix the back panel they will have a 5 star case.  I would also ask them to considering trying to inject a little less polycarbonate and to try it with silicone so the outer rubber case feels a little softer in your hand.  It is a very nice case and I do have my iPhone in this case right now and my Commuter series in my dresser drawer collecting dust.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R224QYC9MHS4VM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PTHU9BO#wasThisHelpful","R224QYC9MHS4VM","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 7:00 MinsAnker's 2nd Gen Astro E5 16000 mAh external battery is a power house.  Match it with Anker's PowerIQ Technology and you have a super fast, adaptive charger.  I like the form factor of this external battery because I could hold it easily in my hand.  It is a little on the heavier side but for it's charging capacity this is inline with comparable models of similar capacities.  The PowerIQ Technology is a really nice feature that Anker has put into all of it's devices.  I plugged in a Kindle, iPad 2, iPad Mini, iPhone and all of these charged as fast as they did with their original chargers.  I also don't have to worry about overcharging or undercharging any of these devices because of all of the safeguards that Anker puts into place.  Their units have voltage regulators, short-circuit and overcharging protection built-in.  There is a reason why Anker is one of the best selling brands out there.  The new E5 takes on the same shape as their smaller E4 and they use premium LG cell batteries for lots and lots of charges over the life of the charger.There is also a small LED on the battery pack for getting around at night.  Because the device is so big, I would like to see Anker put two more PowerIQ ports on the other end.  This way you could load it up with even more devices at the same time.  I also would like to see an AC adapter, so I could plug this into a wall to charge up.  It comes with a micro USB charging connection but that can only go so fast, so recharging this brick takes time.  Other than that, I think they have a pretty solid product on their hands.  They also back it up with an 18 month warranty.I was provided a sample in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39C9S43RCFR5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2T7U90#wasThisHelpful","R39C9S43RCFR5T","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:29 MinsThe Kitchen Frontier Infuser Pitcher is a great way to drink more water while adding a twist at the same time.  The pitcher was packaged very well and is constructed out of shatterproof acrylic that is BPA-free.  I really like the shape of this pitcher because it doesn't take up too much room in my fridge and is very ergonomic to hold and pour. The interior compartment which holds the fruit easily screws in and out of the top lid.The fruit infused water tasted great and is something that I have never had before.  I made tea and then stuck a bunch of cut up lemons in the infusion chamber and the tea tasted great.  Lemon water is another favorite and you can get several pitchers out of the same fruit.This pitcher comes with a lifetime warranty and is a hand wash only item.  My guess is that the dishwasher will either melt the acrylic or will cause the handle to eventually loosen after time since it is glued on - either way, don't put it in the dishwasher and you won't have to worry about these problems.  Future revisions of this product could integrate the handle into the pitcher so it is a true one-piece design.  The handle could be solid acrylic or it could be hollow to hold more water.  I would also like to see this pitcher made out of dishwasher safe materials that are BPA-free, even if it has to be top rack only it is still better than hand washing.I was provided a sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25KGWIX7R4JVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6EFA2S#wasThisHelpful","R25KGWIX7R4JVO","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:58 MinsThe Bolse 12-Amp, 7-Port Charging Station with SmartIC Technology is a great little charging block for all of your electronic devices.  As we gathered more and more electronic devices our charging situation got out of control.  I finally ended up going to Target to get a nice little woven basket and we now dump all of our electronics into the basket at night with this charging station.  This is the best looking solution that we have come up with to date.Let me go into a little more about this device.  I have reviewed other wall / desktop USB chargers before but this one offers the most power and ports in a small, compact size.  Plus, with the addition of SmartIC technology, you never have to worry about plugging Apple devices into Apple ports or Droid devices into Android ports.  There are a couple 50 - 60W chargers on Amazon right now but this one is by Bolse, a brand I can recommend based on my experience with all of the products I have from them.There is a small yellow light that indicates that this device is plugged in.  Sometimes when shuffling around devices the cord on the back of this unit gets unplugged.  So whenever you check this device you want to make sure that you see that small yellow light.  This is a marked improvement over there previous version of the product which required specific items to be plugged into specific ports for optimal charging and had a large yellow light.The SmartIC technology is great.  It senses what type of USB device is connected and then will charge it as fast as it can.  Bolse also builds overcurrent, overvoltage, short circuit protection into this little charging block as well.  We charge two kindles, two iPhones, some Garmin watches, and an iPad 2 on it each night and it charges them all right up.  With 12 Amps of charging capacity, that is enough to charge 6 iPads simultaneously so this charging block can handle pretty much anything you could ever throw at it.This is a must have for the power hungry travelling professional or small family with lots of electronic devices.  I was provided a small in exchange for a fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O23K5J0H59PD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2SBZ80#wasThisHelpful","R3O23K5J0H59PD","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:17 MinsGreat portable charger that has worked well for me for the last couple of weeks.  First off, the product I received looks different than both products shown here.  I think they were gen 1 and gen 2 and the one in my video must be gen 3.  I will place an e-mail to the manufacturer to confirm and then will update my review.The charger is 5600 mAh which is ideal for charging up cell phones and small tablets.  It will charge an iPad in a pinch, mostly will just keep it running rather than actually charging it.  It charges at 1A, so it isn't a rapid charger (1.5A or 2.1A) but it gets the job done.I like a couple of the features and the way this charger was laid out and designed.  I like how all of the buttons are on one side, this way they don't accidentally get pushed while in your bag.  I like the 4 LED battery meter on the side, it is discreet and is really all you need to do to be able to see where the battery is at in terms of charging/discharging.  I also like how the charger comes with an adaptable USB cord that will accept a 30 pin iPhone/iPod, a micro USB (which is handy to charge the charger with), a mini USB and a pin barrel.  So lots of versatility here in one cord and for the price this is a nice feature for just the cord alone.  The charger also comes with an integrated circuit protector to safely avoid overcharging your devices and short circuits.  One last point to mention, the blue LED light will also turn into a white LED so you can see your way around in the dark.  It isn't terribly bright but it is a nice add on feature that Alaska Bear thought to include.Last but not least, I was provided a sample in exchange for my fair and honest review.  I have tested this product out for several weeks now, so has my wife and we are both happy with it and it's performance.  If there were problems or concerns I wouldn't be recommending it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPOP9VWOGNNWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G10URHE#wasThisHelpful","RPOP9VWOGNNWJ","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:33 MinsEvery now and then you come across a product that is really well thought out and designed.  This is the case with the Elune from Taotronics.  This light is very versatile and is well constructed.FEATURES-Three dimming levels-Nice gooseneck holds in place, doesn't move-Detachable head with place for a clip / carabiner-USB Charger-Head swivelsThe light is pretty easy to put together.  The gooseneck swivels into the base, you plug the base into the wall and then you just pop the head onto the gooseneck.  The connection to the light reminds me of a large headphone jack for a pair of studio headphones that you would plug into a receiver.  This connection also allows the light to swivel from side-to-side.  So, between this swivel and the gooseneck you get a pretty good range of motion with the light.  Add to this three dimming levels and you can really get just the right amount of light wherever you want it.The fact that the head can easily detach is very versatile.  Because the battery is in the head, you can also easily unplug the light and move it to another table for a little while.  Pop the head off of the light, and it doubles as a flashlight.  Add the carabiner and you can clip it to just about anything.  Need to charge your phone or tablet, just plug it into the base.  This light can do it all...I used this light for a little over a week now and really like it.  If you are in the market for a light, I highly recommend this one for the USB charger and detachable head that are both bonuses.One thing I did not like about this light is the color temperature at 5500 K.  I would like to see a warmer light around 2700 K (much closer to incandescent) for reading at night.  It is a cool white light and not a warm white, just be aware of that.  The other thing that I would like to see is a switch at the bottom of the base.  When I am laying in bed at night it is very hard to get to the switch on top of the light and the fact that it is flush makes it all that much harder.I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNN16I4CGCF57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3WR6JG#wasThisHelpful","RNN16I4CGCF57","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:31 MinsThe Taotronics Floor Stand will get the job done for you if you are looking for a floor stand for your tablet.  This product is ideal for musicians who use their tablet to read music or if you just want to lay in bed and watch movies on your tablet.  I think with some adjustments it could be a much better product though.The base it pretty heavy, the whole assembly weighs in at almost 12 lbs.  The gooseneck is super heavy duty and the way it interfaces with the tablet holder could be improved as well.  That being said, it did work and it held my tablet.  I like how it is fully adjustable, just be sure to take your tablet out, adjust it, then put your tablet back in.The stand comes with a bolt that screws into the telescoping base.  Also included is a small Allen wrench which I used to tighten the clamp which locks down the telescoping portion of the stand.  This was a relief because this portion was slipping and falling down.  A few turns of the Allen wrench and that problem stopped.  The gooseneck is heavy duty, I think much heavier than it has to be to just support a tablet.  The gooseneck has a base that connects to the back of the tablet holder, you slide the back of the gooseneck in and then slide the tablet holder down to lock it in place.  This is not the best design as it could wobble or become disconnected.  The tablet holder has nice padding on the inside to protect your tablet and can hold a number of different sizes of tablets.I think if they took weight out of the base and gooseneck and improved the connection from the gooseneck to the tablet holder that this would be a 5 star stand.  As is, I do like the product and it has held up for me.  At least with it being so heavy duty you know the tablet will not move or move over time.  I expect this stand and gooseneck to be as sturdy in a year of use as it is today after only a week or so of use.I would suggest Taotronics make this stand sexy.  Go with a longer telescoping pole...make the gooseneck thinner and out of aluminum instead of steel.  Add some functionality like a charger to the base so you can charge your tablet while it is in the stand.  Chances are it is on, playing something and the battery is quickly draining.  I think the clip needs a whole redesign.  The clip should be something that securely fastens in place yet is easy to pop out and adjust so you can switch tablets in and out of it relatively easy.  I think the tablet holder can be made out of a sturdier material as well.  I think a ball and socket joint for the connection between the tablet holder and the gooseneck would be a much better design.I was provide a sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZPTCY87TFVA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LLE47S#wasThisHelpful","RZPTCY87TFVA1","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:22 MinsI really like this soap.  When I first rubbed it on my skin the bar was really stiff and did not slide well along my skin.  Once it had some use it was fine.  Just don't expect it to lather up the first time you use it.  For me, it wasn't until the second time that I used it that it lathered up nicely.It left my skin feeling clean, lightly scented and a little dry.  When it comes out of the box it is a rectangular shape.  At first I didn't like this, I was hoping for a curved soap but after some use I liked this shape because you get more product.  I have used this product a few times now and think it is better as a facial soap.  When I applied it to my face, my skin tingled and I could tell that this soap had astringent properties.  Which is ok for me because I have oily hair and am always looking for ways to clean my pores and to cut the oil.  Just be aware if this as it did leave my face feeling deeply cleaned and degreased.  So, for the money, I think this is better off as a facial soap rather than an everyday all around soap.  I will use my normal soap for my body and this soap for my face from now on.Last but not least, the lavender smell really kicks once you lather up in the shower.  It has a very pleasant smell that was something a little different for this guy to experience in the shower.  I would like to see Vitae come out with a line of soap for men, with manly scents.  They could keep the same formulation but just change the scent components.The manufacturer provided me this sample in exchange for a fair and honest review on Amazon.  If you feel like getting a laugh, watch the video and me trying to read all of the ingredients.  It's organic...that's all that matters.  Plus, if you have any doubts, Vitae offers a one year money back warranty on this product.  They know they have a winner on their hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUK8APJ8HRXAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAOUJ5I#wasThisHelpful","RUK8APJ8HRXAJ","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:26 MinsThe Bolse BTS-12 is a very nice looking, nice sounding mobile Bluetooth speaker.  I have been really impressed with the design and quality of a lot of Bolse products and this one is no different.  It comes with a travel case, 3.5mm to 3.5 mm jack, micro USB charger and sounds great.  Bluetooth pairing was very easy and there is an on-off button on the back of the unit.  You can also do conference calling through this speaker as well, which is a nice feature to have and something I always look for in Bluetooth devices.  I like the top touch buttons, I think they are different and will help prevent dirt and grime from getting in there.  I do wish the charger, AUX line in and headphone jack in the back was gasketed to protect against dirt, debris and water.  I would also like to see space for a transflash card.  I have seen this on other units and my friends that go camping really like these cards because it doesn't kill their phone battery streaming Bluetooth.  Just load up the card and go...I would also like to see the speakers tilted slightly upward, this way it is easier to fill the room with sound.This is a very nice unit if you are in the market for a mobile Bluetooth speaker.I was provided a sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AIZN3D9494B4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4IDA04#wasThisHelpful","R2AIZN3D9494B4","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:12 MinsArctic's S111 BT mobile speakers are a nice addition to Arctic's impressive line up.

"After our water and ice line in our freezer keep getting frozen we looked into getting it repaired and it was $100 just to get someone to come to our door not to mention any parts or repairs that he would do.  That being said, I told my wife that I wanted a faucet filter because the pitcher ones don't hold much water, always have to be refilled before being put back in and take up precious fridge space.  After some research, I found this product.I used it for 3 months and replaced the filter.  There is no indicator so you need to mark on a calendar when to replace it or commit it to memory.  To the filter's credit, when it worked, it worked well and the water tasted good.  I also like how the little pushbutton thing worked so you didn't leave the filter in the on position.  I then bought some more filter replacements on Amazon because you can't find them in a store or I haven't seen any in stores around me.  When I went to unscrew the filter it was basically cemented in place for lack of a better word.  I got 6 months out of this device and now had a three-pack of filters that I couldn't use anymore.  My advice would be to not screw it in so tight but I only did so to make sure it was securely in place.I went to Walmart and got a PUR FM-3700B faucet filter that I love for $25.  It has an indicator, doesn't leak, has a good snap on / snap off mechanism, is easy to change out and I can get a 6 pack of replacement filters from Costco.  Not much more to ask for in my opinion...I can't believe the PUR filter only got 3/5 stars, mine is perfect and this is part of the reason I went with the Culligan product in the first place.Just wanted to share my experience with this product","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IBPFQ5R6XSZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064MKTFY#wasThisHelpful","R2IBPFQ5R6XSZD","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:17 MinsI got this speaker, paired it up right away and was literally blown away at how awesome it sounded.  The bass was huge and tight and it was loud, very loud.  The bass was even solid at full volume while playing rap, it really thumped it out on my countertop.  The only thing that I can think that is close to this is the mini jambox but that costs over $100 bucks.  Just get this instead, I promise you won't be disappointed.As far as features go, this speaker is really jammed packed.  It has Bluetooth with Speakerphone, NFC, long playback from a rechargeable lithium ion battery, voice overs for the Bluetooth (voice says ""paired"", ""connected"" versus just beeps and colors), comes with 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm connector as well as a really nice illustrated manual.I wish this speaker came with a little padded nylon carrying case with some storage areas to stash the charging cable as well as the 3.5mm jack.  That is really my only wish list item for this speaker.By far the best feature about this speaker is the sound, particularly the bass which just cleanly rumbles at very high volumes.  I also wish there was some sort of a removable stand so that this speaker could be tilted 15-30 degrees so that it would not shoot straight out but rather fill the area a little better.  Another suggestion would be to add a little remote control, I know most people will have their phone handy but some people will not and may want a little credit card sized remote control.There are other types of Bluetooth speakers like this on the market but the Bolse one is the best that I have found.  I really cannot say enough good things about this product - I love it.I was provided a sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.

" 7:01 MinsI like this product from Satechi but I think some of the features will not be used very much.  I keep it in my glove box and for what it is intended to do it does a great job.  The trickiest part about this flashlight was figuring out how to get the rechargeable lithium ion battery in and I demonstrate this in my video.  I was given a head's up from the manufacturer but when I went to test out this product did not have my phone or computer near me.Let's get into the PROS and CONS...PROS-Solid, rugged construction, fully gasketed seals-LED is bright, has different illumination levels, SOS and Strobe settings-Large rechargeable Lithium Ion battery-USB power bank charger-Translucent globe-Wrist strap-Very nice magnetic storage kit - the box doubles as a great way to store this in your glove boxCONS-Not waterproof as advertised, water resistant to some degree but has an exposed USB charging port in the back-Translucent globe feels as if it would shatter if you drop the flashlight with it on it on the road-Glassbreaking tool will not be used very much, even if it was an emergency, the flashlight is solid enough that you could just punch through a window with that-Can't focus light at the head end like you can with a Maglite - this is so the translucent globe can screw-in.-No seal for the USB charger for water resistance - you will have to put the glassbreaking tool on to protect itThis is a very nice flashlight for emergency use or for even general use.  I was amazed at how bright the LED actually was when I turned it on.  I keep this in my glove compartment but have used it camping and it has done really well for me.  This being an emergency flashlight I feel like it needs to come with a little survival pack  as well.  Maybe take a small compartment in the flashlight and put in some waterproof matches, tweezers, a little blade.  I think if Satechi took this design and tweaked it with a swiss army flavor than you would have a great product for a lot of campers and Boy Scouts out there.

" 4:11 MinsThe TT-BS004 scanner is a great scanner for everyday use.  I hooked it up to my laptop running Windows 7 and it worked right out of the box.  I like the dual trigger that comes with the unit because it allows you to scan more comfortably.  It sits comfortably as shown in the picture.  The material is plastic and it makes an audible beep when you scan items in.  One thing you will want to do is to make a copy of the user manual or download a copy from the manufacturer's website.  The instruction manual shows you how to switch modes but more importantly it includes a bunch of codes to switch functions on the scanner...so you lose the manual you lose a lot functionality with the scanner.I scanned a bunch of items from all around my kitchen cabinets.  I scanned a bunch of different bar code shapes and sizes and this scanner picked them all up.  I had a Word document open and every time I moved an item in front of the scanner it would light up, beep and then output the bar code digits.My wife is a librarian and she used it at her work to scan in and out books and said it worked fine for that as well.I was provided a sample for review in exchange for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SFA4LJCJVS6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRK99DI#wasThisHelpful","R2SFA4LJCJVS6L","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 5-piece silicone kitchen utensil set is a solid performer.  I really wanted to give this product 5 stars but with some minor tweaks I think we can get there.  Ok, so the product isn't perfect but it is pretty darn good and will get the job done.  Here are my thoughts on each element:Small SpatulaShaft goes too far down into the bottom and needs to be longer at the top.  The tip of the spatula is very stiff and the top by the hole is to flimsy.  If this gets redesigned and tweaked then I would give 5 stars.Large SpatulaTop shaft is good, wish bottom of the shaft was a little shorter so the spatula was more flexible.  I think about using this with cake batter or brownie mix and the tip of that spatula needs to be flexible and firm. I think this one is a little to firm and this is due to the length of the shaft into the bottom end.Slotted TurnerVery nice, don't change a thing.BasterVery nice, don't change a thingWhiskMaybe make the handle out of silicone?  Why not have this be one piece.  Perhaps construction is easier this way.  The hook at the top is a little big, suggest cutting it in half.  Also suggest opening up the bulb of the whisk a little more.  Did fine when I whipped up some eggs for scrambling.Pros-Soft feel-Solid one piece construction-Benefits of silicone constructionCons-Little spatula handle could be stiffer-No different colors offered-Spatulas are a little stiff-Little spatula shaft is not long enough at the topI have cooked with these for a few weeks now and really like them.  They wash well in the dishwasher and overall have a very nice design.  I like the feel of silicone, the bright colors and the fact that I no longer have to worry about the spatula head ever falling off of the shaft again and into my cake batter.  All utensils perform well but my only gripe is with the little spatula and this can easily be tweaked for the next go round.I was provided a sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.  This is a nice set, look at the other user comments, StarPack has done a nice job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EIGHELN9U1IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3M78GA#wasThisHelpful","R1EIGHELN9U1IX","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:51 MinsThe F80 is the quintessential device missing from your life.  A couple of things stand out about this flash drive which set it apart from others.  First, it is the perfect blend of form and function.  I keep mine on my keychain and always have it with me now.  The device is water, shock, dust and vibrationproof - that is super impressive and it doesn't even have a cap.  I have had mine for over a month now in my bag and pockets and it still works great.  I really like the way it looks and when I plug it into my Windows 7 laptop it works fine.If you need any more convincing, just look at the reviews, wow...I like the circular loop, thin diameter and the fact that there are no cracks in the loop - it is one piece construction.  If you are in the market for a flash drive then the F80 is a great choice.The only con is that it is USB 2.0 - hopefully this will be fixed the next time the company updates the product.I was provided a sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM69BEOLBGS6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006LTTHNA#wasThisHelpful","RM69BEOLBGS6K","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:42 MinsThis hard drive ranks among one of the best that I have tested.  I got transfer speeds better then Western Digital and Seagate drives at 114 MB/s.  Where this hard drive really stands apart from the rest is with the shockproof design and being built to military specifications.

" 5:17 MinsGreat portable charger that has worked well for me for the last couple of weeks.  First off, the product I received looks different than both products shown here.  I think they were gen 1 and gen 2 and the one in my video must be gen 3.  I will place an e-mail to the manufacturer to confirm and then will update my review.The charger is 5600 mAh which is ideal for charging up cell phones and small tablets.  It will charge an iPad in a pinch, mostly will just keep it running rather than actually charging it.  It charges at 1A, so it isn't a rapid charger (1.5A or 2.1A) but it gets the job done.I like a couple of the features and the way this charger was laid out and designed.  I like how all of the buttons are on one side, this way they don't accidentally get pushed while in your bag.  I like the 4 LED battery meter on the side, it is discreet and is really all you need to do to be able to see where the battery is at in terms of charging/discharging.  I also like how the charger comes with an adaptable USB cord that will accept a 30 pin iPhone/iPod, a micro USB (which is handy to charge the charger with), a mini USB and a pin barrel.  So lots of versatility here in one cord and for the price this is a nice feature for just the cord alone.  The charger also comes with an integrated circuit protector to safely avoid overcharging your devices and short circuits.  One last point to mention, the blue LED light will also turn into a white LED so you can see your way around in the dark.  It isn't terribly bright but it is a nice add on feature that Alaska Bear thought to include.Last but not least, I was provided a sample in exchange for my fair and honest review.  I have tested this product out for several weeks now, so has my wife and we are both happy with it and it's performance.  If there were problems or concerns I wouldn't be recommending it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7Y2KHYAL9GHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESUIX4S#wasThisHelpful","R7Y2KHYAL9GHR","A1QC8UPMF4XAYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QC8UPMF4XAYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The price is good and the bags do their job OK, but using the bags is very inconvenient and messy because they are not rolled on a cardboard tube but folded together and hard to separate; they are not like kleenex in a box where pulling one out will set up another one to be pulled. At one point I had to pull the entire clump of bags out of its box and then slide each single bag loose in order to access them, which led to lots of bags floating around loose in the drawer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R856G5FUSDGEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012TTWXU4#wasThisHelpful","R856G5FUSDGEI","A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this tool to cut away a small portion of tile countertop at the back of my stove so I could install a new stove that must be flush with the wall. Because the space was very cramped and did not have room to use my big and powerful Sawzall, a powered hand tool was the only feasible solution, so I purchased this item from Amazon.The tool feels heavy and solid and makes a very loud noise while in operation; the cutting blade feels a bit flimsy. The tool comes with a selection of sanding and cutting attachments; I used what looked like a spatula with a saw edge to cut through several pieces of wood that had to be removed. This process went quickly and effectively as far as the plywood substrate and backer board were concerned. However, I did not think the tool and blade could possibly stand up to cutting through the tile on top of the counter so I removed several pieces of tile the old-fashioned way, by chiseling out the grout and prying out the tile. Once the tile was gone the Pit Bull made the wood cutting part of the task a quick and simple matter. (I might have been able to use the Pit Bull to cut away the grout from around the sides of the tile, but the grout was extremely heavy and took lots of blows with hammer and chisel to remove it, so I did not want to risk breaking or dulling my only saw-edged blade.)The cutting, sanding and other attachments were easy to attach and remove with the included wrench.My main concern is that the construction of the Pit Bull tool seems a bit on the rough side, nothing like a precision piece of equipment, which makes me wonder how long it will last. Also included in the box was a set of motor brushes, which made me wonder if the brushes are likely to wear out. If I were a handyman or other worker who would give it fairly heavy use every day, I might have considered paying up for a brand-name tool that costs twice as much. On the other hand, I don't anticipate that I will need to use it very often, so I am awarding four stars. The other concern was with the attachments:  I am not sure I will be able to find other or replacement attachments in my local big box stores, and the saw-edged blade I used for cutting the plywood seemed to flex a little more while cutting than it should have. I had visions of the blade snapping in mid-use, though this did not occur.Bottom line:  Low price compared to similar brand-name tools, got the job done and was delivered on schedule for a time-sensitive project. It feels as if it might not stand up to heavy daily use over an extended period of time, but it was sufficient for my purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVAJKXM7ZAR56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003HY5TFW#wasThisHelpful","RVAJKXM7ZAR56","A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom line:  Several quality components in one box, major reduction in connecting wires, moderate cost, very good sound and video quality, whats not to like? I would buy this unit again if I needed another sound base and would recommend it to friends and family. Philips has pulled off a major technical feat by combining a sound system, 3D Blu Ray player, BlueTooth, several streaming channels and FM radio in a single box. Too good to be true, you ask? Well, read on.Warning:  I usually write thorough reviews, and this one has to be extra-long because it must cover a multitude of components and capabilities.I purchased the Philips HTB3525B Surround Base to support, and provide audio and video for, a 32 (diagonal) TV on a countertop in my 13x15 den, where a 5.1/7.1 surround system or even a typical sound bar simply wont fit.Many years ago I was an audiophile, with lots speakers and amps and preamps and receivers and all that good stuff, but in recent years I have found it necessary for space reasons to install 4 different sound-bar-with-subwoofer setups in three different homes and discovered that they were entirely satisfactory, if not as dazzling and immersive as 5.1/7.1 systems. Also, I find that in a smaller space like a den or bedroom it is desirable to eliminate most of the wires and equipment by using a good-quality sound bar or, in this situation, a sound base.I read the specs for, and listened to a wide variety of, sound base systems, narrowing my search to units with good audio quality and moderate price that could fit in a bookcase opening 30  inches wide. (Yes, there are some sound bases that are wider than 30  inches.)This Philips unit rose to the top of my list because it contains so many components in one box, the technical specs are impressive and the online reviews are generally positive. Finally, the price is surprisingly low given the number of included components, so I ordered one from Amazon. Here are my observations after more than two weeks of testing the unit.ProsMulti-Purpose:  Having all of the equipment and capabilities (3D Blu Ray, BlueTooth, FM radio, Dolby sound, HDMI) all in one unit, and eliminating all but one or two connecting wires, is wonderfully convenient and greatly reduces clutter. Sometimes all-in-one systems have one or two weak components, but I found all of this units functions to be of high quality.Sound and Video Quality:  I have two other Sony 3D Blu Ray players, and audio/video from this units BR is comparable to that from the Sonys. This Blu Ray does an excellent job with both video and music, and while it might be possible to get somewhat better images and sound out of a free-standing, top-end BR player, I am not sure I would be able to tell the difference. When playing BRs, DVDs and CDs and watching cable TV on this unit I have heard and seen details that I never noticed before, so I think its sound/video capability is definitely higher than average. (Of course, the final quality of video and music depends in large part on the source; for example, a Blu Ray movie will virtually always have better video and sound quality than the same movie on a DVD, and cable sources vary substantially in quality.)This unit contains sophisticated electronics normally available only on more expensive systems (go online and Google Philips Surround Base manual to see 2 pages of technical details). The HDMI connection to the TV is as simple as it gets.There is a large selection of audio presets that allow maximizing sound quality. If one of these doesnt meet your needs there is also an option to vary those settings and to create a custom audio setting that controls treble, mid and bass levels independently of each other. Finding a sound base that allows the user to control all 3 of these levels separately is unusual and highly desirable.Sound Volume and Field:  In my 13x15 den the units higher volume settings can be overwhelmingly loud. As an experiment I also used the unit to play CDs and BlueTooth selections in my much larger family room, where the high-quality sound easily filled the room. I know, it is not true surround sound like 5.1 or 7.1, but the units surround setting opens the sound field perceptibly and the stereo setting does provide noticeable stereo separation. The volume setting goes up to 45, but 20 is enough for me most of the time, anything over 30 is too much, and at 40 the sound begins to become distorted. For those who play BRs, DVDs, CDs and cable TV at low volumes there is a preset that gives added clarity to dialogue and singing voices, a helpful  option for folks with hearing issues or those who want to watch/listen at night without annoying those who are trying to sleep. There is also an earphone jack so you can turn the volume as high as you want and destroy your hearing without disturbing family and neighbors.BlueTooth:  The BT function, with its option of using NFC, works easily and well.Streaming:  The short list of built-in streaming services includes Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Pandora and a couple more but, OMG, no Amazon Prime! However, if you want you can always add more services via a relatively inexpensive Roku or similar device; and if you happen to have a smart TV you already have lots of streaming services available.FM Radio:  With the on-board availability of BlueTooth and Pandora it is hard to get excited about the included FM radio. However, if you want or need an FM tuner this unit will do the job. For homes or areas where FM reception is weak it can be improved by plugging the included short antenna into the appropriate slot on the back of the unit. Another trick for improving FM sound quality in an area of poor reception is to switch the FM from stereo to mono, which reduces static and hiss (at the cost of losing stereo separation).Remote:  The remote is well designed and highly functional, allowing the user to make all sorts of modifications to the listening/viewing experience, particularly in the treble/mid/bass. For those who dont like to tinker with settings, the many factory presets offer varied choices right out of the box and are easily implemented by the remote. Backlighting would have been nice, but its absence is a minor annoyance, not a deal-breaker.Looks:  The unit is very attractive. Sitting on a shelf by itself it seems at first almost too wide and ungainly, but it immediately takes on an unobtrusive and proportional look when the TV is placed on top of it.Capacity:  According to stickers on the product, this sound base can support up to 55 TVs or up to 48.5 lbs of weight. Some smaller TVs and of course larger TVs can weigh even more, so be sure to double-check the supporting capacity of any sound base you are considering and confirm the manufacturers stated weight of the TV you want your sound base to support. The size and configuration of the TV stand are critical, too, because some TV stands may be too big or oddly shaped to fit on top of the sound base. If your TV is too big or heavy to be supported by this unit, you can always put the sound base on a shelf just below the TV.Cost:  Amazons price for this unit is a bargain, especially when compared with buying all of the included functions as separate stand-alone units, and is a bit lower than other mid-range sound bases. Based on my research on higher-end sound bases you would have to pay at least $450 and up to $700 to get any incremental improvement, and the more expensive sound bases would likely lack Blu Ray and FM.ConsThis unit has so many benefits and positive attributes that it takes some effort to identify any issues that are significant in my situation.Despite Philips calling this unit a Surround Base, forget about getting true surround sound from this or any other sound base or sound bar. However, if you are shopping in this niche you already know and accept that sound bars and sound bases just cant provide the same immersive experience as a 5.1/7.1 system.The bass from the small, down-firing subwoofer on the bottom of the unit is good but not gut-punching, so for those who want the ultimate, window-shaking bass experience it would be nice if this unit had provided, or allowed connecting, a wireless subwoofer. However, in my den and even in my much larger family room I found that the bass from this unit was enough to handle typical crash/boom/bang movie scenes as well as the lower-register nuances of classical music and jazz. Higher frequency sounds and music are clear and crisp.After playing more than a dozen Blu Ray discs, DVDs and CDs and TV programs over a period of many days, I have noticed only one other issue:  the units sound field is narrower and shallower than that of my Sharp HT-SB60 sound bar, and the stereo separation is less because my Sharp bar is 54.5 wide versus the 27.5 width of this Philips sound base. However, this is a secondary AV installation, my den and TV are so small that  large stereo separation is not necessary, and there is simply no room for a sound bar anyway, so for me this is a non-issue.Thank You Amazon Prime:  Should problems arise during the initial period of product use, dealing with Amazon as opposed to the manufacturer or a vendor other than Amazon is usually a great advantage. These days I find that I buy almost everything except groceries and gasoline from Amazon because its selection, customer service, return policy and delivery are outstanding.Disclaimer:  I have no personal or business relationship with Amazon nor the manufacturer of this product and I paid for it with my own funds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBXBTYDPVFN7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUJAJD6#wasThisHelpful","RBXBTYDPVFN7H","A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom line:  This versatile vest has lots of pockets and lots of potential. However, I had to return it because after several days of trying to close the front zipper it consistently jammed when I attempted to zip the vest up. It has several pros and other cons, including loose CC pockets and tight, noisy velcro pocket fasteners that call into question the vests suitability for CC use.While Rothco calls this a plainclothes concealed carry (CC) vest, Rothco also states that it is a modified version of its deluxe safari outback vest, so it is generally suitable for other activities like hunting, fishing, photography, hiking, safaris and travel, whether or not CC is involved.Construction/Durability:  The vest is made well enough and feels fairly sturdy, though I did notice several loose threads that often are a sign of problems to come. Bar-tacking its stress points, which 5.11 does with its vests, would provide even greater sturdiness but undoubtedly raise the price. The two-way front zipper is a nice feature but I found mine would jam whenever I tried to get it started. The vest feels a bit heavy, but that is due to all the pockets and other layers of cloth, webbing, etc. The washable poly/cotton material is not waterproof, but an application of an appropriate spray will help with that. Webbing and slits in back help with ventilation, but the slits make total waterproofing impossible.  Issue: Some reviews suggest that durability may be a concern, so factor those comments in when judging whether this vest will stand up to your type and frequency of use.Size/Fit:  I am 60 tall, weigh 220 lbs and normally wear a size 45 Long or 46 Long sports jacket, an XL (extra large) long-sleeved shirt and an XL (extra large) golf shirt. Because many Amazon reviewers commented that this vest runs big, I ordered a size smaller, L (large), which fits a bit loosely but not enough that I would want anything smaller. The top outside edges of the vest extend pretty far out along the tops of my shoulders: any farther and I would probably want a smaller size, which then would probably make it too tight around my torso. The bottom of the vest hangs to about 6 below my belt. If you fill only half of the pockets with stuff, too small a size would probably make the vest look too lumpy and feel tight, so having a bit of extra room in the fit is probably a good idea. There are straps and D-rings that allow tightening the vest around the torso, though doing so might create printing issues. Issue:  Many of the reviews address sizing, so those that include information on height, weight and clothing size can help determine what size vest might be best for you.Stealth...Not:  Most of the pockets are closed with industrial strength velcro patches that usually take two hands to open and create quite a loud noise when pulled apart--any perp or threat source close enough for you to shoot or vice versa will probably be able to hear the ripping noise of the velcro. Some of the velcro closures are so tight that it might be hard for someone with arthritic hands to open them. Issue:  If you need to be able to open your CC pockets quietly and quickly this is not the vest for you. (Note:  ScotteVest has magnetic closures on some of its vests and jackets, which makes opening pockets much quieter and easier than those with velcro but the magnets feel too weak to secure anything weighty like a pistol.)CC:  While this vest is well suited to safaris, travel and various outdoor activities, it is not so good for concealed carry. There are two large, inside pockets that will hold fairly large pistols without obvious printing/patterning, though all sizes can move around in the pocket unless stabilized with a minimal holster or some after-market velcro customizing. The large interior pockets are open on two sides and held closed at one upper corner only by small but very tight velcro patches, so there is some danger that pistols, especially small ones, can fairly easily slip out of the pockets when the wearer bends over, lays the vest on a chair or couch, etc. The two pairs of inside mag pockets also have the velcro closures, but these are a bit quieter and easier to open than the ones on the CC pockets. Oddly, the padding of the two inner CC pockets is on the inside, so the padding doesnt really help prevent printing; it is the exterior pockets that cover the inner CC pockets that seem to be designed to reduce printing. Issue:  Do you really want to carry a loaded, unholstered pistol loose and pointing any which way in a large, not well secured inner pocket? Can you realistically expect to make a quick draw or swiftly grab another mag if you have to use two hands to open tight velcro fasteners?Shoot me first:  Some reviewers have suggested that wearing a vest like this is a blatant advertisement that you are carrying and therefore makes you likely to be the first target in certain encounter scenarios. There may be some truth to this, but there are many locations where plenty of non-carrying folks commonly wear vests like these for hiking, photography, hunting, fishing, etc. and therefore are not necessarily likely to be primary targets. Something to think about:  there could be situations in which bad guys will spot the vest and decide to pick on a softer target to mug or carjack. Issue: If this vest were black it would look like a tactical vest; in khaki it looks like vests worn in many areas for a wide range of outdoor activities. Whatever color vest you choose, in most urban and rural areas most LEOs and most bad guys will have a good idea what this vest is for. As for wanting to be inconspicuous or unidentifiable as a carrier, I am pretty certain that no air marshal would ever wear one of these vests while on duty. Whether or not you are carrying, if you wear this vest or anything like it while traveling abroad you will generally be identified as a tourist or other outsider.Safari:  In the 1960s I lived in Africa for a couple of years and went on numerous safaris; I wish there had been something like this versatile vest available back then to carry all the stuff I needed while out in the bush. Tailors in Nairobi or Dar es Salaam or Addis Ababa were able to sew up custom safari jackets or vests overnight, but they were made of a heavy, chafing, canvas-like cotton, didnt have enough pockets, and lacked vents and internal mesh backing, so this contemporary Rothco version is much better. Issue: These days custom tailored safari wear is still more attractive but still less functional and much more expensive than off-the-rack vests like this one. BTW, if you wear this vest while on safari or engaging in various outdoor activities you will be envied for its convenience and carrying capacity; if you wear it in a city you may be a source of amusement for locals and foreigners alike.Photography:  The pockets will hold lots of gear, but only the inner sides of the two CC pockets are padded and there is no pocket really suitable for a long telephoto lens or a bulky SLR or DSLR. Opening the noisy velcro pocket closures will be clearly audible to your human and animal subjects unless you are using a long telephoto lens.Travel:  Travelers can carry a lot of their necessities in a vest like this, which is easy to remove and place in a plastic bin at the airport security line. The vest is an item of clothing, so if you wear it onto the plane it and its contents will generally not count as part of your carry-on baggage allotment. (Important note:  Unless you are an air marshall or otherwise officially authorized, do not even think about using this vest to carry restricted items through an airport security checkpoint, and even if you are authorized you wouldnt want to put this vest in an overhead bin or under the seat where any heavy items might fairly easily slip out of the inside CC pockets.)Style:  Lets face it, vests like these wont earn any style points, but thats not why people buy them. If you want a svelte, uncluttered look this is not the vest for you.

"I know, who can get excited about alkaline batteries? While they are a critical part of our lives, they all look pretty much alike and we tend to take them for granted until they run out of juice, at which point we curse them. Tough life, being a battery--ignored, then at the end of life berated.That said, I must observe that these are good, long-life batteries that serve a critical purpose in my home, where I use four of them at a time to power a flood alarm in the closet where one of my water heaters is located. A leaking or flooding water heater can easily lead to thousands of dollars' worth of damages, so buying these reliable batteries for my leak/flood alarm is a no-brainer. Their useful life in this setting is about 8 months so, to be on the safe side, I replace them every 6-7 months. When all these batteries are drained I will buy another supply of them--from Amazon, of course, where I buy almost everything these days except groceries and gasoline.Disclaimer:  I have no business or personal relationship with the manufacturer of this product and I paid for the product with my own funds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HWMEN9YJYD8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009PPOYAS#wasThisHelpful","R3HWMEN9YJYD8F","A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had one of these a couple of decades ago, back in the dark ages when microwaves did not come with automatically-rotating turntables, and I tossed the device out when I moved into a house that had a microwave with a turntable.Fast forward to 2014, when we bought a house with very recent and upscale appliances--except for the microwave, which is of recent vintage but has no turntable. Most of the time this is not an issue, but I often cook and reheat main meals in the current microwave, which heats unevenly due to the lack of a turntable. I finally broke down and bought this item, which works as advertised. It costs twice as much as the almost identical item did 20 years ago (while high-end microwaves cost half of what they did 20 years ago). The device still makes an awful noise when being rewound, and the need for frequent rewinding is as irritating now as it was 20 years ago. On the other hand, this item gets the job done and I haven't found a better alternative. Truth to tell, I am secretly wishing for my current microwave to die so I can have an excuse to put in a new one with a built-in turntable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKCS8YJ7WOWR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004W4UT#wasThisHelpful","RKCS8YJ7WOWR5","A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Halle Berry offers an outstanding performance and looks great, as always. The plot is twisted and complex and the cinematography is A-OK.My only substantial criticism is that Ms. Berry's male co-lead is a real clunker whose acting is rather wooden and whose accent jumps from faux-American to his native Croatian (or whatever it is) from moment to moment; perhaps the producers had to scale down the male lead's salary--and therefore capabilities--in order to pay whatever premium Halle Berry deservedly commands these days. Since scientists are often portrayed as having foreign accents it would have been better to let the male lead keep his native Croatian accent and let a brief bit of dialogue reveal that his back story includes his having immigrated from Croatia.BTW, I have nothing against foreign accents--Bela Lugosi was compelling in Dracula, and Russell Crowe does a fine job with an American accent when his role calls for losing his native New Zealand accent. I just find it annoying and distracting in a movie or TV show when an actor/actress can't maintain an appropriate--or consistent--accent.Bottom line:  With good special effects, an engrossing plot and Halle Berry, this series is definitely worth a look. With a more credible and capable male lead I would have given 4 stars for sure or possibly even 5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CNPX8Z1733EQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LI0VA4Q#wasThisHelpful","R1CNPX8Z1733EQ","A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By 21st century standards, this film is a dinosaur. However, for its time it was the epitome of special effects and sci-fi escapism (literally). Today's young people will undoubtedly laugh at the funky sets, the often-wooden acting and the lack of ethnic diversity (no people of color on the rocket to the new planet), but this film is worth four stars if only for its historical value and amusement quotient.By the way, the lack of ethnic diversity on the U.S. escape rocket could have set the scene for a sequel, which was not so common in the 1950's:  Other nations were building escape rockets, too, and had those ships also made it to the new planet a basis could have existed for a subsequent film dealing with international and inter-ethnic disagreements and conflicts (U.S. colony vs the Russian colony, Cold War redux, etc.).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PL6N2Y45YVJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RPB8XS#wasThisHelpful","R3PL6N2Y45YVJR","A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, they have an approximate lighted area of just over 1-square-inch, which gives off less light than the 3-square-inch units I used in my other house.If the larger night lights had still been available at a comparable price point I would have opted for the bigger units; however, these do the job well enough that I decided to keep them even though I could have returned them at Amazon's expense.On the positive side, these were not very expensive and they have a negligible electrical draw (0.03 watts).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R115AQAOP3O4V6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DNBWE0#wasThisHelpful","R115AQAOP3O4V6","A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have bought several editions of this book over the years in preparation for retirement. Coming from the northeast US we found that warm weather was our main criterion in selecting our retirement location, and this book provides a wealth of information related to weather and its seasonal variations. However, the book goes on to provide detailed information about many other criteria:  health services, crime rate, cost of living, real estate, quality of life, etc., all of which are important decision-making components.My wife and I have been retired in FL for 6 years and, while the warm climate is still very important to us, we find that health services are of increasing concern. Our small community has limited and relatively low-rated health services and facilities, though we have found an internist we really like. However, the local hospitals and specialty doctors are, to put it nicely, ranked in the middle of all of the medical quality ratings. The nearest bigger cities, which have better facilities and services, are about 2 hours away, and the very best medical services and facilities are in the biggest cities, which are 3-4 hours away.We are fortunate that our health is relatively good, but if we ever have to face serious illness (heart attack, cancer), I know we will wish we were closer to top medical care.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17S517GB1IVYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0979319900#wasThisHelpful","R17S517GB1IVYX","A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PKXKC5V9M8Z1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are very few books that once I started reading, I read all the way through without putting the book down.  This is one of those books.  For this book one of those reasons was the writing style.  I am not sure how to describe it exactly, but it ""flowed"" very well, from one sentence to the next, from one paragraph to the next, from one page to the next.  It was engaging and delightful to read and pulled me along into the next page and the next and the next.  The other reason, of course, was the story itself. Part of that was because of Dana herself who had such a positive attitude even before she was paralyzed as she grew up in a rather troubling revolving-parent family life.  She rolled with the punches, as they say, living the best that could be done at the moment she was in.  Watching her after her attack was even more amazing as she would not be defeated, and stood up, took control of her life, and lived it as she saw her limitations to be (or not to be), not as others told her that her limitations would be.  What was most distressing about that situation was the attitude the military took with her in the terrible choice she was given that lead her to not persecute her attacker.  Hopefully her story helps to change that type of behavior.Increasing the interest of the book is the alternate forms of therapy she investigated, especially stem cell work.  Her involvement with those who helped her forgive was also enlightening.There is much to this book--the story itself, the information on various therapies that helped her, PTSD, the military's reluctance to prosecute rapists, and the power of forgiveness. But most important is the message to never give up, to take control of one's life instead of accepting limitations that others put on you, and to make the best of each moment you are living now, not just putting off life until tomorrow or the next week or the next year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12L1JYWL9KFFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401946348#wasThisHelpful","R12L1JYWL9KFFX","A13Z96HR8EEF24","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Z96HR8EEF24?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This could be a good game, but it isn't.  It is colorful.  The board is attractive.  The little cars are cool.  There are stars and events and singing and acting out situations. The money and all the various cards are durable.  The rules are simple and easy to learn.So what is the problem?  It is impossible not to win in a matter of minutes.  It is like the game makes set out to see how fast he could make someone win.  Does no one have more than a 3 minute attention span?  This is a nice looking game, but in the about 12 games I have played with my kid, never did either of us get around even a third of the game board before someone won.We fixed this somewhat by changing the rules.  No ""attraction"" is free.  One dollar attractions now cost $2. Any card that says you get two free stars means you only get one.  Any card that says you get one free star is only worth half a star.  Any card that says you lose a star means you lose two stars.  You don't get a card at all unless you roll certain numbers.  Some events you need an exact number roll to get in instead of just going in as you pass by.  We have been messing around with the rules and how to make money (like you get a dollar for passing any starting space not just your own) in order to make the game more enjoyable and playable.  We don't have it perfect yet, but it is getting better.  Out changes have made the game better because you can actually play it for awhile.So this is an attractive game with good game pieces.  It is just too easy to win.  Play it as it is and you spend more time getting the game out and putting it away than you will spend playing it.  Change the rules on your own, so it is not so ridiculously easy to win and it is much better.  I only gave it three stars because it is attractive and has nice pieces.  For game play however, it is not more than a one.  Make up your own rules so you can play more than three minutes and it is much better.Oh, don't compare this to the original game of Life because it is nothing like it.  It just uses the name to catch your attention.  But I don't care what they call it.  I cal it a decent attempt at a game ruined by the inability to make the game last more than a few minutes unless you make up your own rules.

I doubt if any game between me and my daughter went over 10 minutes.  So we changed the rules so to win you needed ten banana bunches instead of just five.

"I am not a fan of fondant.  I avoid fondant.  Actually, I kind of hate fondant.  I like icing.  Icing is your friend!  However, even though I hate fondant, my daughter likes using it to decorate cakes, so I buy her fondant.  And this is much better stuff than the fondant I have been buying her which I get at Walmart.  It spreads much thinner and is much less likely to tear.  She is very happy with using this brand of fondant.  So now, she will probably not be satisfied with the cheap stuff.  Dagnabbit.  Oh well.  And everyone in house but me also eats it. Actually, my son doesn't eat it either but he doesn't even eat cake, so his vote does not count.

"This is a good book that explains the battle well.  It explains who was involved and how their personalities and actions affected the battle.  There is a section on the draft, weapons, communications, battle conditions in the back of the book that is also very good.However, I think for the younger reader, the book could have had more effort in pulling the entire battle together.  It is excellent in dealing with all the details in the back and forth battle, but it tends to make the big picture a bit confusing.But even then, this is a well told story that moves along quickly without getting boring.

"There are coyotes in the area in which I live.  I have seen them.  I have heard them.  However, I can't convince any of them to stand watch over my garden.  I have deer, rabbit, and probably other critters running around in my garden.  It is mainly a problem when the plants are small and critters eat the sprouts off.  And since there is always a framer growing field corn near me, the deer tend to wander out of his area and over to my garden periodically after the plants finally grow to a decent size.  They don't do major damage, but they tend to nibble the young ears of corn just enough to ruin them.  So I figured I would try this thing.  It actually looks pretty good.  It is easy to set up, but a little fugly, so I am not sure I would want to be folding and unfolding it a great deal.  The coyote material and the hardware seems decent enough that this will last awhile.  It holds in the ground well enough and doesn't fall over easy in the wind.  It moves around a bit in a breeze, but that is a good thing.However, since I don't have my garden planted yet, I have no idea if this works to actually scare critters.  In fact, since I don't have animal problems every year, it will be hard to know if this thing scared the critters off or if it is just a good year to not have critters lurking about.  But the idea I have is that since there are already coyotes in the area, the deer just from being harassed by the real coyotes will think this is also real and will stay away.  The problem is that deer aren't stupid, so the whole concept worries me.  Anyway, while I think this is built well and should last awhile, I also think it costs a little much for what it is.  Actually, for what it cost, I could probably buy more corn than I will grow anyway.  And I am hoping I don't find it full of holes from bow hunters in the area!Oh well, I am happy with this thing.  It looks the part and seems like a decent quality thing.  I will know more after growing season.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DUYDP0FD44QA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QVUEPI#wasThisHelpful","R2DUYDP0FD44QA","A13Z96HR8EEF24","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Z96HR8EEF24?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do not view Halle Berry as a great actress. She does well when playing a supporting cast, but not the lead. With that said this was a decent show with some good casting and an interesting theme. The visuals were top notch! The near future gadgets caught my attention throughout the series. If I were not a Sci-Fi buff I would rate this three stars versus four. The theme did flow well enough to keep me engaged and watch the series to the end. Therefore, I felt that it earned a fourth star.Be patient. It takes a little time for the show to explain how it got to the starting point of where you picked it up. There are a few disjointed scenes throughout the series that interrupt the overall flow, but they are not ""show"" stoppers (ba-dump-dump, ting).

"Excellent product. I alternate days (or sometimes weeks) between this product and Zinc Balance. Zinc Balance contains a little copper with it and is 15 mg of zinc L-Monomethionine which absorbs exceptionally well. A 25 mg dosage is as high as I would go with zinc supplements unless I were sick. Then I would consider taking this twice per day for a few days.I purposely do not take zinc supplements more than five days per week. If I have had a very stressful week I may take  zinc six days per week, but never seven. I take zinc either on an empty stomach or with a protein-rich meal such as scrambled eggs.30 to 50 mg of zinc will deplete copper and iron (to a lesser degree). Your body dose not require much zinc to be healthy. In addition, you do get some zinc in food (possibly not enough especially as you hit 30 and older).Zinc absorption is blocked by phytates found in plants such as salad and veggies. Try to take your zinc on an empty stomach or with protein. Not with veggies or salad.Megadosers believe that the more you take the better off you are. They are wrong. They overdose on every vitamin and mineral that they can buy not realizing the long term peril they are putting themselves in.

"Now Foods is a decent brand for the buck. They have good quality products (not top quality) that are affordable for most. This particular product does NOT specify the type of Menaquinone it uses, which I find suspicious. Yet on their website they do sell a product that lists Menaquinone-7 as the ingredient.I do not recommend purchasing mystery ingredients for three reasons; 1) there is no easy way to tell if the product is working or not, 2) your bone health depends on how well this product works, 3) your very life depends on how well this product works.MK-4 requires 4 mg or so to be effective where as MK-7 only requires 100 to 300 mcg to obtain long term results. The MK-X (unknown) in this product is costing you money while gambling with your bone health and your life if it is not effective. Until this label is updated to reflect the actual form of Menaquinone, I suggest buying a different brand.Your bone health and your life are worth it.To those who have given this product high ratings I say; ""The devil is in the details"".","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T4SO76258NV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013EJ5QM#wasThisHelpful","R1T4SO76258NV0","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Grocery store multi's are of extremely poor quality. People buy them because of the commercials and the convenience of already being in the store to buy other items.Opti-Men absorbs extremely well. They are fairly soft and easy to swallow. Our bodies flush out excess ""stuff"" over a four to six hour period or so. This is why it is best to reload your nutrients periodically throughout the day.I never take the full daily dose of multi's (except when sick which is extremely rare). I typically stick to a half dose or 1/3 dose. I break one pill in half and take half in the morning and half (or whole one) late afternoon. I eat fairly healthy as well.This product will help to keep you healthy. I strongly advise against taking a full daily dose unless you have a cold, or the flu, or getting over a harsh medical treatment or condition. I also advise you to spread out the dosage to at least twice per day. Do not take it too late in the evening as it may slightly interfere with your sleep (depends on the person). Take it with a meal so that it can dissolve inside a mass of ""chime"" (goo) inside your intestines. Sort of like dropping a blue pill in water and watching the water turn blue. This will maximize the absorption as the nutrients mix in with the goo that was your meal. The goo will shuttle the nutrients through your intestinal tract for maximum absorption over a longer period of time.I encourage you to skip taking this or any multivitamin at least one full day (if not two) per week to allow excess that may have collected over several days to be flushed. I typically skip Sundays or one weekday. Keep in mind you are getting additional nutrients in your food.High protein meals trigger your intestines to slow down the ""pushing"" process to allow more time to absorb the protein (our bodies are awesome machines). So if you take this vitamin with a high protein meal, it too will spend more time inside your small intestines allowing a bit more to be absorbed. I sometimes take my multi with a protein shake. Chicken, fish, beef, and so forth are rich in protein which enhances nutrient absorption.==> Don't forget. Your food contains nutrients as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFC4R9GLB66GL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKK3MA6#wasThisHelpful","RFC4R9GLB66GL","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Easy fix for similar complaints. Purchase anti-skid liner for drawers from your local Target and cut to size.

"This product is also recommended in a nutrition book called It's Not the Cans: The Best Nutrient Balance for a Stronger and Healthier YouThis is a brand I have come to trust. They are the true gold standard for the supplement industry. I hope that they continue to keep tight Quality Assurance checks and balances on their products. They can be a bit pricey sometimes but the quality and the correct dosage of their products are worth every penny. I have not tried all of their products. However, the ones that I do take always meet or exceed expectations.About this product: Vitamin D stores exceptionally well in your system for several weeks. Taking vitamin D3 daily actually slightly impairs utilization. Studies show that blood serum levels increased when supplemental vitamin D is not taken daily. I recommend taking one 2000 IU capsule, 3 nonconsecutive days per week. An example would be Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This product should NOT be your only source of vitamin D.Megadosers suggest ingesting massive amounts of vitamin D for some imaginary benefits. A total of 8,400 IU  to 12,600 IU per week (averages out to 1200 to 1800 IU per day) is more than most people for maximum benefit. Anything that averages more than 2000 IU per day (14,000 IU per week) is a waste of money and will not do anything more for you.You also need adequate magnesium levels to activate the vitamin D inside of you. Rather than megadosing on vitamin D, you will  be better served by ensuring that you are getting 300 mg to 600 mg of quality magnesium each day. This will activate your vitamin D. Doctors rarely ensure that their patients have adequate magnesium in their diet before they prescribe massive doses of vitamin D due to a perceived deficiency. Although you may be moderately deficient in vitamin D, a moderate increase in D coupled with adequate magnesium intake will yield far better results than a massive increase in vitamin D alone.PS don't forget to get 100 mcg of vitamin K2 as well to protect your arteries from the increased calcium absorption and strengthen your bones and teeth.Checkout not the cans d ot com for more info.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JYDBXXVCN1NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G73N3I#wasThisHelpful","R3JYDBXXVCN1NP","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent product. I am very impressed at the quality-to-price ratio! It doesn't take a lot of this product to produce a rich, long-lasting lather so one bar lasts me quite a while.The soap you choose may not be the only issue. It may also be the water.

"This product is now recommended in a new nutrition book called It's Not the Cans: The Best Nutrient Balance for a Stronger and Healthier YouThis is a potent product. 1/2 teaspoon equates to 25, 100 mg tablets in a single dose.I bought this product primarily to neutralize the chlorine and chloramines in my bath water. Based on the science, 1000 mg of vitamin C will neutralize 100% of the chlorine and chloramines contained in 100 gallons of water. This equates to 10 mg of vitamin C to completely neutralize the chlorine and chloramines in 1 gallon of water.The average bathtub holds approx. 30 gallons of water when full. This means that on average, you require only 300 mg of vitamin C to neutralize the chlorine and chloramines in a full tub. Of course, when we leave room for our body we do not completely fill the tub.==> Let us assume we place 25 gallons of water in a tub to bathe in. That means we would need to add 250 mg of vitamin C to the water to neutralize 100% of the chlorine and chloramines. That equates to 1/10 of 1/2 of 1 teaspoon of this product!!!!==> Let's say we want to be certain because your area may use a little more chlorine and chloramines to treat the water. So we decide to double the dose. This means we would add 500 mg of vitamin C to 25 gallons of bath water. This equates to 1/5 of 1/2 teaspoon of this product!!!==> Let's be paranoid and go 4 times the amount of C for a 25 gallon tub, which equals 1000 mg. This equates to less than 1/4 teaspoon of this product!!!According to the label there are 181 servings (1/2 teaspoon) in this container which means even at 4 times amount needed for a 25 gallon bath, we have 362 baths in each bottle (that is after rounding up to a full 1/4 teaspoon)!!!!Not only do I bathe with this product, I also add a little to a large bowl of water when I choose to wash my hair in the sink. I use a cup to scoop out water to rinse my hair. After doing this and installing a chlorine filter in my shower, my scalp has completely stopped itching!!! Please note, vitamin C may cause hair des to fade quicker.If you choose to drink this product, I strongly encourage you to stay below 1/4 teaspoon per day. Please consider that 1/4 teaspoon is still 1200 mg of supplemental C. I get my C from strawberries and pure, organic orange juice as well as via a high quality multi-vitamin (Opti-Men). Excess vitamin C intake (300 mg or more) can be a causal factor for insomnia. You do not need much to be healthy.I highly recommend bathing in this product, shaving with this product added to the water, and washing your hair and face with this product. I also recommend installing a quality, chlorine shower filter.Please note that chorine filters do NOT remove chloramines. That is okay because removing the chlorine is still great for your hair, skin, and lungs.In case I forgot to say it, BUY THIS PRODUCT. You will not be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UMW9NBN9S43Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004F1NF98#wasThisHelpful","R2UMW9NBN9S43Y","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently had a bad case of stomach flu for several days. Every couple of hours I went to the restroom to pass stool and only water came gushing out each time (sorry if I grossed you out). I woke up every 90 minutes or so throughout three consecutive nights to pass water, a lot of it. I should have gone to get something like Imodium or what have you but I decided to tough it out which made it last five days versus the typical three.I drank a few liters of 7-UP over a few days to help stay hydrated which appeared to be running out the other end.

"This product is now recommended in a new nutrition book called It's Not the Cans: The Best Nutrient Balance for a Stronger and Healthier YouI take this product four days per week (Mon, Tue, Thr, Fri). My asthma has improved dramatically. My libido is through the roof.Zinc depletes copper. This is good because too much copper can trigger depression. However, too little copper can cause problems as well. This product contains an excellent ratio of zinc to copper when you consider many people are copper heavy due to environmental factors as well as diet.I take this product on an empty stomach and also with meals. I have never encountered stomach upset. If you have a delicate stomach you may need to take this with meals. If so, animal-based protein will enhance the absorption.This particular form of zinc, L-Monomethionine, has an extremely high absorption rate AND is not blocked nearly as much by grains and legumes like other forms of zinc. You do not need a higher dose because the majority of this form of zinc will be absorbed into your system.If you do not consume a lot of red meat you should consider supplemental iron as well. Zinc depletes copper. Zinc also depletes iron a little but not nearly as much as copper. So I take GNC's Gentlesorb Iron once or twice per week. You do not have to do a one-for-one, iron to zinc supplement ratio because zinc may deplete, for example, only 15% of iron versus 60% of copper. Since iron is only partially impacted by zinc, you need only to partially supplement it to counteract the losses caused by zinc.The capsules are very small.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CKCNRH0WRBTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F0R69W#wasThisHelpful","R3CKCNRH0WRBTJ","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Vitamin K2 is strongly recommended in a new nutrition book called It's Not the Cans: The Best Nutrient Balance for a Stronger and Healthier YouUPDATE -Osteoporos Int. 2013 Sep;24(9):2499-507. doi: 10.1007/s00198-013-2325-6. Epub 2013 Mar 23.Three-year low-dose menaquinone-7 supplementation helps decrease bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women.METHODS: Healthy postmenopausal women (n=244) received for 3 years placebo or MK-7 (180 g MK-7/day) capsules.RESULTS: MK-7 intake significantly improved vitamin K status and decreased the age-related decline in BMC and BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, but not at the total hip. Bone strength was also favorably affected by MK-7. MK-7 significantly decreased the loss in vertebral height of the lower thoracic region at the mid-site of the vertebrae.CONCLUSIONS: MK-7 supplements may help postmenopausal women to prevent bone loss. Whether these results can be extrapolated to other populations, e.g., children and men, needs further investigation.END UPDATE -UPDATE -MK-7 is a better supplier for MK-4 in vivo than MK-4 itself.Nutrition Journal 2012, 11:93  doi:10.1186/1475-2891-11-93Published: 12 November 2012AbstractBackgroundVitamin K2 contributes to bone and cardiovascular health. Therefore, two vitamin K2 homologues, menaquinone-4 (MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7), have been used as nutrients by the food industry and as nutritional supplements to support bone and cardiovascular health. However, little is known about the bioavailability of nutritional MK-4. To investigate MK-4 and MK-7 bioavailability, nutritional doses were administered to healthy Japanese women.FindingsSingle dose administration of MK-4 (420 mcg) or MK-7 (420 mcg) was given in the morning together with standardized breakfast. MK-7 was well absorbed and reached maximal serum level at 6 h after intake and was detected up to 48 h after intake. MK-4 was not detectable in the serum of all subjects at any time point. Consecutive administration of MK-4 (60 mcg) or MK-7 (60 mcg) for 7 days demonstrated that MK-4 supplementation did not increase serum MK-4 levels. However, consecutive administration of MK-7 increased serum MK-7 levels significantly in all subjects.ConclusionsWe conclude that MK-4 present in food does not contribute to the vitamin K status as measured by serum vitamin K levels. MK-7, however significantly increases serum MK-7 levels and therefore may be of particular importance for extrahepatic tissues.END UPDATE -It is hard to go against the grain when you realize how often people state your review was not helpful simply because it is not what the rest of the people are saying.Anyway, here are the facts. Supplemental MK-4 is synthetic whereas MK-7 is natural. MK-4 (synthetic) dissipates within 8 hours whereas MK-7 remains active in your serum for up to 72 hours (3 days). Yet this product contains 1000 mcg of MK-4 which gives consumers the impression that they are getting 1000 mcg of a vital nutrient for the cost. According to the science (not the bloggers), natural MK-7 is the one you need. So go buy a stand-alone MK-7 supplement. Do not let the thought of missing out on 1000 mcg of synthetic MK-4 sway you. MK-7 is the one you need.Also, the RDA for ALL vitamin K is 90 mcg (women) and 120 mcg (men). Even if this dose is low, three times this amount would not come anywhere near 1000 mcg.I warn against mega-dosing on any supplement. Your body is a system and needs a balance of many nutrients to perform at its peak. We are now learning that those who went excessive on calcium developed cardiovascular disease at a much higher rate (nearly 40%).I strongly encourage you to NOT simply take my word for this. Please Google ""vitamin E mortality rate"". You will find more than 30% increase in premature death rates among those who mega-dose on vitamin E. Not just in the USA but across the industrialized world. This is not just from studies in the USA.So please do not follow the crowd and take excessive amounts of any supplement to include vitamin K. Remember, you get these nutrients in your food as well. I only say this because I want us all to be as healthy as we can reasonably be.The thing I love about science is it is ever evolving. What we view as safe to do today is often found to be hazardous 20 years later but the damage has already been done.Keep in mind the days when everything was ""fortified with iron"". 40 years later they figured out iron was a bad thing in excess.So, let us assume the RDA for K is too low for many people. Whatever the good number may be it definitely is not ten times the RDA. Please consider we are dealing with MICROGRAMS in this case not MILLIGRAMS. When you only require mcg (micrograms) this means it does not take much at all to do the job. I can't stress how tired I am of bloggers and so-called ""Top Contributors"" suggesting that over-dosing on vitamins and minerals is a good practice to follow.Supplement abuse s becoming all to common today. Certain supplements have increased mortality rates (premature death) by more than 30%. Those of us who try to shed light on this are sometimes given not-helpful votes for simply stating facts versus high-fiving over-doses of nutrients.So, due to the excessive doses and the synthetic MK-4 that serves no additional benefit than MK-7 I give this product three stars. I prefer facts over blogs and I never follow the crowd, just the facts. If my warnings have added a single year to someone's life it was worth it.To date, studies indicate that K2 is safe at higher doses. There is a huge difference between ""what is safe"" and ""what your body needs"". Try to use the two-times rule. If you have been convinced that the RDA is too low try not to supplement more than two times that amount. Definitely do not exceed three times the amount in supplementation because you ARE also getting nutrients from your food. With few exceptions (if any) the RDA is rarely ten times below what your body needs for optimum health. Even if it were, a healthy diet will supply a lot of nutrients AND they will absorb at a slower and more even rate. Supplements add to what you are already getting via food. Unlike mega-dosers suggest, you do NOT have to receive 100% of any nutrient from supplements alone. People who consume fewer calories or do not eat meat may need to obtain more of certain nutrients via supplements. Yet, due to their diet, they still do not require pills to obtain 100% of the nutrients their bodies need.If new information is presented, I have no issue with standing corrected. Just be careful people. More is not always better. Balance is the key to optimum health.Life Extension is a very quality brand but even they can get it wrong from time to time. They are human too.!!!! FINAL CONSIDERATION - As long as you maintain a healthy, rounded diet you only need to supplement the difference. Bloggers who endorse mega-dosing speak as though our bodies require 100% of every vitamin and mineral from pills and powders. I could not disagree with this mindset more.Most people who regularly take supplements do so because they are health conscience. Thus, they are more likely to pay closer attention to their diet than others are. Due to their diet, health conscience people should not need to rely solely on supplementation to meet 100% of their nutritional needs. Vitamin excess actually serves to undermine the long-term goals of health conscience people.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VTRZJG7NQVGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GW4S0G#wasThisHelpful","R3VTRZJG7NQVGM","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is now recommended in a new nutrition book called It's Not the Cans: The Best Nutrient Balance for a Stronger and Healthier YouSupplemental MK-4 is synthetic and remains active in your blood serum for up to 8 hours.Supplemental MK-7 is natural and remains active in your blood serum for up to 72 hours (3 days).Calcium utilization is a four step process. Following steps 1, 2 and 3 (below) without step 4 (vitamin K2) will kill you over time.STEP 1: Consume calcium rich foods and drinks (try to keep supplemental calcium to 500 mg/day or less. The less the better)STEP 2: Obtain adequate amounts of Vitamin D (vitamin D enables you to absorb the calcium into your blood stream)STEP 3: Obtain adequate amounts of Magnesium (magnesium activates the vitamin D inside your system)STEP 4: Vitamin K2 activates the traffic cop Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) that removes calcium from your blood stream. It also activates the protein, Osteocalcin that binds calcium to your bone tissue.(These are the broad strokes as the process is a bit more complex and involves several other cofactors)Without STEP 4 (above) calcium you consume (especially supplements) deposits into the internal lining of your arteries over time which often results in cardiovascular disease and premature death.K2 is best taken with a meal that has healthy fat, such as (cage-free) eggs or salmon (yes eggs are not the killers we first thought), or a meal with good levels of protein such as chicken, steak, tuna, turkey, etc.As stated earlier, vitamin K2, in the forms of MK-4 and MK-7, prevents arterial calcification and can even reduce existing calcification by activating a protein called Matrix Gla Protein (MGP). MGP protects your internal, arterial lining from calcium deposits. Vitamin K2 also activates another protein, Osteocalcin. Osteocalcin is a protein that binds calcium to your bone tissue.You may wish to consider taking this product twice a day for the first week or so. Please consider that since it remains in your blood for three days. You don't need to mega-dose on this product. Just one softgel will add 100 mcg to the amount that is still in your system from yesterday and the day before. So after a week or two you will simply need to maintain the levels, not rebuild them from scratch.Taking two (or even three) a day won't hurt you but it is not needed after a week or two. I know it is hard for some people to resist taking extreme doses of vitamins. They fail to consider that too much of something is just as bad for you as too little. Overkill is not a good strategy. Balance is the key.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PR05AKZJRWKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009A6KFDC#wasThisHelpful","R2PR05AKZJRWKX","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is now recommended in a new nutrition book called It's Not the Cans: The Best Nutrient Balance for a Stronger and Healthier YouI bought this product three years ago and tried it for several months then stopped using it as I was not impressed.I bought it again a few weeks ago and tried a different approach. It seems to work with my new approach. So I blame myself and not this product the first time I tried and gave up.I shower every day and wash my hair when I shower (every day). I have been doing this for two decades. As an African American male it seemed impossible to style my hair without first washing it. I think I found the right combination.MY FIRST MISTAKE THREE YEARS AGO:I was applying this product moreso to my hair instead of my scalp via putting drops inthe palms of my hands and speading it over my hair. Although it seemed to make my hair softer, it was not addressing my itchy scalp issue. Also, I was using a fair amount of this product ratehr quickly which became costly.HOW I CORRECTED MY FIRST MISTAKE (this time around)I now apply a couple of drops to my finger tips and massage it directly into my scalp. I do this an hour before bed as my scalp really istches at night. I assume it is because that is when the heater is going and drying out the air the most.30 minutes or more after I apply this product to my scalp, I sometimes apply Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioner to my hair as well.IN THE  MORNINGI shower. But now I only wash my hair every other day versus every day.DAYS I DO NOT WASH MY HAIR1) I apply a few drops of Emu Oil to my finger tips and massage it into my scalp. I keep adding drops to my finger tips until I cover my enitire scalp.2) 15 minutes or so later I spray a product such as ""It's A 10"" moisterizer into the palm of my hands, and spread it over my hair and comb my hair.3)15 minutes or so later I spread ""Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioner (contains Jojoba Oil, Aloe, and vitamin E)"" over my hair and comb it through.DAYS I WASH MY HAIRI do all of the above after it driesRESULTS: I am able to style and manage my hair without washing it every day. My hair looks great. My scalp is less irritated at night. I hope by not scratching my scalp and not washing it every day, my hair will thicken in the area that I was scratching it. It will take a month or two to see how my hair responds.I also use Nizarol Shampoo three times a week. I just started using it four weeks ago. I take a balance of supplements (not to much not too little). I love salmon, vegies, and I make protein drinks almost daily. I by the higher quality products for best results even if it may cost a bit more.Anyway, scalp issues can be caused by 50 different things. I always try the simplest approach first to see if it works. The methods outlined above are my smiplest approach.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY3ZAHRTNOUFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001MWV40U#wasThisHelpful","RY3ZAHRTNOUFZ","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NYPD Blue was one of the most authentic television dramas ever produced. Unlike the shallow, crap today that seems to require super models as police officers and comedy every 6.3 minutes, NYPD was true to life. A show called ""The Shield"" managed to draw a large following with average looking actors as well. My only gripe with The Shield is the over-the-top criminal activity the team got away with day in and day out with no casualties until the last one or two seasons. NYPD Blue had casualties throughout the 12 or 13 seasons that it aired and the stars were not runway models. They looked like regular people doing a regular job. This is the same appeal that draws people to the Sci-Fi drama ""The Walking Dead"". They are everyday looking people who don't feel the need to crack jokes every 6.3 minutes.Other than NYPD Blue which seems true-to-life and the Sci-Fi drama ""The Walking dead"" many other shows are saturated with over-the-top pretentious crap. I am turned off by shows involving serious, life-and-deatrh issues that feel the need for comedy relief every few minutes even while engaged with very serious issues. Most shows are like ""Abbot and Costello Meet The Serial Killer"". The slap-stick stupidity ruins the serious moments. Because I know comedy is going to occur throughout the program I do not allow myself to get to deeply engaged with the plot which makes me care even less about the outcome. This new generation of writers suck beyond belief. I assume they use focus groups to determine how many jokes should be cracked per a single crime show episode. The only thing missing are the old laugh-tracks from older comedy shows such as Three's Company or Gilligan's Island. NCIS should add the Three's Company laugh track to their stupid, corny, no-need-to-be there, comedy routines.WHEN I WANT COMEDY TAKE A WILD GUESS AT THE TYPE OF SHOW I TUNE TO GET IT.

"I have always enjoyed Law and Order SVU as well as the other Law and Order shows. SVU is my favorite though.UPDATE:Ever since Stabler left, this show has gone downhill fast. It is devolving into a night-time soap opera versus true drama. Benson plays a weak lead and her acting has tanked dramatically. She wears the same expression on her face throughout the episodes as though she has OD'd on botox. The writing has grown stale and there has been no one to replace the combination of attitude, conflict (internal + external), presence, warrior, and family man that Stabler portrayed throughout every season. I no longer watch every episode. Too many of them are about why we need to become a sterilized, PC society void of any opinion that may hurt someone's feelings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF51HIDGGLDHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JR4QKY#wasThisHelpful","RF51HIDGGLDHG","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this on a whim. I have not been too impressed with these ""re-corkers"" as I called them. I have used three or four in the past several years and they all perform about the same. It may give me one day of storage before the wine tastes too acidic (or what have you) for me to tolerate.When I first inserted this stopper into the bottle it seemed too rigid to form a good seal. That was okay because my expectations were pretty low to begin with. As I pumped the little valve I did not hear any air flowing nor feel much resistance. This gave me the impression that this product was not doing anything other than sitting in the hole. I decided to keep pumping anyway in hopes of finally feeling some back pressure. Please keep in mind I am 6'2 at 205 Lbs. so it may take a bit of pull for me to feel the back pressure. At last I gave up after rigorously pumping this little guy for a few minutes. The bottle was half filled with wine during this initial try.I decided to see how easily the vacuum cork would pull out of the bottle. My expectation was that it would virtually fall out into my hands. I am pleased to admit that I was wrong. It took more force to remove this cork than I anticipated. Also, the loud ""pop"" that followed spoke volumes as to just how much vacuum had developed inside the bottle! I was shocked! So I poured another glass of wine and reinserted this product into the bottle and pumped it for a couple of minutes. The bottle was down to 25% full at this time. Just to see if it was a one-off occurrence I decided to pop the cork. Yet again it took more effort than I originally anticipated. Yet again there was a loud ""pop"" caused by the air rushing into the bottle.I cannot explain why I do not feel much, if any, back pressure as I pump out the air. The strokes are pretty short too, maybe an inch and a quarter or so. I have not allowed a bottle to sit for more than 24 hours after using this product so I cannot review longevity of the wine. I can say that the vacuum this little gadget produces is on par if not moreso with the previous, larger sealers I have used in the past. The previous ones were your typical insert rubber cork. Affix pump to top of cork. Press down to form a seal between the pump and the cork and then pump away.Pros:Excellent sealStrong vacuumSelf-contained unitVery sleek looking aka stylishCons (well, not really for me):Pump has short range of motion (relative of course). This requires numerous short pumps.The height of this unit added to the height of the bottle forcing me to adjust a shelf in the fridge to fit the bottle under it (no big deal for me)Cost ($19.95). However, in this case, you do get what you pay for.I will be buying another one of these unless I find something better in the next few days. I will also give this as a gift to a few wine drinkers that I know.If the price concerns you a bit, you can get a cheaper product elsewhere. To really preserve wine one would have to replace the air in the bottle with an inert gas to prevent oxidation. I don't know the costs associated with that. I assume that you insert the gas and then cork the bottle.I have no problem recommending this product to other wine novices such as myself. I am not a wine expert by any means so I have much to learn. Please note I have only owned this product for a couple of weeks. I cannot speak to how this product may perform after a year or two of use.I hope this review is helpful to someone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R271A0NR002JQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EFXG0C#wasThisHelpful","R271A0NR002JQ8","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE -I lowered my rating due to the strong chemical smell that I ignored for lo these many years. I am leaving my original post below as a matter of full discloser. As I educated myself on BPA the strong chemical smell that emits from the lid took on new meaning. I am 48 years old and was just accustomed to plastic smelling like ""plastic"". Now I am a little more cautious (not paranoid). Although my Capresso still looks and works great I decided to replace it with the Hamilton Beach 40898 Cool-Touch electric kettle. I simply prefer electric vs the stove-top kettle. The Hamilton Beach Cool-Touch also has a plastic lid but I do not smell that strong chemical odor. also, the Hamilton Beach Cool-Touch kettle is louder than this unit when the water is at a full boil. It doesn't shake the walls or anything but you can tell the stainless steel transfers sound more readily than glass. If not for the strong chemical smell and the exposed seal around the heating element I would never stop using this unit. I have used this unit regularly for seven years. So for me to look for another model speaks volumes. I tend to stick to something I like for decades.END UPDATE -ORIGINAL FIVE STAR POST -I purchased this product for myself in 2006 (or 2007) and still love it! I use it every morning for tea then again for oat bran cereal. Almost eight years every day and still going strong. I bought another one a few years later as a gift. Mine is looking a little worn but still works like a charm after nearly 8 years!!! The water boils in minutes and the auto-shutoff works every time.Please note that on three or four occasions I turned it on with no water in it (by accident). It stayed on overnight like that twice. Yet the heater element never burned out!!!!! It still works as it did when it was brand new.I may buy a new one for the future just in case they stop making these.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJ7Q01Z1PJ1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BY4ZHO#wasThisHelpful","R1PJ7Q01Z1PJ1I","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A bit larger than I realized (that is totally on me). Fortunately I was able to place it sideways and it looks great. If my bathroom were small this would not have worked at all.Great looking hamper. Very sturdy. Doesn't bulge out. I let gravity decide when the hamper is full vs forcing more clothes into it. If someone shoves clothes into it it may bulge out. I don't know. I just know mine is as strait filled with clothes as the day I bought it.

"- UPDATE JAN 13 2014The first purchase of 100mg lasted for over four months. The second and third purchases (30mg) did not work at all. The color was a shade lighter too. I then looked elsewhere for Longjack manufacturers and stumbled upon Zinc to boost testosterone. I purchased ""Zinc Balance"" (15mg) which also contains Copper (1mg). Within a few days I was back in full swing. I also added cage free scrambled eggs to my diet as it turns out our bodies need zinc and cholesterol to produce testosterone (go figure).- END UPDATENot as effective as my first purchase of 100mg. Also color not as dark. Not sure why this didnt perform like my first order. My first order received five stars from me and deserved it. The benefits of my first order were immediate and sustainable. I felt zero benefit from this second order. My first order of 100mg performed miraculously to the last. I used it for about four months at 1 gram per day and cycling off for two to three days at a time. This order does nothing for me. I will try one more order to see if this is just a bad batch.UPDATE - third order was just as ineffective as this one so I will no longer purchase this product from this vendor until further notice. I wish I had more of the first batch.

"This product is now recommended in a new nutrition book called It's Not the Cans: The Best Nutrient Balance for a Stronger and Healthier YouGreat multi-vitamin that is far superior to the products you find in grocery stores and drug stores such as Centrum and One-a-Day. Grocery store multi's are of extremely poor quality because they use the cheapest form of nutrients that can be manufactured. People buy them because of the commercials and the convenience of already being in the store to buy other items.Opti-Men absorb extremely well. They are fairly soft and easy to swallow. Our bodies flush out excess ""stuff"" over a four to six hour period or so. This is why it is best to reload your nutrients periodically throughout the day.I never take the full daily dose of multi's (except when sick which is extremely rare). I typically stick to a half dose or 2/3 dose (max). I break one pill in half and take half in the morning and a half or whole one late afternoon. I eat fairly healthy as well.This product will keep you healthy. I strongly advise against taking a full daily dose unless you have a cold, or the flu, or on some getting over a harsh medical treatment such as chemo. I also advise you to spread out the dosage to at least twice per day. Do not take it too late in the evening as it may slightly interfere with your sleep. Take it with a meal so that it can dissolve inside a mass of ""chime"" (goo) inside your intestines. Sort of like dropping a blue pill in water and watching the water turn blue. This will maximize the absorption as the nutrients mix in with the goo that was your meal. The goo will shuttle the nutrients through your intestinal tract for maximum absorption over a longer period of time.High protein meals trigger your intestines to slow down the ""pushing"" process to allow more time to absorb the protein (our bodies are awesome machines). So if you take this vitamin with a high protein meal it too will spend more time inside your small intestines allowing a bit more to be absorbed. I sometimes take my multi with a protein shake. Chicken, fish, beef, and so forth are rich in protein which enhances nutrient absorption.==> Don't forget, your food contains nutrients as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UKP8SZWC2LID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VJDYZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1UKP8SZWC2LID","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I give this book a poor rating for two basic reasons:1) Nothing new here. Just a compilation of readily assessable FREE information2) The ""Drugs to Avoid"" and ""Foods to Avoid"" sections are just a laundry list that goes on for pages. There should be a section containing a short list of the worst things that should be avoided vs listing anything and everything that could possibly cause an issue if you ate it five times a day every day of your life. Based on the never ending list in this book you may as well choose to feed intravenously and not bother going to a grocery or drug store for the rest of your life because everything contains something to be avoided.Don't waste your money. Just go to a good G6PD website for the same information. I am amazed at this author's ability to milk this book for all its not worth via scaring people to death. I wish that I could give negative stars to some products to include this one.There is no new information here. I could have gotten the same from the internet. The theme of the book is ""be afraid"" of everything. If you eat this or that you will die a tragic death (I am exaggerating somewhat). Today's society is virtually paranoid due to too much information IMHO. If my attitude results in an earlier than expected demise then so be it. I am 48 years old, 6'2, and weigh 205 Lbs. I eat healthy but I am not extreme. I feel great and my mind works extremely fast. If you try to live according to every rule in this book you'd die either of fright or starvation. If something is ""low"" impact/risk then I prefer it not to be included in concert with the medium and high impact items on the ""avoid at all cost"" list.

"It isn't often you see a movie oozing with massive potential that fails to deliver in such a drastic manner. I give the movie credit for the special effects and the perfectly buffed actor that plays the starring role (I am a heterosexual male so giving this guy credit for being so fit says a lot). The movie explodes into action soon after the credits are finished rolling. Russell Crowe and the opening cast grabbed and held my attention. After that the movie slows to a dead stop for far too long.- SPOILER ALERT BEYOND THIS POINT -I assume this was supposed to be the ""character development"" phase of the movie which was an epic fail in my view. They spent too much time on ensuring we saw the turmoil within Superman's soul due to unanswered questions. They did it via completely disjointed ""flash backs"" and ""flash forwards"". At any given moment you were either seeing his flashbacked turmoil as a child or as a flashback young adult. I just wanted to say ""I get it already! He has daddy issues!"". Yet the flash-back and flash-forward continued throughout the lion's share of the film. I did not see the need to spend an hour watching Superman search his soul via flash-backs and flash-forwards that seem too disconnected to waste energy keeping up with.He also was extremely moody and seemed ""super"" depressed. I wasn't sure if during one of the flash-back/forward segments if he was going to punch a hole through his adopted father as a child or run off into the woods crying as a young adult because the world was so mean. One bizarre seen is when he was a grown man working in some dive. A customer picked on a lady that also worked at the dive. Clark Kent approaches the guy and says something like ""I'm going to have to ask you to leave"". The guy stands there with attitude so I'm thinking he is going to throw a punch and hurt his hand or something. As I sat there an waited with bated breath thinking ""finally"", Clark Kent stands there for a few seconds, turns around, pouts, and runs out of the dive. Yet another good build up to absolutely nothing!!! It takes a loooooong time before he finally decides to stop pouting/brooding and takes action. You may as well go get some popcorn and stand in the lobby and text for an hour before anything noteworthy happens (after Krypton explodes). Walk out to the car and play some tunes for a while and then come back. You won't feel like you missed a thing because he will still be awash in disjointed segments of rage and self pity.The last fight scene went on far too long and it appears that Superman didn't give a crap about injury to civilians as he punches the villain through several skyscrapers filled with people. I'm also not sure why Zod was so hell bent on building a new Krypton on Earth??? He could have taken his planet scrubbing machine anywhere in the galaxy to do it. There was no incentive to kill all life on Earth when the terraforming machine could have done the same thing on an uninhabited planet. They even took the machine from a former colonized planet. Why not just rebuild Krypton there? Also, why did such an advanced race blow up their own planet via using too much energy? In the original version the sun explodes or some natural calamity kills Krypton. In this version the political leaders tapped into the core for energy knowing the planet would be destroyed in the end. They had colonized other worlds previous to that so why did they a) kill their own planet and b) stay there to die with it when they clearly had options??? I could see if their sun was exploding which would narrow the options quite a bit.Why was a Kryptonian ship buried in the ice on Earth for tens of thousands of years suggesting (at least to me) that humans are the descendants of Kryptonians? Did I miss something? I didn't see them explain why that ship was there waiting for Clark Kent to activate it 50 thousand years later or what have you. The writers only cared about fight scenes and Clark Kent's disjointed, never ending, deep seated flash-back/forward depression. I will say this was the best special effects effort for a superman movie that has ever been made. That does not undue the rest of the issues with this poorly written movie.The title should be changed from ""Man of Steel"" to ""Man Who Broods"". It is a shame because with the powers he has and his popular strength of character this Superman movie could have been so much more. I won't be buying this BlueRay like I often do with these types of movies.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GO90X3AD9Y89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GH4RKYM#wasThisHelpful","R1GO90X3AD9Y89","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been taking Creatine for two weks now (first time in my life and I'm 48). I did the loading phase but only at 15mg per day vs 20mg that others do. So it took an extra day and a half to complete the loading phase. OMG!!! NOW I GET IT!!! I have increased the wieght that I curl, bench, and squats by 20% in such a short time! I initally started with Beta-Alanine and C4 extreme for four weeks. During the fifth week as I was tapering down my Beta-Alanine loading I began loading with this product.I am 48 and I am finally lifting with the staying power of my late 20s again! My muscle fatigue threshold is as high as it was 20 years ago. When I complete my last rep I am not dying of exhaustion anymore. I have added 30 pounds to teh weight that I workout with when I bench and when I perform squats. I have added 10 pounds to the weight that I workout when I curl. I have no idea what my max weights are but if I have added 30 pounds to my 5 sets of 8 reps then I assume my max bench and squat weight has increased far more than 30 pounds! I love the feeling of not being absolutely exausted after a set.I am also extremely happy to state there is ZERO TASTE! The taste is so faint that the texture is the only way my mouth can tell something other than water is in it. I only taste the dextrose. I take it on an empty stomach mixed in plain water and dextrose. No stomach issues whatsoever which I believe is due to the purity of this product as well as the purity of the dextrose I bought.I purchased a 32 once bag of Dextrose from ""Now Real Food"" on Amazon.For the amount of ""sugar"" (dextrose) to use, according to the math:How much sugar do you use? Take your lean mass, divide it by two, then divide that by number of servings per day. and that's how many grams of sugar you need per serving. For instance, 200 lb person at 20% body fat would have 80% ""lean mass"". 80% X 200 lbs = 160 lbs ""lean mass"". Divide by 2 is 80. Divided by 4 servings is 20 grams of Dextrose per serving. One teaspoon of Now Dextrose is 4 grams. So you would add 5, even teaspoons according to these numbers. Please note it takes 3 teaspoons of Dextrose to be as sweet as 1 teaspoon of regular sugar. So taste wise you are adding a little over 1 1/2 teaspoons of regular sugar.That being said I'm not a sugar-holic, quite the opposite. So despite the math I'll probably do 3 or 4 teaspoons vs 5.From Creatine Tips website: Loading PhaseCreatine Tip # 1 - Never let your creatine sit in liquid for more than a fewminutes MAXIMUM. Drink it as soon as you stir it and don't let it settle to thebottom of the glass or around the sides. Think VOLUME.Creatine Tip # 2. - Drink your servings 30 minutes before and again 2 hoursafter your meals and immediately following a workout. Schedule your dayaccordingly, beginning after your first meal unless you exercise uponawakening. You do not want your stomach acids from food digestion todestroy your creatine and limit absorption.I have five days left on my four week, beta alanine loading. As I ramp down this week on the beta-alanine I will be loading my first five days with creatine. I will also cycle completely off C4 in a week or two for two weeks (four weeks on two weeks off). This is the plan until I read up on good C4 cycling methods. I am hoping the Creatine will pick up the stamina I will lose when I cycle off of C4. C4 Extreme has taken my work out a step further. I've added 20 pounds to my bench reps and my squat reps after two weeks on C4 (last week). I will try to add another ten pounds three weeks from this coming Saturday (today is Thursday Sept 12).This is a very pure product that is extremely easy on your stomach. Take this with dextrose in plain, cold water on an empty stomach. As I learn more I will edit this review.PLEASE SEARCH WHY DEXTROSE (GLUCOSE) IS BETTER FOR YOU THAN FRUCTOSE","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29BPLM6F9C9PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0066SKPFK#wasThisHelpful","R29BPLM6F9C9PW","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is now recommended in a new nutrition book called It's Not the Cans: The Best Nutrient Balance for a Stronger and Healthier YouUPDATE -Vitamin K2 in the form of MK7 prevents calcium from hardening your arteries. It also helps bind calcium to your skeletal tissue (bones). A couple of recommendations are:Solgar Natural Vitamin K2 (MK-7) Vegetable Capsules, 100 Mcg, 50 CountNow Foods Vitamin K-2 (MK7) Veg Capsules, 100 mcg, 60 CountPlease try to ignore those who would have you mega-dose on Vitamin K2 (or any other nutrient) as they are the same people who suggested mega-dosing on Calcium and Vitamin D which has served to dramatically increase rates of cardiovascular disease especially among women. Now the same people are suggesting mega-dosing on K2 in hopes of undoing the damage their initial ""advice"" has caused. Balance and consistancy will serve you far better than flooding your system with any nutrient. Please do not allow the bloggers and the one-off study scare you or your loved one into taking excessive doses of vitamins or minerals.END UPDATE -This is an excellent product! This product is Calcium Citrate. Here is what I know so far.Calcium Carbonate requires stomach acid to be absorbed so must be taking with a meal. Citracal contains Calcium Citrate which is more readily absorbed so it can be taken with or without food (very convenient)Calcium Carbonate is approx 40% elemental calcium whereas Calcium Citrate is approx 20% elemental calcium. So when only the ""total"" mg dose is displayed on the product you are actually only receiving 40% (carbonate) or 20% (citrate) real calcium per dose. Citrical displays the actual ""elemental"" (real) calcium dosage so you know exactly how much calcium you are receiving per dose vs trying to do the math (very convenient).Citrical includes Vitamin D3 (most recommended form of D is D3). Vitamin D is the mechanism that your cells need to absorb calcium (very beneficial).These are relatively small, square tablets with rounded edges (very convenient).PLEASE NOTE: You do NOT have to take four per day!!! We are all unique and have different requirements. 4 pills per day supply a concentrated dose of 80% of the RDA for calcium. Even that is a very generic statement.IMPORTANT: Evidence suggest that high levels of calcium hardens arteries over time. They think it is due to some of the excess being absorbed into the normal plaque we all have inside our arteries making it stiff over time (calcification). So the walls of the arteries become more narrow and less flexible which may result in a blockage that would have passed through if not for the hardened internal plaque.So please try to limit your supplemental calcium to no more than two pills per day taken several hours apart (half daily dosage). And then seek additional calcium via other means such as milk, brocholli, or what have you. If you take four of these per day (full dose) try to take them one at a time throughout the day so that you do not generate as much ""excess"" in your blood stream each time. I know this may be too much to remembe. However, this may help prevent the hardning artery plaque issue (not certain).GOOD NEWS: An increase in magnesium increase calcium absorption. So consider taking 200 to 400mg of magnesium each day (don't waste money on magnesium oxide as it does not absorb well). Also consider taking an additional 1000iu of vitamin D3. Basically, the more you actually absorb the less you need to take. Make sense? By the way, D is a ""fat soluble"" vitamin so it stores for several days in our liver. If you miss a few days your liver will release its stores to cover you like a camel's hump in the desert. There is zero need to megadose on any ""fat soluble"" vitamin. Doing so can become toxic. I would not exceed a total of 4000iu per day and I try to remain below 3000iu. Please note that Citracal has some D included. Simply add up all of your D3 sources then include additional D3 to total around 2000iu which is above the RDA yet far below the upper toxic limit. Studies show 10,000iu of D per day becomes toxic in some people after 3 months of that high daily dose.Also, please consider this:1) Your unique body may require MORE than the RDA2) Your unique body may require LESS than the RDA3) The foods you eat on a regular basis are supplying SOME calcium (or ALL the calcium you need)4) Too much concentrated calcium can lead to other problems (quote from Dr. Ox Calcium Fact Sheet)""A recently published study revealed that taking excess calcium can be bad for your heart. In one large study, researchers followed a cohort of over 60,000 women for nearly two decades. They found that those who got a lot of calcium in their diet and/or with a supplement had an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease or heart disease. The increased risk was more pronounced in those who got excess calcium and took a supplement.""5) Always try to spread supplements over the day (if taking 3 total, try to take them several hours apart).If you already have a calcium rich diet there is no need to take 4 of these pills per day (80% RDA). You may only wish to take 1 or 2 per day (20% or 40% RDA). If you are a petite person your unique body may require less calcium than someone twice your size. If you exercise intensely four days per week and eat a somewhat healthy diet you may only need 2 pills per day (40%). I've added a second glass of Horizon Organic 1% milk to my daily diet. Tastes great. Not only does it have calcium but each glass also has 400mg potassium, 15% protein, and a lot of other nutrients. This allowed me to lower my Citrical dose. I'm not suggesting you drink the milk I like. I'm just giving an example of an option I chose.CONCLUSION - This is an excellent product for the cost! There are a very few higher end products but those cost twice as much and are more for people with serious, medical calcium issues vs average people.SEARCH ""too much calcium"" or ""calcium side effects"" to help determine how much is too much.NEVER be a robot (not saying you would) and simply take the manufacturer's recommended daily dose. Be a little more comprehensive and take your unique size, activity level, diet, and medical history into account when determining the proper daily dosage for you.ALWAYS view this and every other supplement as just that, a SUPPLEMENT. This means try NOT to obtain 100% of your daily requirement via pills alone. Adjust your diet accordingly to get some (if not all) of the nutrients you need and then ""SUPPLEMENT"" the rest. The minimum goal is to get at least 50% of what you need through the foods you eat. In a perfect world you would try to get 100% from food yet minimal toxins and calories. You should not need to obtain 100% of anything via pills (exceptions of course for medical conditions). This is another reason why I suggest you consider only taking one or two of these per day (20% to 40% of RDA) and then seeking calcium rich foods to add to your diet (only if possible).That being said we all are unique so these are merely very loose guidelines to get us all to think a little more deeply about the foods we eat and the number of pills we take.Before I forget to mention it, THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R331MJZRRNTBFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043ZLTT4#wasThisHelpful","R331MJZRRNTBFO","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After my purchase of this product I comtinued to research the benefits and side effects of coconut oil. During this time I also Googled ""convert mg to tablespoon coconut oil"".1 tablespoon of coconut oil contains approx 14 grams of total fat which is 13 grams of saturated fat. Each pill in this product contains 1 gram of total fat which is 880 mg of saturated fat. To achieve the recommended 1 to 3 tablespoons of coconut per day you would need to take 14 to 42 of these pills each day. You would also be consuming 14 or 42 of the stuff that makes the capsule that the oil is contained in as well.So there is very little if any benefit in taking this product due to the small quantity of actual coconut oil in each capsule. If you think this small amount of oil is helping then imagine what 1 to 3 tablespoons will do for you.Find ways to ingest the actual oil. I do it in five different ways, so far, depending on what I am eating:1) Eat a direct spoonfull (I tolerate it)2) Add a spoonfull to my morning, hot oat brand cereal along with cinnamon and honey (I love it)3) Add a table spoon of coconut oil to my morning tea. It looks like an oil slick in my tea but tastes good (I like it)4) Spread a spoonfull on my waffle then add cinnamon and then drizzle some honey on top of that (I love it)5) On a slice of bread. I microwave the bread for 8 seconds then spread coconut oil on it (I like it)I will Google ""ways to eat coconut oil"" to ad more diversity to my current methods. I suggest others do the same.SIDE NOTE - Anyone over 35 should also consider adding Taurine (L-Taurine) to their daily supplements. My best guess would be people 35-44 years old take 500 - 1000 mg per day. 45 - 54 1000 - 2000 mg. 55 and up 2000 - 3000 mg per day. If you regularly and intensely work out add an additional 1000 grams just before your work out.Of course do your own research and consult with your doctor. At a minimum Google ""Taurine"" and read about this inexpensive yet absolutely amazing amino-acid supplement. Great for preventing muscle cramps and twitches. Also great for the heart and for the brain. You may wish to start with only taking 500 mg just before bedtime for a few days to a week. I take 1000 mg just before I go to bed and another 1000 mg midday directly between meals (close to an empty stomach). I had no idea it would i mprove my overall mood too but it has after a few weeks. I initally took it to help stop my foot cramps which it did the first day. People over 30 do yourself a favor and read about Taurine. Youngsters don't need to supplement much of anything.

"According to Dr. Murray Heber, ""the term tendinosis was first used in the 1940s by a group of German researchers, however the term did not receive much attention until it was used again in the mid 1980s to describe a non-inflammatory tendon condition. The more commonly used term of ""tendonitis"" has since been proven to be a misnomer for several reasons. The first of which is that there is a lack of inflammatory cells in conditions that were typically called a tendonitis. Since inflammation is the key pathological process involved with that term, and the discovery that there in fact were no, or very few, inflammatory cells present in the condition.There is also said to exist a tendinosis cycle that must be broken before successful treatment and pain-free movements can be restored. The cycle of tendinosis is simplified and described as repetitive overuse activities or microtraumas causing microtears in the tendon creating a fibroblastic hyperplasia response, which then respond by increasing the amount of type III collagen within a tendon. This further weakens the tendon causing more microtears and prolonging the degenerative cycle. Treatment for this condition must first attempt to stop the degenerative cycle and then to restore proper collagen synthesis, strength and function"".This has a much greater impact then just the name one calls a condition, it also has a profound impact on how the condition should be treated.According to Tendinosis Org, ""understanding collagen healing states ""Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS) would not be expected to help tendinosis since it is an injury of chronic degeneration, not inflammation. Studies show that some NSAIDs actually impede the healing process, which is the last thing needed with tendinosis.[17] Long-term use of NSAIDs for tendinosis is probably not a good idea.Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) stimulates Type I collagen synthesis when used in cultures of healthy fibroblast cells. However, when ascorbic acid was added to cells from carpal tunnel syndrome patients, it did not stimulate the normal amount of Type I collagen, and the small amount of Type I collagen that was produced had an abnormally high alpha2(I) to alpha1(I) ratio.[1] Adding vitamin C to the injured cells simply made them produce more abnormal collagen, not normal collagen"".Sports Injury Bulletin states ""NSAIDS also have a track record of side effects; up to 25% of individuals taking NSAIDS develop peptic ulcers, and a rather astounding 5% incur renal troubles. There is also disturbing evidence that NSAIDS may interfere with the metabolism of articular cartilage and the repair of bone"".Basically time, therapy, and good nutrition are the only true way to heal strained tendons. Collagen is a strange beast that grows according to a seperate set of rules than muscle and bone. In trying to help you may actually be preventing the injory to heal.TREATMENT <<<<=======================Int J Ther Massage Bodywork. 2012; 5(1): 14-17.Published online Mar 31, 2012. PMCID: PMC3312643Tendinopathy: Why the Difference Between Tendinitis and Tendinosis MattersEvelyn Bass,Tendinitis  -The most prominent treatment goal for tendinitis is to reduce inflammation, a condition that isn't present in tendinosis. In fact, some treatments to reduce inflammation are contraindicated with tendinosis. Ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, is associated with inhibited collagen repair(9). Corticosteroid injections inhibited collagen repair in one study, and were found to be a predictor of later tendon tearsTendinosis -1.Rest. People with low-grade tendon injuries often find it difficult to rest as much as is necessary, especially as symptoms subside(3). With repetitive work tasks, the patient is recommended to take a break for one minute every 15 minutes and a five-minute break every 20-30 minutes(12). This reduction isn't much considering its role in preventing long-term pain and disability. Some people will need to rest even more than this at the start of treatment. The patient should be advised to stay aware of their body as it heals. If the activity they are engaging in is causing pain, then they are probably doing too much.2.Adjust ergonomics and biomechanics. Small changes can make a big difference. With regard to ergonomics, for example, cashiers are encouraged to press the register keys as lightly as possible, and computer users should be sure their wrists are resting in a neutral position while typing. Larger companies and government organizations often have an ergonomic specialist available to consult with employees about their workstations. Physical therapists are experts at recognizing and adjusting improper biomechanics that might be causing injury.3.Use appropriate support. Physical therapists can also recommend appropriate support to reduce tensile stress on the tendon, such as bracing or taping(3).4.Stretch and keep moving, though conservatively. Lightly stretching and moving the affected area through its natural range of motion while minimizing pain will prevent shortening of the related muscles (preserving active range of motion and flexibility). It can also increase circulation, thereby assisting the healing process. Stretching can also elongate the muscle-tendon unit, reducing the tension placed on the tendon during activity, thereby reducing the chemical changes that cause degeneration(8,13,14).5.Apply ice. Ice causes vasoconstriction and is thought to address the abnormal neovascularization of the tendon tissue(3). Clinical experience indicates that icing is helpful for tendinopathies even though the reason why it works is not yet fully understood(3). Use ice for 15-20 minutes several times a day (allowing for at least 45 minutes in between icing session), and after engaging in activities that utilize the tendon(7,15).6.Eccentric strengthening. An eccentric strengthening regimen done 1-2 times daily for 12 weeks has been clinically proven to be a very successful treatment for tendinosis, especially when the exercises are performed slowly(2,3,5,16). Eccentric strengthening is ""lengthening a muscle while it is loaded and contracting(17)."" For example, lengthening one's bicep while holding a dumb-bell in one's hand would stimulate eccentric contraction. Eccentric strengthening effectively stimulates collagen production, improves collagen alignment, and stimulates collagen cross-linkage formation, in turn improving tensile strength(5). Eccentric strengthening might also help to reduce ground substance and tendon volume (swelling/thickening)(2). It has also been proposed that part of the benefit of eccentric strengthening is the stretching involved, as described above. It can be helpful to consult with a physical therapist to maximize the benefit of strengthening exercises and to minimize the possibility of re-injury.7.Massage. Massage stimulates circulation and cell activity, especially when done at the appropriate depth. Deep-friction massage applied to the tendon serves to stimulate fibroblast activity and generate new collagen. Stasinopoulos and Johnson(18) report that applying deep-friction to the tendon for at least ten minutes after the numbing effect has been achieved results in reduced pain and increased strength and mobility. Lowe(11) states that he has found it effective to apply friction to the tendon in multiple short bursts of 20-30 seconds interspersed with other techniques; this strategy allows for mobilization of the tissue while minimizing discomfort for the patient. Myofascial techniques and trigger-point therapy can reduce fascial restrictions, scar tissue, and trigger points in the muscle connected to the tendon, relieving tension on the tendon. Myofascial techniques, lengthening deep-tissue techniques, stretching and active-release techniques can reset muscle memory to a more lengthened position, reducing the tension placed on the tendon during activity. A variety of massage techniques can decrease overactive pain messages from sympathetic nervous system firing, increase circulation, and improve overall tissue health(10,11,19).8.Nutrition. Vitamin C, manganese, and zinc are all important for the synthesis of collagen production(20). Vitamin B6 and Vitamin E have also been linked to tendon health(21). Patients might benefit from talking with their primary health care provider or a nutrition specialist to be sure their intake of these nutrients is sufficient.BOTTOM LINE <====Tendinosis is OFTEN self-diagnosed as Tendonitis simply because that is a more familiar term. More often than not it is actually Tendinosis. It may be difficult to do but stopping the repetitive activity, good nutrition, and motion therapy of the injured area, and patience are the things that are needed to cure Tendinosis.This product may actually impede the healing process vs help. So I gave it one star. NOT because I think this is a low quality product. Mainly because it may actually be causing a lot of people more long term harm than short term good. Just as with a broken bone tendons need time to heal and no magic ointment is going to make that happen. The ointment is actually slowing and/or preventing the real healing process which then makes people use the ointment for the rest of their life to mask the pain from the injury that was never allowed to heal.PLEASE NOTE: I am seeing a trend of when I give high ratings people appreciate my review. When I give low ratings where others (who don't do research) gave high ratings, people claim my review was not helpful. Why are negative ""facts"" not helpful just because most others gave positive ""opinion""?I have no bias for or against any product. I simply try to state facts (in negative reviews) to help people make informed decisions.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMFLAOX0TG1T9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026HDURA#wasThisHelpful","RMFLAOX0TG1T9","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am almost finished with my second 120 pill bottle of this product. I pulled a tendon at the gym (basically golfer's elbow) and purchased two bottles of this product which I read may help. My tendon is much better but I can't say it is directly because of this product or not. I trhink the LongJack had more of an impact on healing than this product. Who knows? They may have worked together.Anyway, I was in a local chain Vitamin Shoppe the other day and saw the exact same product and pill count. The price in the store and on their website as of today is $22 vs $14 here on Amazon which is an $8 savings!!! So regardless of the effect on my injury you can't go wrong getting this product here vs locally.One thing that I have always failed to do but I will start to do from now on is check the expiration date on products I order via Amazon. If the products are not expired I have no idea why products are so much more affordable here vs locally but I am glad that they are.I hope this product works for you.

"I ordered this brand by accident because I do use this brand for my Glucosamine/Chondroitin/MSM supplement. The Magnesium brand I prefer and recommend, Bluebonnet Nutrition Buffered Albion Chelated Magnesium 200 Mg, cost more but it also has NEVER bothered my stomach (because it is buffered). I purchase it through Amazon as well (B002TU58QAI also recommend Swanson's Buffered Albion Chelated Magnesium 166 Mg (and very affordable from the Swanson website)I am NOT suggesting to avoid this product as it does not appear to upset every users stomach. Also the manufacturer has a lot of credibility as far as I can tell. I am suggesting that for me the other product is second to none but I pay more for it (I think). So I think this product does have value and will deliver magnesium to your system. My preference appears to offer stomach issues to far fewer, if any, users. But then you pay more for it (I think).From 3rd party FAQ response:""Buffering does often include adding a mineral to regulate the pH of the final product. In most cases, magnesium is buffered with chlorine (MgCl2). Magnesium is an alkali, so in this case, buffering would add an 'acidic' to bring it to the same pH as where it is intended to be used (in this case, the 7.3-7.4 range of the human bloodstream). Magnesium, in and of itself, in pure water (Magnesium hydroxide or Mg(OH2)has an alkaline pH of 10.3 or thereabouts. ""Buffered"" magnesium (usually Magnesium Chloride (MGCl2)) buffers the magnesium with an acidic buffer (hydrochloride) to make MgCl2, with a pH of 7.0, which is considered ""neutral"" -- therefore, it should be less harsh on the system than simple magnesium hydroxide (aka Milk of Magnesia).==> Theoretically (and this comes from my friend, who is a biochemist), the buffered version will do less damage to the organs as the pieces are broken apart in the digestive system, and, because it is close to normal body pH, molecules will be more readily accepted in the bloodstream. She also noted that they use a buffered magnesium in human cell culture in her lab, because it reduces the cellular destruction common in the tissue culture process -- using a culture medium with buffered minerals improves cellular viability substantially.""So I will be sending this bottle back and ordering the right stuff. I TAKE MY PRODUCT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH WITH ZERO PROBLEMS!!!IF THIS PRODUCT BOTHERS YOUR STOMACH I WAGER IT IS BECAUSE IT THIS HAS NOT BEEN BUFFERED TO BALANCE THE pH TO HUMAN BODY LEVELS.If Bluebonnet is too pricey for you (Trust me. I grew up very poor so I absolutely understand that. Also something is better than nothing)Swanson is the the same quality but costs much less on their website. Also, you may look to see if you can eat something along with this product to help ""buffer"" it.

"The bench is very sturdy yet light weight enough to move to and from the closet. I am 6'2 at 202lbs and I feel very secure using this bench. I needed something that I could toss in a closet when not in use due to limited space. Yet I needed something that could support my weight and more. This bench does not rock nor tip when I am on it. Thus I have the confidence to focus on lifting weights vs trying to keep my balance. The padding is very comfortable as well.You can't do everything with this bench but it works extremely well for what you can do with it. for the size and weight range of this bench I view it as a great bang for my buck.If I had more space I would have kept my very nice, very large Gold's Gym bench that I had in one of the spare bedrooms by itself. This bench is perfect for condos and apartments, basically places where you don't have space to just leave a bench in the middle of the floor. So if you have tons of space I would go with a larger, universal bench. If you want something very solid yet light enough to pack away when you complete your workout this is the best one I have seen in its class. I used this for three months to get into condition before going back to the gym. I also use this for maintenance workouts when I want a break from the gym. At the gym I lift moderate to heavy. With this bench I lift light to moderate. So even a gym rat like me can make periodic use of this bench. People just seeking to be in okay shape but not seeking to be a major body builder can use this bench even more than I do.Great purchase for what it is designed to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UVKJE9E9SWDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002QJZAE4#wasThisHelpful","R3UVKJE9E9SWDV","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use Just For Men, Real Black hair color treatment. I noticed that the color would begin to fade in a week. This product protects the color for weeks when used properly. It actually coats your hair with a protective substance. I even noticed that after applying it, if I don't quickly wash my hands, the palms of my hands become sticky within 30 seconds. I sometimes clasp my hands together just to note how quickly the product is drying and coating the palms of my hands. When i wash my hands I can see the additional suds build up from removing this product.I said all of that to say when the product dries each hair has a transparent shield around it that works exceptionally well at protecting the individual hairs. I am impressed. This coating apparently seals in stuff AND shields out toxins, pollution, and sun damage. Thus my hair retains its color three times longer than before which is what I have been looking for. Although my hair isn't damaged, I theorize that the coating not only protects each hair but it may also act as a transparent splint that prevents ends from splitting and weak hairs from breaking off (except at the root). As a guy the worse thing I do that may damage my hair is use Just For Men hair color every few weeks. I don't use hair dryers or perms and such. Most ladies (and some men) have a lot more to deal with than me. This product may be of some benefit to you as well.CONS:Fly-aways galore. Once this product dries each hair appears to be in its own universe. Not quite frizzy but more like some hairs refuse to bow before me (lol). So after about fifteen to twenty minutes to allow this product to dry I apply my absolute favorite conditioner in the known universe, Shea Moisture Leave-in Conditioner!!!! This is the best product life has to offer for my hair and scalp. I LOVE Shea Moisture Leave-in Conditioner. I put it in twice a day. It does a great job at grabbing the fly-aways and making them obey my commands. It also moisterizes my scalp. Oh what a product! Anyway, by using these together my color treatment lasts much longer and my hair and scalp love me in return.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ADNJLCDMRTAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ULJN9S#wasThisHelpful","R3ADNJLCDMRTAI","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this product for several reasons vs other products. One of those reasons was the capsules are designed to resist stomach acid and deliver the product to your intestines.The other reasons is why I gave only 1 star. I read the box very carefully. I was looking for the temperature range to store the product. I found nothing on the box. When my order arrived I glanced at the bottle and guess what I found on the bottom of the front label.==> Store at OR BELOW 73 degrees f. Best to refrigerate!!! The bottle goes on to say that you may not get 50 Billion if the product has been stored at temperatures above 73 degrees f!I am certain that prior to being placed in my fridge this bottle has been kept in a hot warehouse and on hot delivery trucks that far exceeded 73 degrees f.Had this been on the box I would have never ordered this product. I find it suspiciously convenient for the manufacturer to exclude this info from the box. I am certain that was not excluded by accident. SHAME ON THEM!!!!So although these capsules may have started off with a great product inside, you are probably getting a few ""survivors"" inside your intestinal tract. The billions of dead bacteria cells is probably what is sending users of this product to the rest room as claimed in other reviews. Bacteria are living organisms that are designed to live in specific environments. Long term exposure to a hot environment (warehouses, delivery trucks) will kill them off with the possibility of survivors.Until they provide all of the information on the box, AVOID THIS PRODUCT! THE DEAD BACTERIA CELLS THAT YOUR BODY WANTS GONE IS LIKELY CAUSING OTHER REVIEWERS TO BECOME MORE ""REGULAR"" AS THEY HAVE NOTED IN THEIR REVIEWS!ALSO, THERE MAY BE A FEW SURVIVORS (out of THE 50 Billion) WHICH MAY BE BENEFICIAL. HOWEVER, WHY PAY FOR 50 BILLION IF YOU ONLY RECEIVE SURVIVORS UPON DELIVERY?according to studies..""Probiotics have greater stability at room temperature than generallyrealized and can be maintained for several weeks with minimal lossof 5% or less. However, loss in potency would be accelerated overtime. That is why it is best to maintain probiotic supplements underrefrigeration, as this offers the optimal conditions favoring long-termpotency and viability.""My question to anyone is do you think storage and shipping occurs at or below ""room temperature""? I don't. Ever been inside the back of a UPS truck in the summer??? How about a non-refrigerated 18 wheeler?RECOMMENDATION: If you want to get what you pay for try Master Supplements or Klair Labs both are available via Amazon. Just ensure that any third party seller is storing and shipping these high quality products in the same manner as the manufacturers. For example, Klair Labs ships there product in a foil packaging that includes an ice-pack. You pay more but you also get a far superior product. Master's product does not use the ""enteric coating"" method as most others do to protect them from stomach acid. That is because that methos introduces other problems. So they bind their product in a gel (inside the capsule). The gel keeps the 15 Billion guys and ladies together through the stomach. It also kicks into protect mode when introduced to stomach acid. The enteric coating method is not as good for you or the probiotic as this method. Kirkman is another brand that ensures live cultures make it to your door.CONCLUSION: Your body already has some bacteria that you need hence the term ""supplement"". You should only seek to ""supplement"" your body's natural process vs ""replace"" it. Therefore I do not see a need to take probiotics every day for months and years on end. I would suggest every day for the first three days (three full doses over three days). Then every other day for ten days (five full doses over ten days). Then once a week for four weeks (four full doses over four weeks). Then either once a month from that point on OR stop altogether. Why? Bacteria multiplies on its own so there is no need to keep adding more. Also, you want your body to do the work it was designed to do vs popping pills for the rest of your life.  Feel free to repeat this (or similar) process periodically. I may try this twice a year. Others may need to do this once per quarter. Others may try once a year. Others once every two or three years. All of us are different. Whatever the case do NOT take probiotics every day for weeks and months on end unless a doctor says to do so. Your body still works or you would not be alive to buy these products. Thus, give your body a ""shot in the arm"" or a ""helping hand"" from time to time and then let it do the rest. Also eat healthier and drink less (some of us). Your wallet will thank you too.SOLUTION: Buy refrigerated probitics locally OR make sure they are shipped with a cold pack. Other than that you are not getting what you are paying for. You are ingesting dead cultures that are sending you to the restroom to expell them. You should NOT need to take the product everyday if the cultures are alive and thriving because they reproduce on their own. If you need to take them every day to get results you are taking dead cultures that do not reproduce.UPDATE FROM 3rd PARTY INFO ==>Q:  Do all brands of probiotics need to be refrigerated?A:  The answer to this should be a loud ""YES,"" however, some manufacturers advertise that their brand is stable without refrigeration.  A study done by Bastyr University in 2003 revealed that brands of probiotics which were purchased from retailers off of refrigeration contained little or no activity.  XXX has performed independent laboratory testing which supports the Bastyr findings.  Consumer Labs has also tested probiotics and has reported many products of questionable quality in the marketplace. No probiotic can withstand the extreme temperatures that are often encountered in shipping, warehousing and hot climates.  Manufacturers must be very diligent in all aspects of production to ensure quality.  Heat and humidity control of raw material transit, storage, manufacturing and packaging conditions, and warehousing conditions are monitored by XXX to ensure product quality and potency through the best by date when stored by customers at refrigerated temperatures.Q:  Once I start probiotics, do I have to take them forever for them to be effective?A:  No.  Once gastrointestinal flora are restored to a healthy state, many individuals can reduce the dosage to every other day, twice per week or a similar reduced dosage schedule.  Sometimes probiotics are only given during a specific gastrointestinal condition such as a bacterial infection, which when cleared up will allow the probiotic to be stopped.  When it comes to probiotics, every individual is different.  You must find your own dosage and schedule which keeps your gastrointestinal tract and immune system healthy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTOJS3GV3I21G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CMKC5Y#wasThisHelpful","RTOJS3GV3I21G","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a healthy person that would like to take your workout to another level this is the product for you.One week prior to taking C4 I started taking Beta-Alanine tablets three times per day. C4 contains Beta-Alanine so when I work out the C4 replaces one daily dose of Beta-Alanine.  Beta-Alanine builds up in your muscle tissue over a four to six week period.  It gives you the endurance for sustained workouts with greatly reduced muscle fatigue which allows you to go harder or longer or both.  If you take C4 or Beta-Alanine you also need to take Taurine because Beta-Alanine reduces Taurine intake and vice versa.  Its as though they are both competing for the same space.C4 lives up to its name in every way.  I took one scoop 30 minutes before my workout.  It dissolves instantly in water and tastes good.  I think 20 minutes is all you really need after taking C4.I alternate body-parts that I work on each day.  On my arm, chest, and ab day I start off with curls.  With C4 I was banging out curls like there was no tomorrow.  My fast twitch muscle fibers were ready, willing, and able to pump out sets more rapidly than I have been able to do since my mid-20s.  I am 48 now.  Due to C4 I was focused like a laser on the task at hand and oblivious to my surroundings during each set.  I had to force myself to wait my standard minute and thirty seconds between sets.  I did not feel shaky or jittery. I felt energized!!!! I felt like I recaptured my energy levels that I once had 20 years ago. I was very alert and felt like all of me was there and delighted to be there (in the gym).  In recent years I have not been 100% in the mood to work out which made it more of a chore and impacts my motivation to do it.  Also, part of me was still burned out from working all day. Now that I have been taking supplements such as Long Jack, Taurine, Beta- Alanine, and Magnesium (at night) I feel energetic again (ten years younger). C4 has taken that energetic feeling to new levels (15 to 20 years younger).I am 6'2"" at 203lbs.  Ever since I turned 40 I have felt my energy and ability to recuperate slowly slipping away.  I eat a much healthier diet now vs in my 20s which helps but still, no cigar. So I started supplementing those things that age decreases a little more each year.  Now I feel like I can take on the world again.C4 is a must-have along with a few other supplements.  I also take a powdered post-workout protein.  At 48 I forgot what it felt like to be 28.  Now I remember and it feels awesome!  My body feels like the machine it once was.  The Taurine and Magnesium are helping me to sleep much deeper as well as ward off foot cramps that I started to get this year and last year.BTW, once you stop taking Beta-Alanine it remains in your tissue for several weeks if not months. I read the depletion rate is approx 2% per day when you have ZERO intake.  So after 4 weeks or so you can cut back drastically on taking Beta-Alanine yet maintain the levels you have stored inside your tissues indefinitely.  After 4 to 6 weeks your tissues basically do not have room to store anymore so the goal after that is to take a little to replenish the 2% daily drop.Please note that C4 contains 1500 mg of Beta-Alanine per scoop. The pills I take are 400 mg per pill and I take two at a time 3 times per day (C4 replaces one of the doses on the days that I work out. C4 actually provides nearly a double-dose of 1500 mg vs my usual 800 mg).  Anyway, after four to five weeks there is no value to taking that much Beta-Alanine anymore.  Once the C4 runs out replace it with one dose of Beta- Alanine(400 to 1600 mg). Make sure you also take Taurine when taking Beta-Alanine. I currently take 1000 mg doses of Taurine three times a day on an empty stomach.  I take the last does of Taurine just before bedtime along with 200 mg of Magnesium.  Now I sleep like a baby again.After four weeks, when I cut down to one small dose of Beta-Alanine, I will also cut my Taurine from 3000 mg down to 1500 - 2000 mg per day. 1000 mg when I go to bed and 500 to 1500 mg some time during the day (the 1500 mg is for the days I work out). Keep in mind that your body makes its own Taurine as well so you can also eat foods that contain ingredients used to make Taurine. Some people take mega doses of suppliments which I do not encourage. Too much of anything especially in one does is a bad thing and can cause long term organ or nerve damage.  Our livers have limits on how much stress it can take on a daily basis. Our bodies work best with a somewhat balanced ratio of nutrients vs a ton of one thing over the other.  So save some money and save potential liver and/or nerve damage by moderating your doses and cycling the intake of supplements.  When feasible spread out your intake throughout the day vs one mega-dose per day.Remember, Walter Payton was the greatest running back in the NFL yet all of the muscles in the world did not prevent the liver disease that killed him far too soon in his life.  Be kind to your liver to live a long and healthy life.  Be patient vs in a rush.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MFR7ES2RO5DU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RG76NC#wasThisHelpful","R1MFR7ES2RO5DU","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I live in a nice size, one bedroom condo with very high slanted ceilings (top floor unit). Although I had hoped for a quieter unit, this one is quite enough (especially in the lowest fan setting). I really like the Economy Mode as well as the Remote Sensing.I also like the Sleep mode. When I go to work I either choose Economy mode only or I choose Economy and Sleep mode. Sleep mode automatically increases the temperature setting by 4 degrees one hour after you select it. Seven hours later it drops back to your original setting (8 hours total). So by the time I arrive home my place is nice and cool without having to run a lot while I am at work. The Economy setting alone is also very useful. It runs a few seconds to check the temperature and then turns the fan off for ten minutes if the room temperature is still cool. It does this check every ten minutes vs running continuously. If the room temperature has risen too much the unit stays on until the temperature drops again and then shuts off. Other units I have had will keep the fan blowing and only cycle the condenser on and off. This unit allows you to do that too if you prefer. I prefer the fan to shut off when not needed.I recommend you also purchase the support strut for this unit (not included). It mounts outside your window and the unit rests on top of it.My only complaints are:1) The remote control has to be within 20 ft (actually a little less) with clear line of site for the Remote Sensing to work. If not, the unit will automatically revert to normal sensing. It took me a while to figure that out because I never read the manual. I was hoping to be able to place the remote in a seperate room and use Remote Sensing to control the temperature in that room.2) Normal sensing is flawed because the unit is installed in a west facing window (my dining room). When the sun is shining directly on the unit it runs as though it is trying to cool itself off vs the room. So I have to increase the temperature setting in order for the unit to cycle off when the room is cool. However, the Remote Sensing is the fix to that for me. I simply sit the remote control about fifteen feet from the unit which forces the unit to cycle on and off ONLY according to the temperature reading on the remote control which is not sitting outside in the sun like the unit itself is.Overall this is a very good unit. It cools my place fairly quickly on the hottest days and maintains the temperature. I live in the top condo unit of a four story building. Heat rises so I had to get an AC unit. This unit maintains my temperature with the lowest fan speed setting which is why I won't complain too much about the noise. Every now and then I put it on high to get cooler quicker but once there the low setting is all I need to cycle on and off to maintain the temperature.Works as intended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ANCDPH4W5Z4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007N6Y3KW#wasThisHelpful","R1ANCDPH4W5Z4S","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is not against this particular brand as Solgar is consistently higher in quality. This review is a warning about taking 400 IU every day. Fat soluble vitamins are stored for several days (mostly in the liver) unlike water soluble vitamins. Large doses overload our storage space and gets stored in places that lead to stress or internal damage of organs and the nervous system. If you buy this high dose please consider not taking it two days per week (ex Tue and Saturday). Please read the following scientific data (not my personal opinion).Johns Hopkins Medicine:==> ""Our study results do not support the use of high-dose vitamin E supplements.  If people are taking a multivitamin, they should make sure it contains no more than a low dose of vitamin E,"" said study lead author and internist Edgar R. Miller III, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of medicine at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  ""A lot of people take vitamins because they believe it will benefit their health in the long term and prolong life.  But our study shows that use of high-dose vitamin E supplements certainly did not prolong life, but was associated with a higher risk of death.""""Vitamin E capsules, used as supplements, typically contain 400 IU to 800 IU.  The study results indicated that these high-dose supplements were associated with a higher risk of death.""  <===Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol)0-6 months*(6 IU) 4 mg7-12 months*(7.5 IU) 5 mg1-3 years(9 IU) 6 mg4-8 years old(10.4 IU) 7 mg9-13 years old(16.4 IU) 11 mg14+ years old(22.4 IU) 15 mg(My opinion and some science) Solgar is a good brand. I caustion people against taking high doses of Vitamins E, A, D, and K because they are all FAT SOLUBLE vitamins (please research ""Fat-Soluble Vitamins"").Quick Facts...- Small amounts of vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and vitamin K are needed to maintain good health.- The body does not need these vitamins every day because it stores them in the liver and adipose (fat) tissue when not used.- Megadoses of vitamins A, D, E or K can be toxic and lead to health problems.- Fat soluble vitamins are stored (mostly) in the liver for use later when needed (like a camel).Many studies show issues such as organ damage, nerve damage, and increased mortality rates among people who regularly supplement 400 IUs or more of Vitamin E.This is a good brand because you do want ""mixed E"" but just not in high daily doses. Pleasae do a quick search on the term ""full spectrum vitamin E"". This Solgar product contains 4 out of the 8 derivatives of vitamin E (which is great). I think for the cost that is a great buy. Full spectrum E costs much more yet the benefits of having all 8 derivatives vs 4, if any, are still being researched. If you buy this dosasge try to skip it two days per week. Can be consecutive days or seperate days. This gives your liver time to release a little of its stores.I take 100 iu of E with my lunch five, six, or seven days per week. There are also 30 iu in my multivitamin which I do take every day (I only take a half dose of my multi each day). The average adult requires 30 (or 33) IUs per day (minimum). If you have a semi-healthy diet you are already getting some vitamin e in your food. Mega dosage of some vitamins and especially minerals can kill you slowly over time. Nerve damage and/or organ damage and/or heart failure can occur as well. But the autopsy will list cause of death as natural unless they have a reason to suspect fould play and look more closely at the cause of death.So don't feel the need to overdose on Vitamin E. You may cause more harm than good when you do. Don't follow the crowd. Follow the science. 100 -200 IU is more than enough for anyone. even though 100 - 200 IUs per day is still pretty high it did not show to cause premature death. 400 IUs or more did (according to science not according to my opinion). One 100 to 200 IU per day  of ""mixed E""(or just four times per week) is honestly all you really need to reap the benefits unless you have been diagnosed with a medical condition that requires more. On the days you skip a dose the E stored in your fatty tissue will be realeased to cover your body's needs. This can be done over several days. So missing a day or two will make zero difference to your body regarding fat soluble vitamins.Some of the foods you eat also contain naturally occuring vitamin E. So please consider all of your sources and add them up to get a feel of how much E you are actually consuming daily and/or weekly. Too much E is not the same as too much C. Your body can tolerate and expell too much C. The damage being caused is such a slow process people don't realize it is happening.I am not trying to make anyone paranoid. You need Vitamin E. Short term gains from mega dosing (if any) are not worth the long term damage to your liver and nerves. However we are free to make our own decisions. I hope this review helps others to make an informed decision.Save some money. Save some time. Possibly extend your life by NOT taking more than 200 IUs per day. Don't just take my word. Search the web for ""vitamin E dosage"" or ""Vitamin E side effects"". Vitamin C is one of the suppliments that appears to cause no harm at high doses. All vitamins are not like vitamin C.SIDE NOTE: I encourage you to research ""Side effects"" of ANY substance you intend to purchase before you buy it (ex: vitamin e side effects).RECOMMEND PURCHASE OF VITAMIN E 100 IU or 200 IU OR BUY THIS PRODUCT AND SKIP A DOSE TWO OR THREE DAYS PER WEEK. I just purchased the Solgar 100 IU dose of ""mixed E"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CNA6U0PWHB8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00012NJJG#wasThisHelpful","R1CNA6U0PWHB8C","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is simply amazing! I have been in an intensely stressful situation for the past two weeks. I was so stressed that I didn't sleep for two days. I promise you that normally my stress results in a cold sore within one or two days into a stressful environment. Then ill use three or so vacation days just to hide from the world because my lip swells a great deal and looks and feels disgusting.When I felt the stress coming I started taking this product three times a day. This product saved me!!! I felt the itch deep inside my lip but no sore appeared. The greatest tribute is when I did not sleep for two days and yet no sore appeared!I wish I would have found this product years ago. For me too speak so highly of any product it must perform. If not I have no problem giving lower ratings.I do NOT take this product daily. I MAY consider taking one a day. I WILL ALWAYS take this product when I feel stressed enough that a cold sore may appear. This is the first time I used this product. I am still amazed at how it prevented a mega cold sore from appearing which allowed me to still go to work and do other things in public to pass the time until the stressful situation dissipates. One last word of advice...!!! BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!UPDATEI have not had a single cold sore since I found this product! If I notice intense stress I take one. When I feel my lip begin to tingle I take one two or  three times for a day or two. I am absolutely amazed by this product and wish I had known about it years ago. I used lots of sick leave just to hide for a week due to the intensity of my cold sore. I gave this product to a friend who had just developed a cold sore. You could barely see it after two days. It was totally gone in three days. BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!I have lost over ten thousand dollars in sick leave due to cold sores!

At times the obvious can be easily overlooked such as warning people to allow them to make an informed decision. This is, in my professional view, a matter of Public Safety.A warning will prompt consumers to ensure the product is safe for them to use BEFORE they use it vs playing Russian Roulette.

After the gym I sit in my car and mix the shake with water and drink it before I drive off.Muscle burns fat even while you sleep. Protein provides building blocks for muscle tissue. Complex carbs fuel the muscle building process. Fiber disposes of undigested waste, keeps you full, and helps regulate your sugar by lowering sugar spikes. The multi-vitamin provides the nutrients.END UPDATE ====I am a 6'2"" male. BEFORE this product I was able to go from 227 to 208 over several months. For the life of me I could not get below 208. Then I went to 210 and have been stuck there for the past two or three months. My goal is 200 (+ or - 2 Lbs).I began using this product four days ago and it is actually helping me to lose weight! I saw results the morning of Day 2!!! I have been weighing myself almost every morning before breakfast for over ten years. For the past two or three months every morning I have weighed 209.4 - 210.8 lbs. Four days ago I weighed myself Monday morning (210 lbs) then took my first pill.My actual weight changes after taking this product:Day 1 (June 3rd Monday morning) - 210 LbsDay 2 (Tuesday morning) - 208.6 Lbs (extremely thirsty so drinking more water)Day 3 (Wednesday morning) - 207.8 Lbs (very thirsty so drinking more water)Day 4 (Thursday morning) - 206.9 Lbs (thirsty so drinking more water)Day 5 (Friday morning)(today) - 206 Lbs (thirsty so drinking more water)Thus far I have lost four pounds in five days without overhauling my lifestyle!!! This is unbelievable! I feel fine except for minor side effects the first three days that I have notated below. I give this product five stars and HIGHLY RECOMMEND!Based on the current trend (that I actually intend to slow down a bit) I suspect I can reach my goal of 200 Lbs in another week. However, extremely rapid weight loss is actually bad for your health and can be dangerous in some instances if you already have underlying health issues.CONS -Day 1 (Monday) I felt somewhat drugged. It felt as though I had taken a muscle relaxer. So I received the opposite of ""additional energy""Day 2 (Tuesday) I had a slight headache which I attribute to this product. Didn't feel as drugged as Monday.Day 3 (Wednesday) no headache but feel just a little bit off of my game. Feel very relaxed (that slightly drugged feeling). My reflexes seem slightly diminished.Day 4 (Thursday) Felt 100% normal. except now I've been using the bathroom (#2) more than usual. Very slight case of diarrhea but nothing crippling.Day 5 (today) I feel completely normal. No sign of the previous minor side effects.PROS -Losing weight without overhauling my current, healthy lifestyle. I still workout the same amount of time and still eat my healthy meals.Appetite is somewhat suppressed. I notice I don't crave snacks as often between meals. I now eat one snack bar where I would normally crave for two.I do not feel jittery at all as one sometimes will when taking diet pills. My heart rate is the same as any other day. I don't feel anxious or irritable.The effects appear to last around 10 - 12 hours day. I eat breakfast and take the pill around 8:00 AM.I am very in tune with my body and can often detect the slightest of changes. I can feel this product still working into the mid/late evening. By the time it feels like it has totally worn off. I don't go to bed until 11 PM or so. By that time I am ready to eat my bedtime snack which is typically a small bowl of Fiber One cereal.I do not notice any ""peaks"" or ""valleys"" throughout the day. There is no ""crash"" that I can detect with this product. The ""slightly ""sluggish"" feeling remained constant with no deviation in intensity throughout the first 3 days until the evening when the product effectively dissipates from my system.My workouts go as they normally do. I may have detected a little extra ""drive"" in my workout because of this product (not sure). I have been able to finish my last sets with less effort (or so it feels). It is too close to judge though.CONCLUSION -I am amazed at how quickly this product impacted my weight. I saw measurable results the very next day following my first use. Although I do not like the slightly sluggish feeling I felt the first few days as well as the minor headache on day 2, the benefit of finally moving toward my weight goals far ""outweigh"" the minor side effects I noted. I think my body had to go through a mild, adjustment period.I am a huge skeptic of diet products but this one is actually delivering for me. I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT but not for extended use.CONSIDER CYCLING USE OF THIS PRODUCT - (5 days ON 2 days OFF or 4 days ON 3 days OFF)1) Extremely rapid weight loss is not healthy and can be dangerous. It takes years to gain weight so don't rush to lose it.2) Your body adapts to new things by altering internal functions. Cycling off the product allows your body to function normally and rebalance itself.3) Gives your kidneys and liver a break along with other processes impacted by this product.4) Will prevent your body from adapting to accommodate this product. So when you quit using it for good it won't be as much of a shock to your system.5) Professional bodybuilders cycle their supplements for similar reasons.NOTE: Cycling may not be necessary to do but it is a common practice with other suppliments that have a major impact on the human body.UPDATE (7/22/13) - I have been ""cycling"" this product in order to allow my system to return to its version of normal for a day or two. I used this product every day for four to five days. Then I did not use it for two or three consecutive days. My ""off"" cycle was Saturday, Sunday, and sometimes Monday. I did this until the bottle was empty. I did see a 1 pound gain for every 2 to 3 pounds that I lost. My lowest measured weight was 201.3 Lbs. That is only because I pigged out on pizza a couple of times as well as chips.I ran out of this product two or so weeks ago. I ordered a second bottle which is scheduled to arrive this week. I am currently 203 lbs and now would like to reach 198 lbs which is very doable thanks to this product without drastically adjusting my mostly healthy lifestyle.Once I achieve 198 lbs I will cycle off this product with the assumption that I will regain 2 or 3 pounds a couple of weeks after I fully stop taking this product.UPDATE (10/08/13) - Stopped using this product 2/3rds through second bottle (couple of months ago). Bottomed out at 201lbs. Additional use did not effect any change so I discontinued use. I am still amazed by this product for getting me down to 201. I regained 1 of the 10 pounds that I lost and that was it. I later started taking Creatine to increase my weight lifting. A known side effect of Creatine is weight gain due to water retention in the muscles. I went back up to 210 (but waist remained slimmer). When I cycled off Creatine my weight dropped down to 205 (not 202). The extra weight is muscle. I eat very healthy but I'm not a health extremists.TIPS -HIGHLY RECOMMEND not going through continuous bottles of this product.  If you can't resist doing so take at least two weeks off between bottles. If you lose 15 pounds and gain back 5 that is still great! I had a two bottle limit. If you take a short break your wallet, stomach, liver, and kidneys (to name a few) will thank you.EAT MORE FIBER - ex: High Fiber Oat Bran Cereal. I add cinnamon, honey, and flaxseed meal to my cereal - Baked sweet potato (I eat half of one) - dark green romaine lettuce - fiber one cereal -so forth. Look for enjoyable ways to increase your fiber intake. Honey, cinamon and high fiber foods often taste well together. Coconut oil goes well with fiber too. Personal tastes of course.PROTEIN POWDER - Buy a good quality protein powder. Drink 20 - 25mg with water first thing in the morning. Protein builds muscle. Muscle burns fat. Give your body the tools to naturally burn fat for you. If you are a little active your body needs .5mg (or so) per pound. So if you weigh 150lbs, your body needs 75mg per day. Quality powdered protein is a great way to help meet your protein needs without the unwanted calories.COMPLEX CARB POWDER - Excessive protein without carbs impacts your PH. Your muscle and bone tissue then release calcium to balance your PH. Average carb-to-proytein ratio is 2:1. 2 grams of complex carbs for every 1 gram of protein. The complex carbs I use are not the weight gainer products. They are listed near the top of this review.WALKS - short daily 15 minute good pace walk does wonders (on days you don't exercise).WATER - I don't drink soda or juice (I actually love water). Try to cut down on beer, juice, and soda as much as possible. I drink wine once every other week or so.CARBS ARE NOT EVIL - Excessive simple carbs are bad - complex carbs are good (not in excess) - people consume thousands of simple carbs and gain weight. Then extremists label carbs as evil. Excessive ANYTHING is bad for you. Excessive exercise damages joints yet no one calls exercise evil. Complex carbs digest slowly and is your body's fuel source.FADS ARE EVIL (well at least bad for you) - Each decade a different food or food type is labeled as deadly by some group of people and to be avoided at all cost. Ignore ALL extreme views and fads when it pertains to what you eat. Generally those who initiate these extreme views are either out to make a buck or feel an overwhelming desire to act like they know something without doing the proper research. I live by the monthly 80/20 rule. Up to 80% healthy food and exercise coupled with 20% of whatever I feel like enjoying. Please note I really enjoy the 80% too but the 20% is solely based on what will put the biggest smile on my face. It may happen to be something that is healthy or it may be chocolate ice cream. It just depends on my heart's desire during those moments that make up 20% of my monthly intake. The other 80% (or so) of eating I am more focused on health and pleasure vs only pleasure.ENJOY!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MGRZRSAGKGT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BTPTF1U#wasThisHelpful","R3MGRZRSAGKGT9","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE ===This is the best magnesium product on the market (glycinate + chelated + buffered)! You cannot get any better than this combination which makes this TOP QUALITY. Buy it. However its the Taurine (taken along with this product that is making the bigger difference!!!!I experimented and know the Taurine is the bigger benefit! At first I took 200 mg of Magnesium each night which helped prevent foot cramps. I still sometimes got a minor cramp at night but not as painful and not as often. I added 500 mg Tauring to my 200 mg magnesium. No more foot cramps but still had muscle twitches in my feet. I tried an experiment. I doubled the Taurine (1000 mg) with 200 mg Magnesium. No more cramps. I dropped to 100 mg Magnesium. Still no cramps. I dropped back to 500 mg Taurine and 100 mg Magnesium. Foot cramp returned (not severe). I doubled the Magnesium (200 mg) with 500 mg Taurine, foot cramps every couple of nights, not severe. I Doubled Taurine (1000 mg) and dropped down to 100 mg Magnesium (no foot cramps but did have muscle twitches). I went to 200mg Magnesium at bedtime (with 1000mg Taurine)and added an additional 500 mg Taurine in the day. Few days later NO CRAMPS and NO TWITCHES!!!!So I take 1000 mg Taurine with 200 mg Magnesium just before bed time and I take 500 or 1000 mg Taurine late morning or early afternoon. ALL MUSCLE TWITCHES IN EVERY PART OF MY BODY ARE GONE!!! On days that I work out (four days per week) I take an additional 1000 mg of Taurine with an additional 133mg of Magnesium (Swanson) as I head to the gym. I have not had a single cramp or twitch since then!!! Taurine transports electrolytes into your cells. So adding Taurine actually delivers more into the cells. Adding more magnesium and potassium makes more of it available in your blood but Taurine is the missing link needed to take it from your blood into your cells.!!!! PLEASE CONSIDER 1000 mg of TAURINE before bed and an additional 500 to 1000 mg midday !!!! My mood is even better now. I feel like my old self again (the ten years ago version). THESE ARE REAL RESULTS!!!!! Also take the Magnesium. This Magnesium product is top quality. Do NOT overdose Magnesium!!! Try not to exceed 400 mg a day. Try to stay at 400 mg or less because it can become toxic and even fatal if you take too much!!! You must consider that you are also getting some magnesium via the foods you eat. As with many supplements the bigger yo are OR the more active yo are, the more you may need but 600mg should be the max and NOT at that dosage every day. If you are lifting some intense weight, climbing mountains, or doing a ton of sweating then you might consider exceeding 400mg the day of intense activities. Just don't treat magnesium like vitamin C. Limit your daily intake.Also, our bodies prefer certain ratios of interactive compounds such as magnesium, potassium, sodium, and calcium. All four working together make our muscles work. Your heart is a muscle. Overdosing on any of these four elements can damage your heart even to the point of death. Too little of these elements can cause your heart to beat irregularly and even fail. So please be moderate in your intake of these four elements. BTW you would have to eat over 12 bananas to get the RDA of potassium which is why I take four potassium pills each day. Five on days I workout. Not at one time but over the course of a day (99mg each). Your body requires around 3500mg of potassium per day! I only share this to give an idea of the ratio of elaments our bodies require. It is not a 1to 1 ratio. More like 1 mg of magnesium for every 8 mg of potassium 1: 8 .This number is only a very loose example. Based on this ratio I just came up with one would need 3200mg of potassium for 400mg of magnesium. Please don't read this and start ingesting 3200mg of potassium supplements. I take about 400 to 500mg of potassium each day and I get more via food.!!!! Finally, consider buying Swanson Albion Chelated Magnesium along with this product. Why??? It comes in 133mg doses! So now I have greater flexibility with my total daily dosing! I can take 1 of the Bluebonnet and 1 Swanson per day to attain 333mg or I can do 266mg or 466mg or whatever daily dosage I like between both products! So buy this product AND buy the Swanson (Amazon link below). They are the exact same quality but at a different dosage per capsule.B00068S9KYEND UPDATE =====I don't know where to begin. I moved to the Seattle area (Bellevue) about two years ago. A year or so later I started having painful, frequent foot cramps where my big toe was being forced downward by the clenching muscle near the ball of my foot. A few weeks after that I started having an irregular heartbeat. I went to a doctor who said my irregular heartbeat may be due to my asthma putting pressure in my chest. I've had asthma ALL OF MY LIFE and this had never happened in my entire life (foot cramps and/or heart beating in an odd way). I asked if I may have low potassium. They drew blood and the results were normal.Still concerned for my health I read up on the symptoms of low potassium. Muscle cramps and irregular heartbeat were two of the symptoms so I self-medicated with potassium supplements (600 mg per day on top of eating bananas and such). My foot cramps subsided and my heartbeat returned to normal. Fast forward seven months later...A couple of months ago my foot cramps returned just not as frequent at first (heart still beating normally) so I added a bit more potassium, vitamin D, and calcium supplements (the calcium pills have some magnesium but not a lot). This seem to help for a couple of weeks but not totally. My cramps came back with a vengeance. Then I started reading about magnesium and the different types available.THANK GOD!!! You see I've also been having trouble sleeping for over a decade! Then the foot cramps that started last year would wake me up in the middle of my sleep with excruciating pain. After that happens I can't go back to sleep which impacts my job performance. Sometimes I have had to call-in and use a day of sick-leave because of the lack of sleep.NOW I take this magnesium supplement an hour or so before going to bed. The difference is like night and day! Not a single foot cramp AND I sleep through the entire night now! I get up to use the restroom once or twice but effortlessly fall right back to sleep now. Please consider until now, when I felt an urge to get up and pee I purposely ignored it for fear of getting up and not being able to go back to sleep which has happened too often for my taste. I can't tell you how great I feel after a full, natural night's sleep. I also don't worry about cramps anymore which is such a relief as well.I recommend you buy this product and also research L-Taurine because it aids the movement of potassium, sodium, and calcium in and out of the cell among other great attributes that I recently learned about. Turns out body-builders use Taurine as well as people with heart and/or blood pressure issues.This product is so easy on my stomach I take it with a glass of water or sometimes shortly after a meal. Just depends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36FTUAP5FLMAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TU58QA#wasThisHelpful","R36FTUAP5FLMAT","A116VGNX84YL7I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A116VGNX84YL7I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Exceptional Boutique Style Ring Sling Baby Carrier ~ by MamawayThis is one of the most amazing inventions around. This holds your baby close to you, supports them however you need.

"One of the most amazing natural things you can use to help fight signs of aging is Vitamin C. The toners I have used in the past seem to dry my face and cause flaking.

"There are so many brands available of fish oil when you look into buying some, make sure to check out the company and their process for making it. This company uses high quality ingredients and has a clean process. This way you get the most potent dosage.Some people use fish oil to lower blood pressure or triglyceride levels. Fish oil is also used for preventing heart disease or stroke. The scientific studies prove that fish oil lowers high triglycerides, helps prevent heart disease and stroke. I know we've all heard the undoubtedly good effects of Omega 3 Fish Oil for our bodies and our hearts especially.  But fish oil also lubricates joints and helps to eliminate pain. One thing I find that it works very well for is ADD in kids. Omega-3 fatty acids are the brain-boosting, cholesterol-clearing good fats. On that note, it helps a lot with depression and other psychological disorders. Looking forward to seeing longer term use results. Happy with my purchase.

"These candle sets are a great value and were an even greater value during a lightning deal. They use the widely available CR 2450 battery and these are included with the candles. Even better, they have a plastic tab in the battery area that you pull when ready to use so you know that the battery is brand-new when you use it yourself or give a set away as a gift. I use one set for myself and have had them for well over a month with no significant loss of glow. However, when these are in a dark room, perhaps acting as a small night light (as I use them), they will just appear as if they are glowing - the color doesn't really come through in a dark room. The white and the light green candles have a nice pattern in them, but the light violet colored candle does not, though it still looks nice. The five hour timer is perfect for my needs.I think these are a nice item to have on hand for a thoughtful get well gift or for something such as Secretaries Day. I always enjoy getting a good deal like I did during a lightning special, but I still think this would be one of those items that is still a good value at regular price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R140XHKKZL17U1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRJJIHM#wasThisHelpful","R140XHKKZL17U1","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prior to using this vase for real flowers I loved this vase.  The colors were rich and vibrant, and the design was beautiful.  I have NO idea why the glass of this vase turned ""milky"" after having some water and flowers in it.  It's a vase - this should not happen.  What's worse is that the person who told me about this vase had the same thing happen to her after she put water and flowers in it.  She had previously had some decorative branches in it and had no problems.  Now both of us have vases that make us look like we don't care for the things we own.I recall reading a review from another design of vase also made by Amia where this was mentioned.  I thought it must be an isolated incident.  It's not...This is a VERY expensive vase to have this happen to.  I can't understand why this would happen.  A vase is supposed to hold flowers and water after all, isn't it?

"I am a left leg amputee so I don't stand in the shower and use this on the shower curtain rod which is what this was primarily intended for. But when I read that it worked on curved bars that are 1"" in diameter I immediately measured my Moen 16"" curved grab bar with shelf and sure enough it was 1"". I ordered 2 of them and they hook on the curved grab bar with shelf like a charm. These hold my mesh bath pouf and other shower accessories that have a cord on them. As other reviewers have noted, this probably isn't the best choice for things like a washcloth. If there's a loop on your bath accessory it should work out just fine.IMPORTANT NOTE: This will only work with the Moen curved grab bar with shelf or other ""lighter"" grab bars made by Moen that are 1"" in diameter and support up to 250#. Moen makes heavy-duty grab bars that support up to 500#, but these are 1.5"" in diameter and will not work with this product.

"Overall, this product is very helpful and works well. I recently had shoulder surgery and these have been very helpful for turning on/off a wide variety of appliances in my bedroom. The biggest downside I've discovered is that the rounded shape of the product prevents me from plugging in anything except a plug for something like a lamp or small fan below it. Even the very small USB adapter to charge my iPhone won't fit below one of these plugs. That is poor design to maximize use of an outlet. In the two months of relatively light use some of the writing is coming off of the remote.

They also have a good, strong light to them. The light goes all throughout the candle too. The batteries are easily replaced and are readily available. On the downside, these seem to flicker almost nonstop and it is not a subtle flicker either. I purchased these votives to place in clear votive holders that are in a decorative base. The ""candlelight"" doesn't even seem realistic at all in this setup. It seems to be more like Christmas tree lights that blink - really. However, when I put one of these in a metal-like votive holder it seemed to be more realistic. So if your aim is to use this in a clear or lightly frosted votive holder you may be disappointed. However, in a somewhat patterned or metal-like/medium to dark colored holder these may work out just fine. This is one of those products that depending on your needs it could be just okay or it could be outstanding. In my case these are working out okay at best. I will continue to look for this type of candle, but with a much more subtle flicker. Once I find flameless votive that is a better fit I will likely give these away as gifts in an individual colored/metal-like votive holder.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10JGBLNTSGFRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7IRJ56#wasThisHelpful","R10JGBLNTSGFRW","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I love the most about this garden flag is that it doesn't have that typical garden flag look. This actually looks like a painting that you would expect to see in a frame. The colors are beautiful and rich. I purchased this is an inexpensive way to seasonally change the look in my second bathroom. Toland actually makes several garden flags that have the ""painting"" feel to them rather than a typical garden flag feel. This would make a fine and affordable gift that I think almost anyone would enjoy having in their home or garden/yard.

"I am an above knee amputee of 26 years who recently had rotator cuff surgery and currently have my arm in a very immobilizing sling. Since I have to take potent pain medication to aid in my recovery I don't necessarily want to be transferring myself too many times in and out of my wheelchair during the night if I need to use ""the facilities."" Missing my left leg and having extremely limited use of my left arm at this time creates a significant safety concern. So I borrowed a commode from a family member to keep in my bedroom and purchased these liners based on reviews here on Amazon. These were easily the most expensive liners I saw at the time, but they are the ""gold standard"" in liner bags as far as I'm concerned. Like many people, I'm somewhat hesitant to believe everything I read in the reviews, but all of the reviews I read were dead on accurate. I lined the bottom of my commode bucket with a product commonly known as ""shop towels on a roll"" to absorb any moisture that might leak through the bag. That was over three weeks ago and I have yet to need to change those ""shop towels."" I have not had one leak at all. I keep a 2 gallon bucket with a lid next to the commode and can fit about five of these in there before needing to empty it. They do not smell one bit. The most I do for odor control is a quick spritz of Lysol.I also read a review from someone who stated they use this in their RV. I own a travel trailer and could easily see where these would come in very handy, especially during long road trips when emptying the black tank may not be so easy to do.Highly recommended and worth every single penny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EHMJLBIZRH4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017SOVD6#wasThisHelpful","R2EHMJLBIZRH4Q","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an inexpensive way to display garden flags in a different way. It certainly is nothing fancy, but is functional. However, the stopper does not firmly fit on the dowel and it would only take a very, very light breeze for the stopper to come off of the dowel, thus allowing your flag to fall to the ground. My recommendation would be to either use this only in areas where there would be no breeze, such as an enclosed patio or even in your home, or to permanently put a flag on it and superglue the dowel into the stopper. Used in the ways I've recommended would make this a four or five star product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4G3MSADI0WJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFQDVDK#wasThisHelpful","R4G3MSADI0WJZ","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've worn Keens for 10 years, but new versions of the Keen Newport pinched my little toe no matter what I did so I tried this style after the Keen Whisper left me without any real arch support, not to mention how narrow they are.The recommendation on the Amazon page (and the Keen home page) for the Venice was to buy a half size larger.  I wear 8.5, so I ordered the 9 - they were like water skis.  So then I sent them back and got 8.5 - better, but the arch support didn't line up that great and for this money they need to fit perfect.  I decided I'd try one more time and got the 8 - SO glad I did.With regard to the shoe itself, I like that the footbed isn't like the Keen of old where there was a leather topper on that which retained smells no matter what you did.  These easily wash up and look great each time.  I wash them with Sport Suds, though I imagine any detergent will do.Since purchasing these in Petrol/Twilight I've purchased 3 other colors - all within a 2 month period.  They are the only footwear I've worn all summer.  Perfect for walking, cycling and other activities, yet they look cute with a cotton dress-down capri pant or jean skirt too.  I get comments all the time like, ""Where'd you get those?  They look SO comfortable.""  When they ask how much they cost I sometimes get comments like, ""You paid WHAT for those?"" But for quality footwear you have to be willing to pay more.  That's the way it goes with quality.  If these are as hearty as my first pair of Keens they will easily last me 4-5 years - small price to pay for quality and comfort if you ask me.  No sense in penny wise, pound foolish.I'm an amputee (left above knee amputee, with prosthesis) and I need to protect the only foot I have left.  I am willing to pay good money for footwear so long as they are quality, supportive items and these certainly have been.  I can easily work all day in them, then go grocery shopping, and for a walk without once saying, ""man, time to get these off!""  As an amputee I am SO picky about footwear, so any shoe getting my endorsement I feel is a winner.  Your experiences may vary, but it's certainly worth a try in my opinion.So again, just because the product write-up recommends a half size larger that it doesn't necessarily mean it will work for you - half size smaller is what I personally needed.  When Amazon is the retailer they almost always provide free returns on footwear within 30 days so if you don't know your size for this exact sandal I suggest you use Amazon as the retailer on here, at least until you know what size really works for you.  Some colors that Amazon sells are not directly through them, so be aware that you may have to pay return shipping if they don't work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13JZFHA6N64BW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000L0SB9G#wasThisHelpful","R13JZFHA6N64BW","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I went back and forth wondering whether to get this clutch/cross body purse or a ""regular"" Broncos purse.  I'm SO glad I went with this one since the new NFL stadium regulations indicate that ALL bags must be clear and no larger than 12x12x6.  Many things that used to be allowed in no longer will be, but this shouldn't be a problem since you can also have a clutch that's about the size of the palm of your hand (which this is).  It will easily hold a small point and shoot camera, cell phone and some money.  The backside, which is clear, doesn't do much for me and is supposed to be there for easy access phone use, but my iPhone 5 doesn't fit well in there - I keep it under the front blue flap with the Broncos logo instead.Can't wait to use it at a Denver game this year along with the NFL Clear Ultimate Carryall Bag.

"I wasn't necessarily seeking a watch with this level of function on it - I just wanted a fairly solid watch to wear when I'm camping or doing other outdoor activities and don't want to worry about being rough.  It wasn't too hard to set, but don't toss those directions out - you'll need them in the future, esp. if you want to use more of the functions. I haven't tried the other functions given that my intended use is for a no-nonsense, inexpensive yet solid outdoor watch that doesn't require batteries.  When I first received it and set it up I had it charging in pretty direct light for about 3 hours.  When I woke up the next morning there were no numbers/characters on it at all - I was bummed thinking that I bought junk.  I turned my bedside light on and within a few moments the watch was displaying the correct time.  About once a week I make sure it gets several hours of solid sunlight to keep it fully charged.  It's worked flawlessly since then.  I often wake with the numbers not showing and this seems to be a power saving kind of mode - again, within moments of even dim light the numbers appear.The only things I'm not thrilled about, but can easily live with, are that it's kind of big for a women's watch and the wrist band could be a bit more comfortable.  Recommended.I purchased on Amazon from a retailer other than Amazon who offered it with free shipping so I didn't have to make a $25 order for free shipping.  It arrived within 3 days.  I liked that option since there are times I just don't have anything I want/need to take advantage of super saver shipping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DPGM38CRF3PZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003URWN5U#wasThisHelpful","R2DPGM38CRF3PZ","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a dyed-in-the-wool Denver Broncos fan and had purchased a Broncos product here and this came up as a recommendation.  What a fabulous value at what I paid (a Jackson and a Lincoln).  It's got a nice wide seat that is pretty well reinforced in the seat area.  A ""solid"", but not overly ""solid"" person could safely use this chair (says 300, but I wouldn't go much above 250 to be on the safe side and to maximize chair life - and definitely do not ""plop"" into it).  It has nice little extras such as the cup holder, side pocket for small items and the insulated cooler sleeve on the left arm.  It won't hold a 6 pack, but it would easily hold 2-3 beverages with a small blue ice freezer block in it to keep it really cold.  Overpacking it would cause too much stress on the zipper and it's not meant to hold enough for a 3 hour game - stock back up at halftime.  Don't count on that cooler sleeve to be as good as a ""real"" cooler for an entire day of cold storage, but for a few hours with that ice block your beverages or small food items it's a great item.  It fits back into the storage bag easily and the bag even lets others know what team you pull for.This is a chair that you'll want to make sure someone keeps an eye on if you have to step away for a little bit - count on it to be gone if you leave it unwatched since it's that nice of a product.  Perfect guest seating for a ""fan cave"" that can fold up to be out of the way and go with you wherever you'd like.I like it so much I might even buy one for a Giants fan I know - may the best Manning win!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WFW2R84LX3OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052TP7B6#wasThisHelpful","R1WFW2R84LX3OM","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an iPhone 5 and an iPod Touch 5 (I know it seems redundant, but different products for different needs).  I chose the orange case for the iPod Touch and think it's a great case for protection against scratches and minor drops.  I would NOT recommend this product for a ""tween"" or teen, for someone who is clumsy or somewhat careless - get an Otter Box for those folks.  But for those of us who are slipping the device into a purse or bag and just want a little protection for the screen and/or for an occasional drop it is fine.  I like that it's offered in a variety of colors.  I actually am about to order one for my iPhone - I ordered a similar case for my iPhone and the phone slipped out the same day and gratefully only a small corner of the phone had a little ding in it that didn't damage the phone itself.  Though it's a pretty snug fit at first I know my iPhone will NOT slip out of this and the much thinner iPod Touch hasn't budged a bit in this case.  Having a variety of colors means I'll grab the right device and the magnetic closure works well.

"This book is written for the ultra novice regarding RV's/travel trailers.  It is NOT for someone who has already purchased one and wants to learn a little more about how the unit works.  This guides the reader through the different types of units available, sometimes to the point of inane obvious comments.There is a small section that was somewhat beneficial in explaining the workings of the unit itself which is what I was aiming for.  That being said, I have an app for my iPod Touch (RV Ref) that I got for a whopping dollar that explains things far more extensively.The campground listing is sparce, outdated and really not useful.The information found in this book can be obtained by talking to other RV owners, picking up an RV magazine somewhere, looking up things on the internet and by purchasing a few apps related to RV's - some are even free.Not the worst book around, but even for me as a first time unit owner it was written on a far too elementary level.

"Expecting a Bose-level of sound?  Keep looking.  But if you're looking for a small little speaker to enjoy on a day trip, camping trip or next to the pool this is a great little product for the price.  I like how the 3.5mm cord is built right into the unit and am even more pleased that this operates off of 2 AAA batteries.  I like to use rechargeable standard sized batteries rather than an internal battery that has to be plugged in and charged up.  Once these batteries die down you can just replace them with a spare set of AAA rechargeables rather than wait hours for it to charge up.  If I'm camping there's often no place to plug things in to charge up - use of standard sized batteries addresses this issue and rechargeables keep it more environmentally friendly.I played ""Don't Come Around Here No More"" by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on my Sony 5.1 surround sound home theater system and then on this.  Obviously the Sony blew it out of the water and I was able to hear little background tones in the song much better.  However, if I was at a state park having a picnic for the day I'd be very pleased with listening to my music on this.I wish it had a FM tuner on it though, but I'm not going to knock down the star rating over this.  For the insanely low price I paid I'm pleased and think this would be a nice gift for a ""tween"" or someone who is on the go a lot and enjoys their music, but isn't a critical audiophile.

"For the price this isn't necessarily a bad case.  It's no Otter Box by any means, but as a responsible adult who won't let children even hold the device it would be fine for my overall needs.  That being said, I won't be using it.Pros:1.  Reasonably priced - worth a shot at this price point, but once you get it you may find it looks pretty chintzy.2.  Reasonable protection for the careful user - along with a good screen protector will probably be fine for most adults.  I wouldn't trust it for clumsy adults, clumsy teens or anyone in the ""tweens"" or younger category - if you're considering for those users I'd definitely spend more for the Otter Box.3.  The covers for the lightning charger and earbud jacks are nice and will keep those areas free of debris.4.  Stand holds nicely horizontally which is nice for watching your own videos, YouTube, etc.5.  Was able to use the power and volume buttons easily.Cons:1.  Stand is not very secure at all when vertical and this is the mode I want it in the most for signaling to my Bluetooth speaker.  When I have a playlist on and want to go to a different song or playlist I end up holding the unit.  Given the sensitive touch needed on the Touch I shouldn't have to do that.  After looking the case over quite a bit I'm not sure why they couldn't have made this a little bit wider - I don't think it would have impacted its performance - it probably would have markedly improved it.  This is my biggest gripe about the product.2.  Stand seems pretty fragile and was not easy to loosen from the main part of the case.  I was sure I would end up breaking it, but once I got one side loosened a bit I used my library card to gently slide around the rest of it for fear I'd put too much pressure on it with my own hands.  I have not secured it entirely back into the slot and leave it loose - I know it will break very quickly if I don't.3.  Rather cheap looking.  No one will say ""where'd you get the neat Otter Box with a stand like that?""4.  The silicone doesn't feel like it has a good grip in my hands.  Not awful, but not as secure feeling as my Amazon Basics 4th Generation Touch skin was.I don't regret giving this case a try given the inexpensive price.  It's not a horrible product, just not the right product for me - it might be the ideal solution for others though.  The next person I know who gets a 5th Generation Touch will probably be offered it free of charge.  I think as more people purchase the 5th Generation Touch there will be better cases with more secure stands.  I'm actually happier with an inexpensive orange skin I purchased and a small folding stand I purchased when I bought my 4th Generation Touch that allows me to have the Touch in vertical or horizontal mode.  I was hoping this one product would take care of both needs, but for me it didn't - your results may be very positive, but mine are neutral at best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3781W93GKTZ5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3NIFDS#wasThisHelpful","R3781W93GKTZ5M","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ORIGINAL REVIEW:  JANUARY 2013I ordered this at the same time I ordered the new iPod Touch and installed it as I pulled the fake screen off of the iPod itself so I didn't even have to use the enclosed screen cloth.  It went on easily enough and I had no bubble problems.  But the screen is just so grainy looking.  I'm not a professional photographer, but have some of my very good professional-level published pictures I uploaded from my computer on the iPod.  This screen protector just doesn't do those photos any justice because it's grainy.I was showing the new Touch to my sister and her first words within seconds were ""why is this so grainy?  Your pictures really don't pop out like they did on the other one.""  I have no doubt that this will keep the screen from being scratched by the careful user and it seems durable - as such I don't think it's a bad product necessarily, but I'm not as pleased with it as I was with Armor Shield for my 4th Generation iPod Touch.  I had to use the cloth once in a while for fingerprints, but I'd rather do that and have my pictures come through the way they should.  The 5th generation is supposed to have the retina display, but you'd never know it with this (in my opinion anyway).If your primary use is to get some of your e mails, play a game here and there and other things that don't really make a huge difference in appearance then this is probably a good product for you.  For those using the iPod to have their photo collection on, watching video, etc., I'd suggest a clear screen protector instead.  No regrets in trying it - it's all about how the product fits your needs and this one just doesn't fit mine.UPDATED REVIEW:  MAY 2013 (original review gave 3 stars, now upgrading to 5 stars)I had been meaning to update this a little sooner.  After I wrote my review I was contacted by the company who offered to replace the matte finish with the clear finish - I received it very quickly and am very impressed with the company's commitment to customer service.  The clear finish shows fingerprints more than the matte finish, but also allows your pictures to really ""pop"" out more with the retina display.  The kit comes wtih a cleaning cloth anyway so it really isn't a big deal.  A quick swipe against a soft cotton T-shirt cleans up the screen nicely too.My overall recommendation:  If your primary use for the iPod Touch is to use some apps, access the internet, general ""messing"" around with, etc., then I'd probably recommend the matte finish since it is good about concealing fingerprints.  If you use your iPod Touch for showing photos then I'd recommend the clear finish - your pictures will come through much more nicely.  Both products are quality, as is the manufacturer.  The difference is in what your primary device use is for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32MCRX6ZNW153/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XV98YM#wasThisHelpful","R32MCRX6ZNW153","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I ordered my new iPod Touch 5th Generation I also ordered the Ionic SLIM FLEX Case for The New iPod Touch New HTC Droid DNA (Blue) since I wanted a skin for the device for a nice grip and it seemed to get overall good reviews.  I didn't like it at all since it was still rather rigid and just didn't fit the device nicely.  It also didn't feel nice with the textured sides.Though several people gave this Evecase a less than ideal review, I decided to try it and am glad I did.  It's the closest thing I've found to the AmazonBasics Silicone Case with Tread for iPod touch 4th Gen (Black), but not quite there.  It most assuredly isn't nearly as rigid as the Ionic Slim Flex case, but just needs a bit more substance to it like the Amazon Basics case for the 4th generation model had.  I'm hoping that an Amazon Basics 5th Generation Touch skin will be available soon.The cutouts lined up nicely and I have a small external speaker that plugs directly into the headphone jack - no cord, just the speaker and jack.  The other case didn't allow this speaker to fit, but this one does.  I've had no problems using the power button or volume buttons at all.  I like the standout orange color against the black of the Touch too - looks sharp.This is certainly no Otter Box by any means and if you're seeking something to provide breakage protection this is NOT the product for you.  But if you're looking for an easy to slip on/slip off silicone skin that provides a pretty decent grip at a good price then this is worth the price.

"While this case isn't inflexible, it's not as flexible as I wanted it to be.  It's a bit on the rigid side and I don't find the ridges on the side of it to be comfortable at all.  The cut out for the camera is fine, as are the ones for power and volume.  That being said, I realize that the 5th Generation Touch is pretty new and there aren't as many reasonably priced skins out there yet such as the one made for the prior version by Amazon Basics which I find to be very comfortable.  I'm hoping that Amazon will be making one for this model very soon.

"Obviously, the primary intended use of this product is to cover foods in odd shaped containers without lids or when a lid has been lost or damaged.  I use them for this purpose, but the way I like to best use them is to keep dust out of things that I may not use all the time, such as my  OXO Good Grips 3-Piece Stainless-Steel Mixing Bowl Set or on my Crock Pot SCR450-PT 4-1/2-Quart Slow Cooker, Black Demask Pattern.

I use the large ones with the red band for these things.  The medium size (green bands) will cover most 2 serving sized dishes and has also worked well as a cover for Progressive International Collapsible Mini Colander.  I'm rather disappointed that there's only one small size (blue band) though since I've thought of several ways to use these.  I purchase them at the big national chain store with the smiley face logo for a fraction of this cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL9EFB36OZYXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FDMJV0#wasThisHelpful","RL9EFB36OZYXW","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a bit hesitant on how sturdy the overall form of this tub would be given that it collapses - I was pleasantly surprised.  The plastic top and bottom are extremely sturdy and the grey collapsible section is strong as well.  I've been using it to soak and hand wash more delicate items.  I fill it to just below the top of the grey section at the sink and then carry it to a corner out of the way for a while.  There is no shifting to the solid plastic whatsoever as I carry it and it never feels as if it's going to give out.  In fact, I think it's equally as solid as a traditional dishpan and certainly more handy.  I will primarily use this at my apartment, but own a travel trailer - it will be great to be able to use it in the same manner and then be able to compact it for saving space.  At my apartment I typically leave it expanded since I feel that any product manufactured in such a manner will last longer if not continually stressed by expanding and collapsing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NVATLI1GNSB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QP30S0#wasThisHelpful","R3NVATLI1GNSB0","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These pieces aren't as solid as I had hoped them to be.  They aren't of horrible quality and my main reason for purchase was to have a set of microwave items for my travel trailer.  If I were going to be using this on a regular basis in my home I don't think I'd be too happy.  But I think for my specific purpose it will be fine.

"I've only owned this for 30 minutes and I already know I'm selling it back to Amazon since I'd pretty much lose money by sending it back for a refund.  Recycled recipes, way too big, just not what I was looking for, but bought it based on all of these 5 star reviews.  I'm glad it's worked out for those people, but for me it's not a good fit at all.  Anyone with any degree of food creativity can come up with similar recipes.  I suppose the best way to go is eat more whole foods since they fill you up better anyway and eat less processed foods.  This one is loaded with processed things.  Thanks, but no thanks.Lesson learned for myself:  If I desire to purchase a cookbook online make sure I've thumbed through a friend's copy first or go to a Barnes and Noble and look through it there.  Amazon's prices are almost always better, but not if you're spending it on something that ends up being a dud for you.  Personally, I have my grandmother's old, old cookbook from the 1930's and 1940's - while lard isn't something we use as a main ingredient these days, at least the recipes are real and can be updated on your own for current cooking practices.All this book did hungry-wise for me is make me hunger for my money back.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TSI0S5H3EX22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312676786#wasThisHelpful","R3TSI0S5H3EX22","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own the full blown hardcover version of this book that also contains the garden center items and find it to be one of the most useful items I own.  So when my nephew started an electrician's training course at his high school I thought this would be a great item for him.  It is great from a reference point of view, but from a user-friendly point it really isn't.  The book is small and the print tends to start to go a lot toward the inner crease/binding, making the book something you have to almost flex back in order to read comfortably.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that in time doing that repeatedly will cause pages to fall out.  It might be good for a quick reference once in a very great while, but if you think you might reference this pretty regularly I'd recommend the larger book so it will last.  I wish my larger book didn't have the garden center part since I really don't need that, but that seems to be the only way to get a durable copy of this book and is worth having the extra pages and size for that reason alone.  I've purchased 2 ""very good"" rated copies of the full version here on Amazon for literally less than a footlong sub each at Subway.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNBMY77EQO23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762414383#wasThisHelpful","R1LNBMY77EQO23","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...but it's worth every penny for my athletic clothing.  When I received this I didn't think 40 loads were contained inside.  The small scoop inside really does do the job and is more than adequate for my athletic wear washing needs, you may need 2 scoops at times depending on your needs.  I have deliveries from Amazon made to work and a colleague scoffed at the idea of paying what I did for this product.  I figured it out to be a little less than $.50/load.  Considering the price all of us pay for Under Armour, REI and other athletic wear I find that to be an incredibly small price to pay to get residual odors out, keep them from coming back and extending the life of my clothing.  I wasn't thrilled with the product after my first load since there still seemed to be some leftover unpleasant scents, but ran the load a second time and was amazed with the results.I know there are several other similar brands of detergent out there and this was the one I chose based upon reviews of other Amazon users.

"My title pretty much says it all.  I don't like putting my refrigerated pizza directly on the rack of my oven because there have been some instances where cheese has dripped on the bottom of the oven and that's not the easiest to clean up.  This allows the pizza to cook nicely and get a relatively crispy bottom without the mess.  This won't work for the larger pizzas that you can purchase in the refrigerated section, but great for a 12"" pizza for 2-3 people.  It cleans with ease, but as with most bakeware a good towel drying is needed to prevent rust from eventually forming.  I just let it sit in my dish rack for about 30 minutes and get any excess water droplets when I wipe it down.The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because I think there are other pans that have aeration holes that are a bit larger which makes it crispier.  That being said, I have almost all Good Cook bakeware in my home with a couple of Oneida pieces.  I am very pleased with nearly every piece in the Good Cook bakeware product line and is the reason I chose to go with what I felt would be a pretty safe bet.  No regrets.

The price is very reasonable (from the vendor I used anyway) and it was delivered to my Mom in less than 4 days.

"I have the good fortune of living only minutes away from Sherrill, NY, the home of Oneida Limited.  I found the Good Cook loaf pans, all three sizes, at the factory store and bought a 5x3 pan since I had recently found a recipe for a single loaf that size and wanted to try it in my GE Countertop Oven.  The pan performed beautifully with a light coating of non-stick spray.  The bread cooked evenly and with a beautiful golden crust and literally slid out of the pan.  It wasn't long before I was back at the factory store and purchasing the other two sizes of loaf pans along with pretty much every other piece of bakeware imagineable that they had which I'd find useful.  Using my Good Cook pieces makes me want to bake and cook a little more knowing how well they perform and clean up.Though they could sustain some light and deliberately thoughtful use from metal utensils, the product line will clearly last longer if non-stick utensils are used with them.  I don't know how these perform in a dishwasher, but they hand wash beautifully.  I use a sponge that has a ""grittier"" side that is safe for non-stick cookware and bakeware to help remove any residual non-stick spray.  Hand drying after use is recommended to prevent rust from eventually starting to form.  The non-stick surface is an anondized type, not the older style that often peeled off.I've been impressed with all of the pieces of the Good Cook metal bakeware I've used thus far.  It was great to replace my heavy and harder to store glass pieces I had with these lighter, quality pieces.  The only items of Good Cook bakeware that I'd steer away from are the larger cookie sheets.  The smallest one is good and firm, but the larger cookie sheets tended to have a little shifting to them when I twisted them at the ends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN3WGXY28QAGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026RHI5K#wasThisHelpful","RN3WGXY28QAGE","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Every conceivable utensil will be able to fit easily on this, in many instances 2 or even 3.  It's lightweight and nothing fancy, but it's a quality product at a good price.  I'm an apartment dweller, but have a full size stove/oven so it fits on top of the stove nicely.

"Overall, I like this product.  It's simple and slim to store.  I love to travel and usually stay at places such as Extended Stay that have a kitchen.  The downsides to these kinds of places is that they often are missing some pieces such as a colander so being able to take this along without really taking up any space is great.  Can easily hold pasta for 2 people (if using portion control sizes and not mammoth servings).  I'm also a die-hard tent camper and like it for my camp kitchen bag too.

"I own this brand of onion keeper and I absolutely love it.  I live near Oneida Ltd. in Central New York so I bought mine there at the factory store rather than on Amazon.  A friend saw it and liked it so I thought I'd see if Amazon had it and send a link to her so she could get one of her own.  Never in a million years would I have thought that this product would keep my red onion as fresh as it has for as long as it has (going on just over a week now).  My refrigerator has no evidence of any sort of onion smell.  I also have the green pepper keeper and that works equally as well.  There's also a garlic keeper and tomato by this company - I don't use either of those for their intended purpose, but look great sitting on the ledge area of my stovetop (with a little non-skid shelf paper to keep them in place).  These make wonderful gifts and everyone I've given one to thinks they are one of the most practical and decorative kitchen items they've seen in years - they're right!

"I am NOT an earbud person at all - until now.  Well, I still don't think I'm an earbud person, but am more than willing to use this particular product.  I have 4 iPod/Shuffle products and never once used any of the earbuds Apple provides with them.  Just looking at them my ears feel uncomfortable and as such I've always used headphones of some sort.  Since I now have a small rechargable earphone jack speaker (Macally Portable Stereo Speaker with Lithium Battery Silver TurboTune) that fills most of my listening needs I thought I would try out these earbuds after reading multiple good reviews of them.  I travel a lot so I wanted something that would take up the smallest amount of room and not have cord all over the place.  This product provides nice sound, is pretty comfortable for the price and they have extra pads for the earbuds.  All in all, a good purchase for me - the product adequately fills my need.Downsides:  As another reviewer mentioned the cord on this is a bit short even at its fullest extension.  This can be a bit problematic if I'm carrying my iPod since my arm can't relax comfortably at my side.  I'm not a tall person - I'm 5'7"", so I am knocking it from a 5/5 to 4/5 for this.  Also, I'd think twice before I purchased this for someone who would be using them constantly since the wires are very delicate.  I realize they have to be delicate in order to wrap around the center chamber and to be so compact.  For someone like me who is using them a handful of times each month it will be fine.  I know not to pull quickly and to treat it gently.  I'm not sure the average teenager would be so cautious, however.Overall I'd recommend it to someone with those caveats in mind.  For the price I'm very pleased.  I purchased this at a site other than Amazon only because it's on backorder here and I needed it before they would arrive.  Once back in stock I may purchase a backup unless I can find something within a reasonable price range that has a longer cord and a cord that is a little less delicate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17T4MNIXL3VYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006RIFV44#wasThisHelpful","R17T4MNIXL3VYS","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...the first one I received from Amazon had a product defect right out of the gate.  It arrives in compacted shape and as I was extending it I noticed the upper portion of the silicone green sides separated from the clear acrylic upper portion and I had to contact Amazon to return.  They promptly replaced the item and paid for my return postage for the defective one.  Because of this problem I'm reluctant to compact it unless I really need to.  I feel the less this product is messed around with the better.  When I travel to my vacation home I'll want to have this along and will compact it then, but otherwise I'll leave it in extended form.  I'm pleased with it as a produce keeper - the 2 qt. truly held 2 qts. of strawberries and seems to extend the life by a couple of days.  I like being able to rinse and store in the same container.  I myself have not had the problems with the bottom cover as others here have mentioned.I'm not sure I would purchase this same container again unless I saw it at a killer price.

"When I bought my Amazon Basics silicone case for my Touch it came with a pretty decent screen protector, but the fingerprints were just awful.  Awful to the point that I had to keep the lint-free cloth close by for regular use several times a day.  When I read that this was the ""creme de le creme"" of screen protectors I thought ""what makes this so much better?""  Well, now I know.  The fingerprint marks I can readily see are so minimal that I don't constantly need to use a lint-free cloth to clean it up - maybe just once or twice a week vs. several times a day with the one I had been using.  I had one small air bubble that was luckily in the black area on the lower right of the Touch that didn't seem to be going away, but as many others wrote it eventually did (I helped it along a little).  Had it remained, however, I still would give this 5 stars for the clear, minimal fingerprint finish I have.The Youtube video was very helpful and highly recommended prior to application.  The instructions I saw were for an iPad, but are pretty much the same for this particular product.  Seeing the step by step tutorial is helpful.  The small piece of shield for over the button at the bottom seems rather inane to me and I didn't use it.I am so impressed with this product that I have no reservations about purchasing more in the future for other products.  I don't think my 4G iPod Touch is going to need a new one - I think it would take a lot to destroy this.

"I bought this to use with my iPod Touch for when I travel to have a better speaker than what comes on the Touch.  I wanted it to be slim, easy to use and no-fuss.  I wasn't looking for it to give me the same kind of sound experience I get from my Bose system - just something a little less ""tinny"" than what the Touch plays through its speaker.  I don't necessarily think this makes the Touch sound level louder as much as it seems to create a fuller sound which, to me anyway, makes it seem louder.  As another reviewer wrote if you have this playing in a relatively quiet household you'll hear it a couple of rooms away nice and clearly.  For a couple of people playing cards while camping it will be perfect, but to entertain a room full of chatting guests it won't give you that level of volume.  It charged pretty quickly and the sound integrity only seems to fade as it's running out of juice.  For my needs it will be absolutely perfect and it's the only one I've seen in such a small size.  I use a 4.3"" 2-sided GPS case HDCSXL: Extra Large Hard Shell Case For Garmin, TomTom, Mio GPS with 4.3"" Screen to hold EVERYTHING I need for my Touch, including charger, an extra case with cover, cables, stylus, etc. and this slides in there just perfectly so everything I need is right in one location.  In fact, I couldn't seem to find another speaker in this size range and thought I'd take a chance that it would both fit in the case AND produce the sound I'm looking for.

Since it's in this protective case I don't need a case with a cover for the most part and wanted something more comfortable than a pseudo-leather case to hold onto.

"My main reason for purchasing this was for the ability to keep it connected to my iPod Touch since I need to use a stylus for effective typing.  I cannot for the life of me understand how no one has yet to make a case for an iPod Touch that includes a simple, secure slot to hold a stylus.  There are enough styli on the market (literally page after page on Amazon) so why hasn't anyone made the simple case with cover and stylus holder?Anyway, when I got this I thought it would be OK enough until I found something that secured a stylus better.  It's still a little too short when fully extended but certainly is useable enough to type out a quick message so I was satisfied enough with my small investment for the time being.  One day I got thinking that this item cost really next to nothing so the plastic used to go in the headphone jack probably isn't of the highest grade plastic and what happens if it breaks off into the jack.  I stopped using it altogether after I thought about that for just a moment and I would encourage you to do the exact same thing.  I ended up giving it to my nephew with the warning that he may want to think twice as to whether or not he wants to put this in the jack.However, if it's a compact stylus you're considering I'd give it about 3 stars.

"My travel is for personal purposes only so I don't need any kind of device that has programs such as MS Office or any specialty computer program.  I just need something compact for travel since I simply want to be able to check my bank statements/ensure direct deposit went in, send and receive messages, access the internet to look up local attractions, maps and local travel guides, checking the weather, maybe a Kindle download here and there, things like that.  I didn't want anything too involved or expensive (like the iPad) since I don't go on vacation to be connected all the time, but want now and then access to look things up or keep entertained if I'm waiting for something.  This device does all these things, but has so much more to it than that.  I'm pretty brand loyal to Apple, but wouldn't hesitate to bring up any problems I encounter.  So far I've had no problems with apps running awkwardly, crashing or any other things other people seem to be noting when looking at app reviews.  Many things are available offline once downloaded, such as travel guides or specific maps, which is great for someone like myself who is envious at times of people with smartphones and their ability to look things up on a whim (but I know I don't want a smartphone and the additional charges since it's not important for me to be THAT connected).  So many places have wi-fi availability that I really don't have any problems finding a place to use it.Favorite Apps:-ShopShop (free, shopping list maker with ability to have multiple lists with a simple layout and it remembers your items for future list making)-iHandy Level (free)-Weather Channel Max ($3.99, but I like the moving radar feature - free version is good though)-Pandora (free, and it will upload whatever you have on a Pandora account you already have)-Betty Crocker cookbook (free, and it's a full version)-Better Homes and Gardens cookbook (free for full version, $.99 to get a specialty add on with more recipes like slow cooker)-Discount Calculator (free, determine final price of a percentage off item)-Vocabology (free, daily new word and urban slang phrase)-National Geographic National Park Guide (free, able to add one specific park in depth information for free but would have to pay small amount for others)-Photo Collage (free, numerous layouts and ability to adjust collage frame size, can use pictures you upload from your computer or ones you take on the iTouch camera)-Gas Buddy (free)-Coleman Lantern (free, select from about a dozen different lantern models to turn it into a flashlight)-Zip code reference (free)-Hobby Lobby (free, coupon via the app vs. printing off of computer)-PBS (free, can watch a multitude of full length programs for free)Most major banks, credit card/financial companies and major retailers have a free app.  This is also reassuring to have while on vacation to ensure my automatic payments indeed went through successfully.

If you're willing to put up with some ads many of the free versions will do just fine.I like that I can load my own pictures since I like to have some pictures with me of my travels to show others easily.  There are many free collage programs you can choose from to even make a collage and send it via e mail.  It's a neat feature for taking a few vacation pics on the iPod Touch itself and sending to family and friends.  It's not nearly as nice as the pictures I take with my DSLR camera, but in many instances has taken some nice shots I'm proud to send along.  I can load the DSLR shots onto this later if I want the really good shot available for viewing.I've played with the FaceTime a little bit with my niece and nephew for the novelty of it all.  I imagine teenagers would find that more fun than a 41 year old, but it is a neat feature.  If I didn't live near them I probably would find it more useful.I have a 2 GB shuffle with ability to use playlists for my music, but I added on a compilation mix of the 3 major types of music I like to listen to on the Touch just to have available if I'm using it while out and about.  When I go camping at the National Parks I can conserve my battery on the Touch by using the shuffle for music and the Touch for reference needs.The size of the iPod Touch is both a curse and a blessing at the same time.  Along the curse side I wish it was more along the size of a 4x6 picture which would be slightly smaller than the Kindle Fire, but a little bigger than it currently is.  Its ability to be taken anywhere easily (vs. something even like the iPad) makes it a blessing.  I've heard rumors here and there from family, friends and some internet articles that Apple is looking to come out with something that could be considered an ""iPad mini"" or ""iPod Touch max"" in the near future too.  I would certainly jump on that opportunity in an instant and is ultimately the device I'm seeking to have.My only regret about this purchase is that I didn't order the 32 GB.  I thought about it briefly, but figured that I'd only be loading on a few things.  Wrong - once I got this in my hands and realized all the things I could easily do with it I wished I had ordered the 32 GB.  Had it come in a 16 GB version that would have been a no-brainer purchase.  That being said, I can always temporarily take off some apps I'm not using as much, take some pictures off, put shorter playlists on and things like that to conserve space yet ultimately still have everything available.  I know this version of the iPod Touch has been out for about a year now so Apple's close to being due for a new version and I will then order one with a larger memory and hopefully it will be the rumored mid size version several of us have been hearing about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KQFT2IUKW66V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FA1O0O#wasThisHelpful","R2KQFT2IUKW66V","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I remember when I got my Nikon D50 SLR 6 years ago that a 1 GB card was about $70.  I choke thinking how cheap they are these days in comparison and come in class 10, but all technology comes down in price.  Since they are so inexpensive these days I find myself transferring my images onto my laptop and external HD and then keeping the card as my ""digital negative"" in a SD card case as a final backup, esp. for trips such as Alaska, Hawaii and other more expensive trips that I'm not likely to take again.  There's no way I could do that back when cards were so expensive - I'd be broke with all the traveling I do.  Since I use the card this way I don't want an 8 GB or higher SD card - for me anyway that becomes too much storage and I'd rather keep it short and sweet so 1 card equals 1 trip.  4GB is a lot of images even on the highest resolution setting.  It may not be all that much for those using it for videos, but according to my newest point and shoot that does 1080 HD recording it gives between about 25-30 minutes which is still pretty respectable.  I don't use the video function so it's not a concern for me, but I think that amount of time would be more than enough if I ever did want to record something.I like Amazon's frustration free packaging as well.  A welcomed change to having to fight with packaging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROZ6NRZGUW0C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VNKNE6#wasThisHelpful","ROZ6NRZGUW0C6","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in a place that's been around for many decades now.  Of course the best places physically for me to use my resistance bands for a workout happen to be the same doors that have sizeable enough gaps between the bottom of the door and the floor that the anchor that comes with my tube set is as about as handy as a doorknob on a tree.  The door anchor that came with my set of exercise bands was no more than a marble sewn into the nylon webbing.  This anchor, as evidenced in the photo, has a nice, large anchoring surface that not only anchors it better but doesn't rub into the door.  It also has a very nice soft piece of material where the resistance bands go which will no doubt increase the life of your bands.  It's a well made product and wish my set came with something more along this line, but this accessory isn't very expensive and is well worth it.

"This will be a great product for me to use to warm up my 3 person tent before going to sleep (turning it off prior to sleeping of course), but it wasn't all that helpful for tailgating.

If I had purchased it exclusively for tailgating I would have been disappointed, but knew that I'd use it to warm up my tent and am confident it will be ideal for that situation given my tent is not a large one.

"I received this style lanyard in orange as a gift.  The webbing itself is nice, but it has velcro at the neck which is not secure.  On top of it not being secure it also doesn't overlap with the velcro making it look quite odd and scratches the neck.  I had a relative remove the velcro, overlap the ends and sew them securely in place.  Now I'll feel comfortable wearing my expensive game ticket on it whereas before there's no way I'd risk wearing it for fear of it coming off too easily and the discomfort of having the velcro scratching my neck.  It looks nice and sharp, but the individual that designed this particular lanyard should go back to the drawing board or should probably get out of design altogether - it doesn't take a whole lot of common sense to make an effective, secure lanyard.I'm also not sure why this doesn't come with a ticket holder - I had to buy that separately.

"My Dad was a tradesman and when he passed away last year I ""inherited"" one of his Makita drill sets that also included 2 batteries, speed charger and a flashlight as well.  Though there were several drill bits in there as well as flathead and Phillips head driver bits I wanted a more complete set and saw these during Amazon's holiday season ""lightning sale"" at a great price.  I read the reviews and even though the reviews weren't so great, I figured for my needs the set will work and it does.  I use them every now and then vs. my Dad who would have used these 4-5x/week and in far more heavy duty projects than I'll ever have.  If you need to drill a simple hole or want to drive a screw in quickly it's fine, but for detail and heavy duty work I'm reasonably sure that my Dad would have hated them.I think a lot of product satisfaction depends on how the item fits your needs - for my occasional, light duty work this set is adequate.  Though not in the building trades myself, I spent 40 years of my life helping a perfectionistic tradesman with numerous projects and based on those experiences I am fairly confident when I say that tradesmen would not likely be satisfied with this set.  Evaluate your needs and purchase accordingly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PX3C7EJC6CW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UZ0VTU#wasThisHelpful","R3PX3C7EJC6CW3","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've done SLR photography for years now and admittedly use the ""auto"" setting too much despite having the knowledge base to be more creative with exposure/aperture/shutter settings.  I've been wanting to make the most out of my cameras and wanted to get a good solid education with exposure without having to take a class.  After much searching here on Amazon I found this book to get great reviews and I now know why.  The book is written in such a way that if you have a good knowledge base it isn't insulting, yet if you are new to SLR photography it isn't written so technically that you can't get a grasp for what it's saying.  That's definitely a difficult balance to reach and this book has successfully reached it.  I also like that this book doesn't cater solely to the SLR user, though that's the user who will definitely gain the most knowledge.  I enjoyed the book so much that I'm considering other titles in the series as well.I recently took a trip to Niagara Falls and after reading much of the book noticed that my night photos were greatly improved versus other night photos I've taken in the past using the night photo setting on the camera.  By gaining a better understanding of the delicate balance between aperture and shutter settings explained in this book, along with use of a tripod and remote, I now have some beautiful shots to add to my personal portfolio that a pre-programmed setting would never allow me to achieve.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33QAAMZKHSFQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470114355#wasThisHelpful","R33QAAMZKHSFQX","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SD cards have come down drastically in price - I remember paying nearly $80 in 2006 for a high end 1 GB card.  Since I can get a 2 GB card for about $6-7 now I've decided to not erase them once I've transferred the images to my computer, external HD, etc.  I've essentially made the SD card the equivalent of the film negative so I have my back up images.  As such, this is a great product for my needs since I just label the SD card and put it in one of the slots and only remove it if absolutely necessary.  The slots are quite snug around the card which is great for card security/non-slippage, but if you think you'll be taking the cards in and out of the slots frequently the plastic sheet may eventually tear.  There are 2 slots that hold larger memory cards OR it would hold the traditional SD card size with a case that is essentially the same size as the SD card without a lot of excess around it - those are the slots I'd use if I would be taking the card in and out of the slot often.  The case is plain but effective, could slip into virtually any little space in a camera bag, zips nicely and the zipper pull could have a carabiner put through it if desired.  A nice organizer for the small price and a nice little gift for a digital photographer who's hard to buy for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AHKKE98JN31C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YKU1ZI#wasThisHelpful","R1AHKKE98JN31C","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is nice for its ability to be played as a single player (for 2, 3 and 5 players) or as teams (for 4 and 6 players).  It's a fun game that anyone over the age of about 8 could enjoy.  Maybe it's just me, but it took longer than usual to figure out the rules for the game and during our trial run game we had to reference the rule sheet nearly every turn and all of us playing are well-educated, smart, common sense oriented people.  For the second actual play round we had to reference the rules here and there, but from there it went relatively smooth and those of us playing all said it was a nice change from Uno.  It's a fairly quick play game and though the rules state that you have to reach exactly 1000 miles to win, you could make it different by having a win achieved by the first person/team reaching 1000 miles without having to be exact, ""drive"" a higher number of miles or through the highest score at the end of whatever amount of rounds you choose.  Make sure you have adequate room in front of you to have areas to place up to 6 different cards - works fine at a kitchen table or card table, but probably wouldn't work very well using a small side table or TV table.  I also own a card tray available through Amazon that works well with this game - 2 Deck Rotating-Revolving Card Tray.In a nutshell, each player has 6 cards at all times during the game and always draws a card on their turn.  You need a Go card to get started, need to hope you don't have hazards (flat tire, repairs) imposed on you by other players and if you do hope that you obtain the necessary card to overcome the hazard quickly (you'll also need to have a Go card to proceed), need to hope that other players don't impose a speed limit (meaning you can't use point cards that are over 50) and score the exact 1000 miles (if playing by customary rules).  There are nice reminder cards to reference throughout the game, but keep the rule sheet handy until you've played this a number of times and really have the hang of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MDXFSR4HF53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035A2PKU#wasThisHelpful","R3MDXFSR4HF53","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've wanted a card holder for Uno, Mille Bornes and other card games involving a draw and discard pile.  Thankfully I wasn't looking specifically for a rotating/revolving card holder because this holder simply doesn't do it.  I knew this was likely by reading reviews before I purchased it.  If you consider having to press down on the holder firmly to rotate it then sure it rotates, but it really should spin relatively smoothly without much effort.  Other reviewers noted that if there were too many cards on one side that it leaned, but I haven't found that to be a problem as of yet.  The clear acrylic is strong and this item would have to take one heck of a whack in order to crack.Again, I was simply looking for a card holder for draw/discard so I think it works well, but if you need it to rotate/revolve I think you'll be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18W1QBWY88L43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000G8Q15E#wasThisHelpful","R18W1QBWY88L43","AQWSPFJS2ENQK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQWSPFJS2ENQK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are genius. Now, I don't believe for two seconds that someone could not bust through one of these if they wanted to, and that is certainly not the purpose we were looking at when we bought them. We have a two and half year old Grandson and did not want him getting out of the house to go outside and ""play"" without our knowledge once he learned to work the doorknobs and open the doors on his own. This is a great concept because you can just leave the key in the top and if someone needs to get in from the outside all they need do is to turn the key from the outside and the chain falls away, you just reattach it when you come in.

"Great Quality Leather!!! And I love the orange color, it is just what I wanted, I can easily see it no matter where it is. The reason I'm giving it three stars instead of five? I'd have been happy to have given it five except for two reasons. This wonderful wallet is RFID, also an important thing to have in a wallet full of credit cards, BUT...while it has tons of slots for the cards, they tend to fall through the slots of the top two down into the pocket and below the first card! So you have three slots side by side on three of four panels, but the cards in upper slots disappear because there is not an actual pocket for each card, just slits cut into the leather, half the time I think my cards are ""missing"" and have to go digging to see if they are actually there. That is not a good thing to have to do every time you open your wallet and it is very annoying! The other problem is that the piece of leather that is meant to clasp the wallet closed is far too short once you fill all those slots with cards. The wallet is now thick with all those cards and it is a test to get the wallet clasped. I have every slot filled and you can forget putting any money in this wallet if you plan on getting it closed. So you must either NOT fill all the slots, you'd probably lose six slots to be able to carry cash. Not really a big deal for me as I never carry cash, but if you do? It will be an issue. They either need to eliminate six slots and make one panel strictly for bills, which in my opinion would ruin the wallet because there are already two pockets you can use for cash and/or receipts OR make the dang leather piece longer to wrap around the the wallet. Someone did not actually FILL this wallet with plastic cards and cash after designing it to see if it would WORK properly, what a shame. Other than that it is a beautiful wallet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SF0C6OTHL76F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TS84F1A#wasThisHelpful","R1SF0C6OTHL76F","A1XKQX71GJASJR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XKQX71GJASJR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They were just right and even if I had to replace them once a week they were a bargain! So I'm keeping them! I think they will be just fine. I replace my toothbrush once a month or if I get sick then as soon as I am well.

"Excellent cover!!! Matched our room perfect and is upholstery quality fabric. They also called to make sure the measurements were correct and that I ordered the right size, which was nice actually! I was worried that the full would be too small if washed or something, but it actually measures well enough that if you did wash it, it would fit and still stretch if need be.

You can use picture bumpers (little rubber nubs that keep pictures from sliding on the walls and being crooked) on each side (that is what I'm doing) or you can use shelf liner cut to size and use double sided tape to put it on, that would keep it from moving. There are a lot of fixes for the sliding issue. And maybe they will eventually put something behind it to keep if from sliding. But for now you can come up with something because this is a really cool and useful item. I love that you can adjust it to any angle. On a table or your lap it is perfect!

"Best price on amazon for this type glove. I was concerned with the size because of all the reviews but bought them anyway because all the others were 30 bucks and I wasn't paying that for them. I wear a size 7 glove which is a large in ladies gloves, I wear a size 9 shoe and I'm 5'8""....you may wonder why I told you that? Well, hands are relative to feet and height. My hand is just under 3 1/2 inches wide at its widest and these fit me perfect. Many people said they fit big and that worried me. SO IF you are short with little feet, these will probably fit you big.

While they lack arch support, if that is important to you, you could add an insert. I am a true size 9 and technically I have a wide foot at 4"", but I didn't order a wide or anything, they are plenty wide and comfy and that is why I say you could add the insert, there is room for it. I have tons of trouble with my right foot, plantar faciitis and so I really cannot say if they are comfortable all day since I cannot walk all day or wear a shoe all day...or even stand all day! But I do know that these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. That said, they are not the most attractive shoe around, they (to me and my husband) look like Old People shoes, which is funny because we have become Old People!!!

"If I could give it no stars? I would. Perhaps she could funny in real life, I don't know, but she is not funny in this book, she only thinks she is. I found her to be rude and disrespectful. She seems to have a major chip on her shoulder about her Father, her family, her upbringing and her former religion. She took things out of context on a regular basis, made them out to be something they were not, and out right lied at times. She seems to have a warped sense of things. Having been around Mormons all my life, and having many, many relatives who are Mormon, I was looking for some insights into those who have left the church. I found a book making fun of Mormons in a really bad and disrespectful way. I felt sorry for her in so many ways because she could only see things from this warped point of view and chose to tell things out of context in a warped and mean manner. She deliberately chose words that twisted the truth about the things that Mormons do and hold sacred. There is nothing strange or untoward that happens in Temples. I am of the same age she is and she flat out exaggerated everything she could to make them look bad! She's outrageous. Like anyone who chooses to talk bad of someone else or something else, they twist the truth to get people to believe their version things. That is precisely what she did here. I wouldn't get Life Coaching from this bizarre woman for all the money in the world. I wouldn't trust her and I sure won't read any of her other books. My husband read her Finding your North Star or something like that, a book I picked up somewhere, and he wanted to read this one. He began telling me strange things, and because he is not Mormon I thought I better have a go at it. In the first three chapters she was so utterly un-likeable I could barely continue. I gathered in the next few chapters that what she thought was humor in the previous few chapters, only came off as showing her in a very unfavorable light. She has a very poor sense of humor, indeed. Perhaps in person she does not come off as so scathing, but none the less she is manipulative and full of exaggeration that I found no respect for her....at all.

"In todays world anyone who can write and post it on amazon is an ""Author"", that does not mean that those who can write, write properly. The grammar is atrocious, and the punctuation is horrendous; the spelling was correct and it was quite clear that a spell checker had done that for her. The organization was poor at best. Amazon has created a place where one cannot possibly know what they are getting when they purchase a ""book"" unless they purchase a hard bound copy that has properly been done by a publishing house. This ""book"" was clearly not proofread, edited or done in proper order. Frankly I am tired of buying books that cause me to cringe because they are written by freelance writers with poor English skills. I have begun ""returning"" them immediately upon the first error I come across in order to retrieve my hard earned dollars and spare myself from the embarrassment I feel for these so called writers.

"I can completely understand the deep, primal appeal of a long, singlehanded sailing voyage. Bernard Moitessier's The Long Way is a beautiful rapture of the deep. He was winning the first round-the-world-nonstop sailing race, but instead of heading north to claim his prize, he sailed around again, all the way to Tahiti, without ever stopping.This is something else. This is rowing across an ocean to prove that you can row across an ocean. Now that it's been done, someone will no doubt row frontwards across an ocean, and then someone will do it in a birchbark canoe, and then with no paddle, and so on. All of those ways are very short on pleasure.So you are guaranteed to meet a very odd person in here. She's a global warming and ocean-ecological-disaster nut much like myself, but she is also a strangely uninformed one: when she meets a sunfish doing what sunfish do (lie on their sides and flap their flippers in the air, literally sunbathing), she assumes it's some horrible pollution-mutant.But hey: she dumped her bog-standard life-with-hubby-n-kids to go find her adventure, and obviously loves doing what she does, and there is genuine adventure in here.

"By page 114, I could already comfortably explain Hawking radiation: the seeming paradox that absolutely nothing can get out of a black hole, yet it radiates vast amounts of energy. (Hint: think of particle/antiparticle quantum foam popping into normally-temporary existence right ON the event horizon.) Where does that energy come from? Literally nowhere.Still here? Good: now I know who I'm talking to. This is a brilliantly clear history of 20th Century physics, astronomy, and cosmology. The characters come to life: before his killjoy editors got to him, one of Stephen Hawking's papers included ""Suppose you have a little race of gnomes..."" At one point, astronomers could rank themselves depending on whether Allan Sandage had at some point stopped talking to them. Described at length are several cases of mentors guiding students in the best Platonic fashion. Also, interestingly described at length is the fall and rise of the mighty Allan Sandage, who was thought of as being out of date until more modern yardsticks stunningly verified his thirty years of meticulous, lonely work.I only have a good brain, a year of college math (which I'm dreadful at) and physics, and a lifelong fascination with astronomy/cosmology going for me, but I submit that any intelligent, interested person would like this book and may be inspired by it. It is an adult dose, and I'm savouring it. By page 300, I already understood symmetry, broken symmetry, the whole enormous fuss about the Higgs boson (yes, it IS that big a deal: until we created one in the CERN accelerator, they had been entirely missing from the universe since the first trillionth of a second), the concept of a supercooled Higgs field, and finally what inflation is and why it had to happen. Though very interested, I thought I could never understand any of those concepts and even dismissed them as mumbo-jumbo: Overbye makes them plain as ... well, he makes them understandable.Overbye doesn't get into string theory very deeply, probably because it was very new in 1991, so I'll end with a question: Can anyone recommend a book that covers the last 20+ years?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX69TSNDF8XEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060159642#wasThisHelpful","RX69TSNDF8XEX","ABBIURWJFRZKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABBIURWJFRZKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this from the library on a whim, not expecting much, given the spectacularly well-coiffed and turned-out author.But so happens the lady really knows and loves her subject, and the book is exactly what it says it is: authentic Japanese cuisine that uses few ingredients and needs few instructions to prepare.Which doesn't imply it's all easy-peasy. The kara-age chicken needs to first be fried at 340F until almost done, then singed at 370F to finish. My first experience quickly taught me that those specific temperatures are important, and are difficult to maintain (do NOT trust the dials on electric deep-fryers: these days I just hover over the stove, monitoring the oil temperature in the pot). I thought to eliminate the first fry by pan-roasting the chicken beforehand, but turns out the batter needs all that time in the oil to cook properly.But my first, messy attempt got eaten almost as quickly as my second. And as I already had hot oil, and we had harvested-today local corn on hand, I also tossed in her kaki-age corn and shrimp fritters, without the shrimp, which means I was basically deep-frying corn and flour: those are so utterly addictive that they evaporated on their way to the table.For a Scotsman, I've made an astonishing amount of tofu, but then so has Ms. Arimoto. Tofu is tasteless, you think? Try using her recipe, but substituting edamame (frozen is perfect) instead of dried soybeans. The result is BRIGHT green, tasty in a very subtle way, and likely to get you lucky if you ever bring a vegan home for dinner.A recommendation for a next book? Japanese Soul Cooking.

"I ordered this book because the excellent Making Artisan Pasta mysteriously skips soba entirely. Now I know why.I am an experienced pasta-maker, and thought that the problem with buckwheat flour - the complete lack of gluten, contributing to a rather brittle texture - could be solved by throwing technology and pure gluten at it.That does work, vastly simplifying the process, but the resulting noodles, while excellent, are just buckwheat noodles, not soba. There is an entire other world in here to discover, encapsulated in the mysterious phrase: ""mixing of the water into the flour in such a way as to allow the buckwheat to develop its own viscosity.""I'm a scientist, don't like mysteries, and hate doing things because ""that's just how it's done."" I will eventually understand the chemistry behind what is going on there, and where the viscosity is coming from, but in the meantime I'm learning the traditional way, and maybe in a couple of years I'll be making passable soba, at which point I'll treat myself to the coolest kitchen knife ever, just the thing to have on hand when the zombies attack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAZOZURUMAJ75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0870118609#wasThisHelpful","RAZOZURUMAJ75","ABBIURWJFRZKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABBIURWJFRZKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you think you know all the problems and possible fixes for the state of food in the world today, you need this book as much as I did. Mr. Barber picks one subject after another and dives in very deep. Take wheat, the largest world crop. One of its problems is that it is an annual, needing planting anew each year, right? Wrong. Wheat has been bred to be an annual, but it can also be a perennial. Perhaps the most staggering diagram in the book is the side-by-side comparison of the roots of perennial and annual wheat. The perennial roots are 3-4 times deeper and wider: that diagram alone COMPLETELY explains the ""Grapes of Wrath"" Dust Bowl.Then he moves on to foie gras, which provokes an automatic ""Boo! Hiss!"" from all animal-sensitive people, right? Wrong again. He describes a goose farmer ( who is quite likely clinically insane, but all the more delightful for that) who simply allows his geese to force-feed themselves. When the first cold-snap appears (which triggers gorging to prepare for migration), he lets his beloved geese into a field of their favourite food and they make foie gras voluntarily, while he lies on the ground among them, snapping photographs and laughing.Then Barber explains how chicken farming sadly became The Chicken Industry (Mrs Perdue, with too many chickens but enough feed), and how corn took over half a billion acres, yet tastes like nothing. And then he dives into the ocean, in depth of course.Two months later, I finally finish the book, is how much digesting it needs. At the end, he cycles back to wheat: how varied the flavours could be (""as different as heritage tomatoes"") but how they somehow all got squished in the drive for commodity-uniformity. The problem here, he suggests, is that even most artisan bakers and cooking-nuts like myself LIKE uniformity, you betcha ... and yet Kitchenaid grain mills  are inexpensive, and I could almost walk to Skagit Valley WA, which is currently all a-ferment with custom wheats.Dan Barber has a possibly-unrealistic view of our ever-more-overpopulated sustainable future, but aren't they all? His sounds more tasty than most.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVB7T5DLZ06I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204071#wasThisHelpful","R3DVB7T5DLZ06I","ABBIURWJFRZKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABBIURWJFRZKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I dove right in the deep end: making pasta using only a bowl, rolling-pin, and knife. (Why? Because I recently had everything I own stolen.) Ms. Green's instructions worked perfectly, and I had a blast doing it. I'll post images shortly.Now that I have an Atlas pasta roller again, I'm all over these recipes like a cheap suit. No more store-bought wonton wrappers for me! The flavoured pastas are brilliant, and the utterly-gorgeous laminated parsley sheets are a show-stopper. I adjust amounts of semolina vs. Caputo ""00"" flour to give exactly the texture I want. Hand-formed udon in miso soup is ... ambrosial.More about the laminated parsley: It took me four 1/4 lb balls and about 20 minutes total to nail it (see user photos). The main thing is to completely trim the stalks off, or the sheets will tear. It's fun to experiment doing the laminating while still a couple thickness away from what you want: the leaves become enormous and abstract. Next time: edible flowers.Four stars only because her recipes constantly refer to other recipes, which is usually just inconvenient, but can be disastrous. Making spinach pasta? After blending the spinach with the eggs, you're told to follow the rest of the directions for red pepper pasta, but THOSE tell you to reduce the liquid on the stovetop.

"I read this brilliant cookbook cover-to-cover as soon as I got it. He has lots of stories to tell and he introduces several obviously-beloved associates along the way, but those asides are always there to introduce and explain the recipes.

Yes, it's long and (very) involved, but the only hard part is finding the ingredients. I managed to score every one except the coriander roots (strangely unavailable in the Pacific NW). The toughest to find is probably the kaffir limes, but I have my own tree.The resulting sausage has me seriously considering dedicating the rest of my life to making and selling it. I'd sell it at farmers' markets, each one wrapped in its recipe, completely unworried that people would then start making their own.I have every David Thompson Thai cookbook, and they're uniformly excellent, but also strangely passionless.

"Yes, you have to get used to it, which takes just a little learning, but that only takes a few minutes of playing around. I keep it for personal use and keep simpler timers for guests, but personal use is exactly where it shines.I have short-term memory problems, so there are several events that I need to time every day. Tea-brewing (9 minutes, over and over) is typical, so it's nice that each timer remembers what it is set at. (Hair-dying was another regular one, but I recently realized I was starting to look ridiculous... )I could properly be described as an obsessive cook, and often load this timer up with three different things to keep track of.

"Nobody would now name, and nobody would now buy, a book titled ""The Best of Asian Cooking."" As if it could all be lumped into one slim volume! The only reason I'm reading it is because I'm house-sitting for a friend, and she has it.Which, it turns out, isn't a surprise. She spent several years eating her way around SE Asia, while setting up tea supplies. This guy did exactly the same (except for the tea-part). Just last night I got a hankering for miso soup with tofu (Go figure: I'm Scottish!) and I followed his ridiculous recipe (7 oz of bonito flakes for 4 pints of wateri!?!) for dashi. It was harder to follow his ""2 squares of konbu (seaweed)"" so I just winged the amount, but the result was transcendental. I had chanterelle mushrooms and smoked salmon all ready to jump in, but ended up adding only sliced green onions, and also ended up in soup-heaven.(There are two massive Asian supermarkets close to here. They both sell endless varieties of ""dashi-mix,"" NONE of which contain actual bonito flakes. Luckily, Central Market was also nearby. It's the Seattle-area food-cathedral where everything (including bonito flakes and the deathly-cute Asian assistant who found them for me) is utterly edible.)I've only made the one recipe, but the dashi was so marvellous that I read all the way through the book. There are dozens of excellent, well-informed recipes for now-popular dishes like Tom Yung Goong here. He was brave enough to include then-impossible-but-now-doable ingredients like shrimp paste and kaffir lime leaves. He includes an accurate recipe for beef rendang (my current passion) but falls down at the end when he says: ""Continue to cook until the liquid has been almost completely reduced"" without mentioning that this should properly take several hours: rendang is beer-party food: settle in, crack a few, and give an occasional stir.I've got perhaps 100 Asian cookbooks, but the reason I'm going to steal this one (hey: I'm taking care of her dying dog, and her goats and ducks and cats, while she goes gallivanting..,) is the dozens of recipes I'm unfamiliar with. I'd heard of winter melon soup, but had no idea it could be done this way, as the stunning  centerpiece of a genuine feast (and advanced pumpkin-carving skills would help greatly, here :-)In short, the book title is fairly accurate.

"This thing is fun, very comfortable, eliminates the need for a coaster, but is not terribly effective at keeping drinks cold, dammit.It's designed for tall-neck bottles, but it also works well on stubby bottles, by squeezing the sides together while zipping up, and then folding the neck down slightly.But then I got scientific, and measured what difference it makes. I took two beer bottles with water cooled to 40F, wrapped one while leaving the other one uncovered (the room temperature was 70F) and measured every five minutes with a probe thermometer. In short, after 45 min, there was only 3F (52 vs 55) difference between them.The beer FEELS colder when drinking from a wrapped bottle, because your hand is grasping something warm, so the cold beer is a surprise. I'll keep using it, but will look around for something more effective.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HY3N9W1A8AYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DKE7G2#wasThisHelpful","R3HY3N9W1A8AYY","ABBIURWJFRZKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABBIURWJFRZKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Felicity Cloake has laughable knife-skills, an endearing little speech impediment that likely makes her unintelligible to most Americans, and is short on knowledge on several important cooking techniques. But she has a real way with finding the perfect recipe. Not familiar with her ""Perfect"" format? She makes several recipes taken from various top-of-their-game chefs, describes the strengths and weaknesses of each one in detail, and then melds them all into her idea of perfection.Her ideas are damn good, but if you disagree with any decision she makes, you can simply reverse it by substituting some road she didn't travel. The other recipes are described in enough detail that each recipe can easily fan out into a dozen distinctly different ones.But if you still pay attention to American health warnings about food (""Margarine is good for you! Butter is bad!"") then you should know that's she's ... authentic. Her Perfect Cornish Pasties call for lard in the pastry. You might think to bravely substitute butter, but the pastry recipe ALSO calls for butter, so just suck it in and buy some (preferably fresh) lard, OK?

"Pacific WWII naval history fascinates me, and I'll happily put up with merely adequate writing as long as it is clear and accurate.I only got halfway through this book before ditching it out of irritation. The description of the USS Tang's torpedoing is just flatly confusing: it describes the stern sinking to the bottom at three different points in the timeline.But that was just the final straw. By that point I was already irritated by the poor quality of the writing. Typical: ""He wondered if he would survive. He would soon find out."" Well, obviously he survived to tell someone his thoughts, or Kershaw is making stuff up. Sometimes it seems he uses this tiresome, amateurish foreshadowing technique every few paragraphs.Interested in the story? Amazon has at least two more books that cover it. First is The Bravest Man, which tells the expanded story of the career of Richard O'Kane (the Tang's commander), and then for a much drier, more technical take on the story, why not read O'Kane's own book on the topic? Clear the Bridge! gets very good reviews. Some of the reviewers complain that he rarely describes the emotions the men were undergoing? Having had my fill of US sports coverage (""How were you were feeling...""), I consider that an even stronger recommendation.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MJV6PFKU0HZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0306815192#wasThisHelpful","R1MJV6PFKU0HZ0","ABBIURWJFRZKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABBIURWJFRZKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nowadays, even highly-regarded cookware store staff have no idea what a larding needle is (and usually look kind of grossed-out when I explain), so I understand I'm preaching to a very small choir indeed.Which is a shame: modern, bred-for-leanness meat needs a larding needle much more than meat used to. This one works very well, with a couple caveats: I find it's better to pre-drill the larding holes by pushing the bare needle through a couple of times, twisting as you go. Then, after cutting your larding strips (all I've used so far are strips of pastured pork belly fat, but the results are wonderful), stick them in the freezer for just a few minutes before pulling them through the meat. I've had very few breakages.But I'm starting to think that this could be used for more than just lacing fat through meat; how about lacing salmon-belly fat through a lean fillet of the same fish?

"This is a brilliant product that contributes to making incandescent pizza, but if you are serious about making pizza, then you'd likely use it on something like a wood-stoked kettle grill, heating it to 900F before sliding the pizza in. When the pizza is done, you need to peel it off of the Lodge immediately, so what are the handles for? They just get in the way.Cast iron absorbs much more heat, and transfers it much more rapidly, than stone, so your pizzas are going to cook faster, which is the same as saying they will be better. I was suspicious of the pre-seasoning, but it works very well: I've now made a dozen pizzas on it, and the seasoning just gets better each time.One comment about sizing: I started out using this on an 18"" kettle grill, but it is too big for that-sized grill. The handles don't even fit under the lid, and not enough airflow gets up to the top, requiring the pizzas to be finished under the broiler. It's perfect with a 22.5"" grill, but I'm still thinking of sawing off the pointless handles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R347YMYAJ6V6G6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000E2V3X#wasThisHelpful","R347YMYAJ6V6G6","ABBIURWJFRZKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABBIURWJFRZKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What happens next is up to you. I thought I'd be making all sorts of exotic pies, but I've become a Margherita-purist, using exactly eight ingredients including salt, yeast, and water.(Confession: I then tried making my own mozzarella.

"I've been trying, and succeeding, to tame this beast for the last two weeks.I'm using an 18"" grill and a Lodge cast iron pizza ""stone"" that is simply too big for it, restricting the airflow to the top and requiring that the pizzas get properly finished under the broiler.But it's easy to crank it to 900F or more (confirmed with an infra-red thermometer), and the 6-minute pizzas already coming out of it are stratospheric, easily the best my roommates and I have ever had. By far our favourite is an utterly-plain Margherita, made with exactly eight ingredients: Italian 00 flour, water, yeast, olive oil, tomatoes, basil, mozzarella, salt. Excellent Parmesan is always on hand, but it simply does not need it: it might be the perfect food.(I added a few ingredients, like lipase and goat rennet, when I tried, and finally succeeded, to make my own mozzarella from raw milk. The results were spectacular on my second try, but to get it right I had to invoke a Rube Goldberg sous-vide setup with 1 degree temperature control. Honestly not recommended, though the result was much better than even Italian bufalo mozzarella, which is, after all, old by the time it gets here.)The KettlePizza is far too expensive for what it is: a simple band of stainless steel, with two handles and a hole in the front, but order the damn thing, and crank it up: it will immediately scare the crap out of you.

"[Upgrade to 5 stars: I've been working with the book for a few weeks, and get more impressed as time goes by. It's quickly answered every question I've had, and the results have stunned this sous vide rookie and his rapidly-fattening roomies. But I had been using it purely as a numbers reference, and only recently looked at the author's developed recipes: they are excellent, uncompromising recipes. Three that jump out at me are the Jamaican pork chops, the pastrami, and the very first fish recipe, the Moroccan snapper. That's the recipe I stole to make a 6-hour halibut rendang, the best thing I've ever made.]This completely-unpretentious little book is excellent at explaining the ins and outs of sous vide and also as an extensive and quick reference book.Just last night I wanted time/temp for lamb chops. Keller's (enormous, showy) sous vide book (only he knows why he titled it ""Under Pressure"") only has one lamb recipe, (140F for 35 min) for a saddle. This little book has 12, plus a two-page discussion about cooking lamb, PLUS a reference page listing time/temp for sixteen different lamb cuts, each to two or three doneness levels.I read the discussion and quickly selected 132F for two hours. The result was astonishing (all the more so because I used a crock-pot hooked up to a PID controller, because the splashing-water noise from my Braun Thermomix has a ... diuretic effect). Since I was brining them, then cold-smoking them, then marinading them in tandoori paste before cooking them, I added a rack of lamb to the recipe, hoping there'd be leftovers: there were none.Two nights before, I needed numbers for that halibut: this book gives 4-5 doneness levels for 38 fish/seafood species, though of course the numbers don't vary very much between species.The author makes the excellent point that far from being complicated, sous vide brings incredible simplicity to cooking, completely separating prep from cooking, and greatly loosening up timing. With the lamb taking care of itself, I had plenty of time to make a simple pineapple curry side-dish, and raita. I could just as easily have sealed the lamb up and held it for 24-48 hours before cooking. Last night I made his Jamaican pork chops (at 136F, not his 131F). My roomies didn't come home, so I seared mine, died, and went to heaven. Thing is: my roomies can die and go to heaven any time in the next 5-6 days, on 45 min notice: 40 min at 136F, then stripe-sear one side and blast the other with a torch. Or I can freeze them for several months, and they're still less than an hour from the same meal.

"I got this to see if long strips of these lights (a single controller can handle 26' of lights) might work as battery-saving ambient lights for the VW Camper I'm rebuilding.The answer is: gosh yes! right now I'm running them off a big deep-cycle battery that is hooked up to a 4W solar trickle-charger. I've left them on all night for the last week, and the trickle-charger seems to be holding its own.Installation is easy. (If you're doing a permanent install, I recommend potting all the connectors in silicone). I was concerned about the amount of light, wanting to use these to at least read by: no concerns there: put six strips side-by-side above the kitchen cutting board, and you've got operating-room brightness (which is exactly what you need, given that the cutting board IS an operating room featuring your hands). A single strip is easy to read by. Thrown in for free is the multicolour capabilities. It's a shame that the controller only allows you to choose between 15 colours and white: the LEDs themselves are likely capable of many more, but it's really nice to be able to see clearly, and also do mood or nightlight lighting.I believe these are built to an international standard, allowing you to mix and match manufacturers. And I'm SURE someone makes a plugin controller that syncs them to the music that's playing (Deadheads pay attention).Dislikes?* If the remote dies, so goes the lights: there is no other way to control them.* Restricted colour choices (ridiculous complaint, given the price)* A slight roughness to the response. Switch colours, and it might flash brightly in another colour.* The remote is primitive: to brighten or darken, holding down the button does nothing: you have to press it repeatedly.* But I dislike that I'm even bitching, given how useful and how much fun these are.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O1ZNH3NXCNMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIG9818#wasThisHelpful","R2O1ZNH3NXCNMK","ABBIURWJFRZKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABBIURWJFRZKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a series of lectures, not an audiobook. The difference becomes obvious very quickly, as the lecturer is thinking what to say as he goes along. This means that he speaks slowly and ramblingly, throwing in many emphases, long pauses, repeating himself, and adding conversational white noise like ""and so on and so on.""There is nothing wrong with the actual arguments, and of his choice of main battles (Artemisium, Salamis, Trafalgar, Tsushima, Jutland, Midway...) the only one that looks out of place is Jutland, because it changed nothing. His summation of Midway is succinct and to the point: at 10:22 am, the Japanese Navy controlled the Pacific; six minutes later, they didn't, and the change was brought about by less than a hundred American men, mostly by sacrificing their lives for the cause.But then he closes the book with an analysis of Leyte Gulf, which is a fascinating battle and a personal favourite, but it was hardly a pivotal moment in history and doesn't really belong here.So approach this one with some caution, and give it a listen first to see how you respond to the overall delivery. I found it rather annoying, and he further didn't endear this Scot by interchangeably using ""Britain"" and ""England"" as if they were the same thing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV3OBBHACM4MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EBHFD4#wasThisHelpful","RV3OBBHACM4MH","ABBIURWJFRZKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABBIURWJFRZKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[Update: For its first real job I had it grate multiple layers of pecorino romano onto a lasagna I was building. In this job it really excelled, quickly and accurately snowing layers of cheese onto the lasagna and not onto the counter. The photo, above, shows it in process. Each layer took less than a minute to grate and distribute: impressive.]This is an impressive-looking design, and with the rubberized handle and end-cap both bonded directly to the blade, looks very durable. The only really relevant question to ask of a new grater is: ""Is it as good as a Microplane?"" With that in mind, I compared at a variety of tasks against five different Microplanes. It's an unfair test, since I selected the best of five Microplanes at each task, but keep reading.You can see the results in the images, above. The first one shows the Cuisipro lined up beside its competiton. I first tested cheese grating, choosing fresh, soft Pecorino Romano and a stone-hard old piece of Parmesan. The Cuisipro was slightly better, and quite a bit faster, than the two best Microplanes.Next was zesting. My favourite Microplane for this job came out on top, being easier to calibrate exactly how much zest is coming off and how close to the white pith I was getting, but the Cuisipro, while it was harder to to control exactly how deep it was going, was ferociously fast, zesting at twice the pace. A little practice with it and it could be a fine, fast zester.Next, chocolate. I chose a difficult one: 70% cacao. When chocolate-grating, aesthetics comes to bear.My favourite Microplane for this job - the Large Shaver -produced much more attractive, large chocolate curls, especially after warming the chocolate to 85 F in a water bath, but the Cuisipro was once again effective and very fast.When comparing build and durability, all the graters in my test were equal, but notice that I only have Professional Microplane models. The standard-issue Microplanes (in other words: the ones that cost the same as the Cuisipro) are all made with easily-breakable transparent plastic frames. Given that the natural way to get grated material off of them is to bang them against the edge of the bowl you're mixing in, their lives will be short, which makes this new Cuisipro an excellent choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16CQXQL7A3Y2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003LS1MM8#wasThisHelpful","R16CQXQL7A3Y2N","ABBIURWJFRZKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABBIURWJFRZKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having delighted in  Charcuterie by the same authors, I waited eagerly for this book's release, received it just hours ago, and have read about half of it already.The first long, non-introductory chapter is entirely about butchering a hog, which is entirely appropriate here; they even give the economic breakdown of buying a whole or half hog, but of course you can approach the process more timidly if you prefer.But I'm more of a ""damn the torpedos"" type, so I turned to the prosciutto chapter ... and stopped short: the short preamble is great, but the following recipe is two pages long. It certainly touches all the basic bases - breed, diet, butchering, draining, packing, weighing, larding on the strutto, hanging - but a chapter that opens with: ""This is the most demanding cut to cure..."" should, honestly, go into more detail than that. For instance, the chapter ends with: ""Depending on the conditions of your drying chamber, you may be able to leave it there for up to two years. The danger in letting it dry too long, though, is that it can be come [sic] dry, leathery, and tough."" Which conditons are most desirable for prosciutto? How about best temperature/humidity? There is a long, excellent chapter on general curing, but before I invest a year or two making a prosciutto, I want a more detailed treatment of its specific requirements.[Update: Somebody wrote, then deleted, a comment about the above. I think what he had to say was informative, so I'm pasting it here, verbatim.==============I really am not trying to bust your chops, but I feel that the book gives as much detail on curing prosciutto as is possible, without going into esoteric meat science-speak.""The Environment: Creating a Place to Dry Cure Meat"" [p. 76] gives very straightforward instructions for how to dry any salumi. Professionals hang their hams in the same chamber as their salamis, and so can we. As someone who has screwed up MANY a prosciutto, I can attest to the fact that they are indeed the most demanding cut to cure. They are so demanding not because there is a highly specific set of actions and environmental factors that are difficult to execute, but because they are massive, convoluted things, and there IS NO foolproof way to make them perfectly.==============I hope he is wrong, but I suspect he is right. In the meantime I'm perfectly willing to delve into ""esoteric meat-science-speak"" if it will lead to more reliable results.]The other, less-daunting preparations seem to get the detail they need, though: the two pancetta recipes are simplicity themselves (to the point where I'm already calling around looking for a pastured pork belly), and the many salami recipes all seem within reach.But the above gripes are minor: like Charcuterie before it, this is a cookbook, not a recipe book. In order to properly make some of these recipes, the whole subject needs to be studied in depth, and this book seems an excellent starting point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RECDS9V2AJ47L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393068595#wasThisHelpful","RECDS9V2AJ47L","ABBIURWJFRZKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABBIURWJFRZKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Costco here in Seattle currently selling twitchy-fresh Alaskan Sockeye fillets for $9/lb and whole fish for $5/lb, this Scotsman decided he needed a long filleting knife. At the knife shop, the best one I was shown was this Global, but I couldn't bring myself to spend that much, and I dislike the Global handles, especially when wet as would happen while filleting.So instead, for chump change I got this excellent knife with a far superior handle. A short detour to Youtube for salmon filleting videos (recommended: the hilariously-unhygienic one that has chickens wandering all over the filleting table) and I was in production, with the freezer and the stockpot quickly filling up. I figure that with the Global's extra flexibility, I could get about 5% more meat off the bones, but none of it is going to waste, so I don't mind. A shorter knife wouldn't work nearly as well.Next up: the same store is selling whole NZ lamb for $3/lb...(Note: Every decent cookbook I've ever read says salmon carcasses make dreadful fumet.

"I'm also 45 years late in writing a review of this book. I read it when I was ~15, haven't read it since, but the many lessons it taught me are still fresh in my mind, like Asimov's deconstruction and explanation of all the components of paradimethylaminobenzaldehyde (still remembered intact, no spell-checker needed), of which I'll just give one: The ""amino"" comes from ammonia, which got its name from the ancient god Ammon. Camel dung was used to heat his temples in winter, and the priests noticed a white crystalline substance collecting in the rafters, hence ammonia.He goes on to masterfully explain each other component of the name, but not without also mentioning that the name itself scans in quadratic pentameter, which means that it can be sung to the tune of ""The Irish Washerwoman"". He probably made up the tale of quietly singing it while standing by the desk of an Irish receptionist, whereupon she gasped and exclaimed: ""Oh! You know it in the original Gaelic!"" but that amount of license is richly deserved by Asimov the writer.I believe he wrote more books than anyone else, ever. I went off his dry, unpeopled science-fiction before I reached 20, and am now a technical and science writer myself, but I'm not worthy to polish the boots of this man, who can truly explain anything to anyone, amusingly. Pick up any of his (100+) non-fiction books, and you will have pure gold in your hands.Why am I reviewing it now?

"Here are the numbers and the other information that I wish some of the other reviewers had written up.I just took delivery, immediately set it up to test it (of which the only non-trivial thing was loosening and rotating the hose clamps so I could align it correctly).Without it, the standard Bradley internal temp with the heating element off is 60 F above ambient (my test was done on a 70 F day, and internal temp was 130 F).With it attached, and the heat exchange tube stretched out to the proper 36"" (the product pic is very misleading, making it look like the heat exchanger is too short to be effective: I'll try to post a more representative one), the smoker-internal temp is 15 F above ambient, which qualifies as impressive. When I tested, the ambient was 60 F and the smoker temp was 75 F. I was just running a test, but I was making smoke while doing it so I stuck some cheese and a stick of butter in. The butter did not melt, but the cheeses sweated, confirming that 75 F is too high for cold smoking. That can be simply solved by the inventive use of ice, thank goodness, because I'm in the Pacific Northwest and right now it is HIGH salmon season, with Copper River Sockeye and Chinook ten bucks a pound for almost-still-twitching fillets. (I did a later test when the wind was gently blowing, and that made for a remarkable difference: internal temp was only 5F above ambient.)Yes, the heat exchange duct (very similar to a clothes dryer exhaust duct) is incredibly fragile and will look cosmetically horrible before long, but it does need to be fragile up to a point. You'll receive an education about heat exchange and temperature gradients by just running your hand along it. The rest of the components are durable quality, with even a magnetic-latch door for the water bowl.This paragraph for people who are using the digital Auber Bradley controller. All you need is a longer power cord between the Auber and the smoke generator, so that the remote temperature sensors can still go inside the smoker. Or just order replacement sensors from Auber: you'll need them eventually anyway, and they come with extra-long wires.If you skipped the last paragraph, you need to consider getting an Auber Bradley controller (auberins.com). It turns this, or any electric smoker, into an incredibly versatile, precise machine. You don't yet have your Bradley, and are wondering about whether to splash the extra for the digital model? Forget it: save the extra money and put it towards the Auber. Granted it's a pain to program, but really worth the effort. If you make beer, or cheese, it can also control some of those essential processes. And if you like to cook, and have a standard slow cooker, plug it into the Auber and you instantly have an excellent sous-vide machine.I've got the whole setup on the back porch right now, but this IS the rainy Pacific Northwest, and I'm installing a woodstove in my man-cave, so I'm getting thoughts about tapping the smoker into the chimney. That would be some radical man-cave indeed to invite some foodie date downstairs to examine...","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXN3A098Q24ZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Q3LO1E#wasThisHelpful","RXN3A098Q24ZA","ABBIURWJFRZKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABBIURWJFRZKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this detergent so I can wash the comforter on a weekly basis. The washing instructions on the comforter say warm on gentle cycle only, so I could not get rid of the dust mites that require a hot cycle. Now I can wash my sheets and comforter together, instead of doing separate loads.The detergent comes with a measuring scoop. That is the red top you see in the picture on Amazon. The scoop is tiny (maybe 2 tablespoons?), so you may want to use it instead of eyeballing the dosage what I usually do with regular detergent. You need 3/4 scoop for a regular top loading washing machine. The instructions say it is compatible with the high efficiency front loaders which I have. Good thing is that it uses even less detergent. It only needs half a scoop for the front loader. Because the scoop is so tiny and half of the detergent sticks to it when I measure it, I put the cup in the detergent compartment as my washer fills up with water.With a regular washing machine, you will get 30 medium loads out of a bottle. With a front loading washer, you will get 45 loads which turns out to be about fifty cents per load.Update: it may be good for allergens but it does not clean as well as regular detergent.

"The color of Spanish Copper is exactly like that of a used penny, not the brand new shiny one but one that has been around for many years and is dark brown. I like the dark brown color but I can see that people expect something with more yellow in it. The tube is 0.5 ounce and the instructions say that it covers 20 sqft! I have not put that statement to the test yet.Rub 'n Buff is a wax rub on compound and not a paint. It seems that most people use it for decorative items like picture frames and ornaments that are not touched afterwards. I called customer service and asked whether there is a way to make the finish durable. I was told that a coat of water based utherane will do that. Since Rub 'n Buff has solvents in it, you can't use the oil based polyutherane. I have used the product on cabinet pulls with three coats of Minwax satin polycrylic. Both the Rub 'n Buff and polycrylic were very easy to apply. Hopefully this will give me a moderately durable finish for several years. Putting this on the front door knob that gets even more use will probably be too much.I also tried to pu the Rub 'n Buff on a bright copper colored chandelier. The fixture had several sections of square metal which did not work with the product. It rubs on fine but when you buff, it comes right off at the square edges. You can't just put another layer on top of it like paint since it has a solvent in it and the previous layer does not dry as a hard layer.

" 0:31 MinsI have two old houses that are about 100 years old. They have a dark stain on tons of woodwork which I think is shellac based or covered. Doing a stain match is just about impossible, but I tried this stuff and it was a 100% match. Where the stain is worn, I just wipe it on with a cloth and rub it in. On the bare wood, just one coat was enough. I have had horrible experience with blotching on pine, especially with darker stains. This stuff had ZERO problems. The stain is poly-based, which gives it a durable finish. Although the finish is listed as satin, I find a real satin poly a bit shinier. So if you want a little more sheen to your stain, give it a poly satin topcoat.I have also used it on bare wood with paint splatters or painted wood (yes, white latex paint). No problem either, it may just need an extra coat or two. Until you end up with the last coat, it all looks bad, so keep on going. I have used it on a veneer door from the 60's. No prep required, just wipe it on three times for full coverage. I used a foam brush for the door and a cloth to wipe it on bare wood. The application is very forgiving.

I don't think you can even get this type of coarse grit in a belt or sheet sander. The discs last for a long time and the grit doesn't easily get clogged with paint. I used to buy the Makita discs at Home Depot but they stopped carrying it and switched to a junk brand Diablo, so had to switch to Amazon. The price is not even that much more than the junk Diablo.

"I bought this as a potty training book. Initially, I was disappointed because there is no mention of potties, going to the bathroom or anything like that. The book starts with mom throwing a diaper in the trash. From there on, you see a little girl who shows off her huge collection of very cute panties. It shows that big girls like her, mom, grandma and aunts but no babies or alligators can wear panties. So why five stars if it is not about potty training? My little girl likes it so much (and she has 50+ books), that she is happy to sit on the potty while we go through the book. The story is long enough that she can do her business in time and short enough that we can finish the book. Bonus is that this is a board book. We also have a book that shows the whole story of a girl going through the potty training experience.

"The exercise ball is of very good quality. I use it for exercise and also bounce on it with my little one when she needs to relax a bit. It has an insanely high rating of supporting 600 lbs, so I don't feel like it will pop under me any time soon. Once it is inflated, I found that it stays quite firm and I don't have to pump it up continuously unlike a cheaper ball that I had before.The pump is not that great. I am not in terrible shape but I had to pump it over the course of an hour while taking breaks in between. It took several hundred pumps of air to inflate this thing. Between pumping sessions, I would have to put the plug in and I could only take the plug out with plyers. However, I understand that a very nice pump would have made the ball way more expensive, so it is ok since I have not used the pump for several months now.I give the ball five solid stars but ding it is one star for the crappy pump.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20KWJOUWHOZ9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C9KU04#wasThisHelpful","R20KWJOUWHOZ9V","A30NHVVC62LJMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30NHVVC62LJMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Oregon Trail resembles any number of Bill Bryson books in its organization and approach to the story.  Rinker Buck tells of America's mid-1800's mass overland emigration as he recounts his modern day wagon crossing of the Oregon Trail.Buck is an older man looking for something in his life and burdened, perhaps, by the shadow of his father.  Dad had taken young Rinker and his siblings on a New Jersey to Gettysburg mule-pulled wagon trip in the 1950s.  The trip imprinted Rinker (as well as earning a story in Life Magazine).  As a man in his 60's looking for a reckoning with his past and present as well as a change, the idea of doing Dad's trip writ large - over the 2,000 mile Oregon Trail - grew in appeal to where it became an obsession he could not rid.$25,000 later, he and his brother Nick set off from Missouri in a three-mule powered wagon pointed toward Oregon and a recreation of the overland route west taken by an estimated 400,000 Americans in settling what was then the far coast.  Bryson-like, Buck gives a fascinating of history of the trail - including what went into a functioning wagon, the breeding, propagation and unique suitability of mules, and a sampling of the people who endured the 2000 mile trek west (often walking next to the wagon if they were women or children).  Alternate chapters recount his own encounter with the trail - remarkably preserved down to wagon ruts in some places, asphalted over in others and with occasional detours required by dams, interstate highways and fence lines.Rinker and Nick become good at what they do - grinding out the miles in often hostile conditions, handling a mule team with needs as well as distinct personalities, and dealing with their own quirks as well as the ghost of their Dad (who weighs heavily upon Rinker, but apparently not Nick).  Rinker becomes an Oregon Trailer - not just in action, but also spirit.  His connection with and research of the original emigrants and trail history gives him an emotional bind to his effort.  This bind helps him understand his father and become accepting of the man who raised him, but who's presence in his life raised discord for the younger man.It's a well-written and engaging book.  The author doesn't have Bryson's wit, but it is gently humorous in its own way (as well as occassionally sarcastic a la early Bryson) and tells a good story - be it history or current.  The only clinkers were about five dropped-in comments equating Fox News watchers and Tea Party folks with dunderheads.  A minor annoyance and discordant with an otherwise smooth narrative, but not a major distraction.Enjoyable as history and as a modern adventure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2345RBJHH6X14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451659164#wasThisHelpful","R2345RBJHH6X14","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I liked the wealth of trail information in this book, ""....The Complete Hiking Guide.""Not having been in RMNP in years, and planning bigger hikes with my seventeen-year-old this time around, I wanted a comprehensive book that would provide information on the breadth of hikes available in the Park.  This book served the purpose.It is fairly well organized with reasonable maps and nice trail descriptions (borne of the author's personal experiences).  I did agree with a couple of the other reviewers who pointed out that non-peak hikes aren't graded and that the author uses the Yosemite point system to rate peak hikes - which might be too technical for those not familiar with this rating scheme.  Also, the author puts basic hike descriptors (elevation gain, for example) in the back of the book in the Appendix instead of with each hike.  This doesn't make sense to me as it requires flipping back and forth to get a full sense of the hike.Still, this book provides a wealth of useful information and I found to be a helpful planning guide.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17MTEG920VUT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615526845#wasThisHelpful","R17MTEG920VUT7","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A National Park junkie, I have become a junkie of books with titles like ""Death in Wherever National Park"" (Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Big Bend).  Partly out of morbid fascination, but also because many of these types of books give interesting accounts of back-country adventure and rescue stories.  They also provide excellent advice and warnings of what not to do in rugged terrain.I ordered this book and sent a copy to my seventeen year old son when we started planning a trip to Rocky Mountain National Park this summer.  Longs Peak, the only 14-er in RMNP, drew his attention.  Also mine after I read up on the hike and saw it required not only great distance (fifteen miles), but also climbing abilities in addition to hiking skills.  Possessing neither climbing experience, nor unsure of my fifty-plus year old ability to do a fifteen mile strenuous hike in rough terrain, Chapter 2 of this book persuaded us both that Longs Peak was beyond our current skill level (ok, it persuaded me....he wasn't entirely persuaded until after the strenuous but enjoyable hike to Chasm Lake at the foot of Longs Peak and 3000 feet below the summit).This book is a compendium of deaths, near-deaths and rescues in RMNP since before its inception.  Each chapter is neatly divided (hiking, climbing, road accidents, murders - thankfully only a few of those).  The synopses of each case run from detailed to brief as the facts and knowledge dictate.  What emerges from the whole is not only a catalogue of incidents, but wise lessons and observations that will make the reader a more knowledgeable outdoorsman about what not to do in terms of risk.Although this book's entire focus is on mishap and rescue in RMNP, when one considers the actual extremely small number of incidents given the three million visitors the park hosts annually, the Park and the Ranger Staff offer everyone a thrilling and safe experience in the outdoors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROCJ3VQJT268B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1555664407#wasThisHelpful","ROCJ3VQJT268B","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Will Durant, who with wife Ariel wrote an epic account of western civilization that runs to 11 volumes (and which I have not read, though my Dad has the collection), produced an excellent series of essays on the eponymously named Lessons of History.These short essays distill Durant's finding from having read deeply and widely in western and world history.  Often thought provoking, they cover broad themes like religion, economics, race, war, government, growth and decay.  Making use of patterns of human behavior and patterns generally applicable across civilizations, Durant does a very good job of describing constants in the life of man as a communal and societal animal.  I particularly liked his discussion of the seemingly never ending trade-off between equality and growth - food for thought given all the attention the ""one-percent"" and ""disparity"" are generating in our current public dialogue.At only about one hundred pages, this is a wonderfully succinct, yet thorough examination of the big questions of the human experience and what historic examination says about them.

"Hampton Sides has written another good true-story in this account of the single voyage of the arctic explorer the USS Jeannette.It was a different time - when large personalities could steer national agendas and governments from the outside and where the ""certainty"" of science could commit resources, lives and attention (ok, these echo today with Donald Trump and Climate Change....).The voyage of Arctic Explorer USS Jeannette rested upon three personalities.  James Gordon Bennett, Jr.,  owner of the New York Herald; Geographer August Heinrich Petermann, and; U S Naval Officer George W. De Long.  In Petermann, the world had an expert, who led the argument for a popular certainy that the North Pole was a warm-water sea fed by the Gulf Stream and its Asian counterpart the Kuro Siwo.  Those streams, in scientific thinking, flowed under an outer ice ring (long observed by whalers and northern voyagers) and melted the ocean around the North Pole producing a navigable body of water.  U S Naval Officer George De Long, having participated in an arctic rescue, developed ""arctic fever"" and single mindedly focused on leading a voyage of exploration that would prove Petermann's theory.  In Bennett, inspiration and exploration met money and will.  Bennett, owner and publisher of the New York Herald, then the world's most influential paper, was fabulously wealthy and had an extraordinary talent for tapping into public interest with produced news chronicled in his papers that fed the public's appetite for adventure.  He was the man who joined Stanley and Livingston, having sent his reporter Stanley to the heart of Africa to find the good Doctor.  The resultant serials of the search and meeting sold a tremendous amount of newspapers.  Bennett thought that an arctic voyage to the North Pole would be the follow-on to Stanley and Livingston and saw another chance at making history in the effort.The story of the voyage is heroic and tragic.  Sides writes very well, and it is impossible to read this book without great sympathy for the men who willingly locked their ship in the ice and then endured privation that would sink most souls confronted with a fraction of the challenge the ship's crew endured for years.  Sides does a very good job of bringing the personalities of the story to life and each character becomes known to the reader with well rendered stories that describe the essence of the individual involved.  He does take a while to get to the actual voyage in the book, but the story of the personalities, preparation of the Jeannette as well as the recruiting of the crew is interesting and sets the table well for the adventure.(I would note that the current debate over climate change and the ""certainties"" of some scientists does make a fascinating juxtaposition to Petermann's and an earlier generation of scientists' ""certainties"" of an ice-free Actic Sea and the data that supposedly made it so.  Every age experiences to some extent the ""arrogance of the present"" and overestimates its own knowledge and understanding.  Perhaps unavoidable, but one of the great things about history is that it does give some pause to consider the human condition over time and perhaps learn to better confront the present and future).I read this book over a four day weekend - it moves and held my attention well.  For anyone interested in adventure writing, pick this book up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RZ5X8Q3XX49L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385535376#wasThisHelpful","R3RZ5X8Q3XX49L","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is two books - a series of essays on aspects of death in and around The Civil War; and, chapters on the how of identification, location, retrieval and reburial of the 600,000 of our fellow citizens who spent their all in the great event of our national story.Faust describes attitudes toward death prior to The Civil War - particularly the concept of the ""good death"" and dying well.  His book spends much of its ink on describing how various Americans reacted to the death of loved ones in service and the trauma that death away from home, often with the remains lost or in unmarked graves had on the families and loved ones who watched their men go to war.  Walt Whitman's melancholy and missionary zeal as he provided comfort to the wounded and dying during the last years of the war is recounted to poetically frame the effect such continual suffering had on individuals and the nation.  A host of unknown American's diary reminiscences are also used to underscore the effect of mass carnage and individual loss as experienced by loved ones.A little nation with a heretofore little army was not prepared to deal with the mass casualties produced by The Civil War.  The author describes the haphazard nature of body disposal and grave marking that attended most of the conflict.  The national government had to invent systems of dealing with the great amount of wounded produced by vicious battle and this took understandable priority over the care of the dead.  This lack of planning and organization meant that a generation of Americans who would have to deal with the tragedy of loss would also have to suffer the extra emotional burden of not knowing where their loved one remained near the battle that saw their demise or which one of the vast number of graves whose location was known but whose remains were not did contain their husband, son or brother.The war did, in its aftermath, spur major efforts to locate, rebury and commemorate the fallen.  This had the assistance of bureaucracy for northern dead; for the southern fallen, volunteer societies tried to assist in appropriate treatment of their lost sons.The book was hit or miss for me.  I thought the chapters dealing with reaction to loss and suffering were somewhat repetitive and ended up often underscoring the author's points over and over again.  This sense of loss is described in many histories of the conflict and while the author's focus gave it a greater scope than other works, it didn't really provide anything new to this reader.  Personally, I found interesting and learned a lot about efforts to deal with the dead and establish the national military cemeteries that I had not encountered before.  The chapters dealing with those issues were more interesting to me and I suspect would be for most Civil War buffs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B0ONQE794I56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375703837#wasThisHelpful","R3B0ONQE794I56","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fictionalized imagining of the ""real story"" of the Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday on their way to the OK Corral that takes the varnish off of the characters of of one of the West's best known stories, as I'm sure was McMurtry's intent.This thin book is stark and to the point.  So are Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and Charlie Goodnight and I think the author's stylization is meant to underscore these characteristics of his characters.  The women, on the other hand, have depth and nuance and run circles around the men in terms of understanding motives and in laying plans.  Events just happen in this book as the main male protagonists react and act - often on whims that take them off the front porch or bar stool when action is required.  The women, from the bordello madam to the saucy and interesting foreign mistress of a traveling member of the English gentry, plot, think long term and understand cause and effect - even in a society whose structure at the time prevented them from putting their superior mental efforts to work very often to guide events.I found this book interesting - though nothing like the excellent Lonesome Dove.  Lonesome Dove is layered and wonderfully constructed.  Last Kind Words Saloon is well written but it is a quick little book - it lacks the depth of other McMurtry efforts.  Still, and enjoyable novel of the West.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36U1KAO4WJ8SJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039335119X#wasThisHelpful","R36U1KAO4WJ8SJ","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For anyone in the health care industry who deals with studies, consultants and savings initiatives, this would be a valuable book to read.  The author presents case studies that demonstrate how some health care industry consultants violate rules of common sense in assessing program results (savings) and sometimes even make simple errors of logic and math.  Some of the cases are well known, such as a state Medicaid model that has been replicated far and wide in the country but whose results look to be based upon rosy baseline assumptions and in some cases wishful thinking.As health care delivery reform is a hot topic now, (and a costly one), this book is well timed.  The author does cite some interventions that appear to have positive results, so the book doesn't castigate the process of looking to more effectively and efficiently deliver healthcare.  It does highlight how many consultants have tremendous incentives to ""produce"" savings and choose assumptions that often pre-ordain their results","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UN1H7UJ0SFNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118313186#wasThisHelpful","R2UN1H7UJ0SFNE","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The art misses on some pages, but on most there are interesting pictures that should please the eyes of those being read to - as the rhyming cadence pleases little ears.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC151C8LWU4XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849636621#wasThisHelpful","RC151C8LWU4XV","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not bad, but photos could be better.This book is made out of hard stock, so it will survive some wear and tear (and book chewing, which my ten month old is into now).  On the plus side, 100 pictures gives young ones plenty to look at.  But, having to get to 100 leads to some choices that look like filler (dump truck and truck on the same page, for example).  Also, the picture quality was ok;  not up to the level of a DK book, but serviceable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MF50UWNOC8O1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312510780#wasThisHelpful","R3MF50UWNOC8O1","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story moves, propelling the reader onward.  The author is a good and descriptive writer and gives an immediate impression of the gist of each of the characters she follows.  If you are looking for a suspense read that will pull you in and make you want to finish the book in a weekend, this does the trick.Rachel, the ""Girl on the Train,"" who imagines the lives of a couple whose house she passes every day, is a drunk.  Daily, her train also passes the house she used to call home, now inhabited by her ex-husband and the woman he left Rachel for.  Twice daily on her commute, Rachel alternately mourns for the life she lost (and curses the women who supplanted her) and imagines the perfect couple down the street from her old home whom she views from her commuter's window but doesn't know.  Maybe due to her reliance on being drunk to cope with a life that has severely disappointed her, Rachel often is hesitant to act when contemplating a decision.  This does make some of the chapters repetitious at times, but the author's strong sense of place and use of description largely mitigates this criticism.Comparison's to Rear Window are obvious.  As with the Hitchcock masterpiece, Rachel gets involved when she witnesses an incident from her train that is out of sync with the imagined life of the couple she views every day - the couple about whom she has constructed a vivid, if alcohol fueled, perfect life.  There are a lot of plot twists, though this is the kind of book where most of them are revealed by the three protagonists and not pieced together from a well laid foundation of clues.A good book, quick read and pretty good freshman effort from this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BTWGRE5FK1MZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594633665#wasThisHelpful","R2BTWGRE5FK1MZ","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good book on politics (small ""p"").  I contrast it with Jeffrey Pfeffer's ""Power...."" in a class I teach and it is a useful tract.  Pfeffer studies power as it is, without any discussion of ethics or why it should be exercised.  DeLuca focuses on organization behavior and maneuvering within an ethically based paradigm (I suspect because as a consultant he had to sell his views on Political Savvy to clients who at least like to pretend all their actions are viewed through some ethical lens.)While DeLuca's book is useful, it is a little pollyannaish in that it tends to discount selfishness as a motivator in many organizational settings (not entirely, but enough that it seems the author is selling his model in a way purchases will be receptive).The strength of DeLuca's book (and there are many) is a mapping model he lays out for political assessment.  His model seeks to assign values to players, relationships and goals in situations where an individual or team seeks to move an organization from point A to point B.  This mapping tool, thus loads with assumptions, is designed to aid in the development of strategies for goal achievement.  While real life is immune to such exact representations, the model is very useful as a way to organize thinking in political situations where there will be allies and opponents, scarce resources and hidden agendas.The book is well written and wraps the author's mapping model around a corporate case study.  Very useful for students of organization politics and behavior.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U4U59CN9WGZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0966763602#wasThisHelpful","R2U4U59CN9WGZ7","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rudolph Giuliani's ""Leadership"" is a useful study of some of the things that made his mayoralty a success in New York City (success in that he attacked problems as he defined them and generally produced outcomes he sought).This book is not to be dismissed because it is written by a politician and would-be president.  Giuliani does an excellent job of chronicling the ""how"" of how he did his job.  The book is written in clear language, is direct, and is loaded with examples from his administration.I use this book to teach a course on politics and this serves my purposes well as a series of case studies.  Very critical to this book's utility is Giuliani's discussion of management and personnel practices.  His chronicling of morning meetings with senior staff shows excellent examples of how to conduct efficient and meaningful meetings as well as how to control large organizations through subordinates.  A frequent topic of the book is the new approach to policing and crimefighting his administration undertook.  While controversial to some, it can be argued that statistics portray a successful initiative.  His policing model introduces discussions of data acquisition and management, personnel and accountability as well as communication and feedback loops that are useful to those who seek how to implement new strategies that represent departures from business as it has been done.The author also discusses many other aspects of leadership such as time management, ""showing-up"" as the leader, and communication.  This book contains valuable lessons for any student of leadership.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16NTQDVX4ZNLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786868414#wasThisHelpful","R16NTQDVX4ZNLF","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jeffrey Pfeffer's ""Power: Why Some People Have It and Others Don't"" has been called by some a ""'Prince' for our times"" (referring to Machiavelli's famous tract).That is a fairly apt description.  Pfeffer is interested in power as it is practiced.  As such (and to the dismay of some of my students and some reviewers on this site), the author seeks to describe the world as it is and how many successful people in it maneuver.  Pfeffer breaks down aspects of power such as communication, self-promotion, acting, use of anger as well as other facets.  These are outlined and described (with examples) in easy to digest chapters.  This work is a mix of study (the nature of power) as well as ""how to.""  For anyone involved in organizations or other political situations where there is competition for resources and rewards, this book is very useful to understand how those who are competitors are likely to behave and act.  And while it is true that many view (at least some of the time) these competitions though the lens of ethics, others do not.  Even for the ethically minded, this book is very useful in order to gain an understanding of raw power and how it often is practiced.Pfeffer is a skilled writer who is direct as well as explanatory.  An advantage over Machiavelli's work is that Pfeffer speaks to the reader in today's language.  Whereas The Prince takes some thought in order to translate the mores and references of the Renaissance for understanding, ""Power...."" is crystal clear in its precepts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD62YYTMVCF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061789089#wasThisHelpful","RD62YYTMVCF0","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Jakob Raskob was a financial pioneer and engineer who greatly helped in the building of two of the Twentieth Century's industrial giants - the DuPont Company and General Motors.  And, he engineered the several decades when DuPont controlled General Motors and in effect ran the nation's largest auto corporation as well as America's premier and dominant munitions and powder company.Relying on a wealth of research, David Farber has thoroughly explored the career and life of a very interesting and significant capitalist (as Raskob described himself).  Taking a lucky break as P.S. duPont's newly-hired financial secretary before that duPont combined with two cousins to buy the family business, Raskob proved himself to be a profitable, reliable and creative financier to duPont.  This at a point in history when duPont needed those skills to acquire and remake the family business that would give it the dominance and form it enjoyed for much of the 20th Century.  Raskob financed and organized the family company as it consolidated the gunpowder business and then rode demand for powder and munitions during World War I to fantastic financial heights.  Looking for a place to park their financial resources as well as talented managers, Raskob then engineered the investment in and financial and management overhaul of Willie Durant's General Motors (saving General Motors from Durant's excesses).His final business venture was the conception of and building (on time, under budget and during the Great Depression) of the Empire State Building in the early 1930's.Raskob was a committed Catholic as well as committed capitalist and Farber chronicles his roles as significant Catholic contributor (so significant the Pope named him to a special order - apparently an order reserved for deep pockets who were willing to underwrite church doings) and generous philanthropist.  Raskob - hence the book's title - thought the fruits of capitalism should be spread far and wide.  He took the fairly new idea of consumer credit and brought it to the financing of automobile purchase - thus allowing many more of the public to afford GM's products than was possible in the previously all-cash retail automobile business.  He also campaigned for employee investment plans that presaged today's 401k retirement funds.A man of boundless energy (he reminded me of his near-contemporary Teddy Roosevelt), Raskob found himself advancing the presidential campaign of Alfred E. Smith (a fellow Catholic and ""wet"" on prohibition - important touchstones for Raskob) as chair of the Democrat National Committee during the 1928 campaign.  Ever the pioneer, Raskob was the first DNC Chair to establish the national political party with a permanent structure.  Heretofore, the DNC would be resurrected every four years after a nominee had been selected then die again after the election.  Raskob and his dollars and organizational brilliance (much better than his political acumen the author demonstrates) ushered in the permanent national political party organizations we enjoy today.Though even students of American Economic History are unlikely to recognize the name of Raskob today (he never seemed to have a need to put himself at the head of his achievements, though he came to be one of the most interviewed and sought after business voices in the 1920's), his contributions are significant and his story interesting and inspiring.  A good book on a very interesting figure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OPGO664YC79N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199734577#wasThisHelpful","R2OPGO664YC79N","A8DJ9EU2QP2JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8DJ9EU2QP2JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
