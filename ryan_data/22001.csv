"Half of this book is a new Discworld story involving Rincewnd and the characters of the Unseen University, including Hex, a computer involving insects (""anthill inside""). They're working to save Roundworld, which is our own earth. The problem is that Darwin has written a book called ""The Theology of Species"" rather than ""The Origin of Species,"" thus erasing the remarkable advancements of the Victorian Era, which simply didn't happen when Roundworld went down the wrong leg of the Trousers of Time.If you don't know Discworld at all and found that explanation completely mystifying, you might want to begin with one or more of the Discworld novels.The other half of the book is a clear and sensible discussion of evolution and intelligent design. The two parts alternate, so that you get a dose of Discworld along with each dose of science.The whole book is beautifully written, thought-provoking, and informative. It's a pleasure to read, no matter how much you currently know about evolution, because it includes fascinating historical information that you may not have heard before, even it you're completely up on the science. If you're super well-informed about the history and philosophy of the science of evolution, you'll still enjoy it because of the Discworld story and the wit and insight with which the scientific sections have been written.The book is not kind to intelligent design theorists, but it is thorough in its discussion, and should be enjoyable even for those who become uncomfortable as they read it. Terry Pratchett fans should not miss this book even if they don't want to read the scientific bits -- you can easily skip them and just read the story. You could of course also skip the story by reading alternate chapters but just the science. This would be an error, though.You want to know what happens to Roundworld, don't you?","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F3HPLIJ4UTUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804168989#wasThisHelpful","R3F3HPLIJ4UTUR","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's wonderful to see this classic knitting book back in print! The book consists of three sections.The third section has 17 patterns for beautiful sweaters, caps, and wraps. Like all Starmore designs, they're traditionally styled, beautifully designed, and meticulously written out.The second section has a compendium of traditional Aran designs, with interesting notes on construction and use that will inspire many knitters to create their own variations. All the stitches are charted out, which is good or bad depending how you feel about chartede stitch patterns.The first section is an odd introduction to the history of Aran knitting, from the viewpoint of the question, ""Did Starmore succeed in proving that she was right in her theories about Aran knitting?"" I think this question is probably of more interest to Starmore than to readers, and the whole section comes across as a bit bad-tempered and arrogant. Starmore believes that one star knitter came up with the entire Aran style, and it is hard not to conclude that she relates to this hypothetical knitter... perhaps enough to be swayed more by her image of herself than by historical evidence.That first section is still an interesting read, and if anyone deserves to be a bit arrogant about her knitting, it is Alice Starmore. The book belongs on every knitter's bookshelf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OO8XD1LFDPDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486478424#wasThisHelpful","R1OO8XD1LFDPDT","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Add instant Halloween decor with this sturdy (for lace) lace table runner. It's a fetching design on cobwebs and spiders, and will allow your tablecloth to show through, so use it over an ordinary white cloth for subtle Halloween flair, or layer it over orange or poison green for a complete lack of subtlety.This is the right length for a buffet table or a long dinner table, or let the ends hang down.It's easy care and easy to pack away with other Halloween decorations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G0B7B6OC1MMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOEY8U#wasThisHelpful","R3G0B7B6OC1MMJ","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently lost my phone charging cable while traveling and had to buy a new one at a local shop. I can therefore make a direct comparison between this one and Brand X.The Belkin is longer than the Brand X -- four feet, which means I can talk while it charges without having to lean over. Sure, I could probably have fixed this problem in some other way, but Belkin fixed it for me with this perfect 4-foot length.The Belkin is also suppler than Brand X, which is determinedly set in kinks from the packaging. Belkin's cable is also flat rather than round, which may work better with your personal cable wrangling arrangements. It gives you that extra centimeter of space if you have to fit it into a tight space, which so often is true for cables. And I think it looks a little more refined.The Belkin is purple, which is much snazzier than the Brand X's plain black.Naturally, it charges the phone, and presumably other Apple devices, just as well as any other cable. So why not enjoy its special details?","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26JZ3DGZGFLPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW06DDS#wasThisHelpful","R26JZ3DGZGFLPZ","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dan Shapiro has written a fun, practical book on being the CEO of a startup. It has five sections:* Founding* Funding* Leadership* Management* EndgameIn these sections, you'll find some interesting stories, instructions on how to create a Powerpoint that will make people want to give you money, and some clear distinctions between the startup and a profitable business. The section on running a business is very brief, and the best part is the age where you learn that ""Real company cultures are made of four things: Polarizing decisions, Excesses, Quirks, and Dysfunctions.""So this is not so much about how to be a CEO for a functioning company as it is about how to raise money and then sell your business. Nothing wrong with that, but you should know it going in. If that's your vision, this will be a useful book. If not, it'll still be a fun read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3851CSPN1GWIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449360734#wasThisHelpful","R3851CSPN1GWIJ","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wouldn't drink this for the taste; there's a bit of a cough syrup edge, as with energy drinks in general. However, as the liquid in a smoothie, half a bottle of this will provide 6 grams of protein and an impressive range of vitamins and minerals, with less sugar than an equivalent measure of orange juice.Whirl it up with frozen fruit and maybe some yogurt, and it can make a good start to your day. It's the equivalent of adding a raw egg or some protein powder, without the unpleasant texture.It also compares well for nutritional value with other sports drinks.

"This is not really a shampoo, and it doesn't clean your dogs, but rather encases them in a sort of slippery coating. It's intended to be used along with ""your usual cleaning products."" We tried it right after washing our dog, and also between shampoos. The dog wasn't crazy about it, and we haven't noticed any significant deodorizing benefits. We also haven't noticed any change in our allergy symptoms.On the other hand, we don't have serious pet dander allergies. This might truly be a miracle product for someone who loves dogs but can't handle pet dander.

"Have you started to get ready the morning after a late night and faced bruise-like under-eye circles. In order to avoid scaring people, you reach for the concealer. But perhaps you used a liquid concealer and found that you had to build up layers, work around fine lines, and still go back with a swab to correct your work and try to get a convincingly refreshed look. Or you've gone with a powder and spent far too long dabbing away at the circles, stuck between dark shadows and a powdery look?This Concealer Kit has a thick, silky cream with natural-looking full coverage. Compared with liquids and powders, it provides better coverage with much less effort. It's light, though, so once you've made your corrections, you won't feel it.The special sponge applicator has a handle, so it's comfortable and gives greater precision.

"These are predictably well-made, with a metal zipper, traditional jeans-style construction, and a fabric that is both soft and tough. The fabric has a good deal of stretch and a soft, almost brushed feel. It's lighter weight than denim, and the construction of these pants means that you can have blue jean comfort with a traditional trouser look -- in fact, you can probably get away with these in a ""no jeans"" office. They'll be great for travel, too, since you can climb and hike in them all day (or stay comfortable in them while you're stuck in a car all day if it's that kind of trip) and still go out to dinner in them.The ""relaxed it"" for me means that I should have ordered a smaller size, but I'm more apple than pear.

"This is a fascinating and thought-provoking book for people interested in technology, business, economics, and current events.The book starts with a discussion of four global forces that are leading to change -- and they might include some surprises for you. I wouldn't have guessed all of these:1. Global urbanization leads to a change in the economic center of the world.2. The pace of technological change is still accelerating.3. The global population is aging.4. Globalization is unstoppable.The second section of the book looks at ways that businesses must make ""intuition resets"" in terms of customers, resources, capital, workers, and competitors. This is followed by an intriguing chapter on policy issues, from income inequality to tech standards to the optimum size of government for the future.The last quarter of the book is notes and recommended resources.All through, the book is well-written, practical yet challenging, and business-minded.

"This is a traditional English black tea in a traditional tea bag with a string. The flavor is rich and smooth, with no bitterness even if you make a really strong cup.From the scent when you open the box to the last sip in the cup, it's clear that Yorkshire tea relies on quality tea, with no dyes or flavorings. This is what tea is supposed to taste like.It's also good to know that the company is Rainforest Alliance certified and working with tea growers to develop and maintain ethical, sustainable trade relationships. They're working to reforest a rainforest area the size of Yorkshire. I figure that means we can drink this tea with confidence that we're not making a trade-off.

"Kristina Hancock's father is a mystery writer, so when her best friend Vicki and she go into business together, it seems natural to name the bookstore/ coffee shop they open ""Death by Coffee.""When one of their first patrons dies shortly after drinking a cup of Death by Coffee's special coffee, the name seems like a bad idea. Vicki and Krissy are both single girls, each living with a cat (I could have used less information about Krissy's cat's digestive system). It's a complete mystery what Vicky does with her free time, but Krissy throws herself into an investigation of her customer's death.In the course of her investigation -- which is largely a matter of asking complete strangers very private questions -- Krissy meets and becomes infatuated with a policeman. She also worries a lot about her business, which seems to be on the verge of failure after one week.There are quirky and likable characters in the book, but there's a real problem with plausibility. No convincing reason is ever offered for Krissy's incredible persistence in grilling perfect strangers about their sex lives when she should be at work.She's not convincing as a business owner, either. She and Vicky do a lot of fretting over their business, but no marketing, and they clean tables repeatedly while lamenting their lack of customers, instead of restocking or baking more cookies or working on social media.I like Vicky and Krissy and I'd like to know more about the interesting people in the town, but I couldn't get past the lack of realism.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O1HJI6KMUJJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617737518#wasThisHelpful","R2O1HJI6KMUJJ9","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a wonderful book, filled with intriguing details about shirts. Did you know that shirts used to be underwear, and that in those days the Duke of Windsor wore a sort of all-in-one bodysuit under his evening suits? On a more practical note, you might want to know just where a ducal crest should be embroidered on a shirt, or just how to get the fit you like in a polar exploration jacket.The universe of shirts, as the author puts it, is divided in this book into five basic types, or blocks: dress, sport, knit, folk, and shirt-jacket. Each block has a chapter showing lots of example and details, and discussing how to change one detail for another. Better yet, you will find explanations of how to draft the collars, cuffs, pockets, and plackets that will make those differences, and access to online patterns you can print out for many.This means that you can, if you have a well-fiting shirt pattern for each of those blocks, make yourself a Cuban Guayabera or a camp shirt or a perfect vintage Turnbull & Asser shirt or a traditional peasant smock. It also means that you will know not only how to draft and use the pattern, but the very specific details of construction that will make your shirt authentic and super snazzy.This is first and foremost a design book, sharing the details of shirts from many times and places, for both men and women. You can enjoy this book for no other reason than, as the author says of one of the resources he recommends, ""information and inspiration.""You'll also learn enough about shirt construction to be a very good shirt shopper, a money-saving skill.For a home sewer, there is a lot to savor. This is not a book on how to make shirts; the author has already written that book and I plan to order it. This book is about fully understanding the details of a shirt. For many home sewers, that understanding will be enough to solve frustrations with collars or cuffs. It can also help with choosing the right patterns, or with using a collar from one pattern on another pattern.There are lots of additional resources listed, too, from books to blogs and notions to tutorials. What's more, you will get access with this book to online content -- enough that it's like getting a second book free.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLNMA7AUB28TS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589238265#wasThisHelpful","RLNMA7AUB28TS","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In fact, they're traditionally used in soups. I tried a lot of different recipes, but for me the perfect use is in salads and vegetable dishes. Delicious!

"Whether you yearn for foreign travel and can't fit it in or you want to jazz up your American road trips, Abroad at Home will help you find the perfect place to visit for foreign flavor in American towns. This is a book from National Geographic, so of course it is filled with gorgeous photos and evocative descriptions of exciting destinations. Beyond that expected quality, I was also impressed by the way the book is organized.There are six chapters: five regions in the U.S. plus Canada. For each region, there is a nice mix of small towns with special features, like Sacred Harp singing in Henagar, Alabama, and ""Around the World"" adventures in larger cities like Chicago and San Francisco. Each chapter has a two-page photographic spread saying, ""You could be in..."" another country when you enjoy the scenery (urban or rural) of a particular location. There are also ""Insights"" on special topics such as cocktails or murals, spotlights on the best of class from pierogis to meditation centers, and lots of lists for folks who want to hit all the creameries or some other specialized passion.Each location has specific sections, for efficient info-gathering:* introduction* What to See with a list of cool stuff* Joining In for events* Essentials with addresses, web addresses, and phone numbersThere is an index by heritage for those who want to tour the country with a German or Chinese focus, and a good general index as well. You'll also find online references so you can dig deeper into the things that you find most fascinating.Read the book through -- you will learn things you didn't know before and enjoy it. Then you might want to just store it in your car or your travel bag. When you find with an hour to kill between meetings in St. Paul, you'll know that a trip to Frogtown is in order. This would also be a nice gift for friends who enjoy road trips.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU84J9X0D3EVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426214995#wasThisHelpful","RU84J9X0D3EVQ","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the traditional ""brown sauce"" you know from Chinese restaurants: a bit sweet, a bit tangy, a bit spicy. Cut chicken or meat and vegetables and cook in a wok or skillet, add some of this sauce, and you have a nice stir-fry dish. Used in the recommended amount, 2 T per serving, the sauce is not cloying or too thick.This also makes a nice glaze for grilled meats. The product website recommends it for salad dressings and soups as well. It contains no fat, though it does have sugar, plus soy and wheat in small quantities. For me, having a jug of this sauce in the fridge means that I can make a tasty meal with lean meat and vegetables on a busy day instead of being rushed into carryout, so it definitely comes down on the healthy side.Personally, I add a little more chili pepper, but try it first. It contains ginger and garlic and a little hot pepper, so it might be spicy enough for you as-is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SOE01SCCQ2OZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CFO8JE#wasThisHelpful","R1SOE01SCCQ2OZ","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm glad I got this book as an audiobook. If I had bought the physical book, I think I would have skimmed through it, thinking that I knew all the information already.Knowing what you should do doesn't make you do it.Listening to Hardy's enthusiastic delivery of common sense information on my way to and from business meetings where I could put the advice into action really made a difference. The central point of the book is that it isn't the bold goal setting or th occasional bold step that lead to success. It's the daily small changes and steps toward our goals that actually get us there And it's the daily bad decisions that move us further away from our goals.If you know that but you're not doing it, listening to this book might make the difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EYWSUJNW9NFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0981951252#wasThisHelpful","R3EYWSUJNW9NFH","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book for beginners... but aren't we all beginners at something? For example, I have never used self-striping yarn and hadn't planned to, but now I see its charm.I wouldn't have thought of including self-striping yarn in a book on colorwork, but I am glad that this author did. She compares it with knitting stripes in what I would have thought of as the usual way, and uses this section of the book to bring the new knitter into the wonders of colorwork.. There are great stripey socks and a beret, but also a pair of gloves, which use the self-striping yarn to create a completely different effect, and a really interesting sweater with an unusual construction.The section on self-striping yarn is followed by knitting stripes, and this section includes both vertical and horizontal stripes, plus combinations of striping and texture.Next comes a section with slip stitch patterns. I absolutely agree with the author that this kind of knitting is not as well known as it should be. It's the easiest way to get complex color patterns into your knitting. While the author sticks with simple ones, once you've tried a couple of these patterns, you'll be ready for the most complex slip stitch patterns. I'm knitting the Boxy Socks from this section, and finding the pattern very clear and accurately written.Each chapter builds on the previous one, so we now come to stranded knitting, the point where I would have expected to start. The patterns here are unintimidating but still very snazzy: socks patterned with tiny hearts, a sweater with a yoke composed of gradually growing geometric patterns, a cowl with traditional folk knitting designs, and a bold pair of checkerboard mittens.Intarsia finishes up the techniques, and again the patterns are accessible and fun. A hat with a simple argyle-style pattern is now on my list to knit for my son, and there are also bright polka dot socks and a scarf with giant stars.Each section contains projects that build from small and easy accessories to a sweater. There are also plenty of technical tips and explanation, with large photos showing specific actions to take while knitting. Each section has a list of pros and cons for its particular technique, so that you could decide which technique to try first based on how you feel about weaving in ends or using charts.There are suggestions for ways to customize the designs, and friendly storytelling along the way. The patterns are generally given in traditional knitting but there are quick explanations when they're needed. There's also a thoroughly illustrated (with photos) technical section at the back  -- but it doesn't take up a third of the book, which can be frustrating for experienced knitters.There's also a handy grid showing all the projects at the back. There are 25 different projects and they're all bold, bright, and quirky. Most are in fairly large gauges, too.  If you glance at the pictures on the cover, you might feel that these patterns are all for teens, and this certainly would be a great choice if you're a young knitter or knitting for one. However, there's more to the designs than meets the eye.You'll find classic socks with several different heel options, and a useful page on getting the sizes right. There are sweaters in sizes from 32""  to 46"", though not every sweater is given in every size, and they are interesting and unusual sweaters. There's a wide variety of scarves and handwear, plus hats in several different classic shapes. These are classic, flexible patterns with options. My Boxy Socks, in stockinette stitch with fine teal and gray wool,  are turning out subdued and elegant, and you can make up these patterns in your own way.The perfect way to use this book might be as a self-study course from start to finish, making every project from the bulky scarf to the vest with giant flower designs and ending up a confident colorwork knitter and ready to take on Fair Isle or argyle patterns. However, this is also a great choice for gift knitting and it probably has all the colorful sock, hat, and glove/mitt/mitten patterns you'll need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E76WM2REQWS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811714144#wasThisHelpful","R1E76WM2REQWS9","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has step by step instructions for make up and hairstyles from the '40s as well as for those who want to shop for vintage clothing or reproductions. If you want a '40s style for a play or a party or just for fun, this book will help you recreate the look. There are plenty of photos and I enjoyed seeing both the 1940s shots of the author's relatives and the retro style makeovers of modern women.But the part I enjoyed most was the history of wartime fashion. More than the fashions themselves, the books focuses on the lives of women in the U.S. and Europe, how they managed to dress stylishly in spite of the strictures on their shopping, and what their governments had to say about it. From the propaganda that tried to guide the clothing choices of women in Nazi Germany to the contrast between the rationing and austerity schemes in England and among the chic mademoiselles of Paris, there is just enough historical detail. You'll end up understanding how history influenced clothing design, without getting bogged down.Lingerie, swimsuits, hats, jewelry, and shoes are all included. There is a lengthy section at the back of the book with resources, including blogs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E27U431H0TVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9LU4YU#wasThisHelpful","R3E27U431H0TVE","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Google Analytics is the gold standard for web analytics, and arguably the best source of data on website performance.This book is not for people who are new to analytics, but it begins with an excellent discussion of how -- and why -- to start with business goals, build key performance indicators, and plan how to collect and analyze data, as well as some thoughts about testing and getting buy-in from others in your organization. This plan is much better than merely poking around in your analytics and responding to the up and down arrows.The first chapter has a number of other useful discussions on matters like tagging traffic, setting up your interface, and implementing tracking code. None of this is extensive, but it's enough for people who are fairly comfortable with Google Analytics and able to Google up the details.The main part of the book tells yo how to integrate Google Analytics code with other things. It takes you through the official integrations, including Adwords, AdSense, mobile apps, Webmaster Tools, and YouTube. While all this information is available online, there is a lot to be said for having step by step instructions right in front of you as you work. The instructions are thorough and written in a generally non-technical manner, though you do need to be familiar with cncepts like destination URLs, paid search, etc.Having covered the integrations which are available in Google Analytics, the book goes on to discuss how to do custom data integration. This section frequently refers readers to Google's own documentation, and you shouldn't expect to be able to follow the instructions if you don't know HTML. However, this is again more detailed and accessible than what you'll find in Google's instructions, which are directed to professional developers.This is entirely a how-to book, not a book to enjoy reading on your porch. If you've had some frustrations with GA integrations, or wished you could do them yourself but didn't want to take a chance, this is exactly the book you need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GTRSXBECH5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119053064#wasThisHelpful","R17GTRSXBECH5K","A14638TGYH7GD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14638TGYH7GD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I have minimal cake decorating skills and had never used fondant before trying this brand. However, I can tell you that it is very easy to work with. It rolls out very smoothly and can be rolled very thin and I had no trouble with cracking, breaking, tearing, or uneven texture.This fondant is white, but you can color it by putting some in a plastic bag with food color and kneading it. I tried using fruit juice, too, but that was not successful.This fondant is also excellent for modeling: very malleable and it stays smooth without cracking. Check out Pinterest for lots of fun ideas.Fondant is mostly about looks, not taste, but this one tastes mild and sweet, with no chemical overtones.Can a rank beginner make a gorgeous wedding cake with this product at the first attempt? No. Get yourself an extra package to practice with.

"Andrew Peterson delivers another winner with Contract to Kill.  It begins with a prologue in which the antagonist, Tanner Mason - a private military contractor, is conducting a raid against a Taliban insurgent who’s responsible for countless IED and RPG attacks against coalition forces. Even though the scene was masterfully written, I was a little worried the entire book was going to have a military theme.It didn’t.It immediately switches to modern day and Peterson keeps his foot on the gas pedal, and never lets up. Some familiar characters from First to Kill make appearances and I like they way he’s incorporated them into the story. Nothing is forced.Nathan McBride answers the call to help a friend and from there on, it’s a non stop thrill ride from scene to scene. I loved how the tension built as Nathan and Tanner Mason, both capable and tough, find themselves on a collision course. Coupled with twists and turns, the plot is loaded with high quality action. Again, nothing is forced. It just flows! It’s the exact kind of book I love to read. Honestly, it was hard to put this book and down and get some sleep.My hat’s off to Andrew Peterson, Contract to Kill is his best book yet.

"""Dixie's Last Stand"" is a well-written, and gripping depiction of 'battered wife syndrome'. Scott Shanahan was a vile man that no one liked. He abused his wife Dixie for 19 years (many women will stay and sustain the beatings, and there's many reasons for that, some of which are included in this book). Dixie was dragged by her hair; had guns pointed at her in rage, beaten black and blue, tied up and left for days in the basement, and basically lived a life of hell....until one day she killed her tormentor, batterer, her husband.This fascinating story will leave you asking yourself one question, was the punishment that Dixie received in her case justified?

Vronsky takes an interesting in depth perspective into the case files of what makes women commit these hedious crimes, and why people like Karla Homolka would submit to aiding her husband in rape and murder. Notoriously, Serial Homicide has been attributed to men, but in fact,  1 in 6 SK's is female.As I read through the pages, I was happily met with intelligence, sound facts, and a contemporary stylish prose to pull it all together.

"THE M5 MAGNUM 5 BLADE RAZOR WITH TRIMMER is by far the best razor I've come across. I am over 50 and have been shaving my head bald every day for the past 8 years. I've used so many different razors, including electric razors (which I haven't come close to one yet that gives a closer shave than the M5) until I discovered this razor about a year ago. Countless times I've nicked myself and I'm happy to say that using this razor, I've nicked myself only twice. Both times were my own fault as I should have replaced the blade.That's the other thing, I can get two weeks, head and face shaving out of one razor blade. It's really remarkable especially for the price. I highly recommend it to those who shave their heads.This however is my only my opinion.

"LET THE DEAD SLEEP by Heather Graham is another well-written, captivating story with some likeable and not so likeable characters. The suspense and plot was well crafted. I don't write long winded reviews because mainly I don't like reading them.In a nutshell, Danni, who owns an antique store, is about to purchase a rare statue that is plagued with evil and death. But before she can buy it, the owner is murdered and the statue is gone missing. Enter Michael Quinn, and private investigator who with Danni, is on a search and destroy mission: to find and once and for all, destroy this evil statue.This is fast-paced with lots of suspense and mystery.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12GQJYPQWMXO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ALTVI6K#wasThisHelpful","R12GQJYPQWMXO8","A2ZJPSX9FA2KJZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJPSX9FA2KJZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"WOMEN SERIAL KILLERS OF THE 19TH CENTURY was indeed the golden age of poisons. I find it hard to wrap my head around the fact that there were so many Women Serial Killers in the 1800's. It was almost like an epidemic of female poisoners. Today, a female serial killer is rarely heard of.The author obviously invested a great deal of time researching this information and it reads like a history book....it is a history book, and a must have for the real true crime book collector.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D76BQIAPHA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BK9QY2S#wasThisHelpful","R3D76BQIAPHA6","A2ZJPSX9FA2KJZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJPSX9FA2KJZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LYKAIA (THE SOPHIA KATSAROS SERIES) is Sharon Van Orman's debut book in what is going to be a great series. I understand from her website that the second book, ERATO, will be launched either this month or April.This is a well-written story that is intriguing and hooks the reader from the start.Sophie, a Medical Examiner, travels to Greece as both her brothers have gone missing there. Her nor her mom haven't heard from the boys in several weeks. Upon arriving in Greece, she discovers that her brothers had become fascinated with unravelling their roots and during this time, they learned tales of Kings, Priests and Werewolves. After searching their apartment and discovering their obsession with folklore, she now believes it's possible that her brothers have been transformed into wolves during a ritualistic ceremony that takes place every nine years.Get ready for a mystical ride of suspense, mystery, fantasy, mythology, horror and magic. I look forward to reading more from this author who by the way has a very creative mind, as it shows in her characters and plot.#1 Bestselling Author & Top Amazon & Goodreads ReviewerRJ Parker","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N73G4I34KMZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094GCQFS#wasThisHelpful","R3N73G4I34KMZC","A2ZJPSX9FA2KJZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJPSX9FA2KJZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A well-written suspense book with more twists and turns than I've ever read in another book before. Two guys have planned to rob this bank for almost a year. Everything is going according to plan until they realize there is someone else in the bank, and in particular, in the ceiling fixing the AC. This book also has some humor in it. One minute the robbers are robbers, next minute they are hostages. This 'taking over' happens a couple of times. The ending was a huge surprise, I never saw that coming. All in all, a good read. I found that when the author was going back to where the robbers met, it was kinda boring and I flipped a few pages. Good read, captivating and enjoyable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WYMZHDKV0MJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SPCD8M#wasThisHelpful","R1WYMZHDKV0MJB","A2ZJPSX9FA2KJZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJPSX9FA2KJZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LEFT FOR DEAD is a well-written true story of a young woman who was abused. Not only abused, which unfortunately is common today, but beaten beyond recognition and stuffed inside a garbage can to die. I found myself getting angry at her ex-husband and would love to have a few minutes alone with him. But life in prison for him I'm sure won't be pleasant.After three years of marriage and two daughters, this brave woman had enough of the abuse and got out. She started to get her life back together and had recently re-married. She went to pick up her daughters at her ex-husbands place and he said the daughters were hiding so to come in a find them. After entering, he beat her numerous times over the head with a baseball bat. Taped her up, gagged her, and put her in a garbage bin in the back of his pickup and brought her to a storage unit. There he placed many boxes on top of the garbage bin, sealed the door and left.Without given the story away, when Jendusa was found, she was unrecognizable, lost all her toes due to frost bite, underwent surgeries, five weeks in hospital and miscarried. She had only found out the day before that she was pregnant.It's a sad gripping story but with a happy ending.Bestselling true crime author, RJ Parker","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31EB7JISBEJ09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625104944#wasThisHelpful","R31EB7JISBEJ09","A2ZJPSX9FA2KJZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJPSX9FA2KJZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"APPOINTMENT TO DIE I have a few things to say about. The story, as in the plot, is fantastic. Jake is in prison on death row and scheduled for lethal injection in the coming weeks. His brother Pete devises a plan to hold a classroom of 7 year old children hostage, along with their young teacher Alison. He's rigged with explosives and threatens to start killing the kids one at a time unless the Governor of Texas pardons his brother Jake and flies him to the school in a helicopter.A task force is brought in: negotiator, FBI agents, SWAT and the National Guard. There are some real tense moments that were gripping. The story moves along quite well and I was impressed. I liked it a lot. However, the book is also packed with typos. It was distracting at times as I had to re-read paragraphs and sentences over several times. I wasn't happy with the ending at all and I don't know what happened with the writing, but the last 10 pages are messed up. Paragraphs duplicated and several words typed twice together...several times. The typos I really don't have a big problem with, but the author needs to fix the last 10 pages.I have never given below a 4 star review and I won't this time either. This can be a 5 star book it really is that good. Fix the typos and it will be. As for the story, it was well thought out and captivating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AO4246Y38Q4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BT8QQAU#wasThisHelpful","R2AO4246Y38Q4V","A2ZJPSX9FA2KJZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZJPSX9FA2KJZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great fit and surprisingly strong anchors! I had some concerns and posted a question in the ""Customer Questions"" section. Within a day, I had three answers from guys who own these. One even sent a picture link of his install. VERY helpful.My new '14 Silverado has LineX spray-in bedliner. I was concerned about clearance with these anchors. I had to cut out the LineX around the plastic inserts..and then pried them out with a screwdriver. I unscrewed the bullet anchor as far as I could and put them in. You have to center the anchors on the oval opening/perforations on the sidewall of the bed to make a solid fit. Once I figured out that small detail...no problem at all. They look good, and appear to be stronger then other anchors.My old truck had those large eyelet type anchors you can buy anywhere (like wallyworld). They are cheap, and work decent, but these Chevy bullet anchors are stronger, pop in and out, and seem to match the aesthetics of the bed better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VPW8QQA2RUK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H86T4AQ#wasThisHelpful","R2VPW8QQA2RUK7","A3QDPQBJAJC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QDPQBJAJC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Had to tie a string on the lid to make it hang level- Power cord needs to be at least two-three feet instead of 10 inches long- Dunno reliability yet or cost of bulbs.- Can get messy underneath because it kills so many bugs (not really a ""CON"" but may be a pita for some)OVERALL:- Great purchase and it works well at killing bugs.

"I have this mounted in the center console of my 2011 Chevy Silverado. It is hidden away and I use it when I get onto the highways here in Oklahoma and trips out east (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana).

"Done messing with Whistler. Check out my set up in the Customer Images section above. Installation went well. I had to mount it vertically because of space limitations.INITIAL THOUGHTS:- It is big, heavy, and built strong- Amazon 2-day shipping is great. Double boxed. No issues.- Binding posts are larger and use a standard 1/2"" nut...nice!- Very small chassis grounding post- No cables, but no biggie. I am using 0-gauge to my six-pack battery bank- Inverter turned right on after install.- Running two fridges simultaneously w/o any issues- Measured VAC output (with my true RMS Fluke meter) at 125v. The Whistler only had 115v.- No USB portOVERALL- Initial run up looks very promising. I will put some heavy loads on it later on and in a few months update this review.UPDATE (28 June 2014)- Well, one month+ in and this inverter still performs perfectly 24/7. I have run it up to 2KW and it ran strong...not even a hiccup/fart/burp. The single cooling fan only comes on occasionally. Inside my Oklahoma garage...it is getting up near 95-99 deg...but it doesn't seem to phase this inverter. One note: when the solar charge controller has charged my battery bank and the voltage gets above 13.8vDC, the inverter will hum and buzz a little more (nothing wrong with it tho). Neighbors and friends who come over are impressed. In fact, I bought a 100' heavy duty extension cord to run power to my neighbors house in case we lose power. Gosh I'm a nice guy. Grounded this unit NOT using the little grounding lug terminal...used the inverter's (neg) binding post straight to my sunken ground rod...SCC, inverter, batteries, are now all looped to true negative ground (works really well). It does produce a little RFI I can hear over my CB base station.UPDATE (20 Oct 2014)- Still running perfectly! When the battery bank is at full charge and in ""float"" mode (around 14.5v DC), this inverter will buzz a little bit when there is a load. Not an issue...all inverters do this. At night (no solar charging going on) the voltage goes down to 12.3-12.6v DC and there is no buzz when the fridges kick on. Again, no concern at all. This inverter is an absolute beast! Still produces RFI on some CB channels on my base station. On Channel 19 (truckers channel) it is okay...minimal or no interference. Other channels get completely washed out from this inverter. Turn this inverter off (and the solar charge controller) and my CB base station is crystal clear. Counteracting the RFI is too hit or miss and requires a PhD in electrical engineering to figure out.UPDATE (13 Nov 2014)- Been running 24/7 since May (almost 7 months). No problems whatsoever. Great inverter! Really great!UPDATE (22 FEB 2015)- Okay...nothing wrong with the inverter...still running strong. However, I have been looking at rewiring my battery bank to 24v. So, this inverter won't work. Reason why: my solar charging station will run more efficient with a 24v system. The max wattage I have ever pushed through the Power Bright is under 1800 watts. So, going with a 24v inverter (pure sine wave this time). Looking at a 2,000 watt unit from Go Power (GP-SW2000-24). It will fit on my panel. The 3,000 watt unit is about $1,000 whereas the 2,000 watt one is around $750. Not cheap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G2EODBH2PPSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NHS9R6#wasThisHelpful","R2G2EODBH2PPSX","A3QDPQBJAJC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QDPQBJAJC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS- Fast delivery- 115 VAC ouput (use a true RMS meter to read modified sine waves)- Looks nice- Amazon return policyCONS- Fans are terrible. I have had three Whistler inverters (1200, 2000, and this one). All of them have a terrible ""clicking"" sound right at the threshold of the thermostatically controlled (PWM?) fans would kick on. My 2000 watt unit's fans went completely out. I was out of my 30 day return window. So, I sent it to Whistler and pitched a fit. The tech support guy even said the fans are not that good and suggested buying some fans and putting them in myself! WTF? It's under warranty! This 3000 watt inverter is better then the 2000, but the fans started acting up earlier. So, I returned it for a full refund and went with a Power Bright PW3500-12. If my 2000 watt inverter ever comes back from Whistler (and is repaired with correct fans) I will use it as a back up to the Power Bright.- You can get a better return policy (90 day) at local home improvement storesCONCLUSION- Expect it to work initially, and work well. Make sure you use at least 0-gauge battery cables with very short length. These are inexpensive inverters at a great price, but the fans on these things will fail. They will chatter, click, hum, and do weird things right at turning on. PWM fans are the same as on many desktop computers and they last for years. Not sure what are in these...but they fail.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38IOY3LIFXS1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003R7EGA8#wasThisHelpful","R38IOY3LIFXS1V","A3QDPQBJAJC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QDPQBJAJC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"7 May 2014 - Got this really fast (Prime). My old Phillips 2GB MP3 player served a tough life (multiple military deployments, gym time, sauna, dropped, thrown around, etc-etc). May it rest in peace.PROS:- Smaller then expected- microSD slot (recommend a 32GB microSD card and put all your music on it...that way you can transfer by just taking it out)- Recorder- Sound is much better then expected (using it as a static player for my old stereo receiver/speakers- Power plug input same as my old Phillips...so, no need to buy another AC plug- Owners manual says 16GB max on microSD slot...installed 32GB w/o any problem. 36GB total is A LOT OF SONGS!- Fast power on/off- $30NOT SO GOOD:- The clip is not removable...you would have to break/saw it off to remove it- The display is much smaller then the Phillips...really have to peer at it to see anything- Comes with micro CD to download crap I don't need...you don't need it at all- No video album display like my Phillips...don't really miss that tho.- No AC adapter for USB cable (additionally, the cable is also WAY too short...like 4"")OVERALL: Pretty impressive little player.

I will get a couple more for additional projects.UPDATE: Burned through two of these due to overheating (only thing I can think of that would cause a failure). At $12 per meter...gonna have to look into something that will last longer than a few months. They also don't like being turned on and turned off...shorten the lifespan.

"I bought this as a combo with the solar charge controller.PROS- Very useful for monitoring solar panel voltage- Reads battery bank voltage and current pushing down to them- Has many other features that I don't use, but may in the future- Lighted, green. Bright green light comes on when it is in charge mode- Lets you know what your solar charge controller is doing and when the panels come to life- Mounting frame has a slit for the cable so that it doesn't pinch it- CE rating (Similar to UL listings)CONS- Slow(ish) response time, but fast enough for most people- Display glare is really really lousy and is hard to see sometimes- No mounting screwsCONCLUSION- A must buy match for Tracer solar charge controllers...glad I got it.- I added two bright inline LED meters on my system with faster response time and ease of reading.

"I bought this wax based on the high reviews and write ups. I wasn't disappointed at all! I bought the wax to apply it to the polished table of my table saw. The previous wax I used didn't have much of a life at all and if a bead of sweat landed on the saw table it would soon start to rust if I wasn't careful. Also the wood was sticking to the table and it was making my cuts inaccurate. I cleaned and polished the table immediately prior to applying this wax, so I could get rid of some sap and a few small spots that were starting to surface rust. I only waxed 1/4 of the table at a time before I buffed it off so I didn't let it dry like so many reviews warn you about. The first coat went on very easily and you could tell that the metal seemed to soak the wax up. I would do an initial buffing with denim rags to get the majority of the excess wax off before I did a final buff with Extra-Thick Large Cotton Buffing Ball - Hex Shank - Turn Power Drill into High-Speed Polisher. Getting most of the excess wax off made the buffing ball last longer between cleanings. I kept comparing the surface after waxing to surfaces that hadn't been waxed yet and I was amazed at the difference in how slick this wax is! The subsequent coats went on even more easily. I noticed that the extra coats seemed to spread the wax even thinner and more evenly than the very first coat. Again I used the same buffing method. Ultimately I put 4 coats of wax on my table saw. I found a drop of sweat on the table and it beaded up as it should have, and continued to bead when I cleaned it up and the rag didn't soak it all up on the first wipe. I also used this wax on the table guide and the channels in the table. It made a huge difference in the appearance and lubrication!Afterwards I used the saw to cut some of the wood for a project I'm working on. I wasn't careful at first and a block of wood slid across the table and onto the floor on the opposite side. I've never had that happen before with any wood! Cross cuts are a breeze on the saw and the wood isn't dragging or sticking to the table. I'm going to try applying this to my japanese and western handsaws next to see if it helps with binding and saw removal.Pros:Easy to work withExcellent slick finish after buffingLittle goes a long wayVery little odorVersatileEasy open/close lidCons:Pricey, but worth itDoesn't wash out of rags or clothes easily","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMUZVRR2NU0XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AZOLZO#wasThisHelpful","RMUZVRR2NU0XO","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the second time that I have purchased a quart of Crystalac Wood Grain Filler. I have been experimenting on a book shelf made of red oak. The bookshelf itself is floor to ceiling at the end of a hallway and I started with rough planks of red oak. This is a water based product and is slightly thinner than syrup. I found it helpful to use a putty knife almost like a spoon and then let it drain onto the wood. After that I used a rubber squeegee to spread the filler diagonally across the grain. I tried letting it pool into some of the wood flaws to see if it would act as a wood putty. I tried staining the wood before and after using the wood filler. Lastly I also tried to see what it was like if I left lumps of wood filler on the wood.Here are my findings:1. Stain your wood before applying this product.2. Make sure you smooth the wood fill out as much as possible with each coat.3. SEVERAL thin coats are better than trying to glop it on thickly.4. It shrinks and will not act as wood putty for large flaws or knots.5. It is sandable, but it is harder than wood and will take longer to smooth out the bumps.6. I found that it worked best with the oak to sand and stain before applying the wood grain filler then doing the fine sanding and stain again.7. This dries very thinly so you will use a lot of it for larger projects. I used a quart on the bookshelf, and I should have put on another coat or two.8. It dries slowly so you have plenty of time to work it into the grain.Pros:Dries slowly so you have plenty of time to work it into the grainEasy to work withWater basedClear dryingFlows into the wood grainDries thin so you can add a little at a timeConsDries thin so you will use a lot of itHarder than the wood so if you leave ridges, they will take longer to sand downYou need 24-48 hours between coats if you live in a humid areaUpdate 9 April 2015: The second batch I bought has the consistency of thin jelly. It dries fairly quickly and is easier to work with than my first batch which was much waterier. I used sharp chisels to remove any dried clumps before sanding. I ultimately used 400 grit sandpaper and the red oak felt like glass afterwards. I'm not sure if the first batch or the second batch I bought is the way this is supposed to be, but they both work well and are easy to use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TE7UHCR97ZJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IBFEO6#wasThisHelpful","R3TE7UHCR97ZJ9","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After that it only took me 3 patches before I was using clean dry patches to remove the residual cleaner. The dry patches were coming out wrinkled but just as clean as they went in.I used Tetra Gun Copper Solvent on an M1 Garand that I purchased at auction but hadn't shot yet and a M1903 that I hadn't cleaned or shot since buying it. The patches came out black with copper and carbon fowling on the very first swabs after soaking the bores for 5-10 minutes then using a phosphor bronze brush. The M1 Garand had a rough life before I purchased it and a lot of the patches came out green with copper before I was finally able to get it clean.Tetra Gun Copper Solvent has a yellowish tint to it and you can dispense drops of it straight from the bottle. It's also very thick like molasses. It doesn't take much to get the barrel soaked and to start working.Pros:Thick and yellowish tinge so you can see it and work with it easily to keep it off the stock and your clothes.Works quickly.Bottle can dispense drops or a steady flow.Smell doesn't spread throughout the room like other gun cleaners.Very strong.Cons:Very strong, protect your gun's finish and your clothes. Wear gloves.Smells Horrid. It has that burning amonia smell to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ9C132S4WT5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001YY3DA#wasThisHelpful","RZ9C132S4WT5H","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cleaned several guns over the weekend to test Breakthrough Military Grade Firearm Cleaning Solvent - 2oz Spray Bottle, M-Pro 7 Gun Cleaner, 8-Ounce Spray Bottle, Tetra Gun Copper Solvent, 8-Ounce, and FireClean Fouling-Resistant Oil 2 Ounce FC-2 against Hoppe's No. 9 Gun Bore Cleaning Solvent, 5-Ounce Bottle.

"Don't get me wrong, this is a great little tripod. I bought it for the outdoor rifle ranges in my area. I mounted a Leupold Ventana SX-1 on it and I could clearly see the targets at 100 yards but the tripod and the scope were very susceptible to shake. I had to keep my hands off the tables and scope to minimize the shake. However, the tripod still let the scope shake in a good stiff breeze.The tripod folds up nicely and the weight is awesome! I think the suction cup will help with the shaking if you are using the tripod on a surface that will allow the suction cup to work.The controls and locks on the tripod work well and intuitively. Once set and locked, there was no drift with the scope and everyone on the range could come up to take a look at the exact same thing without having to constantly reset the tripod and scope.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the shaking in the wind with a top heavy spotting scope.Pros:CompactLightweightIntuitive controlsHigh quality manufacture and materialsGood locksGreat quality for the pricePan and tilt handle is the perfect sizeCons:Allows big top heavy loads to shake in the wind.You can't touch it while examining something with a top heavy tool.

"My silver dot case arrived today. The box it was shipped in looked fine, but when I checked the case out, the end was broken and caving in at one corner. Now I have to request a refund because amazon can't replace this case. I have to ship it back, via UPS. The return isn't costing me anything other than time and gas to take the package back.The walls of the case are hard plastic and are much like non skid. It isn't a smooth skin and will be a real bear to clean if it gets dirty and you decide to try and clean it. The case itself has the small built in locks on the latches and a loop on each end for padlocks. This case is supposed to meet airline requirements and it probably does, but I don't think it would hold up to the baggage handlers.There are 3 layers of foam inside the case. 2 layers of the egg crate style foam and a third flat layer with lots of slots cut into it. I don't know why all the slots are cut there isn't anything to slide through the foam or an anchoring system. The wheels on the broken end seemed fine. The latches were a little unusual and would take some getting used to, they won't flip open as much as most others I've seen. The loops for the padlocks are pretty thin and felt sturdy on initial inspection. However, if they caught my eye that quickly, they probably won't hold up. The handles feel and look sturdy. There is one on the side and one on the end. The case itself was big enough for two scoped rifles and long enough for a goose gun or a Mosin-Nagant.I really had high hopes for this case but it just wasn't meant to be and now I have to find something different.

"I am comparing these parallel rulers to ones I've used in the past in middle school and high school shop classes and in the US Navy for navigation and moboards.They are clear and without any graduation markings on them. The edges are smooth and will give you a straight line on your charts or for any other time you use them for parallel lines. The hinges on them are snug and there wasn't any play in them unless you force it. The non stick pads are perfect and will allow you to easily walk the parallel rulers across your charts, drawings, or table saws. These are 18 inches so they might be a bit big for small charts or confined spaces. However, I use them for wood working to ensure that the saw blade and the rip fence are truly parallel. For that I needed a large surface area for more accuracy. They are clear and without flaws or scratches to impede your vision through them so that you can read your charts or watch out for obstructions that might impede your ability to walk them across a table or chart. The handles on them are standardized, free of burs, and comfortable to hold. The verticle grooves on the handles allow you to maintain a solid grip on them without straining your hand to hold them tighter.I've been searching for parallel rulers for years without finding them. I should have thought to look on Amazon in the first place.These parallel rulers meet the exacting standards for professionals and anyone who has to use them for navigation, but they are also priced right for hobbyists. So far, I really haven't seen any down side to these parallel rulers, they meet my needs perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25SUDU70KI98Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRY1GAA#wasThisHelpful","R25SUDU70KI98Q","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like the saying goes, you get what you pay for. I was looking for an economy rifle case that would fit my Mosin-Nagant. It fits with a couple inches to spare. The case seems well made and I didn't see any issues with the stitching, wrap around handles, or the zipper. It's well made for the price I paid. I certainly won't put anything else in the case with the rifle since there is no way to prevent everything from bumping or scratching the rifle or other items. It won't fit a scoped rifle either, but that wasn't what I needed.

"I have a 2004 Jeep Liberty that I'm using my dashcam on. The first night I hooked the suction cup up to my window, it fell during the night. No big deal, I put it back up the following morning and it hasn't fallen since then and it's been a few weeks. The screen is in color and it's kinda tempting sometimes to try and drive using only the screen, but then the grown up in me takes over as I remember what my insurance rates might do. The low light and night recording is exactly what I expected and I love the fact that it will cycle over the oldest files first when I run out of room on my 16 gig micro SD card.Maybe I'm hard of hearing or maybe I keep the radio turned up too loud or I drive with my windows down too much, but any of the features that require an audible signal are worthless to me since I can't hear them unless the car and radio are off and it's quiet around me.Overall, I like this dashcam but I wish it had some of the features that the more expensive units have like gps and I wish the speaker was louder. The base functionality is great, and it's very easy to use and set up.Edited 21 May 2014: I'm upgrading my rating to 5 stars from 4 stars. The Papago customer service is AWESOME! They replied to my review soon after it was submitted with suggestions to fix an issue I was having! They ROCK!Edit 29 Sep 2014: The LCD screen on this unit started blinking recently and then suddenly it stopped blinking and the screen was staying on. I tried to adjust the settings but none of the buttons will work now and the only way to turn it off is to unplug it. The suction cup would come off the window whenever there was a significant temperature change overnight or during the day. That wasn't a problem until now when it won't stick to the window at all anymore. My wife has a more expensive model and she hasn't had the issues that I have had. I'm reducing my overall rating to 3 stars since the unit didn't even last a year before I had to try and find the warranty records or find some way to fix it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLNOLPVI1A0FN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNX7AAA#wasThisHelpful","RLNOLPVI1A0FN","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my research on stripper clips for my first Mosin-Nagant, I repeatedly read warnings about sharp edges on the stripper clips. These arrived and the outside of the stripper clips were clean, shiny, and bright. I didn't find any sharp edges to slice my thumb on right away and they seemed to be well made and formed. My only minor complaint is that they have some deposits on the inside of the stripper clips. It seems like this will come clean though when I throw them into my tumbler for a few hours.I haven't opened a case of 7.62x54R yet, but I tried some .308 and 30-06 ammo in the clips just for giggles. Even those were held in well and they didn't feel stuck in the stripper clips. I feel confident that these will work flawlessly.Edited 27 May 2014:I took these to the range on Sunday and I was very disappointed. I don't know if it was operator error or clip quality, but rounds kept popping out of the stripper clips when I tried to load the rifle. I also had a very hard time pushing the rounds into the magazine of the gun with the stripper clips. The stripper clips wobbled back and forth a lot and I had to hold them steady with one hand while using the other to push the rounds in. For the most part I could get the first 2 or 3 rounds to go into the magazine and the rest I would have to manually load one by one. Eventually, I just gave up and loaded the rounds manually. It was quicker and easier. Hopefully it is just operator error on my part and I will have to do some digging to make sure I used them correctly. Oh and after several hours in the tumbler, the deposits on the inside of the clips never came clean. The outsides of the stripper clips were nice and shiny though.

"You aren't going to go wrong with this conditioner. I would recommend your first coats of new, old, or neglected wood be the Howard's mineral oil. Then when the oil soaks into the wood at a slower pace, you can switch to the conditioner. It swells the grains and smooths the wood out. Knife marks are reduced and it gives the finish to the wood a soft smooth feel. We use our butcher block as an end table now and we never have to worry about water rings from glasses. The butcher block top also has a smooth feel that I like to just rub my hands on. This conditioner also gives the wood a nice glow and darkens it up a little. As others have noted. Only use rags to apply this conditioner and throw them out afterwards. You also don't need a lot of elbow grease with the conditioner. It's kinda like polishing your shoes.

"You won't go wrong with this oil. It's perfect for new wood and old neglected wood. My wife and I used this on an 80 year old butcher block we bought at a garage sale. (We dated the butcher block by looking at the local history and when the deli that was stamped on the side of the block went out of business) The butcher block was well used and in good shape but the wood was dry. We coated the entire piece including the bottom and the legs and we used several bottles. The wook absorbed this oil quickly and it never left an oily or slimy feeling behind. It also helped to give the wood a healthy look to the oxidation. It also smoothed out the top as the grain swelled to fill the cuts in the top and the end grain expanded slightly.We use the butcher block as an end table now and we have never had an issue with water rings from glasses and we have no worry about what we set on top of the block. This oil really helps protect the wood as well as restoring the natural moisture.Pros:It helps preserve the wood and expand the grains for a smoother feelIt's easily absorbed into the wood.It doesn't have a foul smell or impart any taste to foodsCons:The wood will really absorb this oilYou may need a lot of it for new and untreated wood or neglected wood.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RION4R5MNIP0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004G6X0J2#wasThisHelpful","RION4R5MNIP0A","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I will say that if you are cleaning a 44 and a 45 at the same time, you have to be careful to keep them seperate. The individual brushes are not labeled with their size. Each bay though is fitted to a brush. The picture is kinda misleading and it appears as if there are two rows of brushes. This is not the case.

"I bought a 40 inch cleaning rod for my Mosin Nagant and my 1903/A3. I've never liked cleaning from the muzzle to the breach so now with this rod I don't have to. I can also put a plastic bottle on the end of the barrel to catch the wads and spray from the cleaning brushes. This is the second carbon fiber rod I've purchased and I much prefer them over the sectional aluminum rods. With the aluminum rods the jag and sections kept coming unscrewed whenever I used them. I don't have that problem with the Tipton rods. The rod spins so smoothly on it's bearings that you won't even know it's spinning unless you are touching the rod. The handle is ergonomic and provides a good grip especially when wearing nitrile gloves. The threads on the end are the standard 8/32 so they fit most all standard brushes or jags for this caliber rod. The rod is stiff but flexible and you shouldn't have any difficulties with pushing tight wads or brushes through the breech and barrel. The 40 inch rod is also long enough that I can pull the bolt out of my rifles and clean from the breach instead of the muzzle. I also don't have to worry about a big T handle getting in the way and catching on the butt or other parts of the rifle.Pros:Smooth bearings inside the handle for flawless spinningPerfect threads to attach your jags, brushes, and other attachmentsRod extends through the handle with an eye so you can hang the rod upStiff and flexible, if it bends it goes back to it's original shapeWon't scratch the barrel or recieverStiff enough for stubborn patches or brushesAttachments don't come unscrewed when the rod follows the rifling1 piece and easy maintenance.Can be hung upCons:Long and if you don't hang it, storage may be a chore40 inch model is long and requires some room to maneuver","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R226ANJACLZHUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009JO59O#wasThisHelpful","R226ANJACLZHUO","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used other polishes over the years and I've even found out how flamable some of them are. I can honestly say that I like Flitz better than anything else I have ever used on small parts. This is a tumbler additive, but I have also put it on a soft cotton cloth to polish carbon deposits off the outside of a gun barrel that I couldn't fit in my RCBS 87088 Vibratory Case Cleaner-2. I had no problem cleaning the barrell while I watched TV and my wife and son didn't complain about the smell either.I usually add corn cob bedding material from the pet store or feed and seed and a cap full of Flitz TA 04885 Green Tumbler Media Additive - 7.6 oz. Bottle in my tumbler for all my brass shells and other small metal items that need tumbling or cleaning. Make sure you turn on your tumbler with the media in it before adding the flitz, otherwise it will clump up on you. Be advised though, that this works really well and if your brass is dirty, you will get a lot of oxidation off of it, and the corn cobb media will get really dirty really quickly. It's still useable when it's dirty, and I usually judge by how long it is taking to clean the brass in order to determine when to change the media. I've also found that tearing up pieces of a used dryer sheet and mixing it in with the tumbler media will help with the dust.It's eco friendly and I simply throw the old media and Flitz in the garbage. It's not often that an eco friendly product works as well as it claims, but Flitz does it well. I've heard lots of other people recommend it on gun forums as a good cleaner.Pros:VersatileEffecientWorks as well as it claimsReasonable costEco friendlyCan be used to polish metal with a soft clothThe smell isn't overpoweringLong lastingCons:It gets really dirty so wear gloves when changing the media.You can use it to polish metal with a soft cloth, but it's more effecient as a tumbler additive","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28NE3Z8K5PN4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FS94568#wasThisHelpful","R28NE3Z8K5PN4C","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great for packing for a trip out of the country, but I found I needed multiple sheets for just one item. Your hands must be totally dry before your touch the sheets in the pack, so I had to carefully dry my hands each time I added another to the sink. Even with several, I never had any suds and the items didn't feel soapy in the least. Also, they don't disolve as redily as I expected and I had to rub at my hands or the clothes to unstick the residue.

"I bought this for a trip out of the country. I get warm easily and I needed lighweight clothes to pack, so I figured this would be perfect. Um, no. It's WAY too sheer. The model must not be wearing a bra for the back view, because you'd be able to see it easily. I was uncomfortable with that, so I wore a cardigan over it the whole day. But, alas! A worse problem surfaced. Although it wasn't tight across the chest, it kept unbuttoning at the bust line. We were out and about all day long so I couldn't change. I had to rebutton literally 20+ times. I may try to fix the problem just so I can wear it around the house (sans bra!) in the summer. I'm going to sew the button holes at the edges to make them smaller. The color and fabric held up in the wash, but I had it in a hosery bag on cold and delicate cycle.

Then there were my coworkers! They loved being able to non-verbally express how they felt about thier long boring conference calls where there is always someone who drones on and on! It turned out to be a big hit at the office where I gave out several different pooping animals. Even the mildest of office mates would spend a couple minutes to make their own pooping barnyard scene and snap a quick picture.These toys won't stand up to rough play like banging on them or launching them from a catapult. They do last a few years in my office before time takes it's toll and it's time for the office mascot to retire to greener pastures. the legs are sturdy enough for poop after poop and refill after refill. The head stays on well and locks in place for the pooping fun, yet it is easy to open for refills. The jelly beans that came with the animals weren't the greatest, but you can use your own jelly beans or other round candies. In fact, these little pooping critters can handle most anything round that will fit through the back end. At our office you never knew what might come out.

"We originally bought the Renaissance wax on the recommendation of others who have used it in the past to protect their art. Once we saw the history of the wax and the fact that it is museum quality, we decided to try it. Hubby has used minwax paste wax on furniture before. However, when the wife used this on her new chair, he was amazed at the ease of application and the shine it leaves. A little of this wax goes a long way. It dries quickly, and easily buffs to an amazing shine. After letting the chair sit for a couple days in between coatings, it didn't feel like there was ever a waxy buildup, and it feels like there is a strong protective coating. It's also very slick, I can see how other reviewers commented on using this wax on jointers and table saws. The next thing for the hubby to wax will be the table saw. We also won't hesitate to use this as a protectant on metal ornamentation, furniture, leather handles, or any other projects that require protection and a high gloss finish.The first time the wife used it, she didn't wear any gloves while applying the wax, and she complained afterwards how it made her hands feel. We would definitely recommend gloves.Pros:Amazing glossEasily buffsDries quicklyEasy to applyVery slick finishA little goes a long wayFeels like it's a strong protectantCons:Makes your hands feel slick if you apply it without glovespricey","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO5G2NLNCBW95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012S1XBO#wasThisHelpful","RO5G2NLNCBW95","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm starting to tear through these books as quickly as I can. LOL I love the story premises and being able to identify with what the characters are doing and who they are. I apologize for being a little slow, but by the middle of this book I started to think that there was more to the change than I originally thought. The ending confirms it. I also find that I'm eager to read the rest of the books and I'm really hoping that Stirling expands on my favorite characters and doesn't just abandon them. I'm also coming to appreciate that good and bad characters die; and I appreciate being kept on my toes when it happens. I still wish that Stirling would title his books in a different way. I would say more on this but I don't want to spoil it for anyone.Good read and I can't wait to get the next one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3781SK2E9P8N5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UZJR7W#wasThisHelpful","R3781SK2E9P8N5","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stirling's style has much improved since Dies The Fire. However, I wish he would choose his titles in a different manner. He isn't abandoning fight or battle scenes in mid fight to leave you assuming who won. You can still pick up the book without reading the previous one and become interested in the story. The book length is short and his style of recapping will probably become tedious as I read more of the books. All in all though the book is good. I'm still planning on reading the rest of the series and then moving on to the series of the Island In The Sea Of Time books. Jumping back and forth in time within a book doesn't bother me at all when it's done logically. It worked for me in this book.Good and easy read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11BSOSGHJR5AS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006CETC0C#wasThisHelpful","R11BSOSGHJR5AS","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NO SPOILERSTwo short stories in one graphic novel.In ""Throttle,"" Hill and King pull together a short but exciting tale of another, and very different, son and father. As the description provides, their biker gang is pitted against a murderous trucker who mysteriously wishes them ill. Father and son's personalities and relationship are well drawn and believable. The comic is based on their short story Throttle (Kindle Single).A short story needs to be lean and tightly written, with no elements useless to the plot and character development. Hill and King are both sharp writers who know how to make a character feel real and relatable. Matheson's ""Duel"" main character is also well defined, but with less background or final explanation. Matheson's story Duel inspired Hill and King's.The book includes a comics version ""Throttle"" and one of  ""Duel"" as well. I have never read ""Duel"" as a short story but, based on the perfect adaptation of the ""Throttle"" half by Ryall, I'm guessing it's true to Matheson's original.I bought the short story version of ""Throttle"" first, but after reading the comic I didn't feel the comic was necessary. It felt superfluous, and I'm a big comics fan. Not that it's poorly done; it's well illustrated and true to the short story. Ryall and Daniel adapt and illustrate it well, with, IMHO, two caveats. The style used in ""Duel"" was not really to my liking. Not poorly done - just not my cup of tea. I loved the illustrations for Throttle, except the use of Ben-Day dots. I found them a little distracting. If they'd been a little smaller I would have liked them better. However, these opinions are just about my personal taste and you may disagree. In addition, the two stories are so similar that it felt like a bit of a repeat reading them as the only things in the book.It also included a prologue by Joe Hill explaining how and why they wrote the story. I enjoyed reading that.The kindle edition of the ""Throttle"" short story also includes a couple of illustrations from the comic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPSRMRBAYVOIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613772823#wasThisHelpful","RPSRMRBAYVOIR","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was really disappointed in this story. I can see how people who grew up in this time period and/or lived in the same town. The Amazon book description is 100% about the missing Pecord family; the book is 20% about the Pecord family. Mr.  Naughton clearly knows how to create an atmosphere and show reader like me, who didn’t grow up in the 5os, get an idea of what life was like.But the Pecords? He gives a lot of information about his and his friends’ involvement of the discovery that the family was missing, but no real follow up. The best he does is question a police officer friend years later. He could have done so much more…interview older residents, search newspaper archives, look at land deeds (if they owned the house, who owned it next), search death records, etc. Nope. I myself looked up the address to see it on Google maps and looked at what past sale records I could find in a casual search online.He named the book, “Whatever Happened to the Pecords?”  Well, geez man, put in a little more effort to find out!","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IFX1ANGK1A7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESV9ENQ#wasThisHelpful","R1IFX1ANGK1A7Q","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always have this in the house. It’s a great quick cover for scratches and small nicks on furniture. I have a lot of old, “well loved” furniture. One item is an old, dark wood bed with a wreath shaped applique on the headboard. Part of it was broken off before I even got the bed. Once a year, I use a Q-tip and soak the area with Old English so it’s not immediately noticeable that part of the wreath is missing. I do find I have to reapply this to some nicks and scratches once a year or so. It seems to soak in over time.Using the ""dark"" cover on wood that's light is a bad idea; it shows right up.

"I use the pourable Liquid Gold, not the type in an aerosol can.Most of the furniture I own is quite old - family pieces or antiques that are just as old. Therefore, I worry about them drying out too much as time passes.The Liquid Gold does the trick. It makes the wood smell really good and gives it a lovely shine. It improves the appearance of, shall we say, lower quality wood items. I purchased our 120 gallon fish tank used. It's on a pine base and was fairly cheap looking when I got it, but the oil darkens up the wood a bit and evens out the appearance. It has also perked up a slightly battered washstand and a converted radio cabinet that we use as night stands.On several occasions I have flipped my 70 yr old dining room table over and drizzled liberal amounts on the underside (done this with other items, too). Then I leave it sit overnight and it all soaks in. I'll also use a liberal amount on surfaces and let it soak in overnight, just wiping off whatever little bits are still there the next day. I've also used it to good effect on pine paneled walls.We got a long, thin scratch on our brand new bamboo flooring, so I tried the Liquid Gold, not expecting a fix.

"This is my first foray into scoped rifles and if I can shoot groups smaller than a quarter from 100 yards away, the rifle and scope have to be good! I mounted my scope on a Smith & Wesson MP-10 and I'm using a Harris bipod. My second trip to the range with my rifle and scope felt amazing. I was actually able to zero the scope so that I could cover my 3 shot groups with a quarter. The dials on the scope are firm with very distinct clicks. The optics were able to accomodate my poor vision. There was no fog or glare on the glass when I used it, and I had no problem using the scope with enough eye relief for a .308. Considering that this is the first time that I mounted and used a scope on a rifle, I have to give this scope a 5 star rating. However, my first trip to the range to sight the rifle in was very frustrating. It seemed that nothing I did was working to zero the scope. Then I had a flash of brilliance, I read the directions more closely with the scope in front of me. It's amazing the difference it made when I realized I was making the wrong adjustments. I proved that this scope isn't idiot proof, but it is darn close!pros:Very clean and good threads for lense caps or other attachmentsExcellent quality glassClear markings for windage and elevationDistinct clicks when adjusting windage and elevationVery crisp reticleVery accurateConsI wish the directions were easy enough for novices like me to understand them the first timeThis scope does not come with lense covers, you will have to purchase them seperately.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PFNRTLK822K2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AB3Z8LC#wasThisHelpful","R3PFNRTLK822K2","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The other was just right. Since they're real bone, the sizes aren't uniform.I got one of each; Pet n Shape Filled Small Dog Bone Trachea Flavor and Pet n Shape Filled Small Dog Bone Bully Flavor. Well, they liked them both but, overall, the bully stick flavor was preferred.What's nice is that these are real bones, so the dogs enjoy gnawing at them even though they're now empty. You can also spread a bit of peanut butter inside once they're empty. The filling wasn't stinky and didn't leave marks on the carpet, either! My only issue is the high shipping cost. I will be searching for these locally.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R386BEJUME905L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1D75ZW#wasThisHelpful","R386BEJUME905L","A1DDZAE5NREK1O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DDZAE5NREK1O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was a girl back in the 70s, my sister and I - in fact all the girls! - wore Love's Baby Soft. It's a fresh, clean, light scent suitable for pre-teens and teens, but there's no reason an adult couldn't enjoy it as well! I also wore Love's Fresh Lemon by Dana for Women 1.5 oz Body Mistback then. That was my favorite. I picked out this set as part of my niece's birthday gift. She really likes it. My only disappointment was that I couldn't get the Baby Soft and Lemon as a combo. The cute heart shaped box also makes for a nice and easy to wrap gift. Just wrap in tissue and drop in a gift bag.

"I was really tired of polishing my sterling flatware and my silver jewelry every time I wanted to use of wear something.

"NO SPOILERS  ""The Beckoning Fair One"" is the longest (a novella) and best known piece in this collection of short stories. Writer Paul Oleron moves into several rooms of an otherwise long empty, neglected and run down home. He soon finds himself obsessed by what he believes to be a ghost. The question for the reader to determine is whether it is a ghost, a leanan sídhe, some other phenomena, or the deterioration of Oleron's own mind at work.This and the other stories showcases Onions' strength at creating mood. It's best to read the novella in one or two sittings only, as the reader's involvement in the tone and identification with the main character build as the story progresses. In some ways the stories reminded me of the slow building classic The Turn of the Screw by Henry James, so if you enjoyed that novella, you may like Onions' stories.Onions didn't write ""jump out and BOO"" stories. They're carefully crafted gems of mood, plot and characterization which have influenced many big name writers after his time. And here Amazon has a collection of his stories - for free!

"My dog Bruno is diabetic, accident-prone, and has very delicate skin.  He's a Pit-Bull / Lab / Shar-Pei mix, and it seems his skin has been more delicate lately, and tearing open more often.  Vet bills have been piling up, so I need to start doing more at home.  I'm already doing glucose curves and administering insulin injections.  I've even done subcutaneous fluids at home when he got real sick about 4 years ago.Anyways, just last week, he was scratching his neck, and put a 3/4"" gash in his throat.  I shaved the area, cleaned it and dried it.  Then I applied the Vetbond Adhesive while I held the cut closed.The Vetbond Adhesive held for a couple days until he was scratching (again), and re-opened the wound (unfortunately, it was in a location where a ""cone"" around his neck wouldn't have prevented this), which was now nearly twice as long of an incision (close to 1.5"").  Time for the pro's to take care of it - back to the vet for some stitches.I'm not giving up on this adhesive yet, though.  It's the same stuff they use at our Vet (and have used many times on Bruno).

"The stitching in the webbing around the D-Ring (where you clip the leash) came undone 5 minutes into the first walk after this was delivered.The only reason I needed this harness was so that I could walk my dog while his throat heals from an injury.  I didn't want to use a regular collar due to it potentialy aggrivating the area of his throat that is currently stitched up.Overall, the quality is good, and the fit is good...but the QC department let this one slip through the cracks.  I noticed that the stitching around the D-Ring was a little loose about 1 minute into the walk.  I was taking him for a short 10-minute walk, so I figured I'd chance it and finish the walk...well, it only lasted another 4-5 minutes when Bruno saw the puppy he's been playing with the for the past few days.  One slight tug, and the rest of the stitching came undone.  I was able to clip to one of the O-Rings on the side to keep him under my control for the walk back home.I have some spare webbing at home, and will just re-make the part that broke, since I don't want to deal with return shipping.  Besides, if I wait for the next one to be delivered his stitches will have already been removed.  I need to take him for daily walks to keep his diabetes under control, so I'd rather just repair it myself instead of waiting for shipments to be delivered.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SJIFYNRQ474A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009ZBKG4#wasThisHelpful","R1SJIFYNRQ474A","ATCL00P7C2KUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATCL00P7C2KUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Almost a year ago I raised my desk at work and got rid of my office chair.  This single change helped relieve my back pain more than anything.  I prefer to stand.  When I go to people's homes, or to a party/gathering, people are always telling me to sit down, and that I'm making them uncomfortable...but sitting is simply uncomfortable for me unless I'm in a recliner.Last weekend I was at an annual 3 day convention that required a total of 6 four-hour sitting periods.  This usually would have left me with an extremely painful lower back and tailbone.  Just days prior to the convention I was on a cross-country flight (NY to SF).  While waiting in Denver for my next flight for 4 hours, I decided to take a walk around the concourse, and stumbled upon a BackJoy sales booth.  I had never seen these before, but the salesman doing what salesmen do - offered to let me try it out.  I did, and it felt fine, but I was a bit skeptical, so I walked away without purchasing.That's when I came to Amazon to read the reviews before making my purchase.  My rump was already sore from my other flights and Greyhound bus rides over the prior week.  After reading a few of the reviews I was sold.  I paid about $5 more at the airport, but I didn't want to get on another plane without it.Now, it's not perfect.  As others have stated, it doesn't work as well atop cushioned chairs, but it sure beats sitting directly on lightly-cushioned seating - like airplane / bus / stadium seating.  Some minor adjustments may be needed here and there to remain comfortable.After using this device during the 3-day convention, my lower back still hurt after sitting for extended periods of time - though only about 50% of what it would have been had I not had the BackJoy.  My tailbone had no pain whatsoever, and there was no hint of my legs or other parts going numb after prolonged sitting.I got a few stares, laughs, and some light ribbing from friends for bringing my 'booster seat' / 'tractor seat', but at the end of the day, quite a few people wanted to try it, and a couple were convinced that they will need one for next year's convention.I plan on getting into Kayak fishing, and am anxious to try it out on the water.  Anyone know if it floats?In case you're wondering, I'm 6'2"" 250lb.  Supposedly this is a one-size-fits-all...but anyone that's either really small, or really big, knows that there's really no such thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI48YK9WHQI3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00911XIBM#wasThisHelpful","RI48YK9WHQI3D","ATCL00P7C2KUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATCL00P7C2KUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must say this is much faster, easier to use and provides for a quicker cleanup than my other method - which is using an old (clean) cotton t-shirt.  I still prefer the way that almond milk turns out when strained through something that is more tightly woven - which captures all of the fiber.I just received this new nut milk bag a couple days ago, and was eager to give it a try.  While it works good, it leaves the nut milk a bit too gritty for my taste.I'm making my almond milk in a Blendtec blender.  Maybe I'm just running it too long, and grinding up the almonds too fine.

"I purchased this locally after verifying that I'd be able to return it if it didn't work.  I didn't want to end up with a $40 sweater for my dog.I bought it on July 3rd in preparation for my annual sleepless night.  Not only are there random fireworks going on all night in my neighborhood, the city does their full-fledged tens-of-thousands-of-dollars fireworks show right next to my house.  They launch them literally 100 yards from my backyard, which makes it great for viewing the show, but not so great for my 2 dogs.The older (11) of the 2 dogs is a cattle-dog mix, and is easily controllable in these situations with simple verbal discipline.  The younger (9) is a Pit Bull / Lab / Shar-Pei, who is a great dog most of the time, but goes absolutely berserk when he hears fireworks.I was hopeful that this Thundershirt would help - even just a little.  But it did absolutely nothing.  There was no change whatsoever in his behavior or demeanor.For those that it does work for, it looks like it would last through many uses.  The materials and construction look reliable.  It's fairly easy to put it on the dog, if your dog will sit still for you.  If not, you'll definitely need a second set of hands to get this thing wrapped around the dog.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y6AWA9QTFG1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028QK6EY#wasThisHelpful","R1Y6AWA9QTFG1X","ATCL00P7C2KUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATCL00P7C2KUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I installed a Sony MEXBT3100P Receiver, and while the install was a piece of cake, the fit & finish of this dashkit leaves much to be desired.The receiver is held in by a couple of side plates that are supposed to clip into the housing - but they aren't very secure, and the receiver can be pulled out pretty easily with no tools necessary.The receiver also sits a little too deep into the dash, which interferes with the removal of the faceplate.The trim piece that installs around the receiver to cover the gaps isn't straight (upper horizontal section sags), and doesn't clip in securely.I'd like to upload photos, but am unable to do so for this particular product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AJATWFYEN36U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000K4YNUE#wasThisHelpful","R2AJATWFYEN36U","ATCL00P7C2KUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATCL00P7C2KUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most people look at me like I'm crazy when I tell them how much I spent on a quality set of optics, but these Leupold Cascades are worth every penny.Several years ago, I purchased a set of refurbished Cascades 8x42 bino's on sale for about $200.  3 weeks ago, when I went to twist out the right-side eye-cup, it broke off.  I e-mailed Leupold support through their website, explaining that I had no receipt, and couldn't even remember where I bought them.  They told me to simply send them in, and they would take care of it.A week or so later, I got a post-card confirming that they received the binoculars.  Yesterday, UPS stops by and hands me a package.  Inside was a brand new, retail packaged set of these newer-model binoculars!  I had always heard that their customer service is second to none - now I'm a true believer.This model seems a bit more refined than my old ones.  Better fit & finish.  Optics seem a bit clearer, and don't have the discolored (pink-ish) ring at the peripheral edges, like the old ones.It included a nice neoprene strap that will probably go unused, since I prefer a harness.  It also comes with rubber flip-away lens covers - like the Butler Creek ones, but a much simpler (cheaper) design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VJV03LAO4VRE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MBCNOE#wasThisHelpful","R1VJV03LAO4VRE","ATCL00P7C2KUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATCL00P7C2KUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never used trekking poles before, except for the odd sturdy stick picked up on the side of the trail.There is a local hill that I like to hike about once or twice a month or so, that gives me a pretty good workout.  Mission Peak in Fremont, CA.  It's about 3 miles each way, and ascends ~2,100'.  Most of it is a wide gravel / packed dirt trail, except for the last 1/4 mile which is narrow and very rocky.Before using these trekking poles, my legs muscles would be very sore from the hike up the hill, and my knees and soles of my feet would be very sore from descending the hill.  Now that I've been using the poles, I still get a great workout - even in my arms, but I'm not nearly as sore at the end.I was a little concerned about the strength of these poles, since they are in Leki's 'ultralight' series, and I'm certainly not an ultralight person, currently at ~260lb.  I've put maybe 50 miles on these poles so far, and believe they are worth every penny spent.Just a few weeks ago I used them as I walked up to the top of Vernal Falls in Yosemite National Park, on the Mist Trail.  The solid granite steps in front of the falls were quite wet & slick, but the tips of these poles just dig right into the rock, making ascending and descending them an absolute breeze.The grips and straps are also very comfortable.  I'm very happy with these as my first set of trekking poles.  The only reason I'll ever buy another set of trekking poles is if these break or get lost or stolen...and then I'll probably buy these same ones again (or maybe the anti-shock version of them).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJGFKNY8G76S2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077NUFYY#wasThisHelpful","RJGFKNY8G76S2","ATCL00P7C2KUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATCL00P7C2KUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted a rear wheel that is sturdy and would be strong enough to haul around my 270lb self, along with my clothes, tools, lunch, and whatever else I need to bring to work with me, on my 20+ mile round-trip commute, and not need constant maintenance.I should have paid closer attention to the spec's for this rim - apparently, it's only rated to 87psi (6 bar).  This is not good for a Clydesdale (tall or otherwise hefty cyclist).  I use 700x28 tires preferably inflated to 115 psi (7.9 bar).  Maybe I'll just get some 32's so I don't worry about pot holes as much.  But that's my own fault for lack of attention to detail, so I'm not deducting any stars for it.The reason for the deduction of a star is becuase the wheel was not properly trued, tensioned, and stress relieved.  Right out of the box, it was out of true, and when I mounted it, and jumped on the bike, I heard some pinging coming from the spokes.  I had to do a quick truing of the wheel during my lunch break, and will do a proper truing, tensioning, and stress-relieving later.Overall, it seems like a good wheel, made from quality components.  It should last me a good long time...after it's properly built.If you decide to purchase this wheel, and you don't know how to true, tension, and stress-relieve a wheel, plan on spending an extra $20-$40 at your local bike shop to have this done for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R97U2G7PKEZ1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JKEUZS#wasThisHelpful","R97U2G7PKEZ1X","ATCL00P7C2KUG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATCL00P7C2KUG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cons:- Battery life - my bike-commute is less than 1 hour each way.  When I put it on the charger after a one-way commute, the charge-level indicator is Red, meaning not much power left.  Orange = ~50%.  Green = 100%- Charger design - I would have much preferred a micro-USB type charger instead of the magnetic electrode charging method.  Because of this proprietary charger, I'm forced to bring the charger with me on my commutes.  It would have been nicer to use the same type of charger that many phones use.- Durability - The first one I got worked one time and then failed.  I was able to charge it up right out of the box, and it worked once.  After a single charge the charger failed to charge the light.Pros:- Very bright- 3 blink settings- Very lightweight- Solar Charger - can be used to charge other USB devices as well - though very, very slowly.- Customer Support - I called customer support about the light failing to charge.  They sent me another one brand-new in retail box with all accessories - no questions asked.  That's when I realized that it was the charger, and not the light.  They didn't want the old items back, so now I have one working charger, and 2 working tail lights.Overall, I don't regret buying it, and will continue to use it.

"The hoses themselves were a perfect fit, but the metal hose didn't come with a rubber grommet where it mounts to the undercarriage, leaving a loose metal-to-metal contact which results in rattling.  Put a 1"" section of 1/4"" or 3/8"" inside-diameter rubber hose, or wrap it with some durable tape, and you're good to go.Removal of the old hoses was a piece of cake.  You'll have to remove the vertically-positioned hose coupler from the top of the power steering pump in order to get the high-pressure hose loose.  A couple of adjustable wrenches will do the job nicely. Unthreading from the steering rack proved tedious because you can only turn the nut about 1/8 turn at a time due to lack of clearance.Threading the end of the new hose into the steering rack can be a bit tricky.  Removal of the left-front wheel is a must.  A 17mm crows-foot wrench is also very helpful. Getting the hose perfectly aligned, and getting the threads to 'catch' seemed an impossible task, but after ~40 minutes of struggling, I was finally able to thread it in.  No leaks.

I purchased these because I was going to be bartending (first time) at a friends party.  I quickly learned that these pourers don't fit very tight, and even if they did, they have to be held at a specific angle in order to keep them from leaking.  The little air-relief hole needs to be at the 12 o'clock position in order to prevent leaks.For this beginner, the flow rate is good.  Not too fast.

They're plastic, seem durable, and do the job of keeping your tie from shifting side to side, accidentally turning around, or hanging down when you bend over.Tie Chains and Pins do the same thing, but if you want a cleaner, no-bling look, these are perfect.Update - April 2015:They aren't as durable as I had expected.  They start to crack in the corners of the rectangle button hole, which will eventually break open.  I use these approximately twice a week, and have worn out several of them. The price has gone up considerably since I purchased them.  I've switched to a cheaper alternative - making my own from large paperclips.Design change recommendation - instead of having four 90 angles to make the rectangle shaped button holes, make the ends rounded (long oval).  This will prevent the cracks from forming at the corners, and will make the device more durable.

"I wear size 14 (49) shoes.  I purchased a pair of XXL Craft shoe covers from a local bike shop, thinking they would fit.  They didn't.  Searching online, I found that XXXL was the typical size shoe cover that I would need to look for, but when I brought the Craft ones back, the owner of the shop showed me these Louis Garneau shoe covers.  The size was XL, and I was a bit skeptical, but they were noticably larger than the others, and they fit (quite snugly) over my casual leather shoes, so I have no doubt they'll fit over my cycling shoes.  They are also much more flexible & stretchy.  An extra bonus is that they were $5 cheaper than the other ones.I would say that the XL size of these is probably good for shoe size 12-14 (46-49).  Not sure about other sizes.The one thing I don't care for is the small velcro opening at the ankle.  This should have been extended further down than just 2"" from the top to make it easier to put on & remove...but then again, maybe it helps with waterproofness.I'll update this review after I actually have a chance to put them to their intended use...I just have to wait for the cold and rainy weather to return to Northern California.Update:  I wore them on my commute this morning.

"I love this genre (post-apocalyptic or possible dark future), but even I'll admit that some books in this genre are ""genre-fiction"".  However, this one is literature.  There is intention in every word placed on the page, yet it never feels constructed - not unlike the tea garden where Nouria casually scatters leaves across the path, to look as if they were placed there, for that feeling of artful nature.  This book is beautifully written, like the Japanese garden it often evokes in its descriptions.  The fact that it stays small in scope, only hinting at a larger world and its events, is a very effective tool that usually only an experienced author understands.  Many post-apocalyptic books take on a huge scope, travelling across an entire world - in this book, we only know as much as the narrator herself knows.I LOVE that this book is mainly about two female characters - Sanja and Minja.  Because the two girls are written so well, like real girls, it never feels like chick lit or a princess book.  These girls are real and that's why they are relate-able for all genders, because real girls are not caricatures of femininity. You hardly think about their gender, actually, except when someone points out that it's unusual for a girl to become a tea-master.  Unlike SOME post-apocalyptic books, the world has not gone back to someone's misogynistic fantasy, but has maintained much gender equity.About the story itself, which you can also read in the description of the book, it is a world where water has become scarce, where the insects flock so fiercely that insect hoods are needed, and where winter doesn't even touch the northern reaches of Scandinavia.  New Qian rules all of the known world, including the Scandinavian Union, and the East Asian culture infuses everything, and it's unclear whether the characters themselves are Scandinavian or Chinese in origin.  And that hardly matters anyway.  Some modern technology exists - like something similar to a smartphone - and yet most of the past-world technology is in the ""plastic grave"" - or garbage pit.  The people escavate it looking for usable parts and metals, and  Nouria's friend Sanja is a techno-genius, able to put back together old technology.  The two girls discover something amazing in the plastic grave that changes Nouria, and yet she stays rooted in tradition, rather than following her mother to Xinjiang, she stays with her father to become a tea-master.  Of course tea is quite the luxury when water itself is scarce.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K5DHGIQCU606/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062326155#wasThisHelpful","R1K5DHGIQCU606","A2OG83SEU9HL6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OG83SEU9HL6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's a dark view of the world, to be sure, and not at all politically correct - but if you have worked in business at all, you will be roaring in laughter.

"This book is pretty comprehensive.  It covers several different ways to work out, and I admit that by the end I was a little confused, but there are specific workouts recommended.  There is a path to building your muscle base, which I suspect most readers would start with, and then other paths to follow for specific goals.  Each exercise is explained in detail, with pictures, and that serves as a reference later on in the workouts.  Sometimes it was body-weight exercises or simple dumbbells, and other times specific gym equipment was needed.Of course, it also talks about diet and how that impacts your results.  You can't eat too little, but you also don't want to eat too much. and you want to eat the right things at the right time.  The book goes into this, without exactly prescribing a diet - more guidelines.My favorite part about the book was the beginning where it explained the principles of fat loss and muscle building, and responded to some common misconceptions.  It confirmed the science behind the way that workouts are often designed. For example, I am following T25 and it uses some of the principles explained in this book, so I liked understanding why something works.for me, I do not do well following a book for a workout, as it's too much referencing the book, and carrying it around. I am more likely to do something that i can take with me on my tablet (perhaps an idea for the author to expand into mobile apps)  or a video to follow, so I don't know how much I'll use the actual workouts. I have considered packing it into my gym bag for work, so that I could make better use of the corporate gym.I gave it four stars because it's my honest assessment. I like it, but I don't love it. However I'm not sure if I'd love any book when compared to other ways of teaching fitness, as explained above.  I think a book like this would be a great guide to a trainer coming up with workouts for his/her clients.  I'd love to have someone take the principles from this book, design a workout and walk me through it. I just don't see myself however putting a book on a bench and trying to read and exercise at the same time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31IFUVQAC1TCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1450432077#wasThisHelpful","R31IFUVQAC1TCA","A2OG83SEU9HL6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OG83SEU9HL6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you work in a cube, no doubt you'll find this history interesting.  Each chapter focuses on a different time period or mndset in office spaces.  Overall, I found it interesting, some chapters more than others.  Much more research has been done lately on the effect of office spaces on different types of workers.  This book should not serve as a manual to the office planner, merely a history. We certainly do not wish to repeat the mistakes of the past.  Honestly I found it a bit depressing at times, revealing the nature of work, and the division between managers and workers (even in the knowledge economy), and how office space is used to indicate power, prestige, control and lack thereof.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C27CGNZDEH5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536577#wasThisHelpful","R3C27CGNZDEH5W","A2OG83SEU9HL6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OG83SEU9HL6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Words cannot express how much I LOVED this book.  I've read pretty much anything I can get my hands on in this genre.  I've read all of Lisa See's books, but this one opened up a new world.  And it was a pretty special one.This story is about friendship and chosen sisterhood, about three girls, all trying to find their identity in America, as  Asians (Chinese and Japanese), from the thirties through the fifties, going through the war, and how that tests loyalty in friendships.  The three women are very different.  Grace Lee is a midwestern girl, who loves to dance and always wanted to be in show-business, but has a sweet and naive air.  Helen is a refined woman who grew up in a big family compound, is relatively well-off but lonely and has dark secrets in her past.  Ruby shows up in San Francisco from Hawaii, willing to do anything to be the star.  Despite their very different backgrounds and values, they form a bond when they try out to be dancers at the Forbidden City, the first Chinese nightclub outside of Chinatown.I related strongly to the characters and their experiences, because I am familiar with the world of bellydancers.  Both dancers are misunderstood and judged.  Both types of dancers portray a caricuture of a culture, in a sense, for an audience not part of that culture.  These entertainers knew they had to play on the stereotypes, make the obvious jokes, in order to bring in the crowds and actually show off their talent.  The women were not considered marriageable, and other women in the community looked down on their ""big thigh show"" - simply because of the jazzy costumes that they wore.  Of course, Ruby was always one to take it a step further as you'll read in the book.The characters had to experience racism and in one case homophobia beyond which most of us have been exposed to.  It was a different time in America back then, with far less diversity, and with people staying apart from other races. In fact, Asians and Whites were not allowed to get married, which is actually a bit of a plot point in the book.  At the same time, you can see the seeds of change, what preceded the sixties, in the characters and their friends who are beginning to buck tradition.I haven't been reading as much lately, with so much to do and so little time, it's a luxury. However, I never got bored of this book and I found myself choosing to read it the way I used to read - for long periods of time, just falling into the pages of another world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FBZQD3S4U5JK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081299289X#wasThisHelpful","R2FBZQD3S4U5JK","A2OG83SEU9HL6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OG83SEU9HL6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a basic four port video display switch.  It requires a two-prong power outlet.  You plug your monitor into the blue-colored port, and you have up to four additional slots to connect additional VGA cables.  An item like this is commonly used if you have multiple servers or just computers and want to use a single monitor (space-saving).  you might use it if two people in one house share a desk.  You might use it if you have a home PC, and a work laptop.  I don't see a lot of home users needing all four ports.The switching mechanism is buttons across the top.It has a small form factor.I'll admit that I only ended up using it with one device, because it turned out that my work laptop doesn't have a VGA connection.Please note that it is ONLY for VGA cables (the old kind).  Many new monitors use HDMI these days, and some laptops only take HDMI. Do not purchase if your laptop or monitor is HDMI only.

"I work from home from time to time, and I tested this product with my iPhone5 this week.  I tried it for both voice calls and music. It works like magic. You simply lay your phone on the dock - no connection required - and it works.  It does need to be powered up by USB first, but then it operates on its own battery.  The sound comes out of the sound. It's not a professional speaker system such as you might use for listening to music for pleasure, but it's good enough to have background music.  For voice, it was great quality. I checked with the people I spoke with, and they said it was crystal clear.  I'm very happy to have a hands-free alternative that is better than a speakerphone.I did notice that you had to turn the volume far down on the phone to keep the speakers from being too loud, and I wish there was a volume control.

"This is a great game! I bought it for my son at his request.  First, the awesome thing is that you can cook as a boy or a girl. The idea is that you are helping out your family in the food truck.  You also learn to clean.In the game, you go to different locations with your food truck, and make different meals. You are able to learn different recipes.  Cooking consists of the following activities:1.) selecting ingredients for the recipe from a pantry, a matching exercise2.) counting a number of items (say, carrots) and moving them to a scale, adding up to a goal number. A counting game.3.) slicing and cutting (hand-eye coordination)4.) cooking, which is mostly following instructions, like adding ingredients at certain times, flipping the food, and taking it off the heat.5.) selecting the right # of ingredients by recognizing numbers.  over time, these become small math problems. You start with recognizing the letter 5, then into two digit numbers like 13, and finally you see 5+5= and you have to select 10. My son got a bit stuck on the last one, but I explained he just had to choose the 5's twice.  It's totally do-able and teaches addition skills.The game doesn't require the child to know how to read, although I thought it would. It does require them to recognize numbers.At the end of the day, you have to clean the truck, put things away, and recycle the trash.  I like that part too!I think it's a really great game that grows progressively with your child's abilities, gives lots of positive feedback, and is apparently quite fun considering he keeps going back to play more (and usually he gets frustrated by games and stops playing after, say, 15 minutes).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25722EXSRKYUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CN8AGCO#wasThisHelpful","R25722EXSRKYUU","A2OG83SEU9HL6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OG83SEU9HL6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I played this game with my son for one and a half levels to qualify myself to write this review.  He is four and a half years old, plus you have me as a ""grown-up"", with our perspectives.  First, I will say that this game is better for an older child - or at least a kid with really good hand-eye coordination.  Since we keep our kid away from tablets and phones, aside from the LeapPad, he isn't the best at ""dragging and dropping"".  He also is a bit behind on drawing, especially staying within lines.  So, given that, he found the game challenging and calls it ""the hard game"".  However, he enjoyed playing the game together, with me helping out from time to time.  With his small hands, he struggles to both operate the ""A/B"" buttons and the directional buttons in all games.  Ok, that aside, let me describe the game.It is an adventure game with a lot of creativity incorporated.  The main game is very much like Super Mario Brothers, with jumping on platforms, jumping on top of bad guys, and getting keys to open cages to save the good guys.  How it's different is that you have opportunities to add your own flavors.  At certain points, you can record your voice as part of the story, making up whatever you want to say within the context of the situation.  At other points, you can draw things that then become part of your game.  As an example, there are ""hearts"" you can pick up to get lives.  You get to free-form the look of your hearts.  Later on, you design the ""lightning flowers"".  For this exercise, you are led to trace the design of a flower, step by step, and then adding your own colored decorations.  Finally, there are coloring exercises where you color in, say, a car, before you can drive it.  You dont' have to do any particular colors - just pick whatever you like - as long as you put your stamp on it.  I really like the concept here, where kids get to have their own creativity.  As a kid, I had several games that let you ""build your own game"" and I always loved them, because they make you feel powerful and creativity.I really like how Leapfrog's games keep it easy enough for a kid to enjoy.  You never really ""die"" - if you run out of lives, you are disabled for a moment and you may not get a trophy for getting through the level with all your lives intact, but you don't have to start over.  You can't fall off platforms and ""die"".  It is a good entry point for video-game playing.  When I had to play the Atari 2600 as a kid, it was so difficult to learn how to use the controller and play games because they were designed for adults, so I appreciate that these games are made easier for kids to get a foot in the door.  (We're gamers, so we want him to learn to play games with us!)I really see my kid growing into this game over time, and it seems to have long-term appeal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CN87AXYEYA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSXJIMO#wasThisHelpful","R30CN87AXYEYA0","A2OG83SEU9HL6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OG83SEU9HL6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The screen display is absolutely brilliant clear quality and true color. It is high definition or HD, and does have an HDMI port as well.  The sound or audio quality is clear and very loud for a small laptop/book device.  Keyboard is crisp and responsive.The Google search using the microphone and speaking into the Chromebook and asking what you would like to search for or find is extremely useful and never missed with us asking it questions.  This is a great feature to have on any of your laptops or this Toshiba Chrombook comes with it already downloaded.If you have always used Windows, one of the main things you will notice is this has no start button or menu. You go to Chrome emblem on bottom which opens the browser tab just as it would if you were using Mozilla or Internet Explorer/Edge.  In the upper right corner you click the menu looking box and opens your settings for mouse, keyboard, screen shot (you can take a pic of what is on your screen and save or mail, etc) in settings you can enable Bluetooth and connect to other Bluetooth devices, set up new users, and other preferences.  It is really simplified and kinda leaves you feeling a little unsure, but it really is quite a simple operating system.For  video chat you press the Launcher button that looks like a magnifiying glass and got to ""hangouts"" icon.  Does not use iTunes for music you got to Google Play Music to listen and shop for songs.You can have several individual users or sign on as guest.  No printer dialog you can do it through bluetooth or use the usb plug in.Does have a SD card slot, no CD or DVD drive but you do have the HDMI or use the internet for movies, also the ""Google Play Movies"".  Bluetooth enabled so you can connect with Blu-Ray DVD players and play Youtube music vids over the internet through your Bluetooth ready home speakers.Oh has a pretty darn decent forward facing camera as well which you can use for snapshots or the Hangout (Like Facetime)A sleek little outward appearance and a slight textured cover for easy no slip carry. Inside you have black keys on a gunmetal silver with a solid touch pad.  Battery goes on and on, I have yet to run out of power with intermittent charging you can sit for hours unplugged.All techies I am not going to be able to help you with your extreme tech questions, but as a simple average family experience this Chromebook has been fun and enlightening.

"Most algaecides have worked well for me but this one just seemed to be very fast and effective.  I cleared pool of all leaves, debris and kids toys, vacuumed bottom of pool to waste so I wasn't running the algae through the sand filter, then circled the pool pouring this in.  We just happened to have a 10,000gal pool so one bottle is all we needed. Went around with a brush and brushed all sides and the floor to upset and expose all algae to the chemical.  After circulating the water for 24 hours and filling up water level, I vacuumed to waste one more time the dead algae left on the bottom of the pool and filter back on to filtration.

Remember to keep dogs away from your pool to drink out of it or swim if they have swam in a pond or stream as their coats will reintroduce algae to your pool.

"Fit my husband perfectly with generous sleeves and comfortable in the shoulders with good length to tuck in. I sometimes have to purchase him one size larger for bigger shoulders but this shirt was true to fit for his size and comfortable. He is not a big man, but very muscular and Army fit and this shirt is cut to give a clean line slight trim fit.  No threads hanging, buttons sewn tight a very nice quality of craftsmanship and a great price.  He does prefer a pocket on his shirts and this does not have one, but I wont hesitate to purchase this brand of shirt in the future for him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24NTHBGL49NHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXERRXG#wasThisHelpful","R24NTHBGL49NHT","A1CCMW354ELJ3U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CCMW354ELJ3U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very inventive.  Easy to put together.  Lightweight and very easy to move it around with it on your floors. Love how the floor vac head will grab items, dirt, fuzz, or objects (like a dead beetle) right up next to the baseboards does not just merely shove it up against the baseboard out of reach.  A quiet but powerful motor.  Easy dump tank.  Best aspect for me is using the extension to get all the way in and behind furniture and appliances.  Very generous heavy cord.  the cord winder was a little in my way using as a crevice tool but still does the job.  I think you are going to be surprised how much this vac is going to help you get your dusting, vacuuming and deep crevice cleaning done.

"Excellent choice and amazing price.  If you research this brand, Asus, it has high accolades in consumer electronics and not an economy brand such as Acer.  The look and feel for an over 15"" screen laptop is not bulky or square.  Extremely attractive, hinge is not flimsy, the entire laptop has a great feel and quality to it. The audio is really outstanding, loud and clear, you can play Youtube music videos while on the table or counter top and hear the music very well across the room, something my more Dell cant do. Set up took just under 10 minutes. Friendly language rather than commands used to guide you through the process so makes the experience of a new laptop even more exciting and fun. This is my daughter's laptop and she uses for college work. She uploaded Microsoft Office Home & Student 2016 and works great. Has the CD DVD RW tray, along with 2 USB 2 and 1 USB 3 ports. HDMI ready as well. Wireless connection easy. Bluetooth capability. Keyboard is quiet and smooth, and responsive, not clicky.  Operates on Windows 10 with Microsoft Edge and you are going to want to change the settings Edge opens with or you'll be force fed news feeds every time you start the Edge browser.  Sometimes you need a break from the world.  Click three dots on top right (not the cog wheel) and go to settings and down to ""A specific page"" and change to Bing or another search engine you enjoy or a homepage.Laptop has pretty decent forward facing camera. This laptop is not a touchscreen, and pixel display is not as sharp or deep as say a Sony or Dell laptop, but the colors look true and pretty good for a laptop priced so affordably!  One more small thing, comes in an attractive, easy to wrap Asus box for gift giving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZL15J3VWM04E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KFQASE#wasThisHelpful","R1ZL15J3VWM04E","A1CCMW354ELJ3U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CCMW354ELJ3U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They commented it was more heavy tight filled from other bags, as a woman it did not impact me too hard when I tried it due to the one inch foam under the leather this bag is wrapped in.  We don't kick but thinking of lowering it and trying it someday.

"Pay attention parents!  Your schools and counselors are not going to get your kid prepared unless you educate yourselves as well and make sure your kids are getting the best of opportunities. The cousnelors and staff are not always looking out for your kid and helping them get into college with scholarships, advice, etc I have first hand knowledge.  It is seemingly assumed you have done this before, several degrees and even graduated from high school.  But high school steam rolled over my child, even tho a National Honor Society kid, and now we are playing catch up while she is in college.  But even for us this book is extremely informative and helpful as we go along every semester and very much still valuable but you are going to want this book if your kid is in any high school grade.

"Bolder taste than Canada Dry.  Just a tad after taste but it is slight.  This is a great choice to get away from the harmful effects of Aspertame in diet drinks.  LOVE that it is caffeine free!  We have become such caffeine junkies but truthfully it is hard to find a restaurant or soda fountain that offers anything zero calorie that is caffeine free.  I hope the trend of more choices continues with drinks like this one.  This is pretty great in mixed alcohol drinks such as with gin.  However I feel the flavor is going to be off putting for some and still more tweaking on flavor needs done but high fresh carbonation makes this an easy drink to have.I also appreciate that my young Type 1 diabetic daughter can drink this and I won't have to worry about the aspartame effects on her body.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R183LZR256BHZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZK6H5HU#wasThisHelpful","R183LZR256BHZP","A1CCMW354ELJ3U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CCMW354ELJ3U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm sorry, I really wanted to enjoy this book but it's just not enjoyable nor interesting.  If I had to take a shot at the premise behind this book, I would say a therapist has at some time asked her to write down childhood slights & sadness in a binder.  And that's how it reads, a hodge podge of brief stories and some of them just seemed more private and unnecessary really, and made me feel icky like I was peering into George's homes, which for him were his sanctuaries, where we all like to think we lead private lives.Most people can curse, you use expletives to highlight a situation or make fun or light of something.  She curses in a vile, hostile way meant to degrade and devalue others.  It repulses instead of adding anything to her story.This author is a product of the 60's, as am I, and I remember the strong feminist mantra that it was insulting to raise your own children in the 60's&70's.  She posts a couple paragraphs on how intelligent her mother was and far too smart to ever be a stay at home mom.  But this is 2015 and we all know better, and raising your own children rather than paying another woman to do it, is extremely valuable to society/community and the family and very intelligent well educated women are leaving jobs/professions to raise their children to return later if they choose.  Point being, there is just no evolution here in this author, like she is locked in the mindset, thoughts and agendas of the 60's. A bitter clinger.  No point to this book for me and felt creepy after reading it.  Poor George.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17F8G5VCVA68Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250058252#wasThisHelpful","R17F8G5VCVA68Y","A1CCMW354ELJ3U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CCMW354ELJ3U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Not something new to me just not sure why I have never used for our pets before.  Now that I know it can be this convenient to use I will.

"Love everything about this pack  This is top of the line, amazing quality.  Tightly woven supple materials, thick smooth zippers, sturdy buckle, enough pockets and zippers for virtually any excursion, including airline travel.I don't understand the strap complaints at all?  They are very thick and cushy and have anti sweat cooling material on the inside of the straps and down the back of the pack where it sits on your back. I don't want any larger or cushiony straps for a day pack for sure.  For one it would look unbalanced and unnecessary, it's not a ""hike the mountains"" for a week kind of pack.  Love the ease of the pull down thumb straps to tighten and secure your load on your back.  Soft, thick lined or padded pockets for protection of your smart phones, tablets, & smaller laptops.My daughter is starting out her college semester with this pack, but we also will use for our day hikes, horseback trail rides, and airline travel.  This pack is rugged and made to last!  The orange is bright, I'd call it close to hunter orange and plan to use this when we ride our horses in the wilderness during deer season to carry water and basic needs for the day.  It never hurts to have plenty of orange on even if in no hunting areas.  The bottom a drab army green.  Bright, easy to find no matter where you stow it away.

"This cowboy ""takes a hold of the reins"". I liked his big presence or persona in the writing of this book. A good atmosphere set early on to listen and focus on what he is telling you (he doesn't suggest, he is firm.). Good lessons in why to farm out the work to good employees, but may have to continue their education if they ask questions or actions that they haven't really thought through (the Katelyn Rule). Sometimes employees just want to hear themselves talk, be acknowledged, and not really think about what they are asking or doing.He asks you to make a list of all your customers from a 12 month period, organize the list in descending order of revenue, split the list into four equal groups, noting the top 25% revenue and the bottom 25% revenue. Asks you to drop the bottom 25%, ""the minnows"", and focus on the 25% top, ""the whales"", and drop the minnows, even if the bottom minnows contain long, loyal clients. However any one of the whales could swim off, get caught in a whalers ship and made to blubber. While being a cowgirl myself, I was always taught to dance with the one that ""brung ya"". So in our business, we co-op the minnows, or rather make a ""school of minnows"" if you will, into the shape of a whale. All resources are put into that area for that day or time frame so no added expenses and the co-op pays off as one big whale and you take care of the ones that built your business from the ground up. But not my book.As I read deeper into the book, it felt like many of the companies he used as examples where sponsoring him and therefore he has to kudos their business in the book. I also felt this was a revenge book at times, but hey, if I write a book I will get revenge too. Not a problemThis book does have a lot to offer and I liked his style and was never offended by him at all if that matters. He does not come off as a ""know it all"" or pompous, more like he takes the bull by the horns (that whole cowboy thing again.) so he does keep you engaged, interested and absolutely you will find value in this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SKVZACV3TU7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599185741#wasThisHelpful","R1SKVZACV3TU7R","A1CCMW354ELJ3U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CCMW354ELJ3U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:15 Mins Had no problems with any of our several dogs trying this, it passed the taste test.  You may have to get over needing to have colorful ""meaty"" looking nuggets (unnecessary dyes), as this nugget is solid tan color (see vid).  Love the front ziplock style opening and plastic bag.  No ripping, tearing or gnawing on a feed bag and nuggets falling out of the rolled up paper sack.  I am not an animal nutritionist, but from what the company website shows these are well researched feed products.

"This Classic Chutes and Ladders Board Game is the classic 1970s Board game many of us played as kids, No bells and whistles no computers. Climb up Ladders and slide down Chutes in the fun game of ups and downs. Your  character goal is to progress along and make it to square marked 100 first. it's not so easy to get there. If you land on a good deed, you go up a ladder, but if you land on the wrong spot (a bad deed) and you'll shoot down a chute! There are many interpretations of what it all means, but I think critics overplay putting to much meaning into it. The game teaches you that Good Deed's take you to where you want to go and bad one stake you backwards. You just Spin the spinner to move your Player piece. Its a very inexpensive game and fu for the whole family its for age 4 and up, and it fun for the whole, family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLTM9ZOIEV3X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V82MG2O#wasThisHelpful","RLTM9ZOIEV3X8","A386NVAVQV5WUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A386NVAVQV5WUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There not a miracle cure but they are helping with my digestive issues. I highly recommend adding a probiotic to your diet. Get them from a high quality manufacturer loe viva Labs, look for at least 5 strains if probiotic there are 6 on these and find a good level for yourself. for Dieters its good to start with 50 Billion CFU for 6 weeks and then up it to 100 Billion CFU.

"5 Star performance, 2 star Video. Ok the negative first. the video and audio is about a 2 1/2 the Video is not crisp and there is a bit of a hum in the audio. They put a graphic on the screen an American Flag with Van Halen symbol up in the left corner, and a photo of David Lee Roth on the right side. It says Live rarities at the top and U.S. Festival 1983 at the bottom. The concert is on the middle of the flag its old TV style size, it would of been better to just let it fill as much of the HDTV screen as possible, but its still watchable. Having said all that, its really hard to get anything LIVE from the Best years of Van Halen, the DLR years. This set list blows away any of there concerts in the Van Hagar years. So if you want a copy of the US festival hear it is, warts and all, as it is. It would be nice if VH went back and did some releases from this era. Quality releasees.

"These Sugar free Gummy Bears taste really good and have the same texture and chewiness as regular ones. Also this is a good price for 2 pounds of candy. The only proviso is most sugar free candies have to be eaten in small quantities, because the sugar substitute causes gas and also can work as a laxative (which can come in handy if your on a low carb diet) . Still I would recommend them for those of us who need sugar free.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RIZT4Y7NCCMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMS8RQC#wasThisHelpful","R3RIZT4Y7NCCMM","A386NVAVQV5WUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A386NVAVQV5WUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And they have a really strong feel. They can absorbed allot and they feel durable. There also nice looking. I like them allot, I am sold. I will buy some more of these to add to the set they sent me.

You turn it on and on by pulling it open (up) and off by closing (down) it. It uses three AA batteries and has a bright LED light, it puts out 120 Lumens for 7-8 hours.

"My daughter (12) reviewed this book for Mother Daughter Book Reviews.  Here is her review:This book tells the story of Fiona Thorn, ornery orphan who has a penchant for explosives and who goes on a mission to rescue her friend, Jaydin Rowan. But when she runs into three annoying princesses whom she is unable to get rid of, all four of them get locked up in the dungeon. Now, Fiona is accused of kidnapping the princesses because she has a rough past with the king who is in danger of being killed. Now Fiona must find a way to save herself and the constantly bickering princesses, save the king, and finally save her friend Jaydin before the “magical debt” kills her.The main character is Fiona Thorn who is an orphan who likes explosives, has a talking horse as her best friend, and who just desperately wants to find her imprisoned friend Jaydin before a magical debt kills her.  I really liked the part with the princesses because it was funny to listen to them argue and I really liked the youngest princess (Cricket) because she was awesome. I didn’t really understand what was going on at the start of the book but when I got further into the book I started to understand.  I learned that it is important to stand by your friends and to always be there for them.I thought the cover was cool and really eye-catching because it looks really mysterious. However, it could use a little bit more color because everything looked bluish.  Overall, I thought this book was really cool and I couldn’t put it down because I kept thinking things like “Why is this happening?” and “What’s going to happen next?”I think girls and boys 8-12 would like this book.  I would give the book 4.5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O86856B97WJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095ZITN6#wasThisHelpful","R2O86856B97WJI","A1AZMG5BMYGSS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AZMG5BMYGSS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sherrill Cannon delivers another whimsical rhyming tale with an important underlying lesson about learning to be a good listener in the delightful Mice & Spiders & Webs … Oh My!  I love being surprised when reading a story, and this newest tale by one of our favorite picture book authors certainly delivers!In Mice & Spiders & Webs … Oh My!, the reader is introduced to Rosemary who comes home from school distressed after her teacher tells the students that a mouse and a spider are soon coming to the class.  Or at least, that’s what Rosemary HEARD the  teacher say. In order to put her daughter’s mind at ease, Rosemary’s mother takes her to see the teacher who explains exactly what was said.  Turns out that Rosemary had not listened very carefully to her teacher; but, you’ll have to read the story to discover what the teacher actually said (definitely worth a chuckle!)I love Sherrill Cannon’s style.  She is an absolute master of rhyming (no, seriously, I don’t know how she does it!).  Each story features a relatable main character who is always a young girl or boy the same age as the target audience.  There is always an important message underlying the story (in this case, about being a good listener) and the illustrations are so kid-friendly.  In true Cannon style, the illustrations feature characters from previous books as well as the covers from her other books in the background.  I love this added element of “hide-and-seek”.  It’s value-added for true Sherrill Cannon fans.My Bottom Line:  Mice & Spiders & Webs… Oh My! features a wonderful rhyming tale with an important underlying message about “being a good listener”.  As an added bonus, the book also features bright and kid-friendly illustrations with cameo appearances of characters and covers from previous books.  I highly recommend this (and other books by Sherrill S. Cannon) for children ages 4  to 8 years.* This book was provided to me by the author in exchange for my honest review.

"This review was completed by my 12 year old daughter for Mother Daughter Book Reviews.DAUGHTER SAYS:This book tells the story of a boy named Jim who abandons his little sister to go see a haunted cabin; but then he accidentally travels back through time to the year 1838 where we meet Hannah and her family.  They are doing their regular chores when a boy appears out of the haunted cabin.  He says his name is Jim. Hannah and Jim become friends and they must solve a murder and track down a criminal but it makes things so much harder when the criminal is able to travel back and forth through time, stealing from two different times.There are two main characters.  First there is Jim, who lives in the present day and who is very mischievous and gets into lots of trouble. Second, there is Hannah, who is a girl from 1838 and who is always doing chores and more chores but she finally gets to have fun when Jim comes to her time. I thought the book cover was really cool and really eye-catching. It also looks very realistic. I don’t really have a favorite part (I liked it all!) but I really liked how Hannah and Jim had to keep traveling through time to catch up to the villain. It was really cool how the villain needed things from both time periods.  I thought the book was very interesting and mysterious. It was a really good book. I couldn’t put it down and read it very quickly.  Very exciting!! I think girls and boys ages 8-12 would really enjoy this book.

"My daughter (12) read and reviewed this book for Mother Daughter Book Reviews.This book tells the fractured fairy tale story of Goldilocks. Goldilocks is fairly new to Grimm academy and wants to make a lot of new friends but when she gets an invitation to join E.V.I.L. society she finally feels like she has friends. But she doesn’t really want to be a villain so when Red, Cinda, Snow and Rapunzel discover Goldilock’s invitation, they realize that Goldilocks could help them defeat E.V.I.L. society! Now Goldilocks must figure out a way to pretend to be a member of E.V.I.L. and keep it a secret.I really liked how Goldie was like a double agent pretending to work for E.V.I.L., except she was actually trying to stop E.V.I.L. I always like books where the villain is pretending to be nice because they think the main character is on their side until they realize that the main character is actually trying to stop them.  I learned from this book that all you need to do to make friends is to be true to yourself and don’t try to be anyone else.  It’s really hard to be the new kid in a school, but in time, you make friends who are just like you.I really liked the cover of the book. It’s really cool because at first glance you think, “Oh look!  It’s the Library of Grimm Academy with random stuff in it”. But when you look at it closely you realize that it’s the “B” section of the library and everything starts with the letter “B” (bears, books, bubbles, basket, banjo, bell, butterfly) everything except for Goldilocks and her ring of keys (which she uses to open a safe in the library).I thought this book was really cool and fun. I read it in only one sitting  because I couldn’t put it down!  I think girls 7-12 would like this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PCV9MX6VXY9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545783941#wasThisHelpful","R3PCV9MX6VXY9A","A1AZMG5BMYGSS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AZMG5BMYGSS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Dreamscape""!  I love the melding of a gaming world with real life and real consequences.  The plot is well-paced and I was delighted that it was unpredictable, providing the reader with a few unexpected twists and turns.  The main character, Alex, was relatable and very well-written.  I liked that she was not perfect and that she experienced real thoughts and emotions as you would expect from that age group.

"Welcome to Mars: Making a Home on the Red Planet is co-authored by famous astronaut, Buzz Aldrin who is a strong advocate for space exploration, and Marianne Dyson, who is an award-winning author and former NASA flight controller.  In short… these are the experts and they make a very compelling case for the possibility of living on Mars in the future.  This book will stretch the imagination of young minds – the future thinkers and explorers.The book begins with a description of the tools for space exploration (i.e., space crafts, space rovers, and more) followed by a discussion of the history of Martian exploration and a presentation of what we already know about the “Red Planet”. The book even contains a topographical map of Mars – it’s just incredible!The second half of the book is dedicated to using our imagination to think about what living on Mars would look like and some of the issues we would need to address for it to be habitable.  For example, there is no breathable air, it is extremely cold, there is no free-running water, no vegetation, no rain, and far less gravity than Earth (does this mean I would be “lighter”?) There are a series of crisp photographs, groovy illustrations, and even some dioramas depicting things such as high-tech space suits, the dusty rust-colored Martian landscape, and tripped-out bio-domes containing all that is needed to live comfortably.  The cynic in me is converting to the idea that it may indeed be possible to live on Mars!My Bottom Line:  Welcome to Mars: Making a Home on the Red Planet features an eye-catching collection of photographs and illustrations and is full of the latest science-based information about Mars, space travel, and more.  As with other children from generations passed, who gazed up in wonder toward the night sky, this book tests the limits of the reader’s imagination by challenging them to envision life on the Red Planet.

"Brain Games features five chapters worth of mind-bending games, challenges, puzzles, and fast facts designed to explore the limits of the human brain.  Among the contents covered in the book include an overview of how your brain turns senses into thoughts; how the brain makes memories; how the brain deals with emotions; how the brain makes decisions; and, how the brain directs the body’s movement.Within each chapter there are a number of sections, each beginning with a challenge (e.g., “Draw a circle with your left hand and AT THE SAME TIME draw a straight line with your right hand.” or “Start singing the ABC song. Did you get it right? Most people learn that song when they are very young. But you don’t sing it every day, so why was your brain able to recall it?”) Afterwards, there is a simple scientific explanation that describes how the brain is operating to account for how the reader responds to the challenge. Also peppered throughout the text are little sidebars cleverly entitled “Mind Matters”.  These contain little snippets of information about the power of the brain.As with other National Geographic Kids titles, Brain Games is a beautiful book that is laid out in an eye-catching, child-friendly way using varying and colorful fonts, gorgeous photographs, and interesting infographics.  But this book in particular is a visual delight with its fun and entertaining “Brain Breaks”.  My kids and I had so much fun flipping through the book and just looking for those!My Bottom Line: Brain Games is another winner from National Geographic Kids! Full of activities, puzzles and fun, this information-packed and beautifully illustrated book will fill your children’s minds while exploring the wonders of the most powerful computer in existence.

I learned that Kittens between the ages of 2-8 weeks must be held and petted every day or else they will remain wild.

"This book was reviewed by my 8 year old son for Mother Daughter Book Reviews.SON SAYS:This book is about a bunch of animals that are like, the biggest, the deadliest, the smallest, the fastest, the slowest, the weirdest and stuff like that.  It’s a big book with lots of information about animals that I know about already and lots that I had never seen before.I really love all of the pictures and the cover and I spend a lot of time flipping through the book just looking at the pictures.  One of my favorites is of the sun bear.  It’s funny because it has a really long tongue (154).  Another really cool picture is the one of the basset hound and the clumber spaniel because it looks like they are wearing a jacket.  Their skin is sagging and they look floppy. (105). There are some pictures that are really cool, but really weird, like the picture of the Japanese giant salamander (23).I really like looking at the pictures and learning about animals. There are animals I’ve never heard of before and I liked learning about them.  The goblin sharks looks evil; luckily they swim very deep in the ocean (1,300 meters).  I liked the section about “Killer Instincts” that talked about how animals kill things like, “death by drowing” (crocodile), “death by stomping” (?), “death by swiping” (polar bear), “death by chomping” (?, “death by confusion” (black eagle), and “death by electrocution” (?).The book was really good and I want to read more books like this one.

"My 12 year old daughter wrote this review for Mother Daughter Book Reviews:This book is about is about a mortal girl who attends MOA (Mount Olympus Academy and who has snakes for hair named Medusa. Medusa is tired of being bested by her two older sisters so when she has a chance to be better, she decides to take that chance and enters the Comicontest. The only problem is, the entry fee is 15 drachmas, which Medusa does not have. But then king Midas gives Medusa his golden touch – a power to turn anything she touches into gold. But after a while the golden touch doesn’t really seem like a great thing.I really liked how usually in the Goddess Girls books, the four most popular goddesses of MOA (Athena, Aphrodite, Artemis and Persephone) aren’t exactly nice to Medusa; however, in this book, they are all helping Medusa.I learned that you should be grateful for what you already have because there is always something worse that could happen.  I thought this book was really good. I really like how the author tells a different version of Greek Mythology. It’s really cool.I think girls 7-12 would like this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N8ZWPVKBVF1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442488298#wasThisHelpful","R2N8ZWPVKBVF1S","A1AZMG5BMYGSS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AZMG5BMYGSS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* My 12 year-old daughter reviewed this book for Mother Daughter Book Reviews. *This book is about five cousins (Cagney, Olivia, Tess, Lizzy and Aidan) who go on vacation to Peru with their grandma who goes missing when they land.  They then discover that there is a hidden treasure somewhere but someone is planning to steal it. So the cousins must foil the villain’s evil plans and find the treasure first. I liked how it was Tess that saved all the cousins because it is basically saying that young kids are capable of being very brave. There were lots of parts that I really liked. It was a fun mystery and adventure.I don’t think it made sense how the grandma had a connection with everyone in Peru and that she would abandon her grandchildren in a strange country. Also why did the kids get grounded because:a) they saved the treasure; andb) the grandma brought them to Peru and abandoned them so why is the grandma not in trouble?Overall, I thought that the book was pretty funny and cool and I really learned a lot about Peru. At some parts it was confusing, but overall, the story was awesometastic!  I think kids 8-12 would like this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQEHIJOM0Q7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOJAC68#wasThisHelpful","R2AQEHIJOM0Q7Y","A1AZMG5BMYGSS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AZMG5BMYGSS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*This review was completed by my 12 year-old daughter for the website Mother Daughter Book Reviews.*This book tells the true story of Jack and the beanstalk. Jack always craves for adventure. One day the giants come down to his world wrecking his town and stealing food and farm animals. However, the giants have taken something very important to Jack. He finds himself and his little sister Annabella in the world of the giants where everything is massive, trying to take back what is his.The main characters are Jack and Annabella, who are brother and sister. Jack is very adventurous but never gets any fun, that is until he climbs up the beanstalk into the world of the giants. Annabella is Jack’s younger sister, when she realizes Jack is missing she goes off to find him, in the world of the giants.One of my favorite parts was when a giant picked Jack up and brought him to the kitchen where she worked. It was funny because she assumed that she could just claim him like she did with Tom (who is a person the same size as Jack an who Jack meets in the kitchen). The good thing though is that Jack and Tom become friends and then Tom tries to help Jack find what he needs.I learned that there are types of books called fractured fairy tales which are basically a different story of a fairy tale.The cover was pretty good. If I were in a book store or library looking for a book and if I saw this one, I would probably choose it because the cover is cool. I thought the book was really exciting and I liked how in the story, not all giants were mean.  I think girls and boys 8-12 would like this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R10KP5WDQWE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385755791#wasThisHelpful","R1R10KP5WDQWE2","A1AZMG5BMYGSS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AZMG5BMYGSS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son's review - he's 8!This book is about a girl, Doyli, who saves monkeys in the Amazon forest in Peru. There is also lots information and pictures that show what life is like in the Amazon forest. The photos were good and the monkeys were adorable. My favorites were the ones of the animals and the forest. I really liked the part where the monkey thief gets caught by the police and they put him in jail. I liked learning about Doyli and how she rescues monkeys.It seems like living in the Amazon can be dangerous because there are snakes and caimans and jaguars and that there are a lot of monkeys. They travel in canoes on the Amazon and they get their water from the Amazon. I also learned about how they are cutting down all of the trees in the Amazon and that is a very bad thing. The book also says that sometimes the kids can’t afford to go to school. That’s sad.It was a very interesting book. I like books about facts and especially books about animals, but I don’t like it when they mix facts with a story. I think monkeys would like this book – just kidding! I think kids who are young like, younger than me, and their parents would like this book (and people who like monkeys).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE5G2RUUKOZ49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933987227#wasThisHelpful","RE5G2RUUKOZ49","A1AZMG5BMYGSS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AZMG5BMYGSS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was reviewed by Mother Daughter Book Reviews on their website.Daylight Starlight Wildlife is a beautiful work of art which reminded me of bedtime classics for young children such as Time for Bed by Mem Fox and I Love You as Much… by Laura Krauss Melmed and illustrated by Henri Sorenson.  I never tired of reading these books which featured soft lilting rhymes while gazing at the gorgeous illustrations magically capturing a wide variety of wildlife on full page spreads.To be clear though… Daylight Starlight Wildlife is NOT a rhyming book.Not only is Daylight Starlight Wildlife an absolutely beautiful book to thumb through but it is educational as well.  Animals are depicted in their natural habitat engaging in behavior at the appropriate time of day.  Children will see a majestic red-tailed hawk soaring high into the sunny sky and will flip the page to see a barn owl flying in the night sky with a bright full moon in the background. I love the inclusion of some more “unusual” animals such as the flying squirrel, the luna moth, an adorable family of opossum, and a bobcat and her kitten.  It’s a bit of a shame that there were two different varieties of owls instead of a completely different animal (a bat anyone?), but there is still quite the diversity of animals depicted in the book with some of their key features described through the text.I highly recommend this beautiful picture book as a bedtime book for children ages 3 to 8 and would think that it would be a great choice as a read-aloud book in a kindergarten or early elementary school class.* I received a copy of this book free-of-charge from Penguin Books in exchange for my honest opinion.

"*** 5 Bright Shining Stars ***My daughter (12) and I (the Mom) read and reviewed this book for Mother Daughter Book Reviews. Here are excerpts from our reviews, but full our detailed reviews can be found on our website (just search us!)DAUGHTER SAYS:  My favorite part in the book was when they did the experiment for the hair color because the kids realized that the black people were being treated unfairly.  I didn’t like how they treated the black people. I especially was disappointed by how the teacher had pretended that she liked Beverly but then gave another teacher a note that insulted Beverly. And then there was the mom who was really rude to Beverly. And I really didn’t like that. This book made me sad to see how Beverly AND Hattie were getting treated. Beverly was getting treated poorly just because she was black and Hattie was getting treated poorly because she was friends with Beverly.The title “Between the Lines” comes from Crackers who tells Hattie she needs to step outside the lines to make a difference in the world.  Throughout the book, Hattie ponders what Crackers means by this and she comes up with many different meanings.  What Hattie learns is that she can stay “Between the Lines” (i.e., play by the rules), but still make a difference in the world with the way she treats people.  She realizes that everybody should be treated the same.  I really loved this book. That is all I can say other than THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!! I think girls 11-14 years old would like this book.MOM SAYS:  There are so many reasons to love this wonderfully crafted piece of historical fiction for middle grade.  Claudia Whitsitt effectively uses stream of consciousness to allow the reader to experience Hattie’s thoughts and emotions as she learns first hand about racism after she befriends a black girl in the aftermath of the Detroit riots in 1967.  Peppered with historical facts, reflections on the social and systemic root causes of racial discrimination and oppression, as well as many heart-wrenching examples of both overt and covert racist thoughts and actions, Between the Lines is a masterfully written and evocative story for tweens that will leave a lasting impression on a generation of readers who are the future leaders of our society.  I highly recommend this wonderful book to children ages 8 and older and in particular for mid to upper elementary classrooms seeking a book to elicit a discussion about racism.

"My daughter, (12 years old) reviewed this book for Mother Daughter Book Reviews.  She gives the book 4.5 stars.  Here are her thoughts:This book is about a girl named Juliet who hears voices and sees visions. She discovers a series of murders that she thinks are connected but she doesn’t know how or why. When she starts trying to figure out what’s going on, she thinks her grandfather, who tells her strange stories about the wind spirit and coyote, is somehow involved. Then she discovers something incredible that will change her forever.I think that the book cover is pretty cool. At first I had no clue what the symbol was but then I read the book and knew right away what it meant.  My favorite part was when Juliet discovered her powers and how you suddenly understand what the voices mean.  I didn’t really like how the final battle between Juliet and the villain (the seeker) was really short. I think it should have been longer because I liked the ways she was using her powers.  It was really cool. Also it usually takes longer to defeat the villain.Overall I thought the book was really entertaining and cool. I would give it 4 1/2 stars.  I think boys and girls 13 and older would like this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REYV7F0XVWWT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1622533143#wasThisHelpful","REYV7F0XVWWT7","A1AZMG5BMYGSS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AZMG5BMYGSS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I give this book 3.5 stars if the target audience is middle grade readers.We’ve reviewed middle grade books set in Egypt before.  Some involved mystery and adventure in modern day Egypt (e.g., The Secret of the Sacred Scarab by Fiona Ingram) and others involved time-travel back to ancient Egypt (e.g., The Golden Scarab by S.W. Lothian).  The Hidden Chamber in the Great Sphinx by Linda Cadose represents another foray into Egyptian history, merging mystery, historical fact, and science fiction.  And, as we all know by now, I am a big fan of Egyptian (and Greek) history and mythology.The story in The Hidden Chamber in the Great Sphinx centres around an archaeological discovery (a real one in fact!): that, hidden underneath the right paw of the Great Sphinx lies a hidden chamber.  While in reality, the Egyptian government has refused to issue a permit to dig and explore the chamber, in this book, Cadose speculates about what might be uncovered should the chamber be opened.  Thus, when Dr. Khalid Saad (an Egyptian archaeologist) obtains the permit, he calls up his friend Dr. Cliff Post (an American archaeologist and the main character in the story) to assist him with the excavation.Tensions arise when Dr. Saad’s rival, Dr. Hosnee Sadat joins their research team.  Dr. Sadat holds a well-publicized disdain for American archaeologists who do work in Egypt fearing they steal from dig sites and sell Egyptian artifacts on the Black Market.  As “accidents” begin to happen, leaked media reports are aired, and Dr. Post is kidnapped, fingers are pointed all around as to who is sabotaging the dig.  Could it be that someone is desperate to get their hands on the contents of the chamber:  13 mysterious crystal skulls believed to be a super-computer?The major strength of this book is the detailed descriptions of Egyptian history including information about the theories behind the building of the pyramids, mummification, hieroglyphics, and mythology and religion.  Further, Cadose spends a great deal of time educating her readers on the art, science, and processes behind archaeology.  These educational components are interwoven with the storyline.  I think that upper middle grade children would learn so much about all of these things from this book.  I would say that the educational value of this book is high.  That being said, I did feel that sometimes the main plot was “interrupted” by the lengthy descriptions.  I also would have liked more details about the plot which did feel a bit rushed in some spots.The storyline itself involves suspense and mystery.  The anticipation builds as the archaeological team gets closer to discovering what is hidden in the chamber.  We discover that there are 13 crystal skulls (a scene reminiscent of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) in the chamber, with the theory being that they are a super-computer planted there in the distant past by aliens.  Alongside this discovery, Dr. Cliff Post is the victim of a number of incidents clearly placing him in grave danger.  The mystery builds throughout the story as the culprit behind these incidents is revealed.One of the things I was wondering about is how an adult main character would go over with a middle grade audience.  Most of the middle grade books we have reviewed involve main characters who are roughly the same age as the target audience, but in this case, the main character, Dr. Cliff Post, is an adult male. Part of the storyline involves his deepening relationship with his girlfriend/fiance Lisa and her son Max but I’m not sure this would be of interest to middle grade readers.My Bottom Line: Egyptian history, mystery and intrigue are key components of this fast-paced thriller which has high educational value and a twisting plot.  I think upper middle grade children who are interested in stories set in Egypt and who love suspense would enjoy this book.  Ages 10+.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22MPHTYXURWFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1468508075#wasThisHelpful","R22MPHTYXURWFU","A1AZMG5BMYGSS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AZMG5BMYGSS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BookReview:SonsoftheSphinxbyCherylCarpinello808 Apr 2015ancient egypt, cheryl carpinello, children's book, history, middle grade, review, sons of the sphinx, tweensby Renee @ Mother Daughter Book ReviewsSons of the Sphinx by Cheryl CarpinelloTitle: Sons of the Sphinx | Author: Cheryl Carpinello | Publication Date: October 10, 2014 | Publisher: Independent | Pages: 182 | Recommended Ages: 10+Amazon Buy ButtonSummary  Armed with what she considers her grandmother’s curse, 15-year-old Rosa agrees to help the ghost of King Tut find his lost queen Hesena. Though Hesena’s ba inhabits part of Rosa, finding the whole spirit of Hesena so that she and Tut can be together for the first time in over 3000 years proves to be a harder task than Rosa first thinks. Thrust back into Ancient Egypt with Tut, Rosa discovers that finding Hesena is not all she must do. She must keep out of the reach of the living Horemheb – who crosses mortal boundaries using Seth’s evil magic – if she is to stay alive to make it back home.MyReviewRenee AvatarMOM SAYSMy Thoughts:  Rosa is no ordinary 10th grader.  She can hear and speak to ghosts – a gift she finds vexing at best.  But her life is turned upside down when the ghost of King Tut appears at her side telling her that the spirit of his one true love, Ankhesenamun (Hesena), resides within her.  Tut only has 7 days to travel back in time to find Ay, a trusted family friend, who can reveal the location of Ankhesenamun’s final resting place, thus bringing the two together for the rest of eternity.Standing in their way is General Horemheb, who with the help of the evil Egyptian God Seth, will stop at nothing to change the history books making his lineage the rulers of Egypt and portraying Tut’s family as traitors to Egypt.  Travel back in time with Rosa in this well-written thriller plunging readers into the fascinating and often sordid history of ancient Egypt and its many rulers.Cheryl Carpinello managed to draw me into the story from the first chapter as we are introduced to Rosa, the main character who is telling the story from her perspective.  I couldn’t help but feel sympathetic toward Rosa as a character who doesn’t quite fit in, but who also experiences what every teenage girl dreams about:  the sudden appearance of a young attractive man who needs her help ~  *swoon*.  Ok, maybe he is looking to be reunited with his one true love (not Rosa) and he (and his love) happen to be ghosts; but, still… it’s very romantic.  Carpinello effectively deals with the tension among this “triangle” of characters: Rosa, Tut, and Hesena.Aside from these characters, there are a few Egyptian characters who play important roles in the overall plot including Ay, the Pharaoh who rose to the throne after King Tut died, and the evil General Horemheb who is able to step between the world of the living and dead to be a constant threat to Rosa’s life and to Tut’s mission.  Tut spends a considerable amount of time unraveling the history of his family for Rosa’s (as well as the reader’s) benefit, correcting any misconceptions she may have had along the way.  This was a clever way to introduce Egyptian history to young readers.  The author includes a glossary of Egyptian Gods, Egyptian people with historical significance, and Egyptian places and terms.  I found this to be helpful, but I felt that Tut’s family tree at the beginning of the book would have been helpful as many of the names were somewhat similar, shortened forms of names were sometimes used, and most of the names were difficult to pronounce.As we’ve seen with her other books (e.g., Guinevere: On the Eve of Legend, Young Knights of the Round Table:  The King’s Ransom), one of the strengths of Cheryl Carpinello as an author is to indulge young readers with theories and hypotheses around some of the most popular legends of our time (e.g., Arthurian legend, the mysteries surrounding King Tut’s life and death).  Carpinello has done her research and is so successful at immersing readers in these legends by creating vividly detailed historical fiction whereby the characters from these legends are featured in the stories themselves.For example, through Tut’s narrative, we learn that his father, Akhenaten was the first Pharaoh to move from polydeism (the worship of many gods) to monodeism (the worship of one god).  We also learn details (i.e., theories) surrounding Tut’s death, Pharaoh Ay’s death, and the rise of General Horemheb to power all occurring within the 18th Dynasty.  There is an incredible amount of educational value to Sons of the Sphinx.My Bottom Line:Sons of the Sphinx is a time-travel thriller featuring a race against time with the stakes being King Tut being separated from his beloved Queen Ankhesenamun for all of eternity as well as the history books forever portraying King Tut’s family as traitors to the people of Egypt.  I recommend this exciting story to children ages 11 and older who enjoy reading stories about ancient Egypt or who are just looking for their next great adventure.*I received a copy of this book free-of-charge from the author in exchange for my honest opinion.

"RapidReview:HankHasaDreambyRebeccaDudley030 Mar 2015book review, children's book, dreams, kidlit, picture book, rapid reviewby Renee @ Mother Daughter Book ReviewsHank Has a DreamTitle: Hank Has a Dream | Creator: Rebecca Dudley | Publication Date: September 15, 2014 | Publisher: Peter Pauper Press | Pages: 32 | Recommended Age: 2 to 7amazon buy buttonSummary: In this poetic tale, Hank dreams that he can fly. Come along for the ride as he recreates the dream for his little friend. How far will Hank fly? What will he see? How high will he go? These dreamland mysteries capture his friend’s imagination and they will capture yours too. The enchanting images of Rebecca Dudley’s meticulously crafted dioramas set the scene for this gentle fantasy. Readers will set sail, gliding through Hank’s world as he discovers the wonders of flight and the magic of friendship. This gentle, uplifting fantasy by the author of the bestselling Hank Finds an Egg highlights the magic of friendship and lets young readers’ imagination soar. Rebecca Dudley’s highly praised, hand-crafted dioramas and characters — combined with minimal text — will entertain and delight.MyRapidReviewRenee AvatarMOM SAYSMy Thoughts:  Using beautiful hand-crafted dioramas, the reader is taken on a magical journey with Hank, an adorable stuffed monkey(?), over land and sea and even above the clouds. Using full two page spreads, the author creates mirror images of individual scenes.  On the left hand side, Hank shares his dream with his friend, the hummingbird, taking him through the forest, over grassy knolls, sitting precariously atop a rope bridge, swinging playfully on a vine, and through other outdoor settings detailed meticulously by the author, Rebecca Dudley.  On the right hand side, we see Hank in identical poses, dreaming of floating in a delicate, elegantly crafted air ship. The effect is simply enchanting!Hank Has a Dream is a piece of art that families will grow to treasure.  What is evident to me is the love the author has poured into the book creating each individual scene with incredible attention to detail. Elements of individual scenes including the air ship, trees, vines, hills, flowers, water, down to the last blade of grass, were created using every day materials such as clay, fabric, wire, paper and each scene was then photographed keeping lighting, shading, and perspective in mind.  I spent a great deal of time just marveling at the details in each scene.  Incredible!Hank Has a Dream features meticulously hand-crafted dioramas of natural landscapes coupled with simple text to transport the reader on a magical journey through forests, over grassy hills, and high above the clouds.  This is the perfect bedtime book to share with young children who will marvel at the magical scenes and who, just like hummingbird,will demand, “Tell me again!”.

"Ok, so when this book was offered to me through the Book Depository’s Book Review Programme, I have to admit that I was very curious. I had, of course, heard of the first book by the same author, the one about sleeping, and I jumped on the opportunity to grab a copy of the second book in the series so I could see what the fuss is all about.This book is designed as a rhyming picture book that features a number of frustrated Dads trying to”encourage” their child to eat the food they have prepared. The children depicted in the book range vary by gender, age, and race – so that’s one positive thing about the book. The illustrations are bright and cheerful and are actually quite child-friendly. It really has the look and feel of an actual picture book. Of course, to be clear… this is 100% an adult book!So, let’s begin with an analysis of the theme… I, for one, can relate to food battles. While this certainly improves over time, all parents will be able to relate to their children turning their nose at foods that they once loved; or demanding their favorite for dinner after the meal is already on the table; or how there ends up being more food on the floor than their tummies; or kids come back from school with their lunches untouched. Yes, these themes are all too familiar and the author does put a humorous spin on them.The first issue I have is that so much of the book doesn’t even make sense:If we were both pandas, I’d know what to feed you,But seafood is scary, we’re leery of meat.I could not make sense of this sentence at first and I eventually chalked it up to poor grammar. How about this one?The sloth and the lemur, the chipmunk and cheetah,The slow and the sleek and the fleetShare one thing, my love: they make less of a messThan you (insert expletive) do when they eatHow are the first two lines even related? The fleet? What? I don’t get it (other than the author had to find some way to rhyme the second and fourth lines)?Let’s address the swearing. Yes, this book is for adults – I get it. Yes, I have felt the same level of frustration with my children’s eating issues – I get it. But, let’s face it, the author just did it for the shock value so he could make money off the books. This series of books are a total gimmick. While I may feel some frustration with my kids, the inner dialogue is not even close to what goes on in my head. Actually, the book left me feeling quite disturbed.To be honest, I don’t know what to physically do with this book. First, I don’t want it in my house because I don’t want me children to stumble upon it. I also don’t want to gift it to anyone because I cannot think of one person who would appreciate this type of humor. I also can’t donate it to my school library nor the public library. What the heck am I supposed to do with this book now?My Bottom Line:This book may be worth a chuckle or two and I’m sure parents will be able to relate to many of the scenarios depicted in the book. That being said, the book is largely a gimmick and is not particularly well-written. I recommend that, if you are curious, browse through a copy at your local bookstore. Frankly, I found the book somewhat disturbing.* This book was provided to me by the Book Depository’s Book Review Program in exchange for my honest review.

"Yawnalot is a sleepy town with not much to do except watch old Goat mending his fishing boat.  But that all changes when the mysterious Abracazebra rolls into town and delights young and old with her amazing magic show day after day.  With the attention now shifted away from him, Goat finds himself feeling jealous that the animals have become enamored with Abracazebra welcoming her in their town with open arms.In a plot to rid the town of Abracazebra, Goat convinces everyone that animals with stripes cannot be trusted and stripes become banned in the town.  With a heavy heart, Abracazebra is forced to leave the town that she has grown to love.  Old Goat quickly realizes the mistake of his ways, but will it be too late to find Abracazebra and convince her to return?Abracazebra is wonderful rhyming picture book with an important underlying message about jealousy and the consequences of acting out of jealousy.  When the townspeople show enthusiasm toward Abracazebra and her magic show, Goat feels left out and begins to feel jealous of the attention the zebra is receiving.  I immediately thought of how a child would feel when a new baby comes into a household and they are showered with attention leaving that child feeling rejected and alone.  While feelings of jealousy are certainly normal, the message in the book is that sometimes people act on those feelings inappropriately hurting others around them.The old Goat quickly perceived that convincing the other animals that stripes are bad was the wrong thing to do.  Goat’s actions hurt Abracazebra who was forced to leave the town; the animals who were sad that their new friend left; and himself as he experienced feelings of guilt around his deceit.  Goat then models the appropriate behavior by taking responsibility for his actions, tracking down Abracazebra, apologizing for his behavior, asking the zebra to return.  All in all, the story contains many important life lessons around jealousy, deceit, and taking responsibility for your actions.The illustrations featured in the story are absolutely gorgeous and are filled with magic and whimsy.  The book features a number of detailed full page illustrations as well as smaller ones scattered throughout the book.  Kids will enjoy leafing through the book, examining the pictures spotting the many, many details.  We all delighted in the illustrations.My Bottom Line:Abracazebra is a delightful rhyming picture book featuring a fun collection of animal characters, whimsical illustrations, and important underlying messages about jealousy and celebrating diversity.  This book would make a great read-aloud book in an early elementary classroom or library circle and I highly recommend it to children ages 4 to 8.* This book was provided to me through the Book Depository Book Review Programme free-of-charge in exchange for my honest review.

"Ok, I'm going to say it... I feel that it's just not as good as the first two. The book is called ""Cress"", but really the underlying story is focused on Cinder.  Ok, no problem ... in Scarlet, the main focus is on Scarlet and her story, but the underlying plot is not lost.  In Cress, the balance is just not the same. It's all about the plot (and an annoyingly high number of perspective changes).  Cress and her role in the story feels very ""secondary"".Don't get me wrong, there are lots of interesting things that happen in the book and I did get increasingly attached to and felt sympathetic toward each character (Cinder, Dr. Erland, Thorne, Kai, etc.).  Well, except for Scarlet, who is barely in the book at all and Wolf, who is just well ... there (sometimes).  At the beginning of the book Cress showed promise as an interesting character, but then she got lost as the book proceeded.To be honest, I suspect that the author was under a tremendous amount of pressure to pump out this book in a timely fashion at the cost of its quality.  I think the author is trying to juggle the perspective of too many characters.  I don't need to know what each character is thinking and feeling for me to fully understand and be captivated by the overall plot (which is brilliant by the way!)So, in short... the story is great - the writing is suffering.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NK48XO6HCTBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F1QX7W6#wasThisHelpful","R2NK48XO6HCTBR","A1AZMG5BMYGSS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AZMG5BMYGSS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ghost of Widdecot Manor features 12 year-old Joshua who must spend one week in a summer ""football"" course (i.e., soccer camp) at an old manor.  At first he is none too keen to participate, but upon learning of rumors of a ghost, he changes his tune and heads off to camp.  It doesn't take long for Joshua to meet up with the manor's resident ghost.  As the story unfolds, the reader learns the dark past of the ghosts(!) and a history involving treachery and betrayal is revealed.I was asked to read and review this book for Mother Daughter Book Reviews, a website that provides recommendations for books appropriate for children ages 12 and under.  This book is currently marketed as a book for ""middle grade readers"".  Given the main character's age (12) and the length of the book (short at 122 pages), I would say that this is probably accurate. On the positive side, I found that the story is fast-paced, well-written, and features suspense and many plot twists and turns.However, IN MY OPINION, some of the themes touched upon in the book (namely adultery, miscarriages, hangings, etc.) I feel are not appropriate for the target audience.  In the end, I asked myself if I would be ok with my 10 year old daughter reading this book and upon reflection, I decided that I would not.  That is simply my opinion and other parents may not feel the same way.  If the author had chosen a different mystery to feature (i.e., what is the ghost's troubled past?), I could easily have recommended it to children under the age of 13.  However, I do feel that there are adult themes in the story that are not appropriate for middle grade children.My star rating reflects my opinion about this book as a ""middle grade book"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12ZWC9ETR5K44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DFHF7TY#wasThisHelpful","R12ZWC9ETR5K44","A1AZMG5BMYGSS6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AZMG5BMYGSS6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Aesir Kids by the father-daughter writing team of James Grant Goldin and (then) 10 year-old Charlotte Goldin contains all of the ingredients of a terrifically entertaining middle grade adventure.  This delightful book features a diverse mix of characters based on Norse mythology each with their own strengths and weaknesses; a fantastical setting taking the reader from the kingdom of the mythical Asgard and across the Bifrost bridge to Midgard, the land of the humans; a great battle between the forces of good and evil; an intricate plot filled with many unexpected twists and turns; and a number of important underlying messages regarding the power of kindness, courage, and loyalty.The Aesir Kids introduces us to the children of the major Gods and Goddesses from Norse mythology.  While most of us have heard of Odin, Thor, Sif, and Loki (as well as many others), this story introduces Norse characters such as Thrud, Magni, and Modi (children of Thor and Sif); re-conceptualizes others such as Skade (who, in this book, is a young daughter of Thor and is the Goddess of Skiing); and creates new characters such as Fire (the son of the mystical Norns).  The book features a large and diverse cast and both boys and girls of varying ages will be able to identify with one or more of the characters.  One of the downfalls having so many characters with uncommon names, is that it does take a while to keep each one straight.  While the authors do provide a list of characters (including how to pronounce the names) at the end of the book, I believe it would have been more helpful to have it at the beginning of the book instead.The writing in The Aesir Kids is absolutely stellar.  I love the opening of the book where an old man is telling a group of children stories of the Norse Gods and Goddesses in a long-hall.  It is a wonderful way to introduce the characters and the setting.  The book also ends in the long-hall with a wonderful surprise.  The reader is already hooked by the time the old man regales the children with the first part of the story, “The Frost Giant’s Treasure”.  The rest of the plot continues to unfurl as we learn more about the children of the Aesir (i.e., Norse Gods/Goddesses), as “Fire” is created by the Norns, and as Loki the trickster God hatches a devious plan to rule Asgard.  As the reader gets immersed into this fantastical world, all the details provided by the authors play a role in the overall story leading to many “a-ha moments” within the final 50 pages.  I love to be surprised and this book offers many delicious plot turns and twists.On the surface, The Aesir Kids provides plenty of entertainment ranging from many humorous moments, to pre-teen angst and budding feelings of romance, to thrilling moments as the Aesir do battle against Loki and his armies of trolls, jotun, and more.  As we dig deeper, the story also contains many important underlying messages about family and friendship as well as courage, loyalty, and working together to achieve a common goal.  But perhaps the most poignant message which recurs numerous times is the notion of kindness as an agent of change.  For example, in Norse mythology, Fenris is a large and fierce wolf (some say he is the son of Loki) who is also the enemy of the Aesir.  In The Aesir Kids, Fenris is befriended and treated with kindness by the children of the Aesir and therefore remains loyal to the “good” side (despite being “planted” by Loki for evil purposes).  What I appreciated even more, was when Mimir, the teacher, bottom lines the key underlying messages for the reader:“A good teacher learns from his or her students.  I have learned lessons from all of you about kindness … and working together … and courage.”My Bottom Line:There is so much to love about The Aesir Kids: exceptional writing, great character development, fast and furious action, and important life lessons about kindness, family, friendship, and courage.  I highly recommend this fantastic book, based on Norse mythology, to children and adults 8 years and older, especially those who are fans of the Percy Jackson series.* This book was provided to us by the author free-of-charge in exchange for our honest reviews.

"This CRlight 4Watt Retro LED bulb works great and it is a great alternative for traditional incandescent bulb which is more energy efficient which only consumes  4 watts with same amount of brightness as the 40 watts bulb.This is a nice vintage looking bulb and when you look at it, it feels in the old days.Pros:*LED bulb is energy efficient and brighter.*Emits low heat.* Long life span than the traditional bulbs.*Low power consumption.Cons:*Non dimmableThis was advertised as warm white but it is not. It is more of yellow color.All in all, this is a great replacement or upgrade for a traditional incandescent bulb. If you want to save on electricity bill then move forward with LED bulbs which has same brightness. The price is much higher but definitely worth the money.I have been using this for couple of days now and still working flawlessly and will update my review if anything comes up.

"This Jelly Comb RF Stereo headphones works as advertised, it delivers decent sound quality and it is very easy to set up, I don’t even read the manual I just connect the audio cable to my TV to the transmitter and turned on the headphone and I get the sound instantly.This uses 2 AA  on the headphone and 2 AA battery on the transmitter. It comes with female 3.5 mm to RCA and straight 3.5 mm audio cable. This headset can be hard wired too in case you ran out of battery.The headphone is comfortable to wear and I can wear for long period of time without any discomfort.  The headset has FM radio feature which has auto search function by pressing down the volume button which is a plus . transmitter has decent connection range and I can walk around the house going in between walls with clear sound however there are some dead spot area which cuts off the connection which is acceptable for the price range of this headset.If this will be mainly use for listening music from tablets, smart phones or ipod then this is not the right headset for you. I suggest to invest on a better one’s. I would highly recommend if this will be use this when watching TV or connecting it to a computer and very convenient to use and great alternative for multi media speakers and don’t disturb others.All in all, this is economical RF headphone to use with TV, PC, DVD etc if you don’t want to disturb when watching.I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review.

"This Sades Stereo Gaming Headset with LED works great! It is well executed and made with solid ABS plastic which is durable and build to quality. The head and ear pads is made with soft PU leather which makes this very comfortable to wear.The ear pads are snug fit to my ear. This headset has good driver which delivers rich sound with deep bass and works very well when gaming. It feels that you are really in the game. The mic built in has good sensitivity which the other party can hear me well.What I do like and attracts me most is the built in LED lights on both side of the headsets, it looks more appealing and this is basically a USB powered which you just plug it in on computer USB port.All in all, this is a great gaming headset considering its price. Why pay more on expensive gaming headsets if you can get with same sound quality for the fraction of the price.

There are 3 bright LED’s which are Red, Green, Blue which only consume 3.5 watts. This can cover a fairly decent space or a big room and this is a good compliment with other disco or stage lights.Pros:♣ Bright LED’s with long life span♣Small, lightweight and portable♣Great value for the moneyCons:♣ Short power cable♣No power ON/Off switch♣Not sound activatedAll in all, this is great addition to my disco lights and it is bright, small, lightweight and portable which is easy to bring it anywhere.

"This EGOGO 12-17” laptop cooling pad works great! This supports larger screen laptop up to 17”. It is well made cooling pad and you can tell that it is cheaply made by looking at it. I do found this as dual purpose for me since it is large I can also use this as my AV receiver cooling pad and it really helps to keep my AV receiver cooled.This has 4 big thin fans which speed can be controlled using the switch on the back. The fan can be also turned off by set of two separately. With Blue LED on the fan makes this more appealing and cool looking.You will never run out of USB port on your computer since this has extra USB type A port which you can connect another USB device. There are two leg stand that can be unfold to  raise the back of the laptop so the fans get more air to speed up the cool down of the laptop.All in all, I love the design and it is durable and looks like this would last longer compare to my other laptop cooler.

"This Morpilot Bluetooth LED smart bulb with speaker, all in one is a brilliant idea. The LED bulb is bright and with color changing feature you can easily switch between colors using an App which you can download it for free on Google play for android and itunes for IOS. The manual has this QR code which you can scan and will automatically download the app. I don’t have QR code scanner on my phone so I manually search for it and the App called “JBS SmartBulb”.The app has timer feature which you can set when the bulb will turn off. It would be nice if this has scheduling feature. In the App you can also select which color you want and in the App you there is a music player which will show all the music in the library. The App is easy to use with user friendly interface.The speaker sound quality is decent, it is not that loud which is considerable for a bulb type or small speaker.  It is OK to use if you don’t really have any other good speaker around.Bluetooth pairing is smooth and easy and the Bluetooth range is fairly decent.Overall , this is a nice smart bulb and great for setting your light mood. It is easy to set up and very convenient to use.I was supplied this free sample product to test and evaluate and in exchange for  my fair and honest review.

"The Syllable wireless headphone G600 is nicely executed. I have tested several headsets with same category and this has surprisingly great sound quality. It has stylish and ergonomic design which is very comfortable to wear. I can wear this for long period of time without any discomfort.The headset is made with combination of solid plastic that makes this more durable.Two tone color design is nice which is red and white and there are other colors to choose from.Sound quality is decent and has balanced mid and high and this has some bass kicking.The Bluetooth connection is straightforward and easy to pair and the Bluetooth connection I would say better than my other Bluetooth headsets I can walk around my workplace and even going in to the other corner of the building and inside the restroom I can enjoy listening to my music without any signal disruption and even behind walls.One thing I like with this heads is it has optional 3.5 mm audio jack connection so even you get low battery you can still listen by plugging in the audio cable to my smart phone.The one I don’t like much is the big brand logo on both side of the headphones. This would be neat or nice if it is placed on the top of the head band and subtle.Overall, this G600 is a decent headset for the price and it is comfortable to wear which is the most important factor for me secondly the sound quality and durability.I was supplied free sample product for testing and evaluation purposes. This review is based on my personal experience and opinion on this product.Hope this help and inform you on your purchasing decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20AHNGMMF3QWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144B3JBM#wasThisHelpful","R20AHNGMMF3QWP","A3H48JGW7UB7PI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H48JGW7UB7PI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The flexible neck is consist of 8 adjustable joints with a goose neck type design so you can easily bend or adjust the position to your liking.

"This Shoot 2.0 inch backpack external display for GoPro Hero 4 3+ 3 works great and best replacement or alternative for the original OEM Go Pro backpac . The image quality is nearly close to the original GP backpack and it is easy to install and snugly fit on my GP 3+.The housing is made of solid plastic with matte rubber finish just like the original backpack and well constructed.  The only thing with this is not touch screen which is not big deal since under the water I don’t really use a touch function I just wanted to see what I am filming. Also for what it’s worth I don’t expect to have full functionality with touch function.Why pay more on branded backpack external monitor which you can get for the fraction of the price which does same thing except for touch screen function.  Having a monitor screen on Go Pro is very convenient.This comes with backdoor waterproof attachment so you can submerge it under water which works as advertised.All in all, this Shoot backpack is a great alternative or replacement monitor display for Go Pro 4 3+ 3. It works as intended. It is well made and works flawlessly!.I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review.

" 2:35 Mins This product review is for HooToo  Pan/Tilt wired/wireless IP camera with IR cut.There are lots of IP cam in the market now and really there are few manufacturers are making a good one's. I do owned couple of IP Cams and got one of the Foscam and one generic pan/tilt IP cam which works fine but not a hi-resolution one. I am using these IP cams to monitor our house when I am at work because we had burglarized twice before. We moved to a better place now and still have cams set up. This Hootoo HD camera is for additional camera only.Packaging:This came in a well secured package and first impression when I opened the box this IP cam must be a good quality cam.It came with the ff:1x HT-IP11HDCP IP Camera with Wifi Antenna built in1x Power Adapter 120VAC1x Mounting bracket with mounting screws1x Short Ethernet cable for wired initial set up.1x CD software and manuals1x Quick set up guideThe Design and feratures:The camera has two flavors one is Black and the other one is White. I got the black color.This has black matte finish with Hootoo Logo in front of the camera. The design is pretty much common now since there are lots of clones or copy model of it. This one looks high quality and well built. Of course this has pan and tilt function to cover a larger or wider area and can be controlled locally or remotely via web or mobile app (MyCam Pro). I do like the fact that this has no annoying power green LED in from of the camera . The other generic cam I have has it and I have to put a cover on it. I just want to keep the camera in low profile so this Hootoo did improved this second version.IR-cut technology to make camera provide true high quality image at day and night. The function of IR-cut in security camera is fix the color distortion, and increase the bright light at night. This camera is similar or equivalent to my FI8910W IP cam which has great and has sharp image but this Hootoo is bit smaller. Hoot IP cam has a nice web interface which is very user friendly and easy to navigate.This camera has a pretty much has same features with other IP camera such as email notification, motion detection, alarms, two way audio conferencing and also with built in SD card slot is a plus for storing picture snapshots or video clips when motion detection is enabled.We all know or as you may know using web interface remote viewing requires an IP address and port number and most of ISP provider are using DHCP so the IP keeps changing once in while and if that changes then you will not be able to access your IP camera remotely. What I would suggest is to sign up for a free DNS service so in this way DNS will automatically update the IP address of your camera and instead of typing in the IP on the web browser you just have to type in your DNS address for example www.youname.Dyndns.org:80. Before I used to use the dyndns service but they are charging customers now so I moved to No-IP.com service now and this is free service but you would have to renew your subscription every month and this is not really an issue for me and very easy to renew just two clicks and your done.Set-Up:There are two ways to connect to this IP cam. Using the MyCam mobile app which take approximately a minute to set up or the traditional way which is using the IPCSearch software utility which it came with that utility tool to find the camera on the network and you can pull the web interface and set it up manually and for more advanced configuration such as port forwarding and port triggering when you want to view the camera remotely. if you are a first timer I suggest to use the App which is much easier and straight forward.Pros:Easy to set upHas HD quality image compared to other generic IP camsHas IR cut filter built in which provides more good quality image day & night and does not distorts the image.Has built in SD card slot for local storage.Has simple and easy to navigate web interfaceHas great customer supportCons:There is one thing I don't like with this camera which is the power cord this has short power cable which upsets me. It could be more better if this has at least 10-15 ft power cord. If you will mount this to a ceiling longer power cord is needed instead of having an extension cable. My Foscam has longer power cable and the other cheap IP cam but I was surprised that this Hootoo did not come with a longer cord. Other than that it was perfect!Overall:I like this camera the hardware is great and very well made except for the short power cord thing. Having a pan and tilt function is very useful to cover wider area and IR cut filter is definitely works great and for the price you are paying for this camera is definitely worth it. I do found this camera great for baby monitoring, watching home and business, watching your garage. If you are looking for a budget and value IP cam this camera is for you. I highly recommend it and great value for the price! I am rating this as 4 out of 5 because of that short power cable.I was supplied this product by Hootoo in exchange for my fair and honest review.Hope this helps!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37RAB1A54MNQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017NNTYR6#wasThisHelpful","R37RAB1A54MNQH","A3H48JGW7UB7PI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H48JGW7UB7PI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Identity theft reports are increasing now a days and to protect yourself of being a victim RFID protection is a best solution. For a piece of mind I would suggest to get a wallet that has RFID blocking protection.

"I have tested and owned several Bluetooth speakers and this VAVA speaker is impressive it has loud bass and has enhanced equalizer for best sound experience. The way I look at this speaker it is solid made and build to quality. This speaker is nearly close to my JBL speaker.Why paying more on higher end and branded Bluetooth speakers with almost similar sound quality for the fraction of the price. This speaker came in a nice packaging and well presented.The control buttons are smooth and easy to press and very responsive. Bluetooth paring is smooth and easy and it has great Bluetooth connection range up to 30 ft.This comes with AC power adapter, USB charging cable, 3.5 mm audio jack and user’s guide.I have no issues using this speaker and it works as intended. I have tried playing Pop, Ballad, Rock, Electro and Club music and tried the equalizer function with no distortion or static noise even the speaker volume is on the max. This sounds like a small studio monitor.Pros:• Great alternative for branded high end Bluetooth speakers. Great sound quality!• Long battery life (6700mAh) up to 10 hours depending on the volume level.• NFC for easy pairing.• Has USB A port for charging USB devices.• Has Equalizer mode• Has Auxiliary port for Mp3 player or any other audio device connection.Cons:• Hands-free calling does not work well, mic has low sensitivity. I can hear very well the other party but the person on the other end can’t hear me when I am 3-4 ft away from this speaker. This is not big deal for me since I will not be using that feature just mainly for listening music.If you will be using that hands-free feature on this speaker then this is not the right speaker for you.Overall, this speaker is exceptional except for that hands-free mic. This is a great alternative for branded speakers on its class. Sound quality is excellent! I love this speaker.I was supplied this product in exchange for my fair and honest review.

"This SB555 Bluetooth sports headset is a real deal! I have tested and owned couple of Bluetooth headsets and not all Bluetooth headsets are made all the same, there are expensive which works great but some don’t. This SB555 is lightweight, well executed and build to quality. I am impressed how this company can make cheap headset which does not compromise the quality.From the packaging to the product itself, this came in a nice solid plastic and transparent on top and with the brand name and logo on the other half of the box. The packaging is definitely not cheap, well presented and comparable to higher end headsets in the market.It comes with USB charging cable, 3 sets of ear buds, 3 sets of ear hooks, 3 sets of ear cushions and user’s manual.This is very comfortable to wear and with its ear hooks makes this more secured and doesn’t fall off. I have small ear canal, I’m just using the one that is already installed ear cushion and ear hooks and this is easy to interchange if needed. This headset uses high quality flat type cable which is durable and sweat proof.This SB555 has good driver and the sound and audio quality is great, this has dynamic bass and balanced mid and high which makes the sound is enjoyable to listen.The in-line mic/control are easy to press and very responsive. You can control the music playback such as music tracks, volume and can also use the Multi-Function button to answer/reject calls.Pairing is smooth and easy, I never had any problems connecting and pairing this headset on my Samsung S4 and tablets. This has great Bluetooth connection range which is up to 30 ft with my connection without any issues or signal loss with clear sound quality. Hands-free calling, audio on both parties are loud and clear.Overall, I love this headset it works great and it is very affordable and great value for the money.I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review.

"This SB552 behind the neck Bluetooth sports headset has ergonomic design, light weight and it is very comfortable to wear. This is well constructed headset and has hybrid style look, it is compact and very cute headset with great sound quality. The sound is balanced with feel of some bass and great workout buddy.This has better battery life compared to the one’s I’ve tested which playback would last up to 6 hours and 7 hours talk time. Behind the neck headset is perfect for running than using the other style and this is secure fit behind the neck and stays in my ear on the entire workout.Bluetooth pairing is smooth and flawless. Bluetooth connection range is great which I’ve tested within 30 ft without any signal loss and still has clear sound.This has nice mic sensitivity which has clear audio quality on both parties.Music playback, volume, play and pause can be controlled from your mobile device using the headset vol up/down to go back and to go to next tracks by press and hold down the button and multi-function button controls the play/pause and also can be use to answer/reject calls.It comes with USB charging cable, manual and soft carrying case/storage and a silicone earbuds.My only complaint is the Volume up /down button is a bit stiffer and I have small fingers but I do find hard to press or feel the volume control buttons but other than that it is great.All in all, this is a nice sport behind the neck Bluetooth headset, it is well made, affordable with great sound quality. Why pay more on branded sport headset which you can get it for the fraction of the price which sounds nearly close to those expensive ones.This is based on my personal experience with this headset and hope this will keep you informed on your purchasing decision.I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE5XT37GEYZ4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEZYR6Q#wasThisHelpful","RE5XT37GEYZ4Z","A3H48JGW7UB7PI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H48JGW7UB7PI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The TaoTronics TT-SK05 Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker is a very cute but powerful small speaker I’ve ever had. I do own some other portable Bluetooth speakers and this one stand out. It has quality sound for its size and with the built in notification or indicator light is very cool. It reminds me of my Amazon Echo speaker it is pretty much a mini Echo design except for the square base. This has sleek design of course and very unique, light and portable. The rubber pads underneath provides a good support preventing the speaker on slipping. The Bluetooth connection has pretty good range up to 33 ft (10 meters) and has long battery life which up to 6 hours on 1 charge. And wait this is not just a regular Bluetooth speaker but can be use for placing calls or can even use for skyp’ing which I found this very useful. This has some other functions when calling like redialing using the Multi function button or you can even cancel a call by pressing the Multi function button. I do found that confusing so I don’t use that function anyway but it is nice to have feature as well.My unboxing link https://youtu.be/E8G4fsnkV1gOverall:This is a great, portable and has great audio quality for its size. Very stylish and great for shelf or display because of appealing looks. This is going to be part of my travel buddy and this will replace my old small and portable Bluetooth speaker.What I do like is it allows you to control your playback music via Bluetooth connection without even going in to your phone to change songs. Every thing can be done through the Multi-function button and it is very convenient.*When connecting to AUX port it automatically switches from Bluetooth mode to AUX mode which is very smart.*You can connect 2 devices at once however you can only play music one at a time which is a great feature.*And yes you can charge this speaker and use it at the same time.What I don’t like or it could be better:There is no LED indicator when the speaker is low battery instead you get the loud beeping noise which I did woke up in the middle of the night. I wish it would be a LED indicator instead of beeping noise.The Multi function button could be more improved.I was supplied this by TaoTronics for eval and to provide an honest and fair review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M5SI1O43WBRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SDNW2Q#wasThisHelpful","R2M5SI1O43WBRC","A3H48JGW7UB7PI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H48JGW7UB7PI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This OAproda rechargeable battery fits perfect on my Go Pro Hero3+. This is very similar to the original Go Pro battery and performance. I bought my Go Pro spare battery for $18 bucks which I just paid the brand name.

"This OAproda Portable HDMI Female to VGA adapter with audio works great! I worked in AV industry and this kind of device is essential to me. This OAproda HDMI Female to VGA adapter housing is made of zinc alloy and serves as heat sink as well. It is durable and lightweight, the labeling for the connections input/outputs well painted.I am surprised this actually works since it does not require any power to convert the digital signal to analog and there is no digression of image quality at all, I am very impressed.I had ordered another adapter prior to this adapter and that did not work and I have to return it for refund and good thing is the seller contacted me and offered this OAproda HDMI Female to VGA adapter to try and just give an honest review in exchange so I immediately accept the free sample and though to give it a try which I was not disappointed.This adapter has nice color which is golden yellow which you can easily find in the bag/purse. Also another thing I like about this OAproda HDMI Female to VGA adapter is the built in 3.5 mm Audio out port so if you are feeding HDMI signal you can take the audio and route it to your sound system/speaker or very useful if you have Projector that does not have audio out port this will take care of it.Overall, I love this HDMI to VGA adapter it works as advertised and definitely would recommend this to anyone who has TV or Projector that does not have HDMI input this will work flawlessly. This is a best alternative for those expensive HDMI to VGA converters.Hope this helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJE8DKNAJSAPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPZWI2M#wasThisHelpful","RJE8DKNAJSAPV","A3H48JGW7UB7PI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H48JGW7UB7PI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife's watch battery just died and instead of bringing it to a watch repair center to get the battery replaced I decided to do it myself since replacing is easy as long you have a watch tool kit since I do have one. Also having the battery replaced will cost you 5-8 bucks on some place so this Sony watch batter only cost me less than 5 dollars and this comes with 5 batteries and definitely worth the purchase.This battery would give another 2-3 years before replacing it again and since I have 4 more left batteries this will last forever!The watch is now working and back in business so I am happy with it.Hope this helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BOLEPEZWV16B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XLW4WI#wasThisHelpful","R2BOLEPEZWV16B","A3H48JGW7UB7PI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H48JGW7UB7PI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This essential oil is amazing!  My family is always diffusing oils to relax, re-energize, feel healthier, or just have that fresh clean scent.  We use so much that value is as important as quality.  So, I am thrilled to have discovered Majestic Pure.  This Lemon Oil is just as great as the ones that cost 4 times as much.  It smells great and so is the value.

"While I never enjoy dealing with any pests or bugs, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to try this since we occasionally get a family of ants visiting my kitchen.  Ugh!!  Here is what I LOVE about this product:  it is meant for a zillion types of bugs from ants to grosser pests that I don't even want to name.  It is child and pet safe, which makes me super happy since my dog gets into everything.  There is a money back guarantee...always a plus.  And it creates a barrier that you can use indoors or outdoors!  So far, it has been a great addition to our home...especially since we always have some type of bug nearby while I am outside...and some follow us in.I recommend trying this for yourself.

"I never thought I would get a selfie stick, but I did and I have to say, I am in love with it!My first concern was will it be sturdy enough for my iPhone, because the last thing I need is to drop it and break the mega pricey phone.  So, upon receiving it, I had to check it out.  Here is the scoop:  the telescopic metal handle is big enough that you can really grip it.  It is far from the skinny, flimsy handle I expected.  The next thing I wanted to check out was how strong it held the phone.  You actually have to stretch the holder open so that you can place your phone in it...there is no chance of the phone falling out.  Yay.  And finally, can it move around easily...and the answer is YES!  You can bend the phone holder to different angles and lock it to get the angle and picture you want!  Plus, there is a wrist handle to keep it from dropping.Next, I took a few photos...personal ones not shown.  But it works easily...you just press the button on the handle and viola...great pictures that make you look thinner because they are not 2 inches from your face!  So, I am sold on this selfie stick.  The only disadvantage is that it is a bit large, so you need a larger purse to carry it in.

"I LOVE this diffuser!  The pyramid design is fun and the remote makes it easy to use...but that is just icing on the cake.  This diffuser is quiet, which I personally love.  The cover easily slips off so that you can fill the water bowl.  No extra pieces to deal with.  Just pour add oil and enjoy!It holds @100mg of water, so you only need about 5 drops of oil.  There is not a max fill line, per se...it is the orange/red plastic inside the fill cup, so just be aware of that.  Try not to overfill, since it will work better when used as directed.  And while I have not run it for hours on end, the instructions say you can get up to 3 hours of continuous mist!The colors are soft and comforting, unlike some diffusers which are a bit too bright.

Without needing the easy instructions, I immediately was able to open the bottle, pull out the green cap with infusing tube attached, open it, fill it with pineapple (our fav), put it back together, add water, and chill.  The result...YUMMY!  Can't wait to do cucumber water on a warmer day, watermelon, and so many other options!!!If you are looking for simple, easy, and refreshing, this is a must have to make all of your water drinking even better.

"I just discovered hyaluronic acid and it is amazing!  I tried it immediately and love the small pump that allows just the right amount out without wasting any.  There is light scent to it, too.  The serum is really light and not greasy at all.  It doesn't take much to cover you face and you can immediately feel the moisture.  The next morning, my skin was softer than it has been in awhile.

They are extremely soft and there is no lint residue at all.In my house, we have used them to clean the tv, laptops, tablets, we have one for our camera lenses, and another that is set aside for my husband's glasses.

"I have always wanted to try Kleem Organics Juneusse products and finally had the chance.  This Vitaman C serum is awesome.  I tend to avoid moisturizers because I am always afraid of extra oily skin.

"These gloves are stylish and so comfortable!These are very comfortable Winter gloves. I am a 30 something year old woman with very large hands and these gloves fit me comfortably and feel so nice against the skin. They are not tight fitting, and they don't rub against your skin or feel like your fingers are rubbing against the inside of them. These gloves are black in color with blue designs and have a design that to me resembles pipes.In terms of how they handle water, I put these gloves on and then dunked my hands into a bucket of ice water. My hands stayed warm, but more importantly my hands stayed dry. Even though these are thick Winter gloves, my fingers still had plenty of flexibility and I was able to grasp things easily without having to remove the gloves.I love that there is a little clip that holds the gloves together. I cannot count the number of times that I have lost a glove, because they were not attached to each other. I also love the little ""cuff"" that comes up over the top of the gloves. It helps ""seal"" in the warmth of the gloves and prevent water from getting in through the top of the glove, even when the gloves are fully submerged in water. I also really love the strap that you can adjust to tighten the gloves in rain, snow, or water, and loosen them on a typical day around the city. The look and feel of these gloves is a ""men's"" glove style in my opinion, but I love the style, the extra warmth, and extra room that these gloves provide me as a female.At the end of the day, these are durable, waterproof gloves, that are super warm, and very comfortable.

"This is a very luxurious looking Charmeuse silk scarfThis scarf is very beautiful. I received style B10633, the design appears to be set at night with couples sitting at tables at an outside cafe. The colors are dark blue, yellow, orange, and black. The design repeats itself over and over again on the scarf. The scarf measures 62"" long and 16"" wide according to my measurements.This scarf has the look and feel of luxury. The design is somewhat abstract the way it comes across, it reminds me of an abstract painting that you would find hanging in a museum. The feel of this scarf is heavenly around your neck. I also like to wrap it a few times and wear it around my wrist, as a wrist scarf.I have no experience with silk scarves, so I cannot speak about the quality. Since I am a newbie to silk scarfs, it would have been nice if the manufacturer would have included care instructions, as I have no idea how to care for a silk scarf.At the end of the day, it's a beautiful scarf that is a versatile addition to any wardrobe.I received this scarf for free in exchange for an honest product review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHEZ11B3U5AI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A73J718#wasThisHelpful","RHEZ11B3U5AI9","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first glance, these look like denim jeans, but notice the words ""fake jeans"" in the title of this product. These are actually denim printed jeggings, which is an interesting concept, but I'm not really sold on the ideaSizing:These jeggings will fit size extra small through size medium. The person who tested these jeggings for me wears a size small, size 6 in jeans, and I cannot imagine how these would fit someone who wears a size medium normally, because they were hugging her really tightly, definitely gave her a camel toe, and there was no way a size medium would be able to pull these jeggings up. She has a 27.5"" waist and 36"" hips for those who are trying to figure out if these jeggings will fit them. The measurements that these jeggings claim to fit are: waist between 22""-37""; hip between 26""-40"", length of 34.5"", and an inseam of 25""Comfort:The nice thing about these jeggings is they are breathable and lightweight compared to denim jeans. That makes them super soft and not stiff to wear and super comfortable. You can bend over in these jeggings without feeling like you are going to bust a button and you don't have to worry about forgetting to zip up your zipper. These jeggings are made of 55% cotton, 35% polyester, and 10% spandex. The material is stretchy and smooth and feels good on the skin. You don't get the chafing that you get with jeans with these jeggingsEven though these jeggings are breathable, they have a slim fit and a very tight fit. This could be seen as a good thing or a bad thing. On one hand, they have a very skinny, tight, slim fit to them that shapes your curves and makes your bottom look beautiful. On the other hand, they give you a pronounced camel toe and you can almost see the panties that you are wearing, and can depending on what type of panties you are wearing, right through the materialColor and style:I received these jeggings in the style Blue3. I love the addition of the leopard print cut outs here and there as well as on the back of the jeggings. It added a little pop of color, and makes these jeggings look awesome with a leopard print shirt, or just when you are carrying your favorite leopard print bag or purse aroundThese jeggings have a very distressed/old look to them. They look like they've been through the ringer a few times, or like they are your favorite pair of worn out old jeans. I know this is the look that the manufacturer was going for, but it's a very poor look overall, as the leopard print looks stylish and new and then the distressed look comes across as cheap and old fashionedThe worst part about these jeggings is the fact that they do not have pockets you can actually use. All of the pockets are ""painted on"" or already worked into the material. In other words, they wanted to make these look like jeans with functioning pockets, without actually making real pockets. This is a really dumb concept all the way around. Who wants to look like they have pockets, but have no pockets they can actually use? Definitely not the person that tested these jeggings for meThe button and other closures on these jeggings are also ""painted on"" or already worked into the material. They are all decorative elements, and definitely help lend to the jean look of these jeggingsCare:There are no care instructions included with these instructions that are in English. So I have no idea of how to care for these jeggings. I am so sick of manufacturers including care instructions in other languages, and ignoring their English speaking customersFinal thoughts:At the end of the day, these jeggings are not quite what I was expecting. While they fit my friend, they are super tight and show off a little more than she would like to. No care instructions included in English, no functional pockets, and the distressed feel all drop my star rating two stars for these jeggings.

"These little fur wrist cuffs are so cute!I received this fur wrist cuffs in black. They are made out of 100% polyester. These would be appropriate for both older children 9+ and adults. I am in my thirties and I have a large wrist, and these fur wrist cuffs fit me beautifully. They have a very luxurious feel to them while you are wearing them. They are warm, soft, and really cozy. You can wear them on your wrists without gloves, or wear them above gloves to keep the gloves sealed around your hand and the warmth in.These fur wrist cuffs can be dressed down with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a nice coat. They are fancy enough that you can dress them up for holiday parties. They are extremely versatile because of the color. The black also does not allow dirt to show as well as I am sure the lighter colors would.My only complaint about this product is that no care instructions were included. Once this product is dirty, I have no idea how to clean it, and no idea how to care for them.

"This is an adorable little beanie hat and scarf set, and all though it's advertised as being for girls, I was surprised to find that it is more for the preteens through adults. I have a fairly large head (I'm in my thirties) and this set fit me perfectly. It is so adorable, and it doesn't scream little kid, which is really nice. I would recommend this for older kids 7+ and preteens mostly, though I'm really enjoying it myself!This cute little set has an adorable hat. The hat is a dark pink that is more dark, than bright, which is nice. The hat has a bright turquoise pom pom on top of it. The pom pom sticks straight up and does not flop around which is nice. The hat has an adorable little Minnie Mouse ears/head with a satin bow on of Minnie's ears. The hat is made out of 100% acrylic. The hat is super warm, comfortable, and looks great when you are wearing it. It does not feel heavy, even with the pom pom on top so you do not feel weighed down, something that is always a concern with pom pom hats.The scarf is just adorable. The scarf has a pom pom on each end. One of the pom poms is the same turquoise color that the hat has on top of it, and the other pom pom is the same dark pink as the scarf and hat. Like the hat, this scarf is made out of 100% acrylic. It's very comfortable, and it allows you to manipulate it in any direction, tie it any way you like, and it still looks fashionable. The scarf, even with the large pom poms on the end, does not feel like it weighs you down, or feel uncomfortable, whether you are wearing it over a coat, or without a coat for extra warmth. The scarf measures approximately 60"" long and just about 5"" wide. While the hat fits older children, the scarf screams young child and I cannot really see an adult wanting to wear it, maybe there are some that do, but it's definitely not my style. For kids though, it is the perfect amount of novelty without looking childish.I love everything about this set. This would make a wonderful gift for any child or tween. Teenagers will like it as well. The ONLY thing I would change about it, which is not enough to dock stars off of the rating of this product is that there are no care instructions written in English, so I have no idea how you would take care of this item, or wash it when the time comes. I'm really sick of manufacturer's not including English care instructions with their products, when they are trying to sell here in the United States.At the end of the day, this is a cute little set that will add some novelty to your winter wardrobe, or the winter wardrobe of that special young child in your life.I received this scarf and hat set for free in exchange for an honest product review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MLPD9QRH32GJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPH1LEG#wasThisHelpful","R1MLPD9QRH32GJ","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute little ""do it yourself"" ballerina figurine kit but there are some problems with the included paint and paintbrushThis is a really cute set that allows you to create two ballerina figurines. The figurines are made out of resin, and are really high quality. Neither of the figures had any cracks or chips when we opened the box. Unfortunately, the included paints and paintbrush are not very good materials to use with these figuresWhat's included in this kit:2 ballerina resin figurines - one ballerina is in a standing position dancing and the other ballerina is in a sitting position6 paint colors - these paints are NOT WASHABLE. Colors include: lavender, baby pink, skin color/light peach, bright yellow, light brown, and blackPaintbrush - plastic paintbrush that is pure junkProblems with this kit:Highly detailed figurines - the details on the figures are intricate and hard for young children to paint, especially with the included paintbrush. I recommend purchasing an ultra fine tip paintbrush. Due to the intricate details on these figures, I recommend them for ages 5-9+Paintbrush - paintbrush is low quality, plastic junk, the kind that you buy in bulk at the dollar store. The bristles fall out and it's incapable of painting the fine details on these figurines. The bristles also end up in the paint, making a mess on the figuresPaints - the paints do not work on the resin figures, period. They clump, they don't cover evenly, and they dry somewhat tacky. I recommend purchasing acrylic paints, which is what we did, and they worked fine. The paints are also NOT WASHABLE from hands, surfaces, or clothing. All Melissa & Doug DYO paints are this way, so I recommend purchasing some paint that you are comfortable with your child using and using it with all of the Melissa & Doug kits. If you do use the included paints, I would recommend that you have your child wear old clothes or an artist's apron, cover the work area with a party plastic tablecloth, and allow paint to dry on hard surfaces and then wipe it off with a Mr Clean Magic EraserAt the end of the day, these are adorable ballerina figurines, but the paints and paintbrush are inadequate","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CMN75SCAOFF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXBLL10#wasThisHelpful","R1CMN75SCAOFF1","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute little ""do it yourself"" zoo figurine kit, but I highly recommend purchasing your own paint and paintbrushThe concept of this ""do it yourself"" zoo figurine craft kit is a good one. The figures are made out of resin and are very high quality. The figures did not have any chips or breaks straight out of the box. The problem is that the paint included and the paintbrush included are not really suitable for use with the figurinesWhat's included in this kit:Resin tiger figurine - high quality resin figurine of a tiger in a crouched or laying down positionResin giraffe figurine - high quality resin figurine of a giraffe in a laying down/sitting positionPaintbrush - low quality plastic paintbrush that I don't recommend using6 colors of paint - non washable paints that stain clothing, hands, and fabric. Colors included: bright yellow, light peach/tan, orange-yellow, light brown, white, and blackProblems with this kit:Paint - the paint included with this kit is a joke. It does not stick to the resin figures at all. We even tried sanding the figures down slightly and the paint still would not stick. It's impossible to get even coverage with the included paint. We ended up purchasing acrylic paint at a big box store which worked perfectly for this kit. The paint included is also NOT WASHABLE which is a big no no with kids craft kits. It stains hands, clothing, and surfaces. To remove paint from hands, use an acetone free nail polish remover. To remove stains from tables and other surfaces allow to dry completely and then scrub over the stain with a Mr Clean Magic Eraser. Wear old clothes or an artist's apron to avoid paint stains on clothing. Cover your surface with a plastic party tableclothPaintbrush - the paintbrush included is a cheap plastic paintbrush, the kind you can buy in bulk from the dollar store. The bristles shed, and end up mixed in with the paint, the paintbrush doesn't paint evenly, and it's impossible to get the small details on these figures with the included brushSmall details - these resin figures have very small details like spots and stripes making them difficult for young children to paint themselves. I highly recommend an ultra fine paintbrush. This craft kit is best suited for children 5-9+ years old due to the amount of detail on the resin figuresAt the end of the day, the figures included in this kit are cute, but the paints and paintbrush are inadequate, buy your own and you can use them for all of the Melissa & Doug craft kits, which all suffer from terrible paints","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYHQ8I6E0ZNWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXBLF3Y#wasThisHelpful","RYHQ8I6E0ZNWB","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute little ""do it yourself"" wooden plane craftThis is a cute little kit that allows your child to create their own wooden plane. The finished plane has wheels that really turn that your child will be able to wheel along the floor or a table.This kit includes:Wooden plane - the wooden plane is the color of natural wood with no pre-printed design on it. It is partially assembled and already has the front wheels on itWooden plane front wings - natural wood in color and are easily glued into the slot in the planeWooden plane back wings - natural wood in color and are easily glued into the slot in the planeWooden axle - natural wood in color2 wooden wheels - natural wood in color with black rims pre-painted on the outer edge of the wheels4 colors of paint - these paints are NOT washable.

Stickers include: stripes, numbers, wheels, stars, lettering, bullseye, and moreWhite glue tube - tube of white glue, not strong enough to assemble this kitProblems with this kit:Stickers don't stick - the stickers do not adhere to the paint, whether the paint is wet or dry. They constantly fall off. I recommend using a paintbrush or a foam brush to apply a thin layer of tacky glue to the back of each sticker before putting them on your plane after the paint has driedPaintbrush is pathetic - included paintbrush is junk. Buy your own high quality paintbrush and you can use it with all of the Melissa & Doug DYO kitsGlue isn't strong enough - glue is not strong enough to hold the wings or the wheels in place. I recommend using tacky glueTips for a successful plane:Apply tacky glue to the edge of the wing that will fit into the slot only, do not try to apply the glue directly to the slot. Repeat this with the other wingFor wheels that will definitely turn, stick the axle through the opening in the plane, and then put a drop of tacky glue on each end of the axle to attach the wheelsAt the end of the day, this kit could use stickers with stronger adhesive, a better paintbrush, stronger glue, and washable paint to make it a better kit.

"This is a cute little ""do it yourself"" wooden princess carriage kit, but there are a lot of problems with itThis is an adorable little ""do it yourself"" wooden princess carriage kit that allows your little one to create their own wooden princess carriage. The finished carriage is made out of wood, and this kit gives you everything (sort of) that you need to create the princess carriage. This craft has a lot of small parts, including stickers, that I would not recommend for super young children. I would say the perfect age group for this craft is between 5-8 years old.This kit includes:Wooden princess carriage - the wooden princess carriage base is pre-assembled and the windows are already painted purple. The carriage is a natural wood color2 wooden axles - the wooden axles are un-painted and they are a natural wood color4 wooden wheels - the wooden wheels are a natural wood color and they have outlines of the outer wheel (or center wheel depending on your view of them) pre-printed on them24 stickers - the stickers are self stick stickers that are pre-decorated and meant to put small details on the princess carriage. You receive two sheets of stickers. One sheet is for the front of the carriage and one sheet is for the back of the carriage. The sticker sheets are exact mirrors of each other (printed in the opposite directions). Each sheet of stickers has the following stickers on it: 2 windows; window with a princess in it; 2 wheels; 2 squiggly accents; 2 hearts with a circle around them; regular heart; crown; and a door sticker. The stickers DO NOT stick once you paint the carriage, they will continue to fall off. I recommend that you use a paintbrush or a foam brush to apply a little tacky glue to the back of them and then add the stickers to the carriage, otherwise they will constantly peel off4 paint colors - the paints are NOT washable. They are made to paint on wood, and they paint evenly. Because of this, they do not wash off evenly. To remove paint from skin use non acetone nail polish. To prevent damage to surfaces, use a plastic party tablecloth. To prevent damage to clothing, have children wear an old shirt or a crafting apron. Paint colors included are: white, purple, baby pink, and a dark bluish-purplePaintbrush - cheap plastic paintbrush that you can buy in bulk at your local dollar store. Not good for painting small details. Bristles fall out. I recommend that you do not use the included paintbrushWhite glue tube - small tube of white glue that is pretty much useless in this kit. It's meant to hold the wheels on, but it is not strong enoughProblems with this kit:Stickers don't stick - the stickers do not adhere to the paint, whether you apply them when the paint is wet or after the paint has dried. I recommend using a paintbrush or a foam brush to apply a small amount of tacky glue to the back of each sticker, and then adhere them to the princess carriageGlue is worthless - the glue tube included in this kit is worthless. It is made to attach the wheels and axles, but it  just isn't strong enough. I recommend using tacky glue insteadTip to make sure your carriage rolls: Put the axle in the opening in the carriage, and then apply a drop of tacky glue at each end to attach the wheel, that way your finished carriage will rollAt the end of the day this is a cute kit, but the stickers could be stronger to adhere to the paint, the glue could be better, and the paint should be washable","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26EXADWA32FVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6V06RC#wasThisHelpful","R26EXADWA32FVY","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This do it yourself kit is perfect for any mermaid fanThis is an adorable little ""do it yourself"" kit. This kit let's you make three different projects: a mermaid doll, a seashell mirror, and a starfish shaped box. All three of the items are made out of wood and have varying levels of difficulty. The easiest project to make is the seashell mirror. The second easiest project to make is the starfish shaped box. The hardest project to make is the mermaid doll. This kit contains small parts, and is not recommended for children under 3 years of age. I think the ideal age group for this craft kit is 4-7 or 4-8 years old.This kit includes:Wooden seashell mirror - pre-painted wooden mirror that is purple in color and in the shape of a seashell. The center of the seashell has a round mirror which is made out of safety glass so it does not shatter when droppedWooden starfish shaped box - small wooden box in the shape of a starfish that is natural wood color that does not come pre-printed or pre-designedWooden starfish shaped box lid - small wooden box lid in the shape of a starfish that is natural wood color. Comes pre-printed with the shape of a starfish on itWooden mermaid doll - wooden doll that looks like a paper doll, in the shape of a mermaid that is natural wood color. Comes pre-printed with the shape of the mermaid and all of the details from hair to scales on itWooden mermaid doll stand - small wooden stand that allows the wooden mermaid doll to stand up and is natural wood color15 gem stickers - tiny little self stick stickers which are somewhat raised/3 dimensional. The stickers are in the shape of stars and are bright pink and bright blue in color28 foil stickers - tiny little self stick stickers which are flat, and not 3 dimensional. Stickers range in size from super tiny to small and include seashells, starfish, stars, and pinwheels in varying shades of pink, purple, blue, and yellow7 colored pencils - mini colored pencils that are less than 1/2 the size of a standard colored pencil. Do not have erasers. Tiny, thin, and hard for little hands to grasp. One each of the following colors: lavender, sky blue, brown, bright pink, baby pink, yellow, and green2 glitter glue tubes - mini tubes containing glitter glue that can be used to add three dimensional outlines to any of the wood crafts in this kit. One each of the following colors: silver and bright blueWhite glue tube - mini tube containing glue that can be used to attach the stand to the mermaid wooden doll4 colors of paint - paints that can be used to decorate the three wooden craft projects included in this kit. The paints are NOT washable, and so plan ahead and have your kids wear old clothes. Mr Clean Magic Erasers work great on tables once the paint dries. One each of the following colors: baby blue, baby pink, bright pink, and lavenderPaintbrush - standard kids craft paintbrush that you can buy in bulk at the dollar store. Weak, flimsy, and does not paint small details. You are better off buying your own paintbrush. The bristles shed on this paintbrush as wellThe crafts and how you make them:Seashell mirror - the seashell mirror is pretty much ""pre-made"" you can decorate it with the sticker gems, the stickers, or with glitter glue, but only decorate the edges or you will not be able to see yourself in the mirror. This craft is easy for young children because there is no painting involvedStarfish box - a cute little trinket box with matching lid. The box is natural wood in color and is ready to paint. The paint covers the box nicely and the paint applies in even coats, even with the crappy paintbrush that is included. Even a young child can paint the box portion of this craft. The lid is a little trickier. It's pre-printed with a starfish design. You cannot paint on top of the design, or you won't be able to see the starfish outline. In addition to painting this box and lid, you can also decorate them with gem stickers, stickers, or glitter glue outlines. Younger children can decorate the starfish box and matching lid with the included colored pencilsMermaid doll - the hardest craft in this kit, the mermaid doll is pre-printed and the details are tiny. So tiny, that you need a fine tipped paintbrush if you are going to try and paint it (not included), but I recommend coloring the mermaid doll with the colored pencils which work nicely on the wood surface. The stand for the mermaid also needs painted or decorated with colored pencils, and then you use the included white glue to attach the stand to the bottom of the mermaid doll (in theory), unfortunately the glue was not strong enough and we had to use tacky glue to attach the stand. You can also decorate the mermaid doll with gem stickers, stickers, or glitter glue detailsProblems with this kit:You can't see the pre-printed outlines through the paint - if you have a child that insists on painting the starfish box lid and the mermaid doll, you'll quickly forget what those two items were, because you won't be able to see the starfish design or the mermaid's detailsPaints don't wash off easily - these paints work great on wooden projects, which is a good thing. But, they don't clean up easily, which is a bad thing. This paint is really hard to wash off of hands, tables, and will stain clothes. Let your kids wear old clothes or an art smock, cover the table with a plastic party tablecloth, and use non acetone nail polish to remove paint from hands. If your child does get paint on the table, once dry, it cleans up well with a Mr Clean Magic EraserNo pencil sharpener - there is no pencil sharpener included for the colored pencils. They are too small for an average pencil sharpener, and too large to fit in my mini pencil sharpenerMermaid doll tough to fit the base on - the mermaid wooden doll is really difficult to fit the base onto. You might need a piece of sandpaper to sand down the rough edge of the bottom of the doll so that it fits in the base without being tiltedGlue not strong enough - the included tube of glue was not strong enough to attach the mermaid doll base to the mermaid dollAt the end of the day, if you have a mermaid fan that loves crafting, they will enjoy this cute little craft kit from Melissa and Doug","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DV10I73NWMLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SXBLH28#wasThisHelpful","R3DV10I73NWMLE","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the best song that I have ever heard by Phil Collins and my favorite song from the Disney animated movie Tarzan.You'll Be In My Heart is the ultimate love song, sung as only Phil Collins could sing it. Whether you are looking at the relationship between a couple, or the love between a mother and her child, this song will touch your heart and move you. This song is powerful. It reaches into the depths of the soul and talks about true love, true companionship, agape love, love without expectations, without boundaries, without conditions. Love that crosses divides, racial stereotypes, gender stereotypes, and is accepting, real, and powerful.This song shows the power of love and how everything in the world is different when you face it with someone, rather than alone. This is one of my all time favorite Disney songs. It is sung in a way that is moving, and the first time I heard it, outside of the movie Tarzan, it actually brought tears to my eyes, because I understand the kind of love that it's talking about. Once you feel that love, it's a feeling that you never forget.In terms of being a Disney song, this isn't the kind that you sing along to, or sing karaoke to, it's the kind of song that you sit back and let take you to a wonderful place that you have never gone before. I love this song, it is so beautiful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R120TIZ6FJUV4E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00138IQX6#wasThisHelpful","R120TIZ6FJUV4E","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such a powerful, moving song from the Disney animated movie MulanThis song is one of the best songs in the movie Mulan, second only in my book to Reflection. This song is much more upbeat than Reflection is and very easy to sing along to, which is exactly how a Disney song should be. The rhythm and tone of this song is very happy and makes you feel good inside.Honor To Us All is a song about turning an ordinary girl into a powerful warrior who everyone can be proud of. It's about meeting people's expectations and surpassing them with flying colors. It's about breaking away the molds and stereotypes that the world has set before you and coming out a new, better, proud person.At the end of the day, this is an inspiring and powerful song for anyone who is trying to spread their wings and break free of any situation that is holding them back or holding them down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ZVP87Q30GW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00138CE66#wasThisHelpful","R27ZVP87Q30GW6","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge Disney fan, but I dislike the movie Mulan. Even disliking the movie Mulan, I love this song. It is by far, my favorite song on the Mulan soundtrack.If you've ever had one of those days where it seems like everyone's expectations of you are running super high and your opinion of yourself when you look in the mirror is the complete opposite of the expectations, then this is the song for you. This song talks about not being able to see what others see in you as a person, as a human being, as a daughter, etc. This is a song about trying to figure out how to raise your own self esteem within the events that are going on in your day to day life.Christina Aguilera's voice in this song is beautiful.

It's super short (around 30 seconds) which can stink if you don't buy the entire soundtrack and are purchasing songs individually. This introduction sets the stage in ancient Greece, and talks about Hercules. This is more like an introduction of events to come, then a song that is really about anything in particular.At the end of the day, if you are looking for a quick song that introduces the story of Hercules, than this is the song to go with, otherwise, skip this song, especially if you already know the story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NAUWC4QJ5TFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00160Q8CM#wasThisHelpful","R2NAUWC4QJ5TFX","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very short song from the Disney animated film HerculesThis song is sung by one of the Muses in the Disney animated film Hercules. This particular song is sort of depressing, and is about not ticking off one of the most powerful Gods, which is Hades (in the movie). They talk about Hades personality, how he's mean and ruthless, and how he didn't get along with people who were in the Underworld.This song sets the stage for Hades plan.

"I had high hopes for this homeopathic remedy for Sciatica, but unfortunately, this product did not do anything at all for my Sciatica pain. I am currently suffering from Sciatica pain. I have Fibromyalgia, so any activity that is above and beyond normal activity, and any strain on my back tends to cause Sciatica to flare up. The pain is excruciating. Pain medication doesn't help with Sciatica pain and muscle relaxers do nothing to help the discomfort. I saw my doctor, and unfortunately the only advice was heat, gentle stretches, and rest. Of course, that's all fine in my book, but when it feels like you are sleeping on a bed of nails all the time, it's hard to rest.When Naproxen Sodium and Tylenol failed to help with the Sciatica pain at all, I turned to homeopathic remedies. The reviews on this product were mixed between completely helping and not helping at all, so I decided to take a gamble and try this product. I have a lot of allergies, so I carefully studied the ingredients in this product and determined that none of the ingredients would cause an allergic reaction. These tablets dissolve under your tongue, but they are not acid tasting, and do not taste like dissolved aspirin when they dissolve, in fact, they don't have much of a flavor at all, which I actually prefer. The tablets are somewhat gritty as they are dissolving, and I often find little pieces of the tablet stuck between my teeth, or my tongue finds one in the back of my mouth long after I took the tablets.Sciatica Therapy tablets are completely homeopathic, they don't contain any actual modern medicine of any kind, just all natural ingredients. They are recommended for ages 12 and up. You need to dissolve 1 tablet under your tongue up to 3 times a day and not swallow the tablet whole. You can actually use the tablets up to 6 times a day if needed, according to the product's label. It recommends that you take Sciatica Therapy 10 minutes before or after eating or drinking. The bottle does warn that it may not be effective for everyone. There are 70 tablets in the bottle.Active ingredients in this product are:Arnica Montana HPUS 6x, 12x, 18xColocynthis HPUS 6x, 12x, 18xGnaphalium polycephalum HPUS 6X, 12x, 18xHypericum perforatum HPUS 6X, 12x, 18xKali iodatum HPUS 6X, 12x, 18xMagnesia phosphorica HPUS 6X, 12x, 18xRhus toxicodendron HPUS 6X, 12x, 18xInactive ingredients in this product are: Advantol 300, Lactose, Magnesium Stearate, Mannitol, Microcrystalline CelluloseThe first thing that you need to know about this product is that your Sciatica will actually get worse when you start taking this product. The product even warns you that your symptoms may worsen. I am not sure if the product itself actually worsens the symptoms, or if the progression of Sciatica is just what makes the condition more painful, but I definitely noticed an increase in my Sciatica pain once I started taking this product.The second thing that you need to know about this product is that it's not a quick working miracle homeopathic remedy. People who claim it works in a couple of days, are probably completely lying, or fooled by the way that homeopathic remedies are ""all in your head"" because this medication takes weeks to months to become fully effective, according to the manufacturer's own website. So, if you feel some relief right away, it's probably more in your head than actual relief, but if that sort of thing works for you, then all the power to you, I wish I was that lucky.When I first started taking this product, I felt absolutely nothing. There was no decrease in pain, there were no side effects, it was basically like I had taken a tablet made of nothing. I really wanted this product to work because of the amount of pain that I was in, but this product never did work for me. I continued to take the product for six weeks to no avail. I did feel more pain in the beginning when taking this product, but I think that was because of the Sciatica itself, and not these tablets. I also found out that it did not make a difference if I took 3 tablets a day or 6 tablets a day, that the end result was the same...no results at all.I continued taking the bottle until it was gone and purchased a second bottle. I got half way through the second bottle before I completely came to grips with the fact that this product was never going to relieve my Sciatica pain, so I finally stopped taking it. During the time while I was taking this product, I used a heating pad on my back with moist heat in 20 minute intervals, lots of rest, and gentle stretches. Those things provided some relief at first, but now, over 6 weeks into the Sciatica, the pain is still just as bad as it was on day one, and I'm still miserable.Products like these work for some people and don't work for others. This could potentially be a good product, but it's definitely not the right product for me, and I did not get any relief from taking this product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29FHHGBJ9QS0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGVHXMU#wasThisHelpful","R29FHHGBJ9QS0Z","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you love Peanuts and you love taking baths, then you will want to check out this Peanuts Bath Squirt toy set.This bath toy set includes three squirting toys: Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Lucy from the popular Peanuts cartoons and comic strips. Charlie Brown is the tallest of the three toys measuring approximately 4.75” tall. Lucy comes next in height, and she measures approximately 4.5” tall. Snoopy is the shortest of the three characters and measures approximately 3.5” tall. Charlie Brown and Lucy are dressed in their classic outfits from the Peanuts comic strip and shoot water out of a small hole located on their mouths. Snoopy is clutching Woodstock in his arm, and has his eyes closed. Snoopy squirts water out of a small hole in his hand.Like all squirt toys for the bath tub, these adorable little toys are subject to mold growth inside. To prevent mold growth inside, you can do one of a number of things:1) Bleach water – mix 1/4 parts bleach water with 3/4 parts water into a small dish pan and dip the toys in, fill them up with the bleach water, and then squirt them until empty2) Hair dryer – after each bath, squeeze as much water as possible out of the squirt toys and then use the hair dryer on the low setting, right over the hole to dry out any remaining waterThe best way to make sure that your squirt toys don’t grow mold is to make sure that you squeeze as much water as possible out of the toys after each bath. I would love to see squirt toys that had little “plugs” that were removable that would enable you to remove them after bath time and let the remaining water drain and dry out. That would certainly make life easier.In terms of how these squirt toys compare with other squirt toys, they are easy to fill with water, just by submerging them. You don’t have to squeeze them to fill with water. They are also pretty easy to make squirt, and don’t require a lot of hard squeezing to make water come out of them. Unfortunately, due to the placement of the holes on these squirt toys, using a hot glue gun to plug the holes does not work like it does with other squirt toys.At the end of the day, I’m not really a fan of bath squirt toys, because of the mold factory, but these little characters are adorable both inside and outside of the bath tub.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WNHXEFE9VJIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014E8NYC4#wasThisHelpful","R1WNHXEFE9VJIG","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an adorable little Peanuts figure set that would make an adorable gift for a Peanuts fan, or an adorable cake topperThis set includes the following: Snoopy figure, dog dish filled with bones, dog house, and Woodstock figureThe Snoopy figure is really adorable. He looks just like Snoopy from the Peanuts cartoons. The Snoopy figure measures approximately 2"" tall. The dog dish is green in color and is piled high with plenty of dog bones from Snoopy to enjoy. The dog dish with bones measures approximately 2"" tall to the very top dog bones and slightly shorter than Snoopy. The Woodstock figure is really cute, it is Woodstock in his nest, and measures 1.5"" tall including the nest. The dog house is just over 4.5"" tall. The dog house opens, but not really the way you would expect it to open.Snoopy is definitely the best figure in this set. Snoopy has arms that can move, his head can turn from side to side, and he's in a standing position. While Snoopy's legs do not move, and you cannot make him sit down, he can stand on top of his dog house. You can also balance the dish of dog bones or the Woodstock figure inside of it's nest on top of the dog house.I have two main problems with this Snoopy set:Woodstock - Woodstock while adorable, does not come out of his nest, this limits his play value immenselyDog house - the dog house opens up. I was thinking that it would be kind of a door that swung open, but this is not the case. It actually opens sort of like a hinged box, the top half of the dog house including the lid is on a hinge and it pops open to reveal the inside of the dog house. Because of this, you can't just walk the characters into the dog house. It would have made more sense to have a door that swung open on the front of the dog houseAt the end of the day, this is a cute little set. It would look adorable on top of a birthday cake or sitting on an adult's desk at the office. The figures are small, but really capture the look of Snoopy and Woodstock from the Peanuts cartoons","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I0Q1F8NIP27Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TTT9CS#wasThisHelpful","R3I0Q1F8NIP27Z","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Spongebob Squarepants Kooky Klicker pen is adorable! I am a collector of Kooky Klickers pens. For those who are collectors, this pen is number 001 Spongebob Squarepants and is part of the Spongebob Squarepants Series 1 collection of Kooky Klickers pens. Kooky Klickers pens are fun pens with a face on them that have a Koosh ball on top of each pen.This Kooky Klickers pen is bright yellow in color. It has the face of Spongebob Squarepants on it, and is very detailed. The face even has Spongebob's teeth and tongue. The expression on Spongebob Squarepants face is priceless on this pen. The Koosh ball portion of this pen is shades of green, blue, and yellow. Like all Kooky Klickers, this pen is narrow at the top and bottom and wide in the middle. It's also refillable. To refill this pen you just have to unscrew the stem attached to the Koosh ball portion of the pen and pop in a Kooky Klickers refill. This pen writes in black ink like all of the Kooky Klickers pens.This Kooky Klicker's pen has a metal clip so you can attach it to a purse or backpack. I love the way that this pen looks. Keep in mind that the design is only printed on one side. The backside has the Kooky Klickers symbol/logo, the name and number of the pen, and the series name and number. I wish Kooky Klicker's pens were double sided.In terms of how long the ink lasts in this pen, it's fairly average for a Kooky Klickers pen, the ink lasted 29 days with daily use. For a Kooky Klickers pen that is about average, some last longer and some last a lot less time. It depends on how many times the pen was scribbled with in the store and how full the ink stick was when it was placed into the pen.At the end of the day if you are a Kooky Klickers collector, or you just love Spongebob Squarepants, you will love this pen. This pen would make a great stocking stuffer, Easter basket filler, or party favor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28QTWN4R3N8RO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WZ7IRE#wasThisHelpful","R28QTWN4R3N8RO","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This digital kitchen timer from Bwert would be the perfect kitchen timer if they corrected a few simple thingsThe main thing I love about this digital kitchen timer is the size of the digital display. I love how large the numbers are, and how I can see how much time has passed or how much time is left from across the room. The display size is what every kitchen timer should have in my opinion. Even though there is a large digital display, the numbers on this timer can be confusing. I don't know what font the company used, but the 2 looks like an 8 from a distance, and many of the numbers are either more rounded or more square than they should be and it can be hard to tell which number it actually is. That's the only reason I am docking one star from this timer.I LOVE the alarm that this kitchen timer has. You can hear it from across the room or in the next room, and even from the bathroom. Granted I live in a place that is under 1,000 square feet, but even with the bathroom door closed, I can still hear the timer in the kitchen which is great, and it's much louder than other kitchen timers that I have tried. The alarm is not so loud that you need earplugs when it goes off, but it is loud enough that the neighbors hear it if I let it beep for too long, just an FYI if you live in a small space or have close neighbors.You can use this as both a kitchen timer to count down the time until something is ready or as a stop watch to count up until you reach the desired time. There are three buttons, one for minutes, one for seconds, and a start/stop button. I generally prefer the digital timers that have numerical keypads, which makes setting them much easier, but this one is really easy to set, even with only a minute and second button. The numbers don't run too fast, so you do not go past the time that you are wanting to set it for, something that I have experienced with other timers.The backside of this timer has a strong magnet on it. The magnet holds this timer easily on both the refrigerator and the filing cabinet. It also has a stand on the backside when you are not near a magnetic surface. The stand is durable, and I don't knock this timer over like I do other kitchen timers when I use them in stand mode.I love the color of this timer, the pretty blue looks great in the kitchen or out of the kitchen. It doesn't look white and sterile like a standard kitchen timer, or the ones that I am used to. It looks more like a pedometer or fancy stopwatch then a kitchen timer...which is a good thing. This kitchen timer runs on 2 AAA batteries which are not included. I am not sure how long the batteries will last, but if it's anything like other kitchen timers, I don't think I'll have to replace the batteries for a very long time.One feature this timer has that other kitchen timers I have tried do not have is a memory. When you turn the timer back on, similar to a thermometer, it shows you the last timer setting. This is handy if you want to repeat a recipe's cook time. I have also found it handy to have the stopwatch like function on counting. This timer will count up to 99 hours before it tops out and comes with a 90 day warranty.If the manufacturer fixed the difficult to read numbers, this would be a five star digital kitchen timer.I received this timer for free in exchange for an honest product review","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVVQQYR5I2DO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016V4RD80#wasThisHelpful","R2KVVQQYR5I2DO","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty basic zombie killing gameThe object of this game is to kill all of the zombies. Killing a zombie is a three step process: aim at the zombie using your stylus or finger; touch the target that appears to zoom in on the zombie; and touch the fire button. I'm either really bad at this game, or there is a strong learning curve to it because I found that I had to fire again and again to hit a single zombie. This was really frustrating, which is why I gave this game four stars instead of five.I found that more often than hitting zombies, I would hit innocent bystanders by knocking them over. I didn't like the idea that innocent bystanders could be killed, but hey, it's a game about zombies, it's not like it's a game about fairy tales. I enjoyed the fact that this game is not disturbing or overly gory and bloody.Compatibility wise, this game worked with my ASUS Memo Pad tablet; my Verizon Ellipsis tablet; and it worked with an Android game player on both the iPad and the iPhone.At the end of the day, this is a basic zombie killing game. There are not a lot of pesky ads in the way and game play is simple enough that a child could get the hang of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RABGJ72UY93P5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVV5I2M#wasThisHelpful","RABGJ72UY93P5","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the original Kikkoman Soy Sauce. It's very tasty but also very salty (most soy sauces are) so use it sparingly if you don't want to suffer from high blood pressure/high sodium levels.I love this soy sauce. I use it all the time in recipes that I am making for other people, as I am no longer able to have this variety of Kikkoman Soy Sauce due to allergies. This Soy Sauce tastes wonderful on both white rice and when used in fried rice recipes. I love putting it into fried rice made with egg, and it tastes fantastic on scrambled eggs as well, whereas some Soy Sauces overpower scrambled eggs. One of my favorite ways to use this Soy Sauce is when I'm making ""gourmet hot dogs"" (I know, those two words should never be used together). I put a tablespoon of the Soy Sauce inside of a skillet and then I coat the pan in it, and dump the hot dogs in, and coat them in the charbroiled Soy Sauce as they are cooking. It gives hot dogs a heavenly taste that even adults love. I've also added this Soy Sauce to BBQ sauce recipes, used a basting brush to ""paint"" it on hamburgers on the grill, and it's awesome in beef noodle soups. I've used it to create my own version of Top Ramen as well.While Kikkoman Soy Sauce adds a lot of flavor to a variety of foods, it is really high in sodium. If you use too much of it, all you will taste in your dish is salt. I have ruined a few dishes by adding too much. Always add less than you think you will need to start, and then add more later for flavoring if necessary, otherwise you can end up with flavor overload.In terms of ingredients, Kikkoman has always been known for simple ingredients. It used to be just water, wheat, soybeans, and salt in their Soy Sauce. Now however, there is less than 1/10 of Sodium Benzoate added to the ingredient list and it's used as a preservative. A serving size is considered 15ml which is roughly 3 teaspoons. I cannot imagine using 3 teaspoons on rice or regular recipes, as that is a lot of Soy Sauce. That 15ml serving size has 10 calories, 2 grams of protein, and 920 mg of sodium. That's a lot of sodium.The flavor of this Soy Sauce is rich, flavorful, and extremely salty. Go easy on it, and use it sparingly, it's great in recipes or as a stand alone topping on rice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27YKBUL2O8WRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051ONTXU#wasThisHelpful","R27YKBUL2O8WRD","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an adorable Hallmark Ornament of the Cat In The Hat.I love this cute little Cat In The Hat ornament. Unlike some ornaments that scream ""Christmas"", this ornament has nothing about it that is related to Christmas at all. The Cat In The Hat is sitting down, and he's holding a blue book ""reading"" the book. The problem that I have with this ornament is that the Cat In The Hat's eyes are closed. Seriously, how can you read with your eyes closed! This ornament would have been so much better if his eyes were open.I had originally purchased a dozen of these to pass out on Read Across America day in March 2016, but when I found out the Cat In The Hat had his eyes closed (I didn't check the photos out ahead of time) I ended up returning them all. I didn't even keep one for myself and I'm a huge Cat In The Hat fan.In terms of quality, this ornament is below Hallmark quality, like a lot of the mainstream Hallmark ornaments are these days. It looks like one of those $5 big box store ornaments and not really like a Hallmark ornament. The Cat In The Hat's fur is painted unevenly, meant to look like fur, but it just comes out looking like clumps more than anything. The book is painted unevenly and some of the blue of the cover runs into the inside where the Cat In The Hat is reading.At the end of the day, this is one of my least favorite Cat In The Hat ornaments to date. The poor quality doesn't say Hallmark to me, and the fact that his eyes are closed doesn't make much sense.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6P1ZXIMAGM96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01452RPWO#wasThisHelpful","R6P1ZXIMAGM96","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw this puzzle at Disney's California Adventure Park inside of a gift shop, and I knew it would be perfect for a special puzzle lover in my life. I sent it to her last Christmas, and I couldn't help but purchase a copy for myself as well. When I purchased the puzzle at DCA, the clerk said that it was a ""hard puzzle"" which is one of the reasons why I purchased it. I love a challenging jigsaw puzzle.The puzzle pieces for this puzzle are very small, but I'm used to that with most large puzzles these days. This is a 1,000 piece puzzle, and the box literally has the nerve to say ages 3 and up on it. After having worked with preschoolers the majority of my life, I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that there is no way that a 3 year old could put this puzzle together, not even with the help of an adult. If I had to put an age group on this puzzle I would say 12 and up, yes, it's that difficult. It is definitely a jigsaw puzzle for adults and teenagers who like a challenging jigsaw puzzle.The finished puzzle measures 18""x26"". The size is weird. I would have preferred 18""x24"" because I make puzzles and then frame them, and an 18""x24"" puzzle would have fit in a poster frame. This puzzle does not fit in a poster frame, nor did it fit any normal sized frame that I could find, at a craft store, big box store, or a frame store. I had to get a frame that was larger and then put a mat around this puzzle to frame it, otherwise I would have had to spend a small fortune to get a custom frame made. Just something to keep in mind if you like to save your puzzles. This puzzle handled puzzle glue well and did not cause the pieces to bend or warp, the designs to fade or bleed, or the finished puzzle to look glazed or shiny.Putting this puzzle together is a challenge. The pieces are small and there are 1,000 of them. The border is not a straight border like you might be used to, and is instead decorative. I found the border to be one of the most challenging parts of this puzzle. Additionally, the puzzle itself is difficult to complete because you don't have a finished picture that is large enough to see detail on, of what the puzzle should look like. There is a picture on the front of the box, but the detail is so small, that it really doesn't help you much with which puzzle pieces go where. If you know Disneyland Park like the back of your hand like I do, you will find this puzzle easier than those not familiar with the park. This would have been a better/easier puzzle if they would have included a poster inside that showed the finished puzzle.The pieces fit together smoothly and do not come apart while you are assembling the puzzle. The pieces did not bend or curl while putting together the puzzle. There were no pieces missing when I built this puzzle. Even though the pieces are small and there are 1,000 of them, this is definitely not an impossible puzzle and I found it easier than the Disney Photo Mosaic Puzzles, which I have come to loathe as they seem to take forever to put together.At the end of the day if you have a Disneyland fan in your household, he/she will love this puzzle. It comes out looking like a map of Disneyland and is a bright, colorful, and challenging puzzle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J2MFC5SGE05K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005H8GKWM#wasThisHelpful","R3J2MFC5SGE05K","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I started taking Doctor's Best CoQ10, I had only just learned about CoQ10. I found it on a website for solutions for high blood pressure, and was delighted to find the Doctor's Best brand here on Amazon. I was experiencing high blood pressure due to eating habits and stress, and I was not able to control it on my own. The doctors wanted to put me on medication for high blood pressure, but bad experiences with Hydrochlorothiazide in the past left me skeptical and not wanting to go on medication. Weekly visits for blood pressure checks were becoming annoying at best, and I knew I had to find a solution.CoQ10 first impressions:My first impression of CoQ10 was that I did not feel anything. No side effects, no benefits, my blood pressure remained the same, and it felt like I as taking nothing at all. I did not change my eating habits, as I did not want to, and I did not change my exercise habits either. The Doctor's Best CoQ10 soft gels were easy to swallow, a good size, didn't leave an aftertaste in my mouth, and didn't have to be taken at a certain time of the day. Still, I thought I was wasting my money since I felt nothing at all.CoQ10 second impressions:My second impression of CoQ10 came 72 hours after my first dose. My blood pressure started to stabilize itself. Blood pressure readings of 185/129 were now down to 128/87, and I felt like my blood pressure was, for the first time in a long time under control. If I missed a dose, I could see a difference in my blood pressure. At the advice of my pharmacist, I started taking Doctor's Best CoQ10 once in the morning and once before bedtime. I could definitely see the difference in my blood pressure.As time went on while taking CoQ10:As time went on, I found that my blood pressure was staying under control all of the time. Readings were consistently in the 125/82 to 129/87 range, and I was happy with the results. Swallowing two soft gels a day was no big deal in the grand scheme of things, and CoQ10 had become a part of my everyday vitamin and mineral routine. I was not sure if it was a placebo effect (I thought it was working) or if it was actually working. So, I decided to stop taking it, for three days, and I had nothing but high blood pressure readings in the 185/130-200/150 range. It was definitely working, and I was definitely now a fan of CoQ10.Research:I don't like to put anything in my body that I don't understand, and I knew nothing about CoQ10 when I first started researching it. CoQ10 is a naturally occurring coenzyme in the body that acts as both an antioxidant and helps with cell growth. It is found in some foods, and is strongest in animal organs like liver and kidneys...two things I wouldn't eat if I was on a deserted island starving to death. I also found out that it is found in peanuts and beef, two foods that I eat occasionally, but definitely not enough to be beneficial in the long run.The medical claims associated with CoQ10 seemed to go on forever, it claimed to be good for everything from cancer to muscular dystrophy, but it's main claim was that it helped with having a healthy heart and high blood pressure, which is the main reason I started taking it.What about side effects:I hate medication side effects. I am pretty much allergic to EVERYTHING under the sun, and so I always worry about side effects when taking a new medication or supplement for the first time. I have not experienced any side effects while taking this medication. Generally I experience some minor side effects from every medication that I take, but I have had zero side effects while taking CoQ10, making it even easier to take it day after day.For those worried about side effects, side effects possible with CoQ10 supplements are: abdominal pain, dizziness, fatigue, headache, heartburn, increased liver enzymes in the body, irritability, mild insomnia, nausea, rash, and sensitivity to light.Does it interfere with other medications:I always worry about medication interactions. I take a lot of medications including Elavil, Tolterodine, and many acid reducers for heartburn like Cimetidine and Pepcid Complete. I have experienced zero drug interactions with CoQ10 and have not had it affect any of my medications. If you are taking high cholesterol medications or medications that lower your blood sugar you should talk to your doctor before taking CoQ10 and the same goes for those on insulin and blood thinning medications.What happens if you don't get enough CoQ10:Not getting enough CoQ10 can result in aching joints, aching muscles, angina, arrhythmia, bad gums, fatigue, heart failure, high blood pressure, and stomach ulcers.How much CoQ10 should you take:There is no official recommendation for how much CoQ10 the body needs. My pharmacist suggested one capsule twice daily, which is 200mg of CoQ10 a day. The average recommendation is 120mg per day. Doses of up to 1,200 daily have been recorded, and toxicity does not occur until you reach a dose of 3,600mg or more daily.What are the ingredients:I have a lot of allergies, so ingredient lists are very important to me. I have not had any reaction to the ingredients in the Doctor's Best CoQ10. The ingredients in this product are: Coenzyme CoQ10-100mg; Black pepper fruit extract BioPerine-5mg; extra virgin non gmo olive oil; beeswax; soy lecithin; rosemary oil; softgel capsule (gelatin, glycerin, and purified water). Something to keep in mind if you have allergies is that Doctor's Best CoQ10 contains soy ingredientsContinued experience:I have now been taking Doctor's Best CoQ10 for a little over two months. I no longer suffer from high blood pressure, even when I'm stressed out. I have not changed my diet or exercise routines. I eat what I want, and I enjoy no longer having to go to the doctor on a weekly basis for blood pressure readings. I monitor my own readings at home, and the readings have been spot on in the range that I would like them to be 122/83-129/87. I definitely feel like CoQ10 is beneficial for lowering blood pressure, but I cannot attest to it working for other medical conditions or claims that CoQ10 products in general make.Packaging:My biggest complaint, and the reason for a four star rating instead of a five star rating of the Doctor's Best brand of CoQ10 is the packaging. The packaging is a white bottle with an orange lid. The lid has this flap that lifts up. After lifting the flap normally, only twice, the flap broke off. Once the flap is broke, it does not go back on the bottle tightly, so the soft gels become rock hard. I had this happen to the first bottle I bought, and I ended up dumping the second bottle into an old vitamin bottle when it came because the lid on that one broke day five. I use other bottles with lift a flap style lids and I have never had a problem with breakage. It always breaks at the hinge, so I definitely think it's the bottle design and the cheap plastic that is the problem. If you are going to buy the Doctor's Best brand of CoQ10, I recommend that you pour the soft gels into a separate bottle as soon as you receive itAt the end of the day, I'm happy with Doctor's Best CoQ10 supplement. If they changed the packaging, this would be a five star supplement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VM37Q34FT9U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019GW3G8#wasThisHelpful","R2VM37Q34FT9U9","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have purchased many different brands of acrylic soap dispensers over the years. Some last a few weeks, some last a few months, and some last a few years. They all have basically the same design, and they all suffer the same problem...the pump is fine but the acrylic container that holds the soap cracks. For years, I tried to figure out what the problem was, and then I talked to someone who makes acrylic fish tanks, and I found out that the problem is actually that acrylic cannot withstand a lot of chemicals (more on that in a bit) and those chemicals cause the acrylic to crack and weaken over time when the acrylic is exposed to those chemicals. Some research proved that many of those chemicals are found in dish soaps. Even all natural dish soaps contain some of those chemicals. Hopefully, if you are like me and suffering from the cracked soap dispenser problem, this review will help you decide is an acrylic soap dispenser is right for you.In terms of acrylic soap dispensers, the Prepworks one is top notch. I have tried 9 different brands of acrylic soap dispensers and the Prepworks one lasted the longest. The problem with the other brands that I tried is that the pump's spout would fall off the bottle when you push down on the pump over time, due to soap build up, and you would have to put the spout back in before you could dispense soap. This is not only frustrating, but extremely messy. I have not had this problem with the Prepworks bottle, and the spout has not detached from the bottle once.Size wise, the Prepworks soap dispenser is pretty average. It holds 12.5 ounces of liquid soap, lotion, or body wash. I recommend that you don't fill it to the top, in fact, you shouldn't fill it up past 1/2"" to the top. Doing so will cause the soap to leak out of the pump's spout while it's just sitting on the counter. There is no fill line on this soap dispenser, but putting a permanent marker mark at around 12 ounces has worked just fine for me. The Prepworks soap dispenser does not clog easily, like other brands. I have used it for liquid dish soap, lotion, and body wash over the years. The pump is secure and stable and does not take a lot of strength to pump. You get a decent amount of soap, lotion, or body wash dispensed with each pump, so you don't have to pump multiple times to get enough to do dishes or wash your hands.In terms of durability, if you use the right kind of soap, this acrylic dispenser is longer lasting than most. With an all natural dish soap in it, this soap dispenser lasted three years before I had to replace it. The outside is easy to clean, and the inside is easy to rinse out. I use a baby bottle brush to clean the inside every time I refill it, and all though this likely isn't necessary, it seems to prolong the life of the dispenser compared to other dispensers that I have owned. I love the base of the Prepworks soap dispenser. It does not slide around on a counter top like other brands that I have tried and the bottom of the dispenser does not mold like other brands I have purchased in the past.This soap dispenser will clog if you use something that is too thick for it. As a general rule, anything that is clear or see through will easily dispense and anything that is foamy or creamy will likely clog the spout on this dispenser sooner or later. For example: this will not dispense the baby Aveeno body wash that is creamy but will dispense the regular Aveeno body wash which is clear. When it comes to dish washing liquid soap, it will dispense most original formulas, including concentrated formulas, but it will not dispense the foamy or creamy formulas, usually the ones with added vitamins, minerals, and moisturizers.Then there is the cracking that I mentioned earlier. If your soap, lotion, or body wash, has any of the following ingredients, then I recommend that you do not get an acrylic soap dispenser. Even if you use an all natural soap, lotion, or body wash, I still recommend that you check the ingredients, because not everything labeled all natural is in fact completely all natural. In terms of how this compares to other acrylic soap dispensers, this is one of the better ones, and lasts longer than other ones but it depends on how many ingredients are in your soap or lotion.Here is the list of ingredients that damage acrylic that the aquarium guy gave me. This goes for all acrylics, and not just aquariums. I thought I would list everything, even though all of these are not found in soaps and lotions:Acetic Acid which may be listed as Acetic Acid, Acetic Acid Glacial, Acide Acetique, Acido Acetico, Azijnzuur, Essigsaeure, Ethanoic Acid, Ethylic Acid, Glacial Acetic Acid, or Methanecarboxylic Acid,Acetone which may be listed as 2-Propanone, Aceton, Acetone, Beta-Ketopropane, Chevron Acetone, Dimethylformaldehyde, Dimethyl Ketone, or Methyl KetoneAnilineBenzene which may be listed as Annulene, Benzeen, Benzen, Benzene, Benzin, Benzine, Benzol, Benzole, Benzolene, Benzolo, or Bicarburet of HydrogenButyl Acetate which may be listed as 1-Acetoxybutane, 1-Butyl Acetate, Acetate De Butyle, Acetic Acid, Acetic Acid N-Butyl Ester, Butile, Butyl Acetate, Butyl Ester, Butyl Ester Acetic Acid, Butyl Ester, Butyl Ethanoate, or N-Butyl AcetateCarbon TetrachlorideChloroform which may be listed as Chloroform, Chloroforme, Cloroformio, Formyl Trichloride, Methane, Methane Trichlorometheny Tricholoride, Methane Trichloride, Methyl Trichloride, Trichloro, or TrichloromethaneChromic AcidDiethyl EtherDimethyl FormamideDioctyl Phthalate which may be listed as 6-Naphthalate, Dioctyl 2, or Dioctyl Phthalate,Ethyl Acetate which may be listed as Acetic Acid Ethyl Ester, Acetic Acid, Acetic Ether, Acetidin, Acetoxyethane, Aethylacetat, Essigester, Ethyl Acetate, Ethyl Acetic Ester, Ethyl Ester, Ethyl Ester Acetic Acid, or Ethyl EthanoateEthyl Alcohol may be listed as Alcohol, Alcohol Anhydrous, Absolute Ethanol, Aethanol, Aethylalkohol, Alcohol Dehydrated, Distilled Spirits, Ethanol, Ethanol Undenatured, Ethyl Alcohol, Ethyl Hydroxide, Undenatured EthanolEthylene Glycol may be listed as 1-Dihydroxyethane, 2 Dihydroxyethane, 2-Diol, 1-Ethandiol, 2-Ethandiol, 1-Ethanediol, 2-Ethanediol, 2-Hydroxyethanol, Athylenglykol, Dowtherm SR 1, Ethane 1, Ethylene Glycol, or GlycolGasolineHydrofluoric AcidHydrogen Peroxide which may be listed as Albone, Albone 35, Albone 35CG, Albone 50CG, Albone 70, Albone 70CG, Dihydrogen Dioxide, Hydrogen Dioxide, or Hydrogen PeroxideIsopropyl Alcohol which may be listed as 1-Methylethanol, 1-Methylethyl Alcohol, 2-Hydroxypropane, 2-Propanol, 2Propanol, Isopropanol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Propan-2-OL, or Sec-Propyl AlcoholLacquer ThinnerMethyl Alcohol which may be listed as Alcoool Methylique, Alcool Metilico, Bieleski's Solution, Carbinol, Methyl Alcohol, Colonial Spirit, Columbian Spirit, Metanolo, Methyl Hydroxide, Methylol, or Wood AlcoholMethyl Ethyl Ketone which may be listed as MEK, 2-Butanone, 2-Butanone MEK, Butanone, Butanone 2, 2-Butanone OSHA, 3-Butanone, Acetone, Ethyl Methyl Cetone, Methyl-Aethylmethylketon, or Methyl Ethyl KetoneMethylene ChlorideMineral Oil or other products that contain Mineral Oil which may be listed as Adepsine Oil, Alboline, Aromatic Mineral Oil, Bayol 55, Bayol F, Blandlube, Blandol White Mineral Oil, Cable Oil, Carnea 21, Clearteck, Crystosol, Crystosol 325, Deobase, Drakeol, Electrical Insulating Oil, Ervol, Filtrawhite, Fonoline, Frigol, Gloria, Glymol, Heat Treating Oil, Heavy Mineral Oil, Hevyteck, Hydraulic Oil, Hydrocarbon Oils, Jute Batching Oil, Kaydol, Kondremul, Kremol, Light Mineral Oil, Lignite Oil, Liquid Paraffin, Liquid Petrolatum, Lubricating Oil, Mineral, Mineral Oil, Mineral Oil Hydrocarbon Solvent, Mineral Oil Mist, Mineral Seal Oil, Molol, Neo-Cultol, Nujol, Oil, Oil Mist, Parafinium Liquidum, Paraffin Oil, Paraffin Oil Class, Paraffin Oils, Paraffinic, Paraffinum Liquidum, Paroleine, Peneteck, Penreco, Perfecta, Petrogalar, Petrolatum Liquid, Petroleum, Petroleum Hydrocarbons, Petroleum White Mineral Oil, Primol, Primol 355, Primol D, Prolatum Oil, Protopet, Refined Mineral, Refined Mineral Oil, Saturated Paraffin Oil, Saxol, Severely Refined, Tech Pet F, Triona B, Uvasol, White Mineral Oil, or White OilNitric Acid which may be listed as Magnesium Salt, Magnesium Salt Nitric Acid, or Nitric AcidPhenol SolutionSulfuric Acid which may be listed as Acide Sulfurique, Acido Solforico, Battery Acid, BOV, Dihydrogen Sulfate, Dipping Acid, Electrolyte Acid, Mattling Acid, Oil Of Vitriol, Schwefelsaeureloesungen, Sulfuric Acid, or Sulphuric AcidToluene which may be listed as Antisal 1A, Benzene, Benzene Methyl, CP 25, Methacide, Methane, Methyl Benzene, Methyl-Benzene, Methylbenzene, Phenyl, Toluene, or ToluolTrichloroethyleneXylene which may be listed as Benzene, Dimethyl, Dimethyl-Benzene, Dimethybenzene, Meta-Xylene, Mixed Xylene, Total Xylene, Total Xylenes, or XylenesAt the end of the day, this acrylic soap dispenser held up better than others, but it's still not going to hold up if you use a soap, lotion, or body wash with chemicals in it that damage acrylic and can cause it to break down and crack. If your soap, lotion, or body wash contains any of the above mentioned ingredients, then I would recommend a glass soap dispenser. I am giving this soap dispenser five stars as it did last more than a couple of months, which for an acrylic soap dispenser that you are putting chemical containing products in, is pretty good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V4ZW3T2PR7SM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOJP0N4#wasThisHelpful","R3V4ZW3T2PR7SM","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you grew up playing the classic game of Trouble, you might be thinking this is the same game with a Frozen theme. I thought that too. But this is not like the classic game of Trouble that I grew up with. Sure, the rules are the same, the object of the game is the same, but the quality of the materials including the Pop O Matic Bubble itself are very poor quality and much different from the original Trouble.The game board for this game is a thin piece of cardboard. It's about as thick as a cereal box. You need to manipulate this piece of cardboard until it is under the plastic piece that becomes the actual gaming surface. It is difficult to manipulate and get set just right. If you don't get it lined up just right the cardboard bends and it causes the plastic gaming surface to be uneven, wobbly, and bounce around on the table as you play. It also prevents the pieces from sitting on their pegs if the gaming surface is uneven. Bottom line, you have to get the cardboard right the first time, or you mess up the entire game. Since everything is printed on the cardboard from the colors to the paths, you need that cardboard insert under the gaming surface in order to play.The next biggest difference I noticed right away is the Pop O Matic Bubble that is on this game board is MUCH harder to pop than the one in the classic game of Trouble. This game is recommended for ages 5 and up. While regular Trouble can easily be played by a three or four year old, once they get the hang of the Pop O Matic Bubble, this game is definitely for 5 and up because it's so hard to pop the bubble. You have to press it down so hard that sometimes all of the game pieces pop right out of the board and then you have to set them up again to restart the game. There are also times when the Pop O Matic Bubble gets stuck on the side, and doesn't clearly show one number. In the classic game, you could lightly tap the Pop O Matic Bubble and the problem would resolve itself. In this version, if you tap the Pop O Matic Bubble, the problem doesn't resolve itself, instead it causes the game pieces to go flying.The game pieces themselves are larger than the original Trouble game I remember playing with. They have a hole on the top, and open bottoms. The game pieces come in four colors and there are four game pieces of each color. The gaming pieces are purplish pink, orange yellow, green, and light blue in color. There are four stickers for each color peg featuring popular characters from the movie Frozen. Anna gets the purplish pink pegs, Sven gets the orange yellow pegs, Kristoff gets the green pegs, and Elsa gets the light blue pegs. The stickers take some careful placement for pegs to come out looking just right. The problem is, the stickers don't stick tightly to the plastic, so as you move the pegs around each game, the stickers start actually peeling away from the pegs. Then you are left with plain colored pegs, which defeats the whole purpose of a Frozen themed game.At the end of the day, this game is a far cry from the original Trouble, with cheaply made parts that I would not expect from a company like Hasbro. I would not recommend this version of Trouble, even for a die hard Frozen fan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KY6PT5ZGWXGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYD5AJK#wasThisHelpful","R3KY6PT5ZGWXGC","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an adorable Sketchbook Ornament featuring Tigger from Winnie The PoohThis is a 2015 Sketchbook Ornament. This ornament has the Disney 2015 charm attached near the top of the ornament. The charm is actually hooked to the hanging ribbon, so you could remove the charm if you don't like the charms (I don't). This Tigger ornament is made out of resin and is just under 4.5"" tall.This ornament looks like Tigger and captures Tigger's bouncy spirit. He is carrying a stack of presents in his arms. The middle present has a glitter ribbon running down it. The glitter sheds everywhere, and leaves bare spots on the ornament. I don't mind Christmas ornaments with glitter, but I think it needs to be the kind of glitter that does not shed and leave a mess all over your house. Tigger is wearing a Santa hat, has a red and green striped scarf around his neck, and has a bell hanging from his tail. The bell hanging from Tigger's tail does not actually ring.The one thing that bothers me about this ornament, besides the shedding glitter. Is the fact that Tigger's eyes are tightly shut, and it looks like he's force closing them. They don't just look closed, they look forced shut. I don't know why they would close his eyes at all on this ornament, as it doesn't seem to fit the vibe or the look of the ornament.At the end of the day, this is a cute Sketchbook Ornament, but the glitter and Tigger's eyes being closed are two big turn off's for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EE8A3PSWWXV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014VHAUSY#wasThisHelpful","R2EE8A3PSWWXV4","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Does your Elf on the Shelf wear the same outfit all the time? Is he ready for a new outfit? If so, then you need this adorable little tuxedo! I had no idea that Elf on the Shelf had clothes available until I saw this adorable little tuxedo in a store. This tuxedo is part of the Class Couture Collection and is the Dapper Tuxedo. This tuxedo will only fit standard Elf on the Shelf dolls (like the ones that are included with the books) and will not fit the Elf on the Shelf Plushees.This tuxedo is so cute! It reminds me of the old Ken (of Barbie Doll fame) tuxedos that he used to wear. The tuxedo is mainly black in color and the material feels is smooth and satin like. It is supposed to be ""silk like material"" but to me, it's more of a satin like material. Either way, it's the perfect material for the Elf on the Shelf because it doesn't show wrinkles, even after the elf has been up to all of his tricks and movements. The tuxedo has shiny silver coattails and a shiny silver lapel. There is a cute little red bow tie that is attached to the tuxedo. The tuxedo is very detailed and you can see the details in the lapel, right down to the adorable little fake buttons and shirt lines which are drawn on.Like all Elf on the Shelf clothes, this one comes with instructions from the big man at the North Pole himself, Santa Claus. Santa's instructions for this tuxedo are: ""Simply place the Dapper Tuxedo where your scout elf can see it, and he will put it on before his nightly flight to the North Pole"".For families that love Elf on the Shelf and make it a part of their holiday season, it is great that they offer clothing that allows you to make your elf stand out from all of the other elves. The tuxedo is easy to put on your elf and I was able to machine wash it on the gentle cycle in cold water inside of a delicates bag and hang it up to dry. The tuxedo came out of the wash looking brand new, which is great if you have a chocolate thieving elf like we have in our house.The one thing that bothers me about this tuxedo is that our elf has to wear it with his Santa hat, which is the only hat that he has. I would have loved to see them include a top hat with this tuxedo, which would have made it the perfect outfit for our elf. This outfit is recommended for ages 3 and up.At the end of the day, if your Elf on the Shelf has somewhere special to be this holiday season, then you will want to pick up this handsome little tuxedo for him (or her) to wear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RILHOU3M188J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VX8G2NM#wasThisHelpful","RILHOU3M188J4","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an adorable little Clarice bean bag plush toy from the classic Christmas movie Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.I purchased this Clarice bean bag plush toy as a companion for the Rudolph bean bag plush toy. I must say that I think that Rudolph is the cuter of the two. Clarice's mouth on this plush toy is really weird, it sort of looks like she has lips and is wearing lots of light pink lipstick. Her bow is not in proportion to her head, and her eyes look really cheap overall. Her eyes do not capture the look of the Clarice from the movie, and her mouth is way off as well. This bean bag plush looks more like a female deer than it does Clarice.One thing that I do like about this Clarice bean bag plush when you compare it to the Rudolph bean bag plush is that Clarice can actually stand by herself. Her feet are closer together, and that prevents her from tipping over. She measures the same 5"" tall that Rudolph does and is the same length of Rudolph, just about 6"" long. Her body is filled with pellets, but she is still soft to the touch and fun to cuddle with. Unfortunately, she cannot be made to sit down on her hind legs like Rudolph can, so you are left with Clarice standing and Rudolph sitting (since Rudolph doesn't stand on his own) if you buy both of them.At the end of the day, this is a cute little female deer bean bag plush, but I don't feel like it captures the cuteness of Clarice from the movie Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. I do not recommend this bean bag plush.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T3G8OTPAOH1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007305802#wasThisHelpful","R3T3G8OTPAOH1Z","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer bean bag plush is absolutely adorable.This is one of the cutest mini Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer bean bag plush toys I have seen. Rudolph measures a little over 5"" tall and just under 6"" long if you include his red nose and his cute little tail. Unlike some of the bean bag plush toys that I have seen around Christmas time, this one actually looks like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer from the classic Christmas movie. Even though the body of this little guy is filled with pellets, he is super soft and lots of fun to cuddle and squeeze.The only reason I am giving this bean bag plush toy four stars instead of five is that he cannot stand up by himself. You have to prop him up against something on the side to get him to stand. You can however make him sit up on his hind legs by adjusting the back legs, this works quite well, even though they are not really meant to be bent. Rudolph's body looks a little more like Bambi than it does Rudolph in my opinion, but the face captures Rudolph's personality and red nose perfectly.This bean bag plush is the perfect size to stick out of a Christmas stocking or use as a centerpiece on a holiday table. I purchased this little bean bag plush for a six year old girl and she loved it. She calls Rudolph ""Rudy"" and loves to carry him everywhere.At the end of the day, if you don't need a Rudolph plush that sings or has a light up nose, then this is the one for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW45EDM55KEJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007304TZ2#wasThisHelpful","RW45EDM55KEJC","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love TY Beanie Ballz, and often purchase them as gifts. Unfortunately, with the Arizona Cardinals, the quality is hit or miss.This TY Beanie Ballz is of an Arizona Cardinals football player. Unlike the other small TY Beanie Ballz, this one is not 5"" in diameter, but is actually 4.5"" in diameter. I prefer the 5"" size whenever possible and I don't know why TY chose to make this one smaller than the other small TY Beanie Ballz on the market. The fun thing about TY Beanie Ballz is that you can toss them around like real balls, without breaking anything or hurting any one.I purchased a couple of these Arizona Cardinals Beanie Ballz, one for my collection and one for a gift. The one that I gave as a gift was the disappointing one, but I did not know this until after the fact. The way that this particular Beanie Ballz is made, is that the helmet is sort of squished on top of the Beanie Ballz character. Usually, it makes for a nice, round Beanie Ballz that looks like the one in the picture on Amazon. But, every once in awhile, when they squish the helmet down, you end up with a Beanie Ballz character that has a squished, egg shaped head. and the helmet on top of it's head sort of comes to a rounded point. Unfortunately, that's what happened with the Beanie Ballz that I purchased as a gift.The second Arizona Cardinals Beanie Ballz that I purchased did not suffer from the egg shaped problem. It has a perfectly round helmet, and everything about it is absolutely perfect. This Beanie Ballz was introduced to the Beanie Ballz line on July 2, 2012. Like all Beanie Ballz toys, this one has the classic phrase inside of it's hang tag ""Roll Me! Throw Me! Catch Me! I Always Land On My Feet!""Because 1/2 of the Arizona Cardinals Beanie Ballz I purchased were not up to normal TY standards, this is one of those Beanie Ballz that I would recommend that you purchase in store, rather than online whenever possible. Otherwise, make sure the store has a good return policy, like Amazon does.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36JWGGDVGE173/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009J8CJUS#wasThisHelpful","R36JWGGDVGE173","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an adorable TY Beanie Ballz of Alvin from Alvin and the Chipmunks. I am a huge fan of Beanie Ballz. I generally prefer the small ones, but this particular one is the medium one. At the time, only the medium Beanie Ballz of Alvin was available, so that's how I ended up with this one.This medium Beanie Ballz measures approximately 8"" round. Like all Beanie Ballz, Alvin is manufactured by TY, the company that was responsible for the Beanie Babies craze. This Alvin looks like the modern Alvin from the newer Alvin and the Chipmunks movie. I would have preferred a classic looking Alvin, but TY doesn't make one in the Beanie Ballz line. Like all Beanie Ballz, you can toss Alvin around like a ball without hurting any one.The biggest problem I have with Alvin is the proportions. His arms are super tiny and look out of place while his head is huge and makes him look more like a hamster with food in his cheeks than a chipmunk. I also dislike the fact that the red shirt that he is wearing is a hooded sweatshirt, including the hood, but there is no way to make the hood stay on top of Alvin's head. This is really disappointing, why put the hood on the toy, if it cannot stay on the top of the head.Alvin was introduced to the Beanie Ballz line on July 1, 2012 and has the classic Beanie Ballz saying ""Roll Me! Throw Me! Catch Me! I Always Land On My Feet"" inside of his hang tag. Like all TY products, Alvin comes with a heart shaped swing tag.At the end of the day, I wanted Alvin to add to my TY Beanie Ballz collection. I was disappointed with the proportions, the hood that doesn't stay on his head, and the fact that it's not a classic Alvin, but other than those minor things this is a great Beanie Ballz.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FFM6LYAVUXXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WRZS7M#wasThisHelpful","R1FFM6LYAVUXXV","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While Aladdin may not be one of my favorite Disney movies, I love the song Friend Like Me. I'll admit when I first saw the movie Aladdin, I had no idea that the Genie was Robin Williams, I was young and clueless back then. Now that I'm older and I learned years ago that the Genie is voiced by Robin Williams, I have listened to this song dozens of times, both before and after Robin William's death.To me, this song isn't just about the Genie's magic, but it's a song about true friendship, and being there for someone. It's about being that odd person in the crowd that your friends love because of who you are. It reminds me that it's okay to be quirky, strange, different, and out of control some times, and that people who are your true friends will love you in spite of all of those things.This song has a wonderful melody, rhythm, and sound to it. The lyrics are fast moving, and it's definitely not a slow, sappy song. This song is a get up and go type of song, and it's my favorite song from the movie Aladdin, even though A Whole New World is also a good song.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R151BVEXBCFBMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013JMLM2#wasThisHelpful","R151BVEXBCFBMQ","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Elf puzzle is adorable and the perfect puzzle for Christmas time or any time of the year.I love puzzles. Big puzzles, small puzzles, floor puzzles, three dimensional puzzles, I love them all. I especially enjoy puzzles that are themed around television and movies. I came across this Elf puzzle and I fell in love with it. This puzzle features Buddy from the movie Elf (played by Will Farrell) with his hands on his hips forming the letter ""L"" in the word Elf. This exact same design is made by this exact same manufacturer in a 300 piece puzzle if you are looking for something that is less challenging.This puzzle is manufactured by Ceaco. If you have never assembled a Ceaco brand puzzle, you are in for a treat. Ceaco has been making puzzles since the late 1980's and I can remember making their puzzles as a tween and teenager. Their puzzle pieces are extremely high quality. The images are well attached to the pieces and don't peel off like other puzzle manufacturer's images do. Their puzzle pieces don't suffer bending and warping whether you make the same puzzle one time or ten times. This particular puzzle, like many of the Ceaco puzzles is made in the United States of America, something that is rare in the puzzle world.Putting together this puzzle was a treat. The pieces are smoothly and evenly cut so that they fit together without having to force them. The pieces do not bend or lift up like some other brands of puzzles do, so you don't have an uneven finished puzzle. The image is really glossy and looks like a photograph when you fully assemble the puzzle. The puzzle is somewhat challenging because of the amount of the color green that is used in the image, but not so challenging that it's impossible or takes the fun out of assembling the puzzle.This puzzle, like all of the Ceaco puzzles that I have purchased, worked really well on a puzzle mat and the pieces did not curl when the mat was rolled up like some brands of puzzles do. Additionally, I was able to apply puzzle glue to this puzzle when it was finished, without the image being damaged, torn, ripped, or faded like occurs with other brands of puzzles. It was an easy puzzle to frame, and the finished size is 18""x24"". I found a black poster frame at a big box store, and then gave this puzzle framed as a gift to an Elf movie fan.At the end of the day, this puzzle has high quality pieces that are well printed and well cut. It's challenging but not difficult to assemble and makes a great Christmas gift for any fan of the movie Elf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UFEU3IIJ5K3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NWTTO4E#wasThisHelpful","R3UFEU3IIJ5K3C","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have pretty basic needs when it comes to a vacuum cleaner. I want something that has a bag, that's inexpensive, that's lightweight, and that has on board tools. I don't need a Dyson or an Oreck for my vacuuming needs, a simple bagged vacuum works just fine. I've owned Kenmore, Hoover, Dirt Devil, and even Dyson vacuums, and Hoover was always my favorite brand of vacuum, until I purchased this vacuum cleaner. It will be the last Hoover vacuum cleaner I ever purchase or own.Day one of vacuuming, I was impressed with this vacuum cleaner. It was quick and easy to assemble with the included instructions, a single bag (not containing a HEPA filter) was included, and I was vacuuming in a matter of minutes. I have carpet in my living room and bedroom only, and the entire area counts for less than 700 square feet. After the first pass, there was still visible lint on the carpet. After the second pass, there was still visible particles on the carpet. After the third pass, the carpet was clean. I was impressed because I've owned cheap vacuum cleaners that require seven or eight passes to pick up visible lint, so this was an improvement on those vacuum cleaners to me.Day two of vacuuming, less than one week later. I ran the vacuum across my living room floor. I made the first pass, second pass, third pass, fourth pass, and then a fifth and sixth pass and there was still visible lint. I flipped the vacuum upside down and it was completely clogged. This vacuum was not used on high pile carpet, was used on the correct setting, and wasn't used on new carpet, so I did not understand why the clogging. I pulled and cut all of the visible hair and other particles from the bottom of the vacuum cleaner, ran it again, no improvement. I looked through the book for instructions on how to take apart the vacuum to de-clog it, and there were none. I called Hoover, and a very nice customer representative walked me through taking it apart, how to remove the clog, and how to re-assemble it. The whole process took 45 minutes and I removed enough lint particles that I could have given a chihuahua a fur coat. I don't have pets, have only shoulder length hair, and live a pretty normal life, so I didn't understand where all this clog was coming from, or even more importantly, why it never clogged my older Hoover vacuum (the motor finally gave out).Day three of vacuuming and I made one pass over the living room and the vacuum stopped picking up. It was clogged again. I once again cut the visible hair and other particles from the bottom, and it still wouldn't pick up, I had to take it apart and completely clear the clog and reassemble it again.When this vacuum was not clogged, it was only an okay vacuum cleaner. There was great suction action  and power through the hose/wand, but the vacuum cleaner bottom never seemed to have that same suction action and power. It would take multiple passes to clear the room of visible particles, and it would clog if the slightest thing got in it's way, as well as during the course of regular vacuuming. Before I knew this was such a bad vacuum cleaner, I recommended one to a family member, and they bought it on my go ahead, I felt bad for recommending it to them, and when their's clogged after the first use (they have only carpet in their living room), I offered to unclog it. The amount of gunk I pulled out could have provided a fur coat for a poodle.This vacuum seems to choke on lint and anything other than fine particles of dirt. It gets clogged with very little effort, and makes it difficult to vacuum multiple rooms. Changing the bag is quick and easy and the bags are inexpensive, two things that this vacuum has going for it, but those are the only two things that this vacuum has going for it, other than the color (I love the color blue for a vacuum cleaner). I avoided buying a Dirt Devil because it was red, and thought that the blue Hoover was prettier, that's the last time I buy a vacuum cleaner based on color. I love my Dirt Devil and this Hoover went in the trash after sitting around for over a year, being unclogged approximately 30 times, and getting used as little as possible.Some other things I did not like about this vacuum cleaner:Weight - heavier than I thought it would be, weighs just under 15 pounds. It's heavier than I thought it would be, but not so heavy that it makes it impossible to vacuum, even with my FibromyalgiaSelf propelled feature - this vacuum has a self propelled feature, so it sort of takes off by itself. This is annoying at best. It doesn't make vacuuming easier, it actually makes vacuuming harder because it takes off like a race car at Daytona, going out from under you as quickly as possible. I'm a plus sized woman, and have a hard time controlling this vacuum cleaner. The man of the house weighs 200 pounds and is 5'6"" tall and it gets away from him all of the time. It doesn't go crazy when you lose control of it, it just takes off, until it hits a wall. Adjusting the setting for surface doesn't help, it's overly powerful for this type of vacuumOn board tools - this vacuum comes with on board tools. I LOVE on board tools, but I don't LOVE or even LIKE the on board tools included with this vacuum. First, the tools do not stay in their spots on the vacuum cleaner and they are constantly falling off. No matter how you position them, no matter how secure they seem, they always fall off. Every time you put the vacuum away and pull it out again, you have to go looking for the tools. Every time you vacuum and get to the next room you have to go look for the tool that fell off along the way. The extension wands are great and don't clog as easily as the vacuum does itself. The upholstery tool is pretty much useless as it tends to eat or pinch the upholstery too tight and leave weird creases in it, even on upholstery that was successfully vacuumed with other vacuums in a similar price range with similar features, and by my old Hoover vacuum. The dusting brush is basically just a hair brush that gets clogged every time you use it. It's like the bottom of this vacuum magnified, and you are stuck cutting particles and hair out of it, or it doesn't pick up anything. The bristles also bend very easilyHose - the hose on this vacuum is the worst quality vacuum hose that I have seen. It is made to wrap around the back of the vacuum, like a standard vacuum hose. Unfortunately, when you put it on the little hooks, it kinks the hose. Once the hose gets kinked there is no removing the kinks from the hose. It stays kinked forever. I've tried every method of removing the kinks that have worked on other vacuum cleaners, and they have all failed with this vacuum cleaner. I have never owned a vacuum cleaner where the hose kinks so easilyFilter - the filter is advertised as being able to be rinsed and reused once it's dry. I don't know why they call it reusable. I rinsed the filter in a very small amount of cool water, and it literally shredded apart and could not be used again. This was on the first washing, definitely not what I consider to be reusableThick front - the front of this vacuum is wide (15"") which is really nice, but it's also extremely thick. Because of this, it cannot vacuum under beds, sofas, or any of the other places that my old Hoover vacuum canLoud - this vacuum is louder than my old Hoover (over 8 years old) and my neighbors all know when I am vacuuming. Unfortunately, that also means I cannot vacuum early in the morning or late at night no matter how badly my floors need itScratches laminate floors - I have laminate that looks like hard wood in my dining room, kitchen, hallway, bathroom, and vanity areas. Even though this vacuum supposedly works on hardwood floors, I have found that it leaves scratches on my laminate flooring. Not deep gouges, but noticeable scratches, I know they are from the vacuum cleaner because they first appeared after vacuuming, in the same areas I vacuumed. I had to stop using this vacuum on laminate floors because of thisRecently, we moved to a new location. Despite this vacuum cleaner being only a little over one year old, and only being used around 40 times total (less than once a week), this vacuum did not make the move with us and went in the trash can, which is where this vacuum cleaner belongs. I would not recommend this vacuum cleaner to anyone. I have had stick vacuums that perform better, and dust busters that are harder to clog than this vacuum cleaner. This is not the Hoover quality that I have known and loved for years, this is absolute junk and the last Hoover vacuum cleaner that I will buy.And that family member, who has this same vacuum cleaner because I recommended it to her, her's continues to clog as well. She now uses a stick vacuum for her apartment. She used her Hoover vacuum twice and found it too problematic to continue using it. I believed all of the reviews I read about this vacuum that were positive, and trusted the Hoover brand name, but I won't make that mistake again.Photos show the front of the vacuum, the backside of the vacuum where you can see the permanently kinked hose that no longer will hang where it should, and how little it takes to clog this vacuum. With this size clog, the vacuum basically makes noise but provides no suction","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LBUW2XDNR0H4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009ONZ8G#wasThisHelpful","R1LBUW2XDNR0H4","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not usually a Cheez It fan. Cheez It's to me have a strong chemical taste to them and are very artificial tasting. The cheese flavor is also somewhat overpowering, unless you are a young child. I was delighted to find a White Cheddar variety of Cheez It's, and couldn't wait to try them. I am already a fan of other White Cheddar cracker products by other manufacturer's, and I was interested to see how Cheez It's stacked up to the competition.These Cheez It White Cheddar crackers have the perfect amount of cheese flavor. It's not too sharp, not too strong, and not over powerful at all, like regular Cheez It's. I prefer these White Cheddar Cheez It's to regular Cheez It's. The flavor of the White Cheddar Cheez It's does not taste chemically like the regular Cheez It's nor is it over powering like regular Cheez It's.If I could change anything about White Cheddar Cheez It's it would be to remove the annatto that they put in it. I have an annatto allergy (it's a coloring agent in most products) and white cheddar flavored products generally do not contain annatto because they are lighter in color than regular cheddar products. Unfortunately, White Cheddar Cheez It's do contain annatto and it's on their label, I just didn't read it the first time I had them.In terms of flavor comparison to other White Cheddar flavored cracker products, here's how Cheez It's rate:Cheez It Get It Grooves Sharp White Cheddar - much more white cheddar flavor than White Cheddar Cheez It'sBack To Nature Rice Thins White Cheddar - much less white cheddar flavor than White Cheddar Cheez It'sCrunchmaster White Cheddar Multi Grain Crackers - much more white cheddar flavor than White Cheddar Cheez It'sAt the end of the day, I prefer the Crunchmaster White Cheddar flavor to the Cheez It flavor, but the Cheez It's are much less expensive and more readily available. I like this product, if they would remove annatto from this product, I would continue purchasing it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14S1478MAJ22C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014E4M6O#wasThisHelpful","R14S1478MAJ22C","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I often wonder about the path I have chosen for my life. This is one of those moments when I cannot help but wonder why I purchased a product that allows you to make your own frog snot. Yes, I said frog snot. It's one of those kits that I thought ""ew"" and ""cool"" at the same time and decided that I had to buy it, try it, and review it.Let me start by saying you don't make actual frog snot with this kit. You make green slime that is a little thicker than green slime and it is not what I think of as snot, but then again, I've never actually seen frog snot. It does not really look like phlegm either, it looks more like green slime, but slightly thicker.There is no frog included. How can you have a frog snot making kit and not include a cute little toy frog? They could have included a little squeezable frog, one that could actually shoot the snot out, that would have made this kit awesome. Or even just to have a little plastic toy frog with this kit would make sense, because once you take the ingredients out of the box, you don't know this is frog snot, and it ends up looking like a green slime kit.I was a bit concerned when I opened this kit. I bought it for self use, but this is not a kit I would consider giving to a child. There are two ingredients included with this kit, a bottle of ""frog goo"" which is Sodium Alginate and little pellets of ""snot activator"" which is Calcium Chloride. While I don't think either of these ingredients are dangerous on their own, there are poison control numbers included with this kit, something I never like to see when I'm researching kits for possible Christmas gifts for kids.Making the frog snot was pretty easy. You fill a bowl with 1 cup of warm water, pour in the ""snot activator"" and stir with a spoon until it's fully dissolved. Then you remove the cap from the ""frog goo"" and poke a small hole in the middle of the seal and squirt the ""frog goo"" into the activator solution. Once you squirt in the ""frog goo"" you immediately end up with a long, stringy piece of green slime with some clumps in it. It's not really snot looking, it's more like green slime that's not mixed thoroughly in consistency. It breaks apart really easily, so you cannot really play with it much. When it does break apart, you can dip the gooey string back into the solution and it will patch itself back up and you can use it again.When you first make the frog snot, it is very runny. You have to dry it out on a paper towel. The frog snot stained the paper towel and the counter underneath it a yellowish green color. I could not get the stain on the counter to wipe off with soap and water, and had to use bleach to remove it. It is very sticky and gooey to the touch, again more like slime than snot. It also stained the container, which was luckily a dollar store container. Even bleach could not get the container clean. It also stained my hands a yellowish green color and I had to use nail polish remover to get it off my hands.This is not what I consider a complete kit. It includes the ingredients only. You need to provide the container for mixing and storing the snot. The snot has to be stored in an airtight container. You also need to provide the spoon or other stirring implement that you will use to stir the snot. So basically you are getting two chemicals for this price, no toy frog, and no real indication of frog snot other than the box.At the end of the day, since this product contains chemicals, I would not feel comfortable giving this kit to children. Again, the inclusion of the poison control phone number is a bit worrisome to me, as someone who would consider purchasing this kit for a child. The finished product was more like green slime than snot, and is overall disappointing. Staining surfaces and hands is never a good idea when dealing with children's products either. I don't recommend this kit.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DQMSAPQQWISZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJL3JFA#wasThisHelpful","R1DQMSAPQQWISZ","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first heard about this packable backpack with a lifetime warranty, I had my doubts. I go through backpacks like they are going out of style. Whether I'm carting them around Disneyland, wearing them around town instead of carrying a purse, or cramming them full of stuff for an overnight trip, I almost always have a backpack with me. All of the backpacks I have used from cheap $5 backpacks to expensive all leather backpacks, suffer from the exact same problem, poor quality materials that wear down overtime. Again, I was skeptical, and then I received this packable backpack and my skepticism quickly went out the window.The backpack I received is black in color. It was all tucked inside of a tiny little pouch that measures 8.5"" by a little over 1"" thick. No way could a full sized backpack fit in the pouch I thought. And, even if they somehow got a backpack to fit in that tiny little pouch, there was no way that I would be able to fit the backpack back inside of the pouch after using it. So, I put the backpack through it's first test, the packing test. I took the backpack out, filled it to the brim with stuff, and then emptied it, and then started the process of putting it back inside of the pouch. I folded it sort of haphazardly and thought no way would it fit back in the pouch, but it fit just fine, and I did not need to spend any extra time packing the backpack.Okay, so it's portable, and it folds up into almost no space at all, so it can't possibly hold much, can it? I was wrong on that as well. This backpack seems huge when I start filling it. There is the main part which easily fit my women's size XL Disney hooded sweatshirt, women's size XL spare t-shirt, women's size XL spare pair of cotton shorts, spare pair of socks, spare pair of sandals, three 16.5 ounce bottles of water, and my keys. There was room left in the main pocket, but I did not put anything else in it. The two front pockets fit my pressed penny book, bag of quarters, bag of pennies, autograph book, three pens, keys, full sized wallet with checkbook holder, a pack of glow necklaces, and a portable flashlight with batteries. The two side pockets easily fit a 16.5 ounce bottle of water in one pocket and my mini Disney umbrella in the other. Everything that I needed for my trip to Disneyland easily fit in this backpack, and there was room to spare.This backpack is super lightweight, weighing only .7 pounds. I have carried around some backpacks that are heavy, even when they are empty. This backpack feels like you are not even wearing it when it's empty, and only becomes as heavy as the objects that you put inside of it. There is no thick, bulky backpack to carry around and you don't feel like you are carrying around a heavy shell like you do with some backpacks. The zippers are very high quality and don't snag or get stuck like the zippers on other backpacks that I have used. The buckles and straps are really durable, and do not stretch or suffer from whiting or loosening like some plastic buckles do on other backpacks that I have used.In terms of comfort, this backpack is awesome. I wore it all day at Disneyland from park opening to park closing, and it was ultra comfortable. It fit on every ride and I did not have to leave it behind at Disneyland or Disney's California Adventure. It even fit in the under the seat compartment on Soarin' Over California. I took the backpack on Grizzly River Run, which is a water raft ride at Disney's California Adventure, that ride has killed and worn out many backpacks over the years. Nothing inside of my backpack got wet, not even the paper pages in my autograph book, and the material that this backpack is made from dried super quickly and did not leave any water stains, faded colors, or water spots on the fabric.At the end of the day, I have tried a lot of backpacks, but this one is the lightest weight and the most comfortable that I have tried. I now use this as my go to backpack for everything, and I love the design, style, and size of this backpack. If you are looking for a lightweight backpack, this is the backpack that you want to go with, the quality is unmatched and the comfort level is awesome for a backpack of this type or a backpack in general.I received this backpack for free in exchange for an honest product review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIOJEF2LOQFF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0157N2HKU#wasThisHelpful","RIOJEF2LOQFF1","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems like Selfie Sticks are a dime a dozen these days and everyone is trying to get into the Selfie Stick market. This Bluebits Selfie Stick is one of many Selfie Sticks that I have tried. While it's not my favorite Selfie Stick, it's an above average Selfie Stick that will definitely perform under normal Selfie Stick conditions.This Selfie Stick is very basic in styling. It is black in color with the Bluebits logo on the Selfie Stick itself, which I don't mind as it's a normal brand like logo, but then the strap of the Selfie Stick is plastered with the Bluebits logo over and over again. Seriously, we get that it's a Bluebits Selfie Stick, give it a plain black strap and call it a day. I had to remove the strap and replace it with my own strap because the logo was so prominent that I found it distracting, plus I don't like to be a walking advertisement for a company.This Selfie Stick has some neat features that I found really useful, and some that did not work as well as I hoped.Bluetooth shutter - this Selfie Stick has a Bluetooth shutter so that you can pair it with your cell phone and then take Selfies without actually touching your phone. I had an extremely difficult time with the Bluetooth pairing of this Selfie Stick. It took six attempts to pair it with a Samsung Galaxy and nine attempts to pair it with an iPhone. It did eventually pair correctly, but it should not have taken so many attempts to make the Bluetooth shutter feature fully functionalRotating head - the head can rotate up to 270 degrees so that you can take Selfie's in different angles. I like the rotating head and feel like the company should have made it a 360 degree rotation like many of the other Selfie Sticks that I have tried haveBattery life - battery life is awesome on this Selfie Stick, compared with other brands that I have tried. I got 22 hours of use time on the first charge, 26 hours of use time on the second charge, and 19 hours of use time on the third charge. The average use time for this Selfie Stick is 20 hours, so I think that it is definitely battery friendly compared to other Selfie Sticks that I have triedCharging time - charging time for this Selfie Stick is incredibly fast, which is great if you don't like to wait around for batteries to charge. The first time I charged it, it charged completely in 28 minutes, the second time I charged it, it charged completely in 31 minutes, and the third time I charged it, it took just under 26 minutes. The average charge time for this Selfie Stick is 30 minutes, which is much faster than many of the other Selfie Stick brands that I have triedMaterials used in manufacturing - very high quality. The plastic bracket that holds the phone is tight fitting and clamps tightly on your phone. It has rubber grips so you don't get damage or scratches to your phone, which I have experienced with other brands of Selfie Sticks. The bracket was able to clamp over the soft cases on both my iPhone and Samsung Galaxy without having to remove the phones from their cases. The pole is made of stainless steel and appears to be very durable. I have dropped it on tile, concrete, laminate flooring, and hardwood floors, and have yet to experience any breakage, or bending of the poleWeight and portability - this Selfie Stick is extremely portable. It folds down pretty much to the size of the handle, and it weighs just over 5 ounces. It's very easy to tuck in a purse or backpack to carry with you wherever you go. Even though it's lightweight, it doesn't feel cheaply made, and both my iPhone and Samsung Galaxy feel extremely secure when they are on this Selfie Stick, it doesn't feel like they will slide off or fall off like it does with other Selfie Stick brands that I have triedLength - in terms of length, this Selfie Stick is much shorter than other Selfie Sticks I have tried, even when fully extended. It is great for close up Selfie's, but if you plan to use it more for far away photos as a monopod rather than a Selfie Stick, it doesn't work quite as well due to the short lengthAt the end of the day, this is a durable Selfie Stick that gets the job done. It has awesome battery life. The main improvement that is required is to make the Selfie Stick easier to pair with Bluetooth and to extend the pole. If they made those two improvements, this would be a five star Selfie StickI received this Selfie Stick for free in exchange for an honest product review","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R158VJKYAIKKJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IXRZ8W#wasThisHelpful","R158VJKYAIKKJ0","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful and luxurious looking dress at a very affordable price.This dress is made of polyester and Lycra. It is extremely easy to wear, and has a casual way of wrapping the body in pure luxury. I knew my friend, who wears a size 4 would love this dress, and I was right, she did love it. The sizing is very accurate. I would say that this dress will fit an extra small to a medium, even though it states small to medium. I think a lot of that will depend on your actual measurements. For reference, my friend has a 34"" bust, 24"" waist, and 34"" hips. This dress fit her like it was made for her. It was roomy enough that someone who is a size 6 could easily wear this dress, but not so roomy that it looked cheap or baggy. The dress measures just over 50"" in length, if you are wondering if it will fit you. My friend is five foot one and this dress fits her beautifully.The colors of this dress are gorgeous. The main color of the dress is an aqua blue color that is quite serene looking. The pattern reminds me of peacock feathers done in shades of pink with yellow and green accents. The dress ties around the neck, and the ties are extremely well made, and don't pull, stretch out of shape, or dig into your neck. I love the fact that you can throw this dress on with a pair of flats to go out on a date, or you can put it on with flip flops or sandals to wear to the beach. It's definitely a casual dress, but you could dress it up as well, on a summer evening with a plain black sweater.My friends biggest complaint with this dress is that she does not know how to care for the garment. Unfortunately, the tags are written in a foreign language (Chinese I think). The words washing instruction are written in English, but everything else is in Chinese. The first time it was washed, it was washed in the washing machine in cold water on the gentle cycle, and we laid it flat to dry. I do not know if this is the correct washing procedure or not, but it came out beautifully, unfaded, and not damaged in any way.At the end of the day, the fit is wonderful, the color is beautiful, but every garment needs laundering instructions or it becomes a one time use garment. If this is something that the manufacturer changes, this would be a five star dress.I received this dress for free in exchange for an honest product review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K0YQXPDWMT9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015N5TK2K#wasThisHelpful","R3K0YQXPDWMT9L","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried a number of maternity belts and other types of support belts. Some just support the back, others support both the back and the belly. This particular maternity belt is what I would consider a low support belt. Meaning that it provides only a slight amount of support for your belly and your lower back.I ordered this maternity belt in a size XXL. I ordered it for a friend who wears a size L usually, but based on measurements, I thought the XXL would be the best fit for her. My guess on sizing was correct. If you plan on ordering this maternity belt, I recommend going up two sizes from your normal size. Her first comment was the fact that she had never worn a maternity belt before, and had no idea which piece went where. This maternity belt comes in two pieces which have to be attached together with Velcro, but there are no instructions, or a picture of how the finished maternity belt should look, so if you've never worn a maternity belt before, you might not know how it goes.The part with the stripes goes on your back and the strap goes up over the top of your belly, just under your breasts. Getting the two pieces to Velcro together properly is the hardest part of using this maternity belt. The pieces tend to want to stick together, because the Velcro is attracted to the entire belt and not just the part that it should Velcro to. I wish the rest of the maternity belt would have been made of a type of fabric that Velcro does not cling to.Once the maternity belt is correctly assembled, it provides next to no lower back support because of how it fits on the body. It does provide plenty of belly support, which is nice if you are carrying a large bun in the oven. The strap that goes on top of the belly provides some breast support so you don't get tons of sagging over your belly, which is also nice.In terms of comfort, my friend enjoyed wearing this maternity belt. It did not bunch up or ride up while she was wearing it. It's very lightweight and not bulky while you are wearing it. While it does show under clothes, it doesn't scream maternity belt and it looks like you are actually wearing a belly sling when you see it through clothes. The material is very soft and doesn't dig into your skin which is nice.At the end of the day, if this belt was made to provide a some lower back support, it would be a five star maternity belt.I received this maternity belt for free in exchange for an honest product review.Photo shows the pieces of the maternity belt and NOT the way that the maternity belt is worn.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8GG9ALUMABVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AC6GQW#wasThisHelpful","R8GG9ALUMABVT","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will start this review by saying that I have no experience with this type of hammock, I've only ever owned the old fabric kind with ropes that you had to tie to posts, you know the ones, that rip when it's windy and the fabric fades almost immediately. The kind that you have to be a sailor to tie the ropes to the posts or the hammock disappears the first time it's windy or raining outside. This hammock is not your typical hammock, in fact, it's a lot better than your typical hammock.This hammock comes in a cute little packable bag. The bag is small enough that you can tuck it in a backpack for camping or a beach bag for a day spent at the shore. The problem that I have with other items that come in packable bags is that once you remove the item from the bag, you can't get the item back into the bag without being a rocket scientist. With this hammock, that is not the case at all. Once you remove it from the bag, it goes back in quickly and easily. You don't have to do any special folding and you don't need directions, you literally just push the hammock back into the bag, and you are ready to take it on the go again. One of the best things about this packable hammock is that the storage bag is attached to the hammock. Because of this, you don't have to worry about losing it, or worry about it flying away never to be seen again, you always know exactly where it is.This hammock is made out of nylon parachute fabric. This is the same type of material that they make the sky diving parachutes out of, and as such it's extremely durable and extremely easy to clean. To clean this hammock, I just squirt it down with the garden hose and let it dry. The fabric is comfortable when you are relaxing in the hammock, and you don't go slipping and sliding all over it, even though it's made of parachute material. The hammock's colors do not fade when it's left out in the sun and stains rinse off easily, as I found to be the case when I dumped a glass of Hawaiian Punch accidentally while relaxing in this hammock.As I said before, this hammock is durable. It is weight rated to support up to 330 pounds. I tested this hammock with a child weighing 65 pounds, an adult weighing 185 pounds, an adult weighing 259 pounds, and an adult weighing 335 pounds. All of these people were able to be comfortably in the hammock, and the hammock was able to support their weight without bending, tearing, stretching, or ripping. This hammock is also very roomy to accommodate a large variety of body sizes, weights, and shapes. The hammock measures approximately 8'8"" in length by approximately 4.5' in width, definitely large enough to accommodate all of our test subjects, the tallest of which was 5'10"" tall. Anyone under 6 feet will be extremely comfortable in this hammock. I have a neighbor who is 6'2"" tall and wanted to see how comfortable she would be in this hammock, she found it comfortable for relaxing in as well, and with some measuring, we feel like this hammock would be marginally comfortable if you are between 6 feet and 6.5'. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone over 6.5' tall.The colors on this hammock are very steadfast. They do not bleed when the hammock gets wet, and they do not fade when left out in the sunlight all of the time. The colors are a bright blue and gray. The colors are gender neutral, though I would love to see this hammock made in a dark purple with maybe a maroon center, that would be truly beautiful and a little more on the feminine side. The material does not tear easily. I often relax in this hammock with keys in my pocket and I've yet to see the hammock tear, or form a hole.This packable hammock includes 2 rope tie downs and two large carabineer style clips. This is the easiest hammock that I have ever hung in my life. It's so simple to tie the hammock down and the carabineer clips ensure that the hammock is sturdy even if you aren't a sailor who ties the worlds best knots. I tested this hammock between two strong trees, two wooden posts, and also a hammock stand that stands on it's own, and this hammock was easy to hang in all of these testing environments.At the end of the day, I could not find a bad thing to say about this hammock, and I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a durable, portable, long lasting hammock. Even if you don't need a portable hammock, this is a great all purpose hammock that is roomy and comfortable.I received this hammock for free in exchange for an honest product review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31PFX0MZRW3WN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XMKE26I#wasThisHelpful","R31PFX0MZRW3WN","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic ring for both men and women. I actually wanted this ring for myself and I'm a thirty something female. I have large fingers that are on the thick side, and I prefer mens rings because they are bolder with a wider band then women's rings. I wear a size 9 in rings generally, but I ordered a size 11 because I thought it looked a little small in terms of sizing online, the 11 fit perfectly and was a great choice!I love the fact that this ring is made out of tungsten. So many rings are made out of Titanium, especially when it comes to men's rings, and Titanium rings cannot be cut off by emergency personnel and you cannot wear them in the military in some cases, so it's nice to see ring manufacturer's, like this one, that are making rings for men out of other materials. I have never owned a tungsten ring before, so I was not sure what to expect, I have to say that I really like the feel of tungsten, it feels substantial without being overly heavy on my finger, and it doesn't feel like it's going to bend or break over time. I also love the fact that it doesn't scratch easily, as I have already banged the ring against cabinets and counter tops, and so far, it shows no signs of damage, wear, or tear.This ring is made out of tungsten carbide, which I have found to be very strong and durable. I have yet to damage this ring. It also is much shiner than I expected and the shine does not fade with constant hand washing, doing the dishes, etc. Keep in mind that this ring does contain some nickel inside of it, but it is plated, and I have a severe nickel allergy, the plating does not contain nickel, and I have not had any allergy problems while wearing this ring. This ring also does not stain your finger, leave marks on your finger, leave black spots on your finger, or leave green rings on your finger, all things I have experienced with other brands of mens rings that are inexpensive.In terms of care, this ring is super easy to clean, I just wipe it with a jewelry cleaning wipe, and it's good to go. It has stayed shiny and looks nice. I've received many compliments on this ring, and when I tell people it's tungsten and not titanium, they cannot believe it, because it looks like a strong titanium ring.At the end of the day, I would recommend this to anyone who loves a wide ring. It's a great gift for men, but as you can tell from my review, it makes a wonderful women's ring as well.I received this ring for free in exchange for an honest product review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34NF9M246OHAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016BH24YK#wasThisHelpful","R34NF9M246OHAT","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This corset is a corset without laces or zippers, it has a hook and eye closure only. There are 16 hook and eye fasteners that allow you to adjust the sizing of this corset to three different sizes. 12 hook and eye fasteners take a LONG time to fasten, and I prefer the newer styles of corsets with zippers to those with the hook and eye closures. I actually find the old style of lace up corsets easier to put on then the hook and eye closure corsets as well.This corset looks like a corset, but it doesn't function like one at all. It doesn't suck in your gut, or make you look skinnier. In fact, it doesn't really do much of anything except fit tightly around your body. It is made out of Lycra, so it breathes well and it also fits comfortably, but it doesn't function like a corset, so I don't consider it a true corset. It's overly flexible, so it doesn't provide you with any kind of support. They use elastic cotton throughout the corset, and I think that's what made it overly flexible, and not really supportive.This corset uses a memory steel bone support. It sort of reminds me of a memory foam mattress that in the beginning conforms to your body perfectly, but as time goes on, it starts getting flatter and flatter. That's sort of what happens with this corset. The first time you put it on, it fits comfortably and provides a very small amount of support, but the material is so stretchy and flexible, that every time you take this corset off and put it back on, it becomes looser and looser. It ends up not providing you with any support at all.I noticed that this corset did not have any odor or chemical smell straight out of the package, which is a nice change of pace from other corsets I have tried recently. This one is also very true to size. I wear an XL and this corset fit me perfectly, a large would have been too small. Definitely order your true size with this corset.I think this had the potential to be a great corset, but it doesn't provide any support and it takes a long time to fasten shut. I definitely would not purchase a corset like this in the future.I received this corset for free in exchange for an honest product review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H76GE3CCWQ9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016M67OAY#wasThisHelpful","R3H76GE3CCWQ9I","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great running belt! I have tried a number of running belts lately, and they all seem to either be too small or too large. This running belt is the perfect size. It fits my Samsung cell phone, my house keys, cash, and my iPod. I love being able to carry everything with me, without having to wear a full size fanny pack, because they just are not very stylish or comfortable, especially when you are running, jogging, or riding a bicycle.I really love the fact that this running belt sits comfortably against my body. It doesn't ride up, shift around, or become bulky and uncomfortable. When I am riding an exercise bike, the running belt stays comfortably in place and does not feel like it's too big or in the way while I'm riding, a problem that I have had with other running belts. This running belt has two pockets with zipper closures, one is a large pocket and is just under 8"" wide and about 3.5"" deep. The other is a small pocket which is a little over 5"" wide and a little over 3"" deep. The pockets are deep enough to secure valuables, and they stay in place without shifting. The large pocket has two smaller pockets inside that are mesh pockets, and are the perfect place for stashing your cash or credit cards.One of the things that I love about this running belt is the fact that it has reflective strips on it, so that you can easily be spotted at night while you are running or biking. This company truly thought of everything and put a lot of care and concern into their product. This running belt is completely adjustable. I have a 42"" waist and it fit me perfectly, but it also fit my boyfriend who wears a mens XL and has a 38"" waist perfectly. I would say if you have up to a size 44"" waist that this running belt will fit you comfortably without being tight or in the way.This running belt is completely waterproof. It is made of a material that feels sort of like diving rubber. The material does not have any kind of odor and you don't need to air out this running belt like I have had to with other brands. I tested the waterproofing ability of this running belt by filling it with cotton balls, and then completely immersing it in a sink filled with water. The cotton balls on the inside stayed completely dry. This reassures me that the waterproofing ability of this running belt is just as the manufacturer claims.At the end of the day, this is a wonderful running belt that provides me with enough space and pockets to take everything with me whether I'm running or just running a few quick errands. This is definitely not just a sports running belt and would be great at amusement parks where you only need a few small things. My Sony Cybershot digital camera even fits in the larger pocket.I received this running belt for free in exchange for an honest product review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REVAKJS4PAE9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016LT1F0W#wasThisHelpful","REVAKJS4PAE9A","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These sports sweat shorts are a different type of short than I generally wear, but I had the opportunity to try them out, so couldn't wait to receive them.The first thing that you need to know about these shorts is that they run small. I generally wear a women's size XL, and the size XXL fit me perfectly. I picked out the size XXL in gray and it was a good choice. These shorts have a multi-colored waist band that was black and red. Each section of the waist band has a separate drawstring which don't really serve a purpose like you would expect them to, they are just kind of for show beyond the first drawstring. The black section has a white drawstring and the red section has a black drawstring. There are two pockets. I love the fact that the pockets are really deep. I was easily able to put my keys, wallet, and cell phone in a single pocket and not have to worry about things falling out.In terms of comfort, these shorts are so comfortable. They are made of 100% cotton and are ultra soft. They fit wonderfully, and they stay securely around my waist. They don't ride up like some brands of sweat shorts do. They also don't get sweaty or absorb sweat odors like some brands of sweat shorts do. The legs don't rub together and cause chafing, a common problem that I have with shorts that are 100% cotton. These shorts are really breathable and feel so comfortable while you are wearing them. They are also super easy to clean and are machine washable and can go in the dryer. They don't get wrinkly when you machine wash and dry them, and that makes it easy to wear them straight out of the dryer.The one thing that I dislike about these sweat shorts is the length. They are overly long, like below the knees long. They make me feel like I am wearing a pair of Capri pants rather than a pair of shorts. If the length was even a little shorter, like slightly above the knees or at the knees, these would be perfect.At the end of the day, these shorts run about a size smaller than you would expect them to, so order one size larger (at least) than you normally would. They are also a little too long to be considered shorts in my opinion. Otherwise, this would be a five star pair of sweat shorts.I received these shorts for free in exchange for an honest product review","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JIU2KF8CNPWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1OX37W#wasThisHelpful","R2JIU2KF8CNPWN","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to start this review out by saying that I know nothing about fisheye lenses, nor have I used them in the past. I'm not one for smart phone ""add ons"" but when I had the opportunity to test and review this product, I thought it was worth the time so I decided to try it.The Aerb Fisheye Lens is actually three lenses in one. The three lenses are: fisheye lens, macro lens, and a wide angle lens. The lenses are stored all together and you have to unscrew them from each other in order to use them. I found this to be somewhat annoying, as the threading on the lenses is difficult to line up, and makes them somewhat difficult to remove from each other. Also included with this Fisheye Lens are two different lens caps. The lens caps are made of thin plastic, and they protect the lenses from scratches, grooves, and breakage. I think the lens caps are really well made compared to the rest of the items in this set. There is also a storage bag for the lenses, which is a nice touch, but make sure you screw them together before you put them in the bag, or you will end up having them bang together, which scratches the lenses. There is also the lens mount, which is the weakest link of this set.The lens mount is made out of plastic and clips onto your cell phone or iPad to hold the lenses in place. The clip is made out of very cheap plastic and does not form a tight grip on a Samsung Galaxy S4, iPhone 6, or an iPad. Because of this, the clip slips around, resulting in multiple problems. The first problem is that the clip is not cushioned in any way and will actually scratch the surface of your phone. I did not have scratching problems with the Samsung Galaxy S4, but I did have scratching problems with both the iPhone 6 and the iPad. The second problem is that the clip tends to move as you move your device, so sometimes the lens doesn't stay over your device's camera, and you end up being able to see the clip in your photographs. The third problem is that the clip does not mount over cell phone cases, so you have to move your case from your device every time you want to use this fisheye lens.The mount with the clip does allow you to position it over your device's camera, and because of this, it works with a wide variety of devices. I was even able to use it successfully with a Toshiba Satellite laptop with a web cam as well as a Verizon Ellipsis Tablet. I love that it's quick and easy to remove the mount from your device and switch it to another device or store it when not in use.The lenses performed as follows:Wide angle lens with the macro lens - taking a panoramic photograph of a sunset through a standard glass windowSamsung Galaxy S4 - clear, crisp photograph with plenty of detailiPhone 6 - clear photograph with only minor detail, somewhat fuzzy over the entire photographVerizon Ellipsis Tablet - clear, crisp photograph with plenty of detailToshiba Satellite Laptop - clear, crisp photograph with plenty of detailiPad - clear, crisp photograph with plenty of detailMacro Lens - taking a photograph of a Micro Machines fire engine to capture the detail for an online auction listingSamsung Galaxy S4 - clear, crisp photograph showing all of the detailsiPhone 6 - fuzzy photograph with very few details showingVerizon Ellipsis Tablet - clear, crisp photograph showing all of the detailsToshiba Satellite Laptop - fuzzy photograph showing no details, cannot make out what the photo is ofiPad - fuzzy photograph showing minor detailsFisheye Lens - photograph of the skyscrapers in downtown San Diego as seen from the sidewalk along the bay in front of Anthony's RestaurantSamsung Galaxy S4 - clear photograph showing most details, average photograph, with black sections on both the left and right sides of the photograph. When fully zoomed in, black sections disappear but the photograph becomes fuzzy and blurryiPhone 6 - clear photograph showing all details, above average photograph, with black sections on both the left and right sides of the photograph. Photograph was unchanged when adjusting camera settingsVerizon Ellipsis Tablet - clear photograph showing all details, above average photograph, no black sections on the photograph. The highest quality photograph that I had during my test photosToshiba Satellite Laptop - clear photograph showing most details, average photograph with black section on the right side only of the photograph.iPad - fuzzy photograph, hard to make out what the photograph is of, worst of the test photographs that I tookMy tests and photographs with the Aerb Fisheye Lens show that this is an average quality macro lens and wide angle lens and a poor quality fisheye lens. The device that you use this product on, really changes the photograph results.At the end of the day, this product is definitely one of those gimmick add ons for your smart phone or tablet. It barely does what it's advertised, and yet the macro and wide angle lenses are good enough to warrant a three star review.I received this fisheye lens set for free in exchange for an honest product review","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R574G4MSG15AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZ7O4IK#wasThisHelpful","R574G4MSG15AC","A1XZVBL9NT2TW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XZVBL9NT2TW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a really nice case but unfortunately, it suffers from the same problem that most of these wallet cases do: the makers of these cases give little attention, it seems, to the fact that people are going to use those pockets for credit cards and other cards in addition to cash. Once you put in several of these items and a few folded bills, it really bulks up. The latch still closes but they should make the case more able to accommodate all of the things people typically carry in a wallet. The only other thing I would have liked is if they would have made the case long enough to hold a flat dollar bill. As it is now, you have to fold the cash you put in there which further bulks up the case. The 6+ is large enough that another bit in the length to accommodate flat cash won't make a world of difference.I have had it for a few months now and it seems to be holding up well. I bought the mint color and love it. When I first took it out of the package, I thought I would hate it. I can't explain it but the color made the wallet look kind of cheap and fake. I can't really explain it.

"I must say that if you have a small deck or patio and an umbrella that you bought 20 years ago, DON'T throw it away! The stuff they make today is just terrible. I cannot impress upon readers enough how incredibly difficult it is to find a 5 foot patio umbrella that actually does its job. First, since most patios and decks are not that large, the need for good quality 5-6 foot max umbrellas is great but options are extremely limited.First, I bought these very lovely looking rainbow color umbrellas locally. They were labeled beach umbrellas. Beach usually means sun right? When I got them home and put them into the umbrella holder, they looked really nice and I was very pleased with them. Then the sun came out and it was like sitting in the sun without an umbrella. You could see the sun right through and there was no protection or comfort sitting under this. Returned them.Next, I moved onto a dark, navy blue umbrella I found in another local shop. Same issue. Nice umbrella, great size, but you can see the sun right through the top if it. Returned that one as well.Then I went all out and bought two expensive (nearly 100 each) 7 foot umbrellas figuring if I wanted real sun protection it was going to cost a good bit of cash. Even the expensive umbrellas that I bought were made of a layer of fabric and nothing else. It did not provide the sun protection that is the whole point of an umbrella. The quality of the material was better than on the smaller umbrella but if you can make out the sun from sitting under an umbrella then it is not doing its job. So I had to send those back as well.This umbrella and the Wondershade are your only options it seems. They have a viny-like insert and feel like a rain umbrella but they completely block the sun. The only problem I have with them is that they are an ""As Seen on TV"" type product so the construction of them is kind of lousy. Within a few months of putting them outside, they get really beat up looking: faded, washed out looking, and the seams begin to get pin-type holes that you can see through much the same way a computer monitor looks when it has a dead pixel and that's pretty much all you see when you look at the screen.Still, I am glad there is at least an option to get a real sun blocking umbrella in a small, patio size. I worry that these As Seen on TV type products tend to vanish. Hopefully these will not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YS92EB3RKLCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLQ1PL8#wasThisHelpful","R2YS92EB3RKLCU","A2V0YH86NKTGX1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V0YH86NKTGX1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is simply a great table. It may look a little ironing board-ish because of the way the legs are but I love it. I needed a table to put on the deck to hold my new plants: Kukla, Fran and Ollie. The outdoor table I had was too small to hold all of them and the deck is not that large. This table fit just perfectly in the space we have and doesn't mind being rained on since it is a resin top. We will fold it up for the winter when we take the plants in, and use the table indoors until the following spring.

"Bought this to replace the broken handle on a patio door that was put up in the 80s. Fits great but I had to use the old screws. They give you three pairs of screws of differing lengths for your door, but I had to use the screws that were in the old handle because the ones it came with were either too long or too short.

"I'll stick with the soups. This meal was okay, but pretty bland and not filling at all like the soups are. Very watery when heated up.

"You have got to be kidding me. I cannot believe how difficult it has been for me to find an umbrella for our deck. I thought my requirements were pretty simple:No larger than 7 1/2 feetMust tiltNeeds to block the sun.I thought the last item was a given until I bought a couple of umbrellas locally and found them to be pure junk that don't block the sun at all.  I searched endlessly on Amazon, reading descriptions of every umbrella I could afford and this seemed like the ticket. So I ordered two.For whatever reason, only one got shipped and the other one got tied up somewhere, so about an hour ago, I retrieved the box, opened it up, put it in the umbrella stand and opened it up only to see that when she sun is not out, you can see through this umbrella even more than you can on this temporary, twenty dollar beach umbrella I bought to use temporarily until I could find a real umbrella. This is not the quality that's expected at this price. When a non-waterproof, discount store umbrella made of cheap material that I can't even tell what it is blocks the sun better than this one, there's something not right there.So now I have try to cancel the other order that's in limbo and drag this thing to a UPS store to return it.

He is incredibly personable and right out of the chute you will be comfortable with him and his style of teaching. The first half of the DVD is about setting up a drum set.

"I picked this up to use for practice with my Roland kit and for the price, I think the DVD is definitely lacking a bit. The play along is nice and I'm still getting used to the ""game"" version of that, but for the cost, I thought there would be more to it than just loading up the DVD, choosing a beat to play along with and then playing along. It's not really a tutor because it doesn't teach you anything that I can find. It boots up into a screen that allows you to play along with pre-made songs and beats and does show where you went off, but there is no opening video of a person going over the basics, as any tutorial would.It's great that it works on a Mac and I do like it but again, at sixty bucks, it feels like it is overpriced.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32426VXQN1YCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077UGGQI#wasThisHelpful","R32426VXQN1YCF","A2V0YH86NKTGX1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V0YH86NKTGX1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a discount store nearby and every month or so they fill one aisle with things like Nature Valley granola bars, Fiber One bars, Special K bars and things like that. They are priced very low-- today they had Nature Valley Oats granola bars, we in a box for a buck sixty nine-- and have a far off (6 months+) expiration date. It is a great opportunity to try something out without paying the ridiculous retail price.I saw these brownies there today and grabbed two boxes, each box was under two bucks. I figured I'd bring one box to the office and leave one at home. I just tried a pack for the first time and here are my impressions:1 - This company should be ashamed of itself with all the wasted packaging that these come in. The outer box is about the length and width of a typical box of granola bars but it is twice as deep.2 - The packet that the brownies come in is probably 10 times larger than the product inside.3 - When I opened up the packet, I counted 7, moist, squares that were about the size of two nickels stacked on top of each other. That was it. All that packaging and if you dumped out the contents of all the packets in the box into one bowl, it would look like a single serving of something.The brownies tasted wet to me rather than like a moist cookie. Like others have said, it was like cookie dough but not yummy cookie dough. There was something very off about the flavor.As far as a healthy snack, I'd stay away from these. I thought Special K was all into healthy snacks so I never really scrutinized the box, but again, as others have said, these seem to be a very high calorie food that has been chopped into tiny pieces and it's the paltry quantity that keeps the calories at 100. They are not 100 good calories though.Next week, I will put them out in the office for others to try and see if they ahve the same view. Judging by all the other negative posts here, I havea  feeling they will.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NFZ9BKUD3TT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWEDP2O#wasThisHelpful","R1NFZ9BKUD3TT4","A2V0YH86NKTGX1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V0YH86NKTGX1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Putting aside the outrageous price here on Amazon, these are just not a great value even from Walmart. The paper the bars are wrapped in are about 25% larger than the square itself. The taste is pretty good but it's just too small to be a realistic breakfast on the go. It is not nearly as filling as a pack of two of their granola bars are. I am sure the caloric content is smaller on these bars but what's the point if you eat one and are still very hungry?There is too much sugar. I wish they would take out most of the sugar and leave us with a relatively tasteless but healthy snack and people would get used to the lack of sugar.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32IAWW1GJ58T9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LDWMR1Y#wasThisHelpful","R32IAWW1GJ58T9","A2V0YH86NKTGX1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V0YH86NKTGX1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought these would be the rival to Belvitta biscuits but Belvitta has nothing to worry about. I found a box of these in a discount store with an expiration date that is well over a year away. That's usually not a very good sign. Lemon Poppy sounded like a weird flavor so I thought maybe they did not sell well and they were unloading this flavor. But here they are on Amazon so I guess they are still being made.The first thing I noticed is that they were hard as a rock compared to the Belvittas. I guess when I saw the shape I was expecting a sort of cookie consistency. Instead, these are like the hard granola bars squished down into a flat oval shape. The taste was not appealing at all at first. It was kind of cardboard-like and had very little flavor. I continued eating them and they were less unpleasant but still not something I'd ask for again.It's a shame that they went the Belvitta route and put FOUR of these into a package. I would rather they had two per package because you can't reseal it and two of these should be plenty for a quick snack.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PMS08WOKZW61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PNMFOR4#wasThisHelpful","R2PMS08WOKZW61","A2V0YH86NKTGX1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V0YH86NKTGX1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

All the women's pants like these are made of stretch material now, have no really useful pockets, are capri type pants, or are designed to be tight fitting. Not interested.

"Purchased mine in November 2014 - by April 2015 it is sound only - screen went black. Have not been able to stream Netflix using the TV app (picture only received, no sound). Dead in the water. Out $1700. I will never buy a Samsung TV again. The picture was great - but less than 6 months life span for $1700 is insanity -- this should NEVER happen for a 'quality' product in this price range.PS: keep in mind that the Samsung 30 day out of box warranty limits you to having only their 'authorized service techs' perform any repairs. There was only one in my entire region -- and it was 200 miles away. I ended up going another route with a trusted 'unauthorized' tech and the masterboard had to be replaced for $200. Why it went bad in under 6 months is a mystery but not uncommon experience for consumers. I am now watching a Sony Bravia tv that cost $700 new and streaming Netflix with sound AND picture sans any problems that were part and parcel of the Samsung tv we paid more than twice as much for.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BDCX0MSFDOZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ID2HI8O#wasThisHelpful","R1BDCX0MSFDOZK","A2REQ7MMUXKTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQ7MMUXKTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some good ideas but fared better finding realistic, affordable applications on the internet. My challenge with books such as these are the ideas cater only to the wheelchair-disabled person and fails to address how to make 'combined spaces' that non-disabled people could function within alongside the disabled person.Not all disabilities are wheelchair disabilities. It would have been helpful to have focused chapters that provide info regarding total hand loss of use, total feet loss of use, vision-disabilities, etc. so as to not have the reader pluck out of the recommendations for wheelchair users to ponder viability for non-wheelchair disabilities their loved ones have.There are lots of pictures showing what one particular home (the author's?) looks like in various rooms but it's certainly not something that people with less space or limited budget could consider. I was hoping to find specific things I could incorporate to the construction aspect rather 'ideas' such as buying elaborate ADA cabinet-systems and special appliances that would limit the functionality for everyone else in the home.From my own research (and not many of these ideas were found in this book), you have zero-thresholds for showers and doorways, lever handles, lowered light switches, raised wall outlets, expanded electrical (for home generator if you have an elevator/chair lift), thermostatic valves, ADA flooring (avoid carpet and engineered wood which will snap/break at the seams under weight of wheelchair-- search ""ADA flooring"" for more info) and tile which will exacerbate falls and fall injuries; roll-in showers, 36"" wide doors, pneumatic doors at exterior doors, home technology (for individual to manage lights, climate, entertainment, security), at least one front and back ramp, ADA height commodes (17-19""), drawers (rather than doors) on lower base kitchen cabinets, 5' turn radius in closets and transition spaces...just to name a few.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TDQH4SO16J6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401603521#wasThisHelpful","R3TDQH4SO16J6I","A2REQ7MMUXKTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2REQ7MMUXKTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since all microwaves are different as far as cooking goes and since there are many different brands/kinds of mac and cheese, it takes a bit of practice to get this done to your liking.  This would apply to just about any microwave cooking.  We really like this 2-pack Rapid Mac Cooker.  I have found that you have to be very careful to get the water level just right.  This is how we make ours...  We have an 1100 watt mid-sized micro.  We usually use regular Kraft mac and cheese, occasionally generic.  I put the noodles in the Rapid Mac, fill the water to a smidge below the waterline and give it a quick shake.  Put it in the center of the micro.  Cook for 2:30 minutes at Power 8.  Take out, stir while adding a smidge more water bringing it to the water line. Back in the micro for 2:30 minutes at Power 8.  Take it out and stir in additional ingredients in the following order:  butter first, cheese powder second, milk third.  Sometimes we add other things like additional cheese.  Then I micro it for 30 seconds longer at Power 10.  Perfect every time!  This Rapid Mac works especially well for us, as we are on different eating schedules due to work.  Sometimes when one of us will be very late, one of us just wants to eat now.  Easy to do with Rapid Mac.  Don't need two pots, one doesn't have to eat cold mac and cheese, each of us can easily and quickly have our mac and cheese hot and fresh!  Rapid Mac cleans up easily in the dishwasher!  If there was one thing I would change, I would have made the container a bit taller.  The noodles can sometimes boil over, if you add a bit too much water or forget to use less power.  This is not just for kids, we are senior citizens!  Hope this was helpful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19KVGROYWTH22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVW29Q2#wasThisHelpful","R19KVGROYWTH22","A1WOMXOEX90ARI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WOMXOEX90ARI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dog loves this Bounzer toy.  Bought all three sizes, big ones for outside, medium one for inside.  She carries the medium one around all day, often chewing on it.  The bigger sizes are favorite outside toys she wants to chase and retrieve every day.  Great bounce to these toys.  I tied an old rope chew toy through the handle on the largest Bounzer to make it easier for me to throw.  Holding up really well for my GSD.  Well worth the money.  Lots of fun.  Not as boring as a ball; the erratic bouncing makes the difference!  Works just fine in the heat and extreme cold.  Easy to wash.

They bounce, rock, roll, float, can be chewed on, carried and tossed.  They clean up very nicely/completely in the dishwasher with no signs of deterioration.

In the early spring/late fall/winter they seem to miss that, sniffing at the places where they ate grass in the summer.

A bit on the small side; would have liked a slightly more generous cut in the hood and a slightly longer knit collar.  Great that there are no snaps.  Easy to use with ANY jacket, not just Carhartt.

"This is a very nice pendant and at a pretty good price.  The stones are surprisingly large, sparkly, bright and clear.  The pendant is quite large and of heavy/sturdy 10K yellow gold construction.

The only problem I had was that of the two I had here, each time there was one defective prong equaling a loose stone.  It could have been fixed, but I purchased for a gift, so rather than give a repaired gift, I returned them.  I would order this again in the future--perhaps I just got the last two defective ones.

"Well, I don't know about everyone else, but WE loved it!  This movie was just the thing we needed.  Funny and yet reminding us of things in our own life.  Robin Williams is the guy we can all identify with.  This movie is great for all ages, sweet at times, funny all the way through and makes you feel good, especially in the end.  Made you still believe that nice guys don't always end up the loser and that families are still the most important thing.  I am glad we purchased this movie and will definitely watch it again someday.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38RYQNU1XNTF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GCFNZO#wasThisHelpful","R38RYQNU1XNTF3","A1WOMXOEX90ARI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WOMXOEX90ARI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This rack will fit in an oval 6 quart West Bend and an oval 7 quart  Hamilton Beach slow cooker.  It is made of very heavy gauge wire; very sturdy!  The non-stick coating on the new rack arrived with an area about an inch or more long that looks like it has been repaired with black shiny, speckled paint.  The coating isn't very non-stick, but somewhat better than nothing.  If I have future durability problems, I will update.  I would have liked this rack so much more if it were raised about double the current height, which isn't much.  The meat, etc. doesn't sit high enough to stay out of the juices.

"This is a good rack for oval slow cookers.  It fits in a 6 quart oval West Bend and a 7 quart oval Hamilton Beach.  If there is something I would have changed, it would be to make it a bit sturdier.  It's a bit flimsy, but it does the job!  Cleans up fairly easily.  Not too expensive.  Hope this was helpful!  UPDATE:  I have downgraded this a bit due to the VERY SHARP ends on the rack spokes.  The spokes on this rack are cut very sloppily and are very sharp--I cut my hand when handling this.  I did end up sanding the ends of the spokes with fine grit sandpaper, which was annoying and time consuming, but mostly fixed the problem.

"I ordered this Hamilton Beach 7 Quart Slow Cooker because I wanted one that was BIGGER than my older West Bend 6 Quart; which is great, but not always quite big enough.  When this arrived, I very carefully measured water TWICE to fill the crock.  I wanted to be sure it would hold a full 7qts.  IT DOES NOT!!!  To the very top of the inner rim, it holds 6 quarts plus barely 1 cup.  My good old 6 quart West Bend slow cooker does hold exactly 6 quarts.  So, if I keep this Hamilton Beach, I've gained only 1 cup in capacity!  I looked on the HB website for a replacement crock (thinking this one may be defective) only to find that the replacement crock for this model is clearly stated to be 6.5 quarts capacity!  To say that this is 7 quarts is very misleading, as it clearly is NOT.  Other than this, I did like ALL the other features very much; except I really would have preferred a decorative patterned white or bisque for the color.  I do own another older, smaller HB slow cooker that I like, so this is a BIG disappointment.  If a full 7 quarts is not important to you, this is a great slow cooker, if 7 quarts is important--keep looking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8Q0DUUCAKGHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ARWCUI#wasThisHelpful","R8Q0DUUCAKGHU","A1WOMXOEX90ARI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WOMXOEX90ARI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This brush is similar in texture to Scotch Brite scouring pads, but thicker and pleated.  I do wish the handle was an inch or two longer, but it works.

"This Sierra Club Wilderness Calendar is nice.  Beautiful photos, big area to write appointments each day, okay printing, paper is a bit on the thin side.  However, I DO NOT like the spiral binding, as it is rubbing on the wall leaving fine marks on the paint.  I had to cover the spiral binding with a large, long piece of sticky felt.  That took time, cost money and caused aggravation.  One other thing, this calendar is much longer than the standard-sized calendar.

We do not NEED to eat gluten-free, but have found that we seem to feel better after eating this cereal versus other grains.  I think the price could be MUCH lower (other brands are).

"I bought this Thomas ABS Plastic Traceable Refrig/Freezer Thermometer with Bottle Probe to use in my large freezer.  My freezer has 2 regular thermometers inside, a power light on the outside and I check all regularly.  But recently, my freezer temps started to fluctuate wildly and then plunged sharply downward.  Even though I checked it, I missed the wild fluctuations until I had a freezer full of mostly freezer-burned food.  After purchasing a NEW freezer, I found this thermometer.  So far, it works WONDERFULLY!  I can now see the temp from the outside, so can check it much more often and I can see the high/low fluctuation in temp, so I know if it's too much.  This thermometer has an alarm that can be set with high/low temps, so I might know even sooner, if something is amiss.  It is a bit tricky to figure out how to set it at first, as the directions are a bit confusing, but once figured out and set in place, it is great!  The main temp display is fairly large (easy to see from a distance).  The alarm is fairly quiet, not too easy to hear from outside the room it's in, but I guess you can't expect too much from one small (included) battery.  At least it's something and along with the display will give me more piece-of-mind than before.  The fold out stand is tipsy, so I use the enclosed magnetic/Velco strips.  The bottle probe is nice because it moderates the temp fluctuation when I open the freezer door.  That way the alarm isn't going off each time I do so.  The generous 10' long probe wire is thin, but still leaves a small gap in the freezer gasket.  An unfolded paper clip works well for pushing the reset button.  I like it so much, I ordered another one for my smaller freezer.  I wish the price were lower.  Hopefully, it will last longer than my freezer did!  If I encounter problems, I will update...","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV57O5AVPL5CF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0069TGQPY#wasThisHelpful","RV57O5AVPL5CF","A1WOMXOEX90ARI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WOMXOEX90ARI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Portable 24 LED Super Bright Deluxe Camping Lantern with Compass by Think Tank Technology is NOT very sturdy, so is of minimal use for camping, where you would want something more rugged.  However, it is useful for in the house ""lights out"" emergencies or in the back yard sitting on the picnic table at dusk.  It is easy to hold on to and stands up nicely.  Very bright, producing a wide area of light.  The battery compartment is a bit hard to open, but if you are careful, it can be done.  The little hanging loop is sturdy and handy if you want to hang it up.  The compass is of minimal value and not very accurate.  The plastic this is made of is very thin and hard.  I am a very careful person, but soon after purchase, I knocked it over; it dropped about 18 inches or so onto the vinyl floor, landing on the top corner which shattered into three pieces.  The good news is the light still worked, I was able to find the pieces and fitting them together one at a time I was very successful in gluing them back together with a liberal amount of Gorilla Super Glue.

"I bought this Quartet Magnetic Dry-Erase Board Tile (85401) mostly for the magnetic properties.  I attached it to the back wall of my desk hutch, so I could post small notes, etc. with magnetic push-pins or clips.  It attaches with 4 double-sided, self-stick foam squares that you may place as needed; manufacturer suggests the four corners.  The back of the board is thick corrugated cardboard, tucked inside a front metal shell.  If you ever want to move the board once attached, the cardboard back will likely just tear off, leaving bits stuck to the 4 pieces of foam.  You could attach new foam pieces in a slightly different spot, purchased separately, to reuse the board.  The board I received is plain white (not assorted colors or silver).  The dry-erase pen is small, held on the side with a clear plastic clip attached to the board.  It also has a magnet on the pen cap, but this doesn't hold the pen onto the board very well, as the pen (in cap) is too heavy.  The pen seems to write just fine on the board, the cap has a felt eraser, which works fine, too.  Doesn't seem to leave ghost images, when erased.  Comes with two round button magnets about an inch in diameter.  One is slightly defective, but still works.  The board has a few small dings on the front, probably due to shipping.  I would have liked a slightly longer board with a better way to attach and remove, but otherwise, it is okay.  I think it should be cheaper, but I needed something that would fit a certain area, so...

"My GSD has many food allergies.  It has been a struggle to find a dry kibble that she could eat, likes and is higher in protein.  Most limited ingredient kibbles are low protein, mostly fillers--potatoes, peas, grains and must be flavorless, because my dog won't eat them.  Plus, they seem to upset her intestinal tract.  This NV Instinct LID Rabbit flavor is not as good/tasty as the NV regular rabbit flavor, or as high protein, BUT my GSD can eat it, likes it and it is significantly higher in protein than the competition.  It is simple ingredients, has meat FIRST, does have some peas and tapioca, but it does not upset my dogs intestinal tract or cause an allergic reaction and comes in a LID Duck flavor she can have too!  So, we have two choices, to rotate a little bit and keep her from getting bored.  My only ""gripe"" is that the LID rabbit flavor ONLY comes in a small 4.4 pound or a large 25.3 pound bag size.  For my dog a medium sized bag would be right.  Small bag (very expensive) only lasts a few days; large bag goes stale before she finishes it.  The LID duck flavor comes in a medium sized bag, as do the other 2 LID flavors--lamb and turkey (which my GSD can't have).  So, when this comes in a medium sized bag, it may become 5 star.

"We haven't even had this table 2 years and already the top and seats are crazed and cracking.  It sits on my patio, semi-protected from the weather and mostly, it sits there unused.  We sit/eat at the table a few times each year, just the two of us.  Yes, it is exposed to the weather, but is protected some, especially in the winter, when we cover it with a tarp.  We paid a lot for this and expected a much longer lifespan.  The plastic is too thin.  One other annoying thing is that the plastic table/benches are statically charged.  My clothes/hair stand out; dog fur, grass, dirt jumps on the table and is difficult to remove, as it is so statically charged that it sticks to your hand, if you do manage to get it off the table.  The shipping was bad; as others have said.  It is not the fault of UPS, rather, it is the packaging.  This very heavy table is just shipped in an inadequate strength carton.  This may be fine for bringing home from a local store, but it is NOT FINE for shipping cross country.  Mine arrived with the box totally ripped apart into pieces that UPS taped back together, as best they could with (no kidding) about two or more rolls of packing tape!  Yes, my table was scratched some, I was not happy about it, but the thought of trying to return or exchange it and having to try to tape the mess of a box again was just too difficult, so reluctantly, we kept it, scratches and all.

"I have several other pieces of Swiss Diamond cookware, recently adding this one.  I love the pan, but I hate the metal handle on this pan.  It is similar in shape to the black handles, but not quite.  It is slippery to hold, so your grip is not as firm as with the black handle.  This is of concern because this pan is heavy empty and MUCH heavier when full.  The handle is too long (longer than the black handles) and it doesn't match the collar on the pan (which looks strange), nor my other Swiss Diamond pans, as this is the ONLY one with a different handle.  I wanted this pan for the size, so I guess I will keep it, but I'd like to see the black handle on it, not the metal.  Not too keen on the glass lid or vented knob.  Would like a plain metal lid or at least, a knob without the ""spin"" vent much better.  Lid is very large and heavy, glass can break and you can't really see through the lid when cooking, as it steams up.  The spin knob closes/opens to let out steam, but spins out of adjustment when you move the lid or sometimes by it's self while cooking.  It also traps water/soap/dirt after washing, which keeps dripping out/running down the glass lid from under the knob for days.  Very annoying!  Hope this is of help.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T32KT3V1ZF0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VIHPY0#wasThisHelpful","R2T32KT3V1ZF0I","A1WOMXOEX90ARI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WOMXOEX90ARI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a VERY nice pendant.  The smokey quartz stone is perfectly cut with a very nice medium color.  The filigree setting is very pretty with heavy, not cheap-looking prongs, holding the stone very securely.  The bail is large enough to allow you to put the larger ring on a much sturdier chain.  The one thing I would have liked to see is the ring holding the filigree setting to the bail soldered a bit more, but it is okay so far and could easily be re-soldered, if needed.  The chain that comes with it is the usual thin, flimsy thing, but it is pretty.  The pendant lays nicely when wearing, doesn't roll backwards easily.  All-in-all, a very pretty, above average pendant.  I would like to see this pendant available with different colored stones.  I would buy this again!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YXI9DLOV60IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZLVFS8#wasThisHelpful","R1YXI9DLOV60IW","A1WOMXOEX90ARI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WOMXOEX90ARI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This grinder shuts off before even 20 seconds of grinding and even if you wait the 5 minutes the manufacturer says to wait, it will only grind a few seconds and then shuts off again!  I tried to grind 13 T. of coffee for my coffee maker and after a half hour of trying, still didn't have enough!  The other reviewers who said it grinds too fine are absolutely right.  Even on the coarsest French Press setting, it was powdery fine and clogged my filter using the 11 T. I finally was able to produce!  The glass container produced less static than the other brands with plastic containers (such as Capresso).  Going back to pre-ground coffee in a can for now!","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLGZY68XSKHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00430AXLO#wasThisHelpful","R1NLGZY68XSKHN","A1WOMXOEX90ARI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WOMXOEX90ARI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These mini turners are NSF certified, dishwasher safe, hold up to hard use and handy for cutting/flipping/serving small food items.

"This is a very good and detailed book if you are a dog owner looking to understand more about your dogs anatomy and how it functions.  Makes it easier to speak intelligently with your veterinarian about your pooch!  Was very helpful during our dog's recent CCL surgeries.  Not enough detail for a vet science student, but more than enough for a concerned/interested dog owner, shelter worker, dog groomer, etc.  Has many detailed, but not cluttered drawings, some photos, a large appendix with anatomy/medical terms/definitions and explainations along with other helpful tips/info.  Book is grouped into logical sections (ie: locomotor section which covers bones, joints, muscles; sections on heart/lungs, internal organs, skin/hair, nervous system, the senses, etc.) and it is reasonably easy to comprehend/understand.

"From my wife Sarah: This is adorable. Here's what I like about it:- The crib soother fabric animation is adorable. The fabric has a nice feel to it.- It attaches reasonably easy to the crib.- The nature, lullaby music and white noise sounds are very soothing and pleasant. I actually use a sound machine that has some similar sounds. Soothing sounds works for adults, and for babies too!- There is volume control.-  It plays for up to 30 minutes.- There are two light modes (twinkling and tracking) which keep the child's attention. The light lights slow down after 5 minutes, which is relaxing and soothing to the child.- It's over 2 feet long so it provides plenty for the child to look at and decor-wise it's very cute.- The control panel is easy to use and faces out away from the baby.- The surface is washable.Really, it's just very sweet and a really good tool to soothe babies and help them go to sleep peacefully at bed-time. I'd recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32Z7YUJ1YXCGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFETDQA#wasThisHelpful","R32Z7YUJ1YXCGX","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a very good manual for those people in the scientific and engineering fields, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.I’ve read many networking books over the years, and decided to review this book because I often think of myself as kind of a nerd. What was not clear to me from reading about the book on Amazon was that this book is really for nerds who are high tech scientist and engineer types. I'm in the creative industry, and quite honestly I did not find this book be a good fit for me.Personally I found the book to be very dry, rambling, and difficult to get through. I felt like I was reading a manual. A lot of the information was basic material that I've found in other networking books that were more appropriate for me. On the positive side, I found the book to be organized well, and enjoyed the fact that there are many highlighted tips scattered throughout the book. I found it helpful that each chapter ends with what the author refers to as Chapter Takeaways. These takeaways are written in bullet point form, allowing the reader to review and remember what they read.Overall, this book will most likely help high-tech people who are looking for jobs or clients. However I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MWVE1OHAJRH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118663586#wasThisHelpful","R2MWVE1OHAJRH1","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my wife Sarah: Very simply, this does a decent job of moisturizing and is made of some cleaner ingredients than most products, but it's got some issues.Here's what I like:- I love that it's gluten free and fragrance-free. It's also paraben-free, vegan, and non-GMO. That's fantastic, uncommon and very difficult to find. I'm very sensitive and it does not cause me any allergic reactions.Here's what I don't care for:- I wish it had a better texture. While it does a nice job of moisturizing, I don't like the heavy feel of it, especially on my nose and hands. It's kind of oily and thick, and I feel like I have to wash my hands to get it off my fingers after. Still, after I rub it into the rest of my face it seems to do a decent job of moisturizing.- I don't care for the fact that you can't use it around your eyes. In fact it says that you must avoid your eyes, lids and lashes. Naturally anything going on my face is going to make its way to my eyes, even in very small amounts, so that concerns me. I would also have liked to have the ability to use it in my under eye area.- Though it has some natural ingredients, it also has some of the chemical-sounding ingredients you'll find in non-natural brands.Ultimately, I've been using it for about 5 days, and haven't noticed any real changes other than the fact that my skin feels moisturized. If you're looking for a moisturizing product that's free of all the things I listed above, this will work. For those with oily skin this may be too much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P3DLEH4AJKQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGWE8IQ#wasThisHelpful","R2P3DLEH4AJKQN","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my wife Sarah: This unit is well built, sturdy and does its job extremely well. With this Cuisinart it's all about efficiency and quality.There's a great video put out by Cuisinart on YouTube that goes over all of the features of this unit. It can help you get a better sense of what this food processor is like. Amazon doesn't allow for the link address, so just put ""Cusinart 14 cup food processor"" in the search bar on YouTube.Here's what I like about it:- It's sleek looking if you plan to leave it on your counter. It looks like a very professional grade device.- It does an excellent job of shredding, chopping, pureeing, etc. It even allows for mixing dough.- It's reasonably easy to use and figure out. The directions are well written and easy to follow (that's a big plus in my book).- The accessories box that comes with it is convenient, nicely designed and sturdy. It makes it easy for me to safely store the parts together. My old unit didn't have this, and it was annoying to figure out how to store the blades without getting cut. It's also lockable, which is a great safety feature for those with kids.- It's easy to clean up.- The retractable cord is very convenient, neat and clean.- The two work bowl sizes are really perfect for me. One is 4 1/2 cups and the other is 14 cups.  The pour spouts are helpful and the bowls have measurement markings which are also helpful.- A small note - It comes with a spatula that works well with the unit.The only thing that may be challenging for some people is the size and weight. It's tall and large. It does fit under my cabinets, so for me the height is not a problem. However I noticed one poster who said it didn't fit in theirs. For me personally, it's on the heavy side, so I don't want to be moving it around.Other than that, I have no negatives. It works great, looks great, and is easy to use, so I'd highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EC4EYT5QCG5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLX6M5M#wasThisHelpful","R2EC4EYT5QCG5R","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We're fans of GermGuardian and own three of their large units and a small unit that fits into an outlet which we keep in the bathroom. We're really happy with this air purifier. It does a nice job of cleaning the air in our bedroom.  We love that it has the UV light, along with the HEPA filtration, so we find it to be effective. It handles odors and dust along with germs, bacteria and mold.The size is great for our bedroom. It's small and very light. It fits easily on our desk top.If you turn it all the way up, it's on the loud side, but at bedtime we just turn it down to the lowest level and it's a very quiet white noise kind of sound. When I walk into the room I'm usually not even sure if it's on or not and I have to come close to listen.Another good thing is that you don't see any light emitting from it, so it's fine to use in your bedroom at night.The only issue we have with this unit is that it's hard to tell whether the UV light is still working or not. These bulbs need to be replaced periodically, and on all the other GermGuardian units that we own, you can easily see if the light has gone out. On this unit to see that the light is still functioning you have to get up close and peek inside. You can see a very tiny pinpoint of light if it's working.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1LMGOBJ4ORE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G7VNO86#wasThisHelpful","RK1LMGOBJ4ORE","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my wife Sarah: This book is very informative, well written, easy to understand, and it has actionable steps. It's appropriate for anyone with almost any kind of illness, and anyone wanting to maintain good health for life.Lately I've been hearing about the massive impact of your gut microbiome on your term health, and how any imbalance can be the root cause of a large number of illnesses. I've known for decades that after having taken antibiotics you needed to take replenish your good gut bacteria, but I thought it was enough to take one acidophilus pill a day for a couple weeks. It turns out that it's far more complicated than that.Dr. Robynne does an excellent job of describing the problem. I was really surprised to see how many illnesses could have this imbalance as the root cause. This book should bring a lot of hope to many people - turn around your microbiome and you may be able to improve your health. The book is packed with the information that you need to do it.Dr. Robynne shared actionable steps that you can take to reverse the problem. It turns out that restoring the microbiome throughout your body requires a number of steps including the intake of much greater quantity and a much wider variety of good bugs than I had thought. It's also done through a variety of other means including the addition of fermented foods, and pre-biotics (foods that feed the good bugs), etc. She suggests dietary changes, lifestyle changes and time to heal.The book is well organized, very easy to understand, and eye opening. I'd say pretty much everyone should read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NRK7HZ8HPEGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583335765#wasThisHelpful","R2NRK7HZ8HPEGU","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my wife Sarah: My husband and I have been using Purell for years as a way to avoid viruses that are spread by touch. I purchase a bottle of this size that I keep in my car, and I also get a small purell container that attaches to exterior of my handbag. I refill the small one with the large Purell I keep in my car. This is so convenient.I've found the claims to be true - It does leave my hands feeling a bit softer, and it's not sticky. It dries quickly. I'm not sure that I notice a difference in the effect on my skin between the regular clear Purell and the Purell with aloe.The Purell with aloe seems to have a slightly stronger fragrance than the clear version.For those who are on a gluten free diet - This product is NOT GLUTEN FREE. I'm on a strict gluten free diet, so I had called the company years ago and they said it was gluten free. I called again today and they said it's not. The only gluten free purell is the alcohol free version with product number 5784-04. However when I look it up on Amazon and around the web, for some reason it's selling for an amazingly huge amount $67 for 4 bottles.So although this is a great product, unfortunately I'll be moving on to a gluten free hand sanitizer, but my husband will finish our Purell bottles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TGD29DYZH47V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2KYUAY#wasThisHelpful","R2TGD29DYZH47V","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This set includes the following:- 8"" pliers- 6"" cutter pliers- 6"" long nose pliers- 10"" vise-grip pliers- 8"" adjustable wrench.All of the pliers are made of carbon steel and are very high quality.  They are very solid and well-made. They're comparable with other high quality tools you can purchase.Upon opening the packaging, I noticed that the tools have a slight oily film on them, which leaves your hand smelling like a mechanic's hands.Most of the tools feel comfortable in my hands, because they have soft grip handles. That makes them easy to use and grip tightly for many jobs. Unfortunately the adjustable wrench does not have a soft grip, and the steel feels very rough in my hands. It's not very comfortable to use, but because the metal has a rough feel, it's still easy to grip. I would have preferred a soft grip handle on that wrench as well.The vise-grip, seems very rough to adjust at first, but working it a few times loosens up the mechanism.The pliers and wrench all have the Ford Emblem imprinted on them. Not being a Ford lover, I don't really care for this, but it really doesn't effect the usefulness of these pliers.The packaging indicates that the pliers have a ""Limited Lifetime Warranty."" However there's no information on what the limitations are, or what you can do if a tool fails. For craftsman tools, you can just bring them back to Sears and they'll replace them. I would have no idea on what to do with a defective tool from this set.Overall, I'd say that this set of tools is a very good add-on to my tool box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ5UIIHWMT4GH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQOCKME#wasThisHelpful","RQ5UIIHWMT4GH","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We own many different air purifiers because of, and use them around the house. Those include a Delonghi Energy Star Air Purifier, and a Germ Guardian 3-in-1 Air Cleaning System, a Germ Guardian Stainless Steel UV-C Room Air Sanitizer, and Aireox model 45.  All of these do a decent job, with different strengths and weaknesses.The higher priced Aireox is the most complete air filtration system, and many people with chemical sensitivities and allergies prefer it. I've reviewed the Delonghi unit on Amazon, and to summarize we find that it does a good job for the price. The Germ Guardians are excellent at removing and killing mold spores and bacteria from the air.The AeraMax Baby DBB5 does a decent job of air filtration. Although the unit is supposedly for a baby’s room, it can work in any small room in your house.The unit is very easy to set up. It comes with a very simple diagram that tells you how to open it and remove the filters from their plastic wrap. Once I powered it on, the first thing I noticed when I turned it on was the smell - it was really overpowering. I let the unit run continually at a high speed in my home office for around 48 hours before the odor finally dissipated. Several weeks later there's a very faint smell left. You should be aware of this before you just start using this unit for the first time in a baby’s room.What I like about this unit is it’s small size and it’s quiet operation at its low speed. At it’s lowest fan setting, I hardly notice the unit is working.  However when the unit is moved to even the second setting, the sound gets louder. This may be an issue for anyone who needs real quiet for sleep.The lights on the unit change from blue to orange if there’s a sudden odor in the room. That’s a comforting feeling to know the unit is working and removing bad things from the air.Overall, I feel that this unit does its job reasonably well.  Although the size of the unit prevents it from working effectively in a larger room, it certainly can do its job in a small bedroom or home office.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23NPTA0F7AQNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V31B14E#wasThisHelpful","R23NPTA0F7AQNN","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There’s a lot to like about this phone AND a lot to dislike. It depends on what you’re hoping for in phone.After unboxing the phone, I experienced this right away. The first challenge was figuring out how to open it, to insert the sim card and battery. There are no arrows indicating if the back slides off or just pops open.I found that I was able to pry the back off and insert the sim card and battery. After a short charge the phone started up.One cool thing with the phone is that it comes with a screen protector that you can apply. It also comes with a rubber cover for the back of the phone. Those were two nice surprises.The phone instantly recognized my T-Mobile sim card, and all of my contacts appeared.Phone OperationThe manual that came with the phone contains very little useful instructions. It was a matter of trial and error, playing with the phone to learn how to use it.  After a few weeks, I’m still trying to figure things out. The fact that this phone has a lack of clear documentation, instructions and support is a major mark against it in my opinion.TextingI like the texting features, especially the ability to do voice texting. I find the voice texting to be about 90% accurate. The on screen keyboard is comparable to other phones. I find it easy to text.VoicemailSo far this is the most frustrating feature of this phone. I cannot find any indicators that let me know that I have a voicemail message.  There’s a text icon on the home screen that has a small red number when you receive texts. That also holds true for missed calls. But there’s nothing that lets you know you have a voicemail. That’s disappointing.Voice QualityI find the voice quality to be good. I need this phone for business, and I can hear every call and they can hear me fine. It has not dropped a call since I’ve had the phone.ScreenThe screen is bright and easy to read. The size of the phone and screen are more than adequate.Audio notificationsI keep hearing beeps that are indicating some form of notification, but I have no idea what I’m being notified for. Is it a Text, and email, Facebook? Who knows?!CameraThe 5 MP camera is not very good quality. It’s barely adequate if we’re being honest.Sim CardsThis phone allows for dual sim cards. I still have no idea how to take advantage of this, but for some folks this is probably a great feature, if you can figure it out without any sort of direction.Battery LifeBattery life for this phone is horrible. Just using it for about 2 hours I noticed that I was down to 40% battery remaining. That’s bad.Yesterday I had a 52% battery left when I put the phone down for the evening. When I awoke, the battery was completely drained, and the phone would not turn on. That battery lasts about 6 to 8 hours with very little use.SupportSupport for this phone is non-existent. There’s nobody to call, no YouTube videos to watch, outside of a few unboxing videos.Overall impressionFor my first android phone, it certainly has lots to offer. I really needed this as a good phone for business purposes.  In certain respects it’s met that need. I think for the price, it’s a decent phone. But I need something better and easier to use.If you’re looking to just upgrade to an Android phone from a flip phone, this may be a good starter phone for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY6BDK7MFHFJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRRVGTQ#wasThisHelpful","RY6BDK7MFHFJL","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my wife Sarah:On the plus side:- For the price, these razors do a capable job. They were great on my skin, and I've had no scrapes or cuts. They've given me a smooth shave on my legs.On the downside, it may be unfair to compare these to the Gillette Venus because it's a more expensive razor, but I'd recommend purchasing that one if you can spring for the extra few dollars. Here's why:- The grip on the Bic Soleil is a bit awkward and it's easy to drop when it's wet. I dropped it several times in the shower this last time. The grip on the Gillette Venus is natural and comfortable.- The razor head on the Bic Soleil is locked in place, making it a bit more awkward to use. The razor head on the Gillette Venus flexes smoothly and moves with the curves of your body, making it easy to use. I'm also more confident that I won't be cut with this because of the motion of the head.While I feel the Bic Soleil did a good job, I've found the Gillette Venus easier to use, more comfortable, and I feel more confident that I won't get cuts or irritated skin with it.

It's got a hard cover, and it's nicely made. The pages discuss rituals and/or beliefs found in different countries and cultures around the world. The author has chosen these beliefs/rituals, and presents them as a lesson - and as something that supposedly helps make these people happy. The author then offers a life lesson for each page, and sometimes a ritual that the reader can do themselves. The idea is that these lessons and rituals can help make the reader happy.Here are the pros and cons as I see it:Pros:- Just the very concept of the book makes you think. I found myself thinking some deep thoughts, such as what would make me happy, and what happiness meant to me. I even contemplated about whether happiness was essential in life. I think this is a really positive thing as it makes you examine your life, your beliefs and your values.- Some of the lessons really make you think, and are even helpful. For example, I liked the lesson titled ""Get lost to find yourself"". The author suggests the following: ""Everyone can take time out. Book a solo holiday - you'll be forced to find yourself, and discover what really interests you. Take control of areas  in which you feel vulnerable - master basic car mechanics, or learn how to boil an egg. Gain confidence in your own abilities, and take comfort in knowing that you can rely on yourself"".I like those suggestions. Maybe I wouldn't do the exact things the author is suggesting, but I appreciate the concepts and I think this could easily be applied to my personal interests and needs. I think this could be helpful.Cons:- While it's interesting to learn about other cultures and faiths, some of the life lessons the author is coming up with based on those ideas seem completely against common sense and at times, against my Judeo-Christian faith.For example, on the page related to Buddhist sand mandalas, the author suggests the following: "" Celebrating transience is strangely comforting. Draw chalk pictures on your front path, then watch them be worn away by time or rain. Make a sand castle. Accept the inevitable truth that nothing lasts, and savour the peace that comes with it.""Maybe someone else will find that comforting, but I do not personally find transience anything to celebrate. I recently lost two close family members and it's been very difficult. To me the author's ""lesson"" feels very shallow, and even ridiculous. There's absolutely nothing about drawing chalk pictures on my sidewalk and watching them wear away that's going to comfort me regarding my own mortality or the death of those I love. Someone writing that I should accept the inevitable truth that nothing lasts, doesn't help me to do that. Savour the peace that comes with it? I don't think so. Maybe there's peace within my own personal faith, but not with these suggestions.So would I recommend this book as a gift or even for yourself? Personally I wouldn't feel motivated to give this book away or to suggest it as something to buy for yourself, but it's certainly got some value if you can pick through it and find the things that have value to you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13L0QPG3NT8ES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607601#wasThisHelpful","R13L0QPG3NT8ES","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my wife Sarah - This just didn't work for me. I've had pain in my coccyx (tail bone) on and off for years, and when it recently flared again I purchased this pillow. Unfortunately it didn't relieve the pressure on my tail bone. I also found the cushion to be very hard, and the shape put pressure in various places  including my tail bone. I found it to be quite uncomfortable.Fortunately Amazon is excellent at taking returns, so this will be going back.The pillow case is nice and soft, and I like the color. However this is just not effective for me.

"From my wife Sarah: I purchased this as a part of a plan for lyme disease to break down biofilms. I found that this stuff is the best natural anti-inflammatory I've found! This was actually visible on blood tests - my inflammatory markers were down significantly. It diminished pain significantly (though not as significantly as with drugs like NSAID's or prescription pain pills, of course).I take serrapeptase with this product: From Fatigued to Fantastic's End Pain, but that product by itself didn't do nearly as much as it does with the serrapeptase. Combined the two products really take the edge off. I wish I knew about this sooner!After being on this product for several months, I decided to try Dr.'s Best serrapeptase because it's stronger. However it jut didn't work for me. My pain increased and I finally went back to the NutraMedix brand.Serrapeptase will also thin the blood and break down clots.It's Sugar Free, Gluten Free, Starch Free and Dairy Free.I'd definitely recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R393WQHQ2ZAUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058AC12M#wasThisHelpful","R393WQHQ2ZAUP","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my wife Sarah: When we opened the package we were surprised to see that it was nicer than we expected. The color was a very attractive light periwinkle blue - it had more intensity than the photo. The fabric had a nice sheen to it, and the woven texture also brought it up a level. It's on the thicker side, isn't wrinkly, and resists staining.I see some people saying that it's cheap looking. Is this appropriate for your next fine dining gourmet event?

"The first thing I noticed was the size of this unit. It's huge!  It's actually larger than our microwave oven. That's a problem for us, because we have limited counter and cabinet space. I can't imagine most people being able to fit this dehydrator in their kitchen.That being said, the good part about the size is you can fit a LOT of food in it because of all its 6 large trays, and 2 expansion trays that add height and allow you to accommodate taller, thicker items.The trays seem a little thin to me, but they seem to fit and work properly. The timer is a great feature and you can set it for a full 24 hours. The unit is very easy to use and easy to clean. The instructions are very well written, but the cooking times and temperatures were not right. Some experimentation with longer dehydration times and higher heat were necessary to get the right results.If you have the space, I'd recommend this item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W31J6VXTAE50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAH1CTQ#wasThisHelpful","R3W31J6VXTAE50","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my wife Sarah: I tend to be super sensitive and was disappointed that I developed headaches when taking this, so I had to stop. I'm sure that's an unusual response. I think this supplement would be worth trying for anyone trying to lose weight or to help with blood sugar issues like insulin resistance.I'm a big fan of the Jarrow brand and I take many of their supplements daily with no problem.

"This is an excellent book that would be helpful to anyone who fears rejection. I would say that applies to most people. This book is full of strategies on how to rethink and overcome the negative impact of rejection.The author recognizes that rejection can cause negative emotions and it can be de-motivating. This book is a literary version of a pat on the back! It makes you feel good, helps you get motivated, and helps you to take positive actions.The book includes several inspirational stories that help put things in perspective. I particularly like the ""Rejection Toolbox"" section of the book. This section encourages the reader to not give up, and to keep trying. It offers several practical strategies for moving forward. These also include negotiation strategies to turn around a situation when you've received rejection.This book is  great for entrepreneurs, sales people, and even those looking to raise their self-esteem after having suffered from personal rejection.I highly recommend this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26DKJQIHUH855/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080414138X#wasThisHelpful","R26DKJQIHUH855","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First I'll say that the materials seem sturdy, and the glasses are of nice quality. The fit was very good for me.The problem is that they don't work for all distances for me. I'll explain:1. Reading - They work nicely. When looking down and reading, the words are nice and clear.2. Computer Screen - The view is kind of blurry and slightly distorted.3. Looking across the desk - This view is fine for me.So for me, these glasses are not practical for me when working on the computer because I can't see the screen well, though I will be able to use them for reading.

"From my wife Sarah: Three teens are being heavily trained physically and mentally to become ""Seekers"". They're not quite sure what that means, but they are told they'll be hero's, saving lives, righting wrongs, protecting the innocent. One of the teens has some secrets that complicate things.Once the other two become seekers, they find out that being a Seeker is not what they were trained to believe. They can travel from one place to another by accessing another dimension. I don't want to give too much away, but trouble ensues as people fight for power, and the lines of right and wrong become blurred.I enjoyed this book. The concept was very different and original, and throughout most of the story I was entertained and kept interested. There were times that moved a bit slowly, but overall, I really enjoyed it.Certain parts of the world building seemed somewhat fuzzy to me, but the character building was well done. There was some romance in there that complicated the story and made things interesting.Of course as all scifi's do these days, the book ends before you see how everything turns out, but the story will continue with a second book released in the spring of 2016. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next.While it's not actually one of my all time favorites, it's entertaining, so I'd recommend this book to all scifi fans, YA fans, and fantasy fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D59IOBN4B0OL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385744072#wasThisHelpful","R3D59IOBN4B0OL","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are really tasty, crunchy, satisfying and relatively healthy. I was hesitant to get all 5 flavors but this was the best buy on Amazon so I took the chance. It turns out that I enjoyed all of the flavors that come with this pack, but I especially like the margherita pizza. It's a delicious, flavorful treat that satisfies my craving for pizza flavors. I also enjoyed dipping the sea salt flavor into salsa for a healthy treat.Here's what else I like about Plentils:- The texture is light and crunchy. It's very satisfying as a fun chip snack.- It's only 130 calories for the full bag, with no saturated fats.- It's only 16-17 grams of effective carbohydrates for the bag, and zero sugar grams.- The lentils yield 3 grams of protein for the bag.- They're free of gluten, wheat, dairy, peanuts, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, eggs and soy.  They're verified non genetically modified. There are no artificial ingredients. I really appreciate the thought and high quality ingredients that went into this product!So is it as fantastic as a bag of lays potato chips, fritos, etc? Maybe not, but it's so much better for you and it's still really good. So I'd definitely recommend this product, and this variety pack in particular if you're interested in having healthy low cal snacks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X2MVXKGYY9F6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008D2X8C4#wasThisHelpful","R1X2MVXKGYY9F6","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my wife Sarah: I used to drink a different whey shake daily for weight control and for the nutritional value. It was low calorie, low carb and low sugar. It was a real treat, tasted very delicious, and was filling.Then I had to go on a gluten free diet, and I couldn't find a single gluten free protein shake that was low carb, low sugar and low calorie that tasted good. I tried somewhere around 7-10 different brands and nothing tasted remotely tolerable. I don't even know how some of these brands stay on the market with the terrible flavors.I find this nogii to be the best of all the brands I tried. It's actually pretty tasty. I especially like the chocolate. I love that it's low calorie, low carb and low sugar, and it has live cultures. Now I'm drinking it almost every day, and I'm so excited to have found this. It's works great with my weight loss plan and my health regimen.Rather than using two scoops, I use one to decrease the calories so it's only about 85 calories rather than the 170 you get with the recommended two scoops. I add some ice in a blender with water or almond milk and blend it smooth. It's really good!I'd highly recommend this protein powder to anyone looking for a gluten free, low carb, low calorie, low sugar drink with healthy ingredients and live cultures.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PUE7WLBPUAJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LT6APCC#wasThisHelpful","R2PUE7WLBPUAJ3","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful monitor that really rivals my 30"" Apple Cinema display on my Mac workstation. The colors were superb right out of the box.I love how you can adjust the height of the Dell monitor, and even rotate it vertically and horizontally.  I rotated it vertically so I could attach the HDMI cable into the proper port, as the ports are fairly hidden. This made connecting the HDMI cable easy.I also like how you can thread the power cord and HDMI or other cables through the monitor's stand to hide the cables and give your desktop a neat look.I wouldn't call myself a super computer techy person, so when I received the monitor I was a little hesitant and slightly intimidated as I unpacked it. I didn't recognize the cables that came with it. My plan was to hook this monitor up to my Dell XPS 5800 tower and use is as a second monitor. The only monitor connections my tower has are aDVI, a USB 2.0 and an HDMI connection. I had an HDMI cable lying around, so I connected it to the monitor and to my PC tower. Nothing happened. Then I discovered the controls on the lower right of the monitor. I switched the input to HDMI and presto, it worked!The next trick was to set it up with windows so I could have 2 monitors extended. Just 2 clicks of a mouse and it was done!So ultimately I found this very easy to handle and set up, and I'm quite happy with the visual quality and ease of use.The only thing I'd suggest to Dell is that they include an HDMI cable with the unit. I realize you can't have every kind of cable included for every scenario, but for the price of the monitor they could include that as many people will need it.Kudos to Dell for this monitor! I'm definitely happy with it and would recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLAQJDDJG4G1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PC9HFO8#wasThisHelpful","RLAQJDDJG4G1O","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my wife Sarah: This is a decent eye shadow set. It went on evenly and smoothly, and lasted reasonably well - perhaps even better than most comparable brands. The quality seemed good compared to other drugstore/supermarket shadow brands, but not as nice as some of the more expensive brands.The main issue I had was that the color didn't look as rich on my skin as it looked in the kit. The pink looked much less pink on my skin and looked almost off-white. The crease color is also  a very neutral earth tone that doesn't have the pink undertone you see in the kit, and appeared as a straight light brown when I applied it. I have a lot of natural pink tone to my skin, so I don't think this was because of my skin color. I would have preferred the shadows to have the colors they appeared to have in the box, on my skin.The darkest color makes a good liner, but the brush that comes with the kit is too thick and is difficult to use. I'd recommend using a thinner brush.I have super sensitive eyes and they get irritated easily from eye makeup. This did not bother me at all, so allergy-wise for me, it was great!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTFBDJALCZJUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLP9RSG#wasThisHelpful","RTFBDJALCZJUO","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great thermometer! I believe the word I've used to describe this in my home is magnificent. My wife laughed at that, but I meant it! I certainly wouldn't call myself a cook, but this thermometer gives me a chance to cook food right. It has several features I haven't seen in other thermometers:- It lets you preset the desired temperature you want your food to be cooked to. You simply punch in the temperature and turn on the alarm. When the food reaches that preset temperature, the alarm sounds. The alarm is loud enough to be heard from another room. This is fantastic!!!- It has a digital timer that is easy to set. Once it's set, the time counts down and the alarm sounds when it reaches the cooking time you've set.-  It has a long 3 foot probe. This allows you to  place the probe into the food that you're cooking inside the oven, and actually close the oven door with the thermometer in the food, and the screen/control unit outside on the counter.- The thermometer control unit has hinges that allow you to adjust it into different convenient positions so you can check the temperature as your food cooks.- The thermometer has two magnets underneath it so you can place it on your oven, refrigerator, or other metallic surface. This is really handy.Overall this is a very good product that helps you cook foods to the right temperature and helps you prepare food that's properly cooked and safe to eat. It's light, easy to handle, easy to use, and easy to read. It's incredibly versatile, a good value for the price, and a great thermometer for any kitchen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PFC4NYASLWE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QAVJT32#wasThisHelpful","R1PFC4NYASLWE5","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this spray bottle and immediately tried it on the interior of mu SUV that hadn’t been cleaned for a while. To my surprise, it really cleaned my dashboard and car doors great! I used paper towels, and the amount of dirt that I found on the paper towels was astonishing. It even helped remove ground in dirt on the glove compartment door, which seems to be a foot resting spot for my wife during long drives.The best thing about this product was that there was no smell from it. Usually when you’re cleaning a car interior, the fumes can be bothersome. My wife is very sensitive to chemical smells, yet she didn’t notice that I had cleaned the interior of my vehicle.This product does not clean glass. I over sprayed my dashboard and the product spattered on the windshield. I noticed it at night while driving. It was a film that I couldn't see through well.

"From my wife Sarah: Absolutely delicious. This is one of the tastier snacks I've eaten in a while. It's an incredibly satisfying snack. Filling and flavorful. The flavor is scrumptious with a nice, strong buttery popcorn taste and just the right amount of salt. Flavor-wise, it's what popcorn should taste like in an ideal world.Concerning the hardness - I had read other reviews that talk about how hard these HalfPops are, and I have really severe TMJ, so I expected to have a problem. While they are crunchy and firm, they're not what I expected. They're easy enough to bite through, even with the jaw issues I have. They're not rock-hard like unpopped kernels. They have a kind of firm, crunchy air-puffed grain consistency, but a bit harder.I did find one or two much harder pieces in my batch, so if you have TMJ or are concerned about your teeth, I would suggest eating them carefully. Just eat slowly and stay aware of any kernels that are particularly hard.I love that it's made with wholesome ingredients like sea salt, and it's gluten free and nut free. It has no artificial flavors, preservatives, corn syrup or hydrogenated oils. Take a look at the ingredients and you won't see any chemicals at all (they do have dairy).Halfpops would be a good snack choice for many diets. There are 140 calories in one ounce, and one ounce would be relatively filling compared with many other snack-type foods.There is:- 3 grams of protein- 15 grams of effective carbohydrates (18g carbs - 3g fiber)- 6 grams of fat- under 1 gram of sugar- No trans fatLow carb dieters should keep in mind that popcorn isn't great when it comes to the glycemic index, but the carb count is reasonable and the sugar gram count is excellent.I've only tried the butter flavored Halfpops, so I can't comment on the other flavors but I'd bet they're excellent based on the quality of the butter version.The price on this page must be a typo because this product can be found around Amazon for $22.99 for a 16 pack. You can also buy one bag for $1.59 if you wish to give it a try.So I'd certainly recommend this product as a healthy snack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33OWQA5H703P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082H2EFC#wasThisHelpful","R33OWQA5H703P3","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From my wife Sarah: As an E-reader it's perfect, but I'm also using it as a book light. As an E-reader, it's compact, light, fits securely and easily, it's easy to manipulate, and gives off the right level of light.As a book light and as an E-reader light I really like it, and here's why:- As an E-reader light, this is nice and light.For book reading, the lights I've had in the past were all much heavier and weighed the book down, but this is really light. That also makes it easier to balance it on the book.- At about 6 inches, it's easy to bend the neck to direct the light. As an E-reader the size of the neck is great.As a book light, the necks on the ones I've had in the past were longer, and while you can direct the light over a larger area when the light is further away, the longer necks made them bulkier, awkward and more challenging to balance, especially as you turn the page. This one is super easy to handle.- I think the level of light is great. There's only one level with a single on/off button. Past book lights I've had were so bright that they woke my husband. On this one the light is bright enough so that you can see your e-reader or book pages, but not so bright that you're shining a big flashlight type beam in the room.- The clip is easy to use. It doesn't take much strength. It's wide enough to mount and be stable, and the plastic doesn't tear at my book's pages or the e-reader.As a book reader, the only thing that was possibly a negative is this: Let's say that I clipped the light onto the right side of the book. Because the E-reader light is small, when the book's pages are wide open, the book light didn't light up the opposite page fully. Of course it wasn't designed for books, but I overcame that by letting the book slightly close just enough so the light would be cast on the left page, while keeping it wide open enough to read.So I'd suggest this light for e-reading as well as book reading, however if you're reading a very large book, the beam may not be wide enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMH7O3I8TP0F6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N30UX6A#wasThisHelpful","RMH7O3I8TP0F6","A23W55M32D2AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23W55M32D2AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My first attempt to upgrade my Apple Watch Sport Edition lime green band was with a Luvvitt stainless steel Milanese loop look-alike band--similar in appearance to this Yaha band.  Unfortunately, I did not Luvvitt, and I rated it just 1 star.  This Yaha, on the other hand, is a grand slam.  I am so proud of it that I took 6 pictures and included them with this review.There is so much to love about this Yaha band.  Where do I start?+ Upscale, Protective Packaging: Unlike the Luvvitt, this Yaha came in a very premium-looking black box with velour-padded interior to protect the band (see picture).  This is what I would expect from a premium watch band.  It is so nice that I plan to use it for storing the band when I am using the lime green sport band.+ THICK & Substantial Stainless Steel Mesh: It doesn't feel cheap in the least. Note that Yaha offers a smaller mesh/loop version of this band, if you don't prefer the larger stainless steel loops that I chose. When I say ""loops"", I don't mean the band itself, but rather the tiny stainless steel loops that make up the mesh in the band.  The difference is purely one of style preference.  I thought this one would look for beefy/masculine and, indeed, it does.+ Secure Clasp: I have zero fear whatsoever that this clasp will ever come loose and result in my Apple Watch falling of my wrist.  The clasp works like so many watch bands on the market.  Even if the clasp comes open, the band stays on your wrist.  You would have to take quite a hit to both release the clasp and somehow dislodge the second clasp mechanism inside.+ Hidden Inner Band Tail: I complained in my Luvvitt band review that the excess length of the band that was inside of the band against my wrist did not line up properly with the outer portion.  The result was a sloppy look where you could see the excess inner tail of the band.  This Yaha does NOT have this same issue.  The excess band length, after adjusting for my wrist size, is nicely hidden from view, as it lines up perfectly with the band that shows on the outside of the wrist.+ Clasp Adjustment Grooves on Back of Band: You will likely need to adjust the band length just once.  Compared to the Luvvitt band I did not like, this one was MUCH EASIER and aided immensely by the grooves on the back of the band that are intended to hold the straight and in position where you want it.  The Luvvitt did not have these grooves.  If you look closely in the product listing images, you can see these grooves on the back of the band.  To adjust the band length, you will only need a small screwdriver, jack knife, or other pointy tool to release the clasp for sliding it up/down the band to the proper position. Securing the clasp is done simply with your hands--no tools required.+ AMAZING, UPSCALE APPEARANCE: Last, but not least, I was stunned when I first put the watch on my wrist.  I have loved my Apple Watch since I first put it on, but I was still shocked to see what it looked like with this band.  My wife was equally amazed.  So, now I plan to use my lime green sport band for sporting activities and my new Yaha stainless steel band the rest of the time.  For those who own Apple Watches, you know that you can change the bands in seconds with no tools.For this price, I am floored that I got such an amazing new band for my Apple Watch. I guarantee you that I will be getting compliments on it virtually immediately. Get one. You won't be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F0SVL053XLFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011B4QM0A#wasThisHelpful","R1F0SVL053XLFN","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We recently purchased a Yakima Skybox 21 Carbonite cargo carrier, which I believe is the largest cargo carrier known to mankind--21 cubic feet of space on top of our minivan.  I wanted a hoist that would hold the carrier high enough and secure enough in the garage that I could still use the floor space beneath it.  Sure enough, this hoist does the job!Installation of the hoist was fairly easy, though I have some advice to offer.  Do NOT follow the instructions for how far apart to space the pulleys if you plan to lift something odd like me.  Their advice pertains to a kayak or canoe, which are much longer.  After I installed the pulleys, they were too far apart, and I ended up needing to move one of them in order for the hoist to work for me.  With this adjustment, everything is working great.  Start to finish, even with my do over on locating one of the pulleys was no more than about 1 hour of labor for installation.This hoist is built very well, and I have no concerns about whether it will hold.  I walk under it all the time in the garage, and I store things below it, too.  Just don't push your luck and load your cargo carrier with anything before lifting the hoist.  Best to store your cargo carrier empty, to be on the safe side.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6FUDWZ4HDUDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EUL2DO#wasThisHelpful","R6FUDWZ4HDUDD","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've broken more flag brackets and poles than perhaps anybody I know, but then I've never gone around and asked people how many they've broken.  Anyway, you get the point!Years ago, I went to a smaller flag when my poles were snapping and bending.  That did the trick for the poles, but then the point of failure became the brackets.  I always purchased the adjustable-angle brackets made of cast aluminum.  You would think I would have learned my lesson after breaking 3-4 of them in high winds, but I just kept on buying replacements, for crying out loud!Finally, after purchasing way too many replacement brackets, I decided there MUST be something sturdier.  I finally found this cast iron bracket.  It is HEAVY and SOLID with no moving parts other than the thumbscrew that holds your flag in place.  There is absolutely no way this bracket will ever fail in high winds.  I know that for sure.  The only question remaining is whether my poles will start snapping and bending again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY75HCJAY8U9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GUD18Y#wasThisHelpful","RY75HCJAY8U9T","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife wrote the first review below, which I thought was a little dry and lacking in critical content, positive or negative.  Hence, I will first provide her review.  Then, I have added my own version.  No, I didn't read the book, but I have heard all I need to know!  Hope you enjoy both reviews and find one or both of them helpful or entertaining.**Wife's Review**Abby, Luke and Hannah were friends when they were growing up.  Eventually, Luke and Abby dated.  After a while though, Luke and Hannah got married.  Luke became a doctor and they moved back to Seaview Key, an island off of the coast of Florida.  Abby moved away and married.  She never forgot her roots though.  After a few years, Abby got divorced and moved back to Seaview Key to start a housing development.When she got back she met Seth but wasn't sure if they'd just be friends.  She rekindled her friendship with Luke, but not without jealousy from Hannah.These three are the main characters and the book is about their lives, the good and the bad, back in Seaview Key.This is a good book and very well written.  I gave it 4 stars because it was a slow moving at times.**My Review**For starters, this ""romance"" wouldn't be nearly as romantic if we replaced Seaview Key with Dubuque, Flint, Pittsburgh, El Paso, or Tijuana.  So, the author used all the tools in the shed to pull off the tale of promiscuity, intrigue, and infidelity.  The beach chair and crashing waves on the cover are a good lead in to the tale, and one can hardly blame the author, as stick figures of Dick, Jane, and Spot on the cover could not have created the same appeal to dive right in.Second, the notion that Luke was just ""friends"" with Abby and Hannah is totally a chick thing.  Unless they work together with women, guys aren't looking for girls to pal around with.  Sorry to disappoint, ladies, but Luke probably had other thoughts in keeping both of the ladies on the line, beyond friendship.  Sounds like he had his paws in the cookie jar with both of them, to support my point, and he eventually got hitched with one of them.So, Abby eventually got divorced.  Sounds to me like she was longing for Luke all along.  Maybe she should have focused a little more on saving her  marriage, rather than running back to the fictitious love mecca by the sea to look for long lost Luke.  Yeah, she rekindles her flame for him and Hannah gets jealous.  OF COURSE SHE GETS JEALOUS!  Hannah was married to Luke, for crying out loud.  A cat fight was bound to ensue for the doctor with a gorgeous bod and money galore, living in a love mecca by the sea, of course.I would have loved this story a lot more if it had a very unpredictable ending, such as Abby stopping up the toilet, calling a plumber, and falling in love with all 300 pounds of his blubber when he exposes his plumber's crack while turning off the cold water supply to the toilet.  Next thing you know, she's sneaking off to KFC to share a double order of biscuits and gravy before they slink off to a no tell motel to inspect one another's plumbing, if you know what I mean.  Yeah, that would have been an ending that a guy would like, but then guys don't read romance novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NXA1DJUR9FZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778315894#wasThisHelpful","R3NXA1DJUR9FZT","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Until now, men had to trade in their manliness in order to use a loofa sponge or exfoliating scrubber.  Now Bud, Big Al, Rusty, or any other guy can grab onto this ergonomically designed tool for men and experience the wonders that previously only women could enjoy.  Wet the loofa side (not the tan side, which is for exfoliating), apply a little body wash liquid, and lather up your burly bod without wasting the body wash.  Then, turn over the tool and use the tan side to exfoliate.  For those of you who haven't exfoliated before, it is a fancy word for using a mild abrasive to remove dead skin cells.  Think of it like using a little turtle wax on the car.  In order to get a nicer shine, you have to start with a little rough stuff.  The tool is comfortable to hold with either side up, as the gray rubber grip fits nicely in your hand.  There is a loop, as well, for hanging the tool in your shower to dry each day when you are done.  Chances are pretty good that you'll love this tool as much as your favorite wrench, ratchet, or power tool.  But don't go around bragging about it.  The boys will start to worry about you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLT4FW6GI0UQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TSA90C#wasThisHelpful","RLT4FW6GI0UQ7","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**UPDATE ON SATURDAY 8/29/15**Today I wrote a 5-star review for a Yaha 42mm Stainless Steel Apple Watch Band 42mm Stainless Steel Watchband Yaha® Metal Strap Classic Buckle Adapter Watch Bands for Apple Watch Sport (Thick 42mm) that looks virtually identical to this Luvvitt. If you are thinking about this Luvvitt band, forget about it. Read my review on the Yaha and buy that one instead!******************************************My favorite iPhone case of all time is a clear Luvvitt case for my iPhone 5s. So, when I decided to try a snazzy new band for my Apple Watch, I didn't hesitate to try this highly rated Luvvitt. Unfortunately, my perception of the Luvvitt brand has diminished after this very unfortunate experience.My complaint starts with the listing on Amazon itself.  When I made my purchase, there were numerous difference products all listed together on Amazon, and the reviews were commingled, as a result.  I don't think that Amazon should allow this.  It's one thing to have different colors or sizes of the same product reviewed together, but having to sort through reviews of dissimilar products in order to determine how people feel about the product you are considering is a hassle and makes it near impossible to figure out the true star rating of a particular product, unless you want to add up the reviews and do your own math.  Anyway, enough on this.My next issue was with the packaging of the band.  When it arrived, it was packaged with loose screws and a sharp/pointy screwdriver in the same plastic pouch as the stainless steel band.  To me, this was a poor reflection of quality.  A quality watch band would not be packaged together with tools and hardware, as they could scratch or otherwise damage the band.My biggest issue, and the primary reason for the 1-star review is that the band is designed poorly and, as a result, functions poorly.  The clasp mechanism has too much play (extra space in the width measurement).  As a result, it is difficult to get the clasp mechanism properly fastened with the band exactly in the middle of the clasp.  If you do not get the clasp fastened exactly in the middle, then the excess band tail on the inside of the band (on your wrist side) will not be perfectly aligned with the band on the outside band.  This poor design ends up making an otherwise premium looking band appear sloppy and cheap.  As they say, a picture is worth a 1000 words.  Hence, I have provided a picture of this problem with the watch on my wrist.The quality of after market replacement bands is bound to increase over time.  Until then, I am sticking with the original Apple Watch sport band that came with my watch.  Perhaps someday I will splurge and buy a real Apple Milanese Loop band, but at $149, it's a bit too rich for my blood at the moment.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XSJJIQYJLVWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012UG7BMG#wasThisHelpful","R2XSJJIQYJLVWH","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have high arches and have long been loyal to Asics, both for running and for casual tennis shoes. I never had any reason to try another brand, until Amazon Vine presented the opportunity for me to try these awesome Mizuno Wave Enigma 5 shoes for free. ""BLOWN AWAY"" are two words that best summarize my experience so far with these shoes.**POSITIVES**+ Style/Appearance: My Asics aren't much for beauty contests, but these Mizunos are lookers, for sure. I love the metallic blue trim, as well as the yellow midsole. Of course, you'll love the color coordinated laces that you will, unfortunately, never find again when time to replace.+ Comfort Beyond Compare: I cannot tell a lie. These are more comfortable than any other running shoe I have ever worn. They are amazing--ample arch support, incredibly soft cushioning, snug but not tight fit, super soft tongue, somewhat stretchy/elastic laces, supple/luxurious sock liner (could wear barefoot!), and perfect width for normal feet (no too wide or too narrow areas).+ Excellent Breathability: I've worn these for extended periods in warm weather, and the cooling from the breathable mesh material is outstanding. I've never had the urge to get them off because they are too hot, and I am the kind of guy who is always taking off his shoes.**UNSURE/NEGATIVES**It's truly difficult to nitpick on these shoes. In the early going, they seem virtually flawless, but here's my attempt at finding fault.- Yellow Midsole Difficult to Clean: These shoes are so beautiful that you'll find yourself trying to keep them pristine. I have the nasty habit of using one shoe to kick off the other by placing the toe of one shoe on the heel of the other. DOH! I dirtied up the bright yellow midsole, and I was so bummed, especially since I could not get it clean with a wet rag. Perhaps I will try a mild detergent, but the typical wet rag isn't doing it.- Extra Laces Please: I know it isn't industry practice, but when you are paying for top-of-the-line running shoes (I got to try these for free, to be clear), it doesn't seem like too much to ask for an extra pair of the perfectly coordinated laces to be in the box. These laces are to die for, both in color match and in performance with their stretchy/elastic feel.- Somewhat Long Laces: I haven't used the extra ankle-tightening laces hole eyelets at the very top yet, which would help, but these laces do seem quite long. With their stretchiness, I found that I needed to have really big loops when I tied them at the top in order to avoid my laces hitting the ground. Not a huge deal, but I am trying to nitpick virtually perfect shoes!Durability will be tested with possible future updates to this review, as I have less than a month on these. So far, they are holding up wonderfully.Overall, it's tough not to LOVE these shoes, and love them I do. Trying is believing. I never expected I'd be won over, given my past loyalty to Asics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OQIL720KJYCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1HA4CY#wasThisHelpful","R1OQIL720KJYCF","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Competition is a wonderful thing, and imitation is the greatest form of flattery, as they say.  And so it is that you can get an ASUS laptop that is beautifully thin, constructed of aluminum, with an awesome screen, multi-gesture touchpad, premium keyboard, and excellent audio (albeit not as loud as I'd like).  Indeed, until you start using the computer and realize that it has Microsoft Windows under the hood, you'd swear it's an Apple.  Of course, the operating system makes all the difference for those who appreciate ease of use, but I'll stay away from tearing down Microsoft.  This is a review of an ASUS laptop, and I'll focus on the laptop, not the software.From an aesthetics standpoint, this computer is truly a work of art.  Sleek is an understatement.  It feels substantial/solid, but not bulky.  If opens and closes like the doors of a luxury car.  The screen is magnificent and so thin it's silly.  The typing surface is equally beautiful with large areas to rest your wrists while typing.  The integrated left/right click into the touchpad adds to the sleekness, as does the sheen of the all-aluminum body.  Wow, it's a sight to behold.From a performance standpoint, it also delivers beyond my expectations:+ Startup of the machine is lightning fast.  My last Windows laptop was purchased about 5 years ago, and let's not talk about how long it takes that heap to start up.  This laptop goes 0-60 like a sports car.  No more waiting and getting angry behind the wheel.+ The keyboard is simply awesome with its dimmable, lit keys and super luxurious feel.  The 10-key number pad on the right is a nice touch that fits naturally on the super-wide surface provided by the large screen.+ The screen is beautiful, too, with its glare-free design and bright, vivid colors.  Plug it in to get the full brightness, or crank up the brightness and burn down your battery faster.  Don't settle for a dimmer screen to save your battery.  You will miss out on the beauty of this screen.+ The stereo speakers, interestingly on the underside of the laptop, have excellent sound, as one would expect.  However, either because the speakers are under the laptop or for some other technical reason, I cannot get the speakers as loud as I'd like them when playing my favorite music.  Don't get me wrong.  The speakers are not quiet, but they seem like they could go louder.  Frankly, I think they should have put the speakers on top of the keyboard or on the screen, which would have made a difference, I believe.+ Speed and responsiveness when navigating the computer and the internet is marvelously fast.  I am sure this is a testament to the hardware at work, though I cannot say, because I am clueless when it comes to computer specifications.  What I can tell you is that you will be impressed.+ Indicator lights on the front edge of the computer, visible when the lid is closed, tell you whether your keyboard is lit, whether your battery is green/yellow/red, whether your hard drive is operating, whether you are in airplane mode, and whether CAP LOCKS is selected.  Nice touch.+ Two USB ports on each side of the laptop provide ample ports on whichever side you wish.  What a novel idea!+ SD card slot on the right side is easy to access.+ Headphone jack on the right also easy to access.+ HDMI port and spring-loaded, flip-down LAN port on left both easy to access.As biased as I am to Apple computers, it's hard not to love this laptop.  That said, it comes with Windows 8, which is a mess.  Supposedly, Windows 10 is available for download, but I spent a good 10 minutes or more trying to figure out how to download it.  When I finally got there, I think, I got cold feet and decided that maybe I'd wait to read about all the problems before I jump in with both feet.  Anyway, this laptop is emblazoned with a sticker that reads ""Plays well with Windows 10"".  That is hardly a reassuring statement--so the laptop won't fight with Windows 10.  I guess in the world of Microsoft Windows, that is progress.When all is said and done, this is one beautiful machine that performs as well as it looks.  If Windows is what you want, then you'll be the envy of your household, your office, or wherever you flip open this baby.  Enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VE58DWVN3IRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YR6BMS2#wasThisHelpful","R2VE58DWVN3IRO","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been trying to get my wife to try these out for weeks. Every time I tried, she passed on the opportunity. Clearly, she didn't believe they'd work as well for her as the tried and true spray bottle and rag. I know it will give many readers great pleasure to read that after trying them myself, I had to admit, once again, that she was right. When will I learn? Never. I'm like most men--overconfident, stubborn, and determinedly stupid.Most of us have used baby wipes or sanitizing wipes at some point in our lives. Admit it, guys. You change diapers now. We all do. So the concept of a wet wipe for cleaning windows and mirrors makes sense. In fact, when I saw this product, I thought I'd love it. What could be easier? Just dispense, wipe, and toss. Unfortunately, this was an unfulfilled dream.My experience with these wipes was brief and frustrating. First, the solvent in them isn't that strong. The bathroom mirror gets unmentionable material on it that usually comes off pretty easily with window cleaner, but not with these wipes. I found myself scrubbing and scrubbing to remove marks, but the worst part wasn't the elbow grease required. The worst part was the annoying particles the cloth left all over my mirror. After cleaning the mirror, I had to go back and wipe again all over the place to remove fine particles. This is completely unacceptable for a window cleaning product.There's only one logical thing to do with these wipes--give them to my mother-in-law.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EHXYTMBO4D28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNT6BR4#wasThisHelpful","R1EHXYTMBO4D28","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I installed this rack on a 2001 Lexus IS300. It was a major pain to install, and it never fit securely in the couple of weeks I had it on the car. Even worse, the wind noise it created was unbearable. I could have tried installing a wind deflector/fairing, but that just seemed like too much work and expense for a rack that seemed jimmy rigged from the beginning. Notably, it is shipped without an instruction sheet, which  you must view on Amazon. Also, the metal hooks that wrap around the edge off the car roof are bare metal, which is not only  unprotective but also a hindrance to holding the rack securely.

"This kind of luxury is usually discovered in a fancy hotel or spa, but I discovered it on Amazon. Amazing stuff. Though the product description reads like a liqueur or wine, it is, indeed, deserving of such elaborate description. My nose is not as keen as some others, but this masculine essence is unmistakable. The aroma brings me back to the days of walking past the tobacco shop at the mall--not smoke, but sweet and alluring pipe tobacco. If Axe is a chick magnet for teens and millennials, then this is for the grown-ups among us, whether eligible or just wanting to remind your significant other that you still live in the same house.I've been using this brew for my hair and body for weeks now, and I love it. Just a couple of notes worth mentioning: your bathroom will take on its smell (must get on the shower curtain and walls) and it doesn't lather up quite as much as shampoo or a bar of soap. Still, this bottle is lasting me surprisingly long, perhaps because it is a thin consistency that goes a long way, even without a loofa, which would make it last even longer. But a real man doesn't use a loofa.Indulge yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV2G185BQOD79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCXS80S#wasThisHelpful","RV2G185BQOD79","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, you usually buy Trident or Dentyne, and you are wondering what's so special about this Orbit gum? Yeah, I used to be like you. It's just gum, right? And mint even. What could be so special about mint?Well, let me tell you, this gum far exceeded my expectations on several fronts:+ 2 Unique & Wonderful Flavors: In addition to 3 packs of Peppermint and 3 packs of Spearmint, you will be blown away by 3 packs of Wintermint and 3 packs of Sweet Mint. Both of these flavors are now favorites of mine.+ Soft, Long-Lasting Flavor: Softer out of the wrapper than other gums, it stays softer as you chew it, and the flavor doesn't disappear in just minutes, like other gums.+ Big Pieces: With other mint gums, I'm often tempted to eat two pieces at once, because they are such small pieces. Not here. These are generously sized pieces, and I never once thought of eating two at once.+ Cool Reclosable Packaging: Each pack comes in a neatly designed, wallet-like paperboard package--perfect for your pocket or purse (or ""murse"" if you are a man).

"OK, lame headline, but great hammer!  Who ever thought one hammer could be different from the next? I am sure there are some carpenters out there laughing at that statement. I'm just an average Joe who needs to use a hammer once in a while. Still, there is so much to like about this hammer:+ Magnetic Head: You can actually attach a nail by its head to the magnet, set the nail into the wood by forcing the nail point into the wood while the nail head is attached magnetically to the hammer, pull back on the hammer, and drive the nail with a typical hammer swing. Advantage? No holding the nail and smashing you fingers or thumb.+ Rubberized, Ergonomic Grip: Comfortable and secure in your hand. You'll love it.+ Low Vibration: Driving nails feels effortless, with no sensation of vibration whatsoever.+ Attractive: In addition to the cool red handle, the polished steel hammer head is very cool looking. I know it's a hammer, but why not choose one that looks cool?I'm not sure how one could ask for anymore in a hammer. I would recommend this one to anybody.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B1Z96040BVPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWVAV40#wasThisHelpful","R3B1Z96040BVPV","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are thinking these are sinful, you are right. If you are thinking they'd be good on just about anything, you are right. If you are thinking you'd like to just open a jar and eat just a spoonful, think again. Next thing you know, you'll be eating it like a pint of Ben & Jerry's.Natural ingredients blah blah blah. Who cares? It's yummy beyond belief, and if you are eating this stuff, you're not terribly health conscious in the first place!So, when gluttony calls your name, a whole jar is only a thousand and some odd calories, and with a cold glass of milk or a hot cup of black coffee to balance the sweetness, you'll be in heaven. Well, I guess gluttony and heaven don't usually go together, but you can always repent. Repentance is a small price for this level of joy.A favorite? Well, for chocolate lovers like me, the one that's like smashed Oreos in gooey goop is impossible to top. Does the graham cracker really taste like graham crackers? You bet! The third one was a bit of a mystery to me, but still worthy of spooning large quantities down the ol' hatch and chasing with milk or coffee.Recommendations? Eat it cold, but not frozen. It'll be stiffer (less runny) and more like eating Ben & Jerry's. Also, be sure to have milk, coffee, or at least water close by to cleanse your palate between mouthsful.Complaints? Are you kidding me? The jars weren't deep enough! If somebody wanted to get really persnickety, one might describe the mouth feel as a bit gritty--not totally smooth. Still, it is a stretch to say that this is a complaint. Rather, it's an observation.So, do you need these?  No. Do you want these? Yes. Do you deserve these?

"I fell for the positive reviews on this product.  Then, I received it and realized that it was basically a big hunk of plastic.  Ugh.  I hate plastic, especially when my water is sitting in it.  I am not a scientist, but I do know that BPA is just the start.  As reported recently by a chemist on NPR, BPA has gotten a lot of publicity, but there are many more chemicals in plastic that have not gotten as much publicity and may be equally harmful to human health.  In particular, heating up plastic is a concern, because the energy transfer from heat can release these chemicals from plastic more easily than they will leach on their own from contact with cold water.So, unhappy that I hadn't considered this purchase more carefully, I decided to search high and low for a BPA-free claim, at a minimum.  I found NONE on package or in the User Manual!  As a marketing guy who once managed a water filtration business, I know that BPA-free is pretty much ""table stakes"" to play in plastic.  If you don't have that claim, you are either (1) hiding something, (2) keeping your options open to using BPA, or (3) extremely clueless as to what consumers want.  I don't know about you, but I don't want to do business with a company guilty of 1, 2, or 3.I am returning the kettle unused to Amazon.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OQHHMA8N64Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086UJQN8#wasThisHelpful","R2OQHHMA8N64Z0","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew the reputation of Bosch, but I had never actually experienced it first hand, until now.  If BMW is the Ultimate Driving Machine, then Bosch is the Ultimate Impact Driver.  It's no coincidence that both of these engineering wonders--BMW and Bosch--both come from Germany.Lithium Ion technology has advanced cordless tools in a huge way.  I am reminded of this every time I struggle painfully with my weed whacker or cordless drill, with their short battery lives and long recharge times.  In case you didn't make the connection, Lithium Ion batteries are the same ones that power those ultra-thin laptop computers, iPads, and iPhones.  If you are expecting a heavy impact driver, think again.  This driver is WAY lighter than my cordless drill, with its massive non-lithium battery.I'll be updating this review later, after I have had more use of the driver.  For now, I report on just a few features that I have already experienced:+ Simple Setup: First, you'll need to determine if you want to charge the driver while connected to the battery or whether you prefer to disconnect the battery from the driver and charge it.  If you choose the latter, as I did, then you can choose to place the charging plate either on a flat surface or hang it on a wall with the included bracket (though you'll have to supply the screws to mount it to your wall).  The bracket is perfectly designed to have the charging plate snap into it from one direction and the battery slide into it securely from the other direction.  There is no concern about the battery or the charging plate falling to the floor.  Bosch nailed the details with the perfectly designed bracket.+ Belt Clip: There is an included belt clip, if you wish to use it.  I did not.  If you do use it, it comes both with the clip and with the screw to connect the clip to drill.+ Smooth-as-Silk Chuck: The chuck is the piece at the top of the driver into which a bit driver or socket driver attachment is inserted.  This one has a rubberized grip and slides as smoothly as one could imagine when operated.  I tried it with the included dual-end Phillips head driver bit, and it worked like a charm, just as I expected.+ 3-Speed Transmission: Simple push button transmission with LED light indicator has 3 speeds--plenty fast, very fast, and BMW fast.  The difference is noticeable, and I cannot wait to get it out for a test drive so I can open it up in the BMW fast speed.  In the meantime, I can just rev it up in the garage to get my blood pumping.+ Precision Braking: Take your foot, I mean finger, off the gas, I mean trigger, and the brake automatically stops the driver on a dime.  Zero to 60 to zero in 1 second flat.  Impressive.+ LED Lighting: Working in a not-so-bright location?  Well, you would work like a woman and spend 20 minutes getting the lighting just right, or you can just push the light button on the impact driver and let Bosch light the way, right where you are pointing the impact driver.  Perfect.+ Rocket Fast Charging: When I unpacked the driver, the battery indicator light on the battery itself was indicating just 1 bar.  So, after hooking up the charger, I placed the battery on the charging plate.  I swear it was fully charged in less than an hour.  Amazing.  I have never seen anything charge that quickly--not even a cell phone.+ Free Ballistic Nylon Bag: The included ballistic nylon carry bag says quality, and you won't be embarrassed to use it.  Though it would be nice if it had a few more pockets (it has just a couple on the outside, non inside), it is hard to complain about such a minor detail.So there you have it.  If you are going through midlife crisis like me and need to feel like a kid behind the wheel of a sports car, splurge and spend a couple hundred bucks on one of these bad boys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EG68ZN0XRP3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND4H4K4#wasThisHelpful","R3EG68ZN0XRP3A","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...The more you eat, the more you toot!The more you toot, the better you feel.So let's eat beans for every meal!OK, I interrupt this jingle for a product review.The time between selecting this item on Amazon and actually eating the beans was probably probably a week or more.  My wife was excited to try them, too, and she ate half the can before I got to them.  She reported that she really liked them, and she especially liked that many of the beans were still whole, though everything was cooked properly, whereas so many refried beans seem to come as pure mush out of the can.  After eating half the can, she left the rest in a glass bowl for me in the fridge.Today, I heated them and made a bean burrito with nothing else on it--just beans on a whole wheat tortilla.  It was delicious--mild, but flavorful, and not too salty.Fast forward a couple of hours, and here I am reviewing the beans, only to recall they were FAT FREE!

"True pizza lovers, we wasted no time getting this oven set up and operating. Who doesn't want pizza that bakes in 5 minutes?Having made a half dozen pizzas in just the first couple of weeks, I already know the two faults of this pizza oven:1. SAFETY HAZARD: The first fault presents a safety hazard, in my opinion. When the oven heats up, the pan holding the pizza, which is intended to be inserted and removed with the included pan holder tool shown mounted on the side of the oven, warps and becomes extremely difficult to remove from a hot oven. My wife and I have both struggled to remove the pan from the hot oven. In a tug of war with a hot oven with a hot pizza on a slippery pan, accidents and burns are bound to happen. This is unacceptable and makes me wonder, as a marketing manager myself, whether this product went through basic testing before launch.2. Poor Facsimile of Quick Fired Pizza: Quick fired pizza is all the rage right now. Typically made in a stone hearth oven fired by burning wood, quick fired pizza is made with very hot top and bottom heat. The top heat cooks the toppings, and the bottom heat bakes the crust to either a chewy or crispy crust, depending on how thick or thin the crust dough is rolled and how long it is left to bake. Though this oven does, in fact, make a pizza in 5 minutes or less, it does so almost exclusively with strong top heat. The end result is bound to be a soft, bread-like crust, even if you closely follow the instructions to preheat the pan in the oven.As a pizza connoisseur, I find this oven big on style and short on substance. I am convinced I can more safely produce a higher quality pizza in my full-size oven. So, why make space for this monstrous oven in your kitchen? I see no reason, unfortunately, and I am disappointed, even though I got the oven for free to test out as an Amazon Vine Reviewer.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20MLXYQOEWB29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2OZM66#wasThisHelpful","R20MLXYQOEWB29","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If your little boy or girl loves pretending to work on things, this workbench would seem, at first glance, to be a great selection. Our 6-year-old son loves to watch This Old House, and this bench seemed like it would be an instant hit with him. He and my wife assembled the bench as a fun project together, and initial feedback was positive. Then, through the course of typical play by him and his 4-year-old twin sisters, the graphics on both the horizontal and vertical surfaces started to come off. Oh, the decals began to peel, you say? No, the designer of this bench somehow thought that it would be better not to use decals, but rather printed paperboard (think cereal box) material that stays in place behind plastic slotted tabs. Big mistake! Either my kids thought it would be fun to tear off these graphics or they began to warp and become detached on their own. Regardless, replacing them is a pain, and it is only a matter of time before they become too damaged to be replaced in our household. Once an imagination toy becomes a nondescript hunk of plastic, the magic fades, in my opinion. It looks shoddy and nothing like the real life version with missing or damaged graphics, and this means the kids will lose interest. This has already happened in our household, where it seems that none of the 3 kids kids are much interested anymore, and we are only 1 month into the experience. Had this toy been made to last with heavy duty graphics, I would be rating it 5 stars. However, since the manufacturer cut corners on a key design feature--graphics--I suddenly feel this bench is worthy of no more than 3 stars. What a shame.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M0JB8Q72KFP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q058PRE#wasThisHelpful","R1M0JB8Q72KFP5","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**GENERAL IMPRESSIONS**Anybody who has searched for protein powders knows there are countless hundreds, if not more, versions out there, each claiming to be different in its own way. This one claims to be ""LITE"" because it has only 60 calories per serving--about half the calories per serving of other protein powders.  I find this to be a weak claim, as this protein powder also delivers half the amount of protein per serving as the others.  So, in essence, you are putting half as much stuff into your glass and getting twice as many servings, each with half as much nutritional content in them.  It's not magic!**NUTRITION**Getting beyond the weak ""LITE"" claim of this powder, I move on to other nutritional details on the product:- No Added Sugar: It uses sucralose, known as the brand name Splenda.  This, too, is not unique.  Lots of protein powders use it.- Natural Protein: Plant or dairy based protein are both natural, and natural is not a regulated word like Organic.  I am not impressed here.- Prebiotic Fiber: Supposedly helps digestive health and feeling of being full.  OK, perhaps this is something a little unique, not recalling this from other searches, but I don't buy protein power for these things.  I guess it will depend on whether you place a premium on these.  You are only going to feel so full with such a small serving size.- Vitamins & Minerals: Like other protein powders, there is good overall nutritional content on vitamins and minerals.- Certified Gluten Free & Kosher: If these are important to you, you are covered.- Certified Non-GMO Soy Protein (non-hydrolyzed): Claims to have particular benefits to women.- MADE IN USA: A must for me when it comes to food these days.  Kudos.- Ingredients: Only 2 of them stand out as pretty unique from other powders I have seen, and they are quite low on the list, which means they are a low % of the product weight.  They are Garcinia Cambogia and Green Coffee Berry.  Anything with coffee in it is my friend!  WebMD says the following about Garcinia Cambogia: ""Garcinia cambogia, a tropical fruit also known as the Malabar tamarind, is a popular weight-loss supplement. People say it blocks your body's ability to make fat and it puts the brakes on your appetite.""  Sounds like great marketing material!  At least it's natural!**TASTE**So, it is hard to miss the cookies on the front of the label, and cookies are a high bar for taste!  Does it clear the bar?  Meh.  It's not bad, but it's not Oreos either.  When I tried to mix it with only water or soy milk, it was tough to drink.  When I added bananas, greek yogurt, oatmeal, soy milk, and ice to make a tasty smoothie, it was quite good.  Taste is a personal thing, I know, but my wife wasn't a huge fan of this powder, either, so we are a sample size of 2, and we both give it a resounding MEH!  As a general comment on taste, my wife and I have decided that we will buy only vanilla or unflavored powders from now on.  They are more versatile, and you can add your own flavoring, such as very low-cal baker's cocoa, if you like chocolate.**VALUE**Personally, I think it's always important to compare protein powders on a cost/serving basis, and I consider a serving to be equal delivery of protein, not whatever they call a serving on the label.  After all, it's a protein powder, and you are probably in it for the protein, right?  So, I have found that virtually all protein powders fall in the $.50-$1.00 per serving range for roughly 20 grams of protein.  On that basis, this powder is on the upper end of the range.  Today's price of $7.99 means that you'd spend over $1.00 for 20 grams of protein--nothing to write home about.  You can do much better by shopping around.**SUMMARY**For most people, I am guessing you can do better than this protein powder on all fronts--taste, protein content, and value.  Unless this one really lights your fire for some reason, it's just another protein powder on the ""tried that once"" list.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y6GDK3VYFDTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMUP58#wasThisHelpful","R1Y6GDK3VYFDTI","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm new to weight training, as my wife got me into kettlebells just a few months ago to complement my cycling and aerobic exercises.  Now, we are looking at converting one room of our home to a home gym, and we want to expand our equipment and weight training.  I thought this book might be a good reference.Within minutes of opening this book, I knew it would be PERFECT!  It covers everything from why you would want to weight train, to basic principles and terminology, to personal strength testing before you get started, to safety and injury prevention, to setting up a home gym, to working out in a club, to how to work specific muscle groups (with images), to setting up workout programs, including 20-minute workouts for people who don't have a lot of time.Like all DUMMIES books, this book is very nicely organized.  You don't need to read the book cover to cover.  You just skip to what you need to read, and things are straight to the point--easy, short segments that get you the nuts and bolts you need to know.  I see myself using this book again and again as a reference once I get started.Even though it's a DUMMIES book, don't mistake that to mean that this just covers the basics.  The depth of knowledge in this book is impressive.  There is so much I will learn, but I can take it as a pace that suits me, given the very nice organization of the book.  It is clear what I need to read now and what I can save for later.Honestly, this book has far exceeded my expectations already.  I cannot wait to dive into it further.  I would highly recommend it to anybody getting started or considering the idea of getting started with weight training.  I believe Amazon allows you to peek into the book to see the table of contents and perhaps a few pages.  Check it out.  You will be impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NB86U3YZQM5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118940741#wasThisHelpful","R3NB86U3YZQM5L","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried lots of styli (just look at all my reviews, and you will see reviews I've written for several of them), and none of them has really been great, for one reason or another.  Maybe I'll never be happy writing on my iPad.  How can it possibly be like paper, right?  That's the feel I am seeking.  It's just too awkward.  I'd rather write on paper and then scan it into an app like Evernote, which has native document scanning built in, or Evernote's new standalone app called Scannable, which is an unbundled version if you are not an Evernote user (or even if you are an Evernote user).So, getting to discussion on this little Adonis Mini.  A couple of things caught my attention when it was offered to me to try out.  First, the tiny size seemed like it would be handy and manageable taking it with me, since my iPad is on the go with me all the time.  Second, the built-in clip seemed like promised to somehow attach to my iPad or iPad case in an elegant and effective way.POSITIVES: The tiny size of this stylus makes it really unique from anything else I have tried.  Even though it's small, it doesn't feel small when you are using it.  It is mostly small in length, not girth, and it is really lightweight.  I especially love the screw-on cap, which screws onto the back of the stylus when the stylus is in use.  Kudos to the designer who recognized that caps fall off in pockets and sometimes even fall off the back of pens/styli when not in use.  With the screw-on feature, this cap is not going anywhere.  Another cool aspect of the screw-on cap is that it nicely protects the flat plastic disk that is affixed to the tip of the stylus.  Try transporting a stylus with one of these disks and no cap on your stylus and see how long the disk lasts!  Good thinking, Adonit!NEGATIVES: OK, so the clip is useless.  In fact, calling it a clip is a complete misnomer.  To me, a clip has some sort of tension to allow it to hold onto something.  This built-in ""clip"" is nothing more than a tapered slot that is part of the stylus design.  If you are carrying the stylus in your shirt pocket (who does that--nerds?!?), it might be moderately functional, but if you plan to clip the stylus onto any other part of your shirt, FORGET ABOUT IT!  This clip will never work for you.  Also, the thought of this clip somehow holding directly onto my iPad or iPad case was an imagined use on my part.  This is no way this will be happening.MYSTIFYING: The little plastic disk that is affixed to the tip of the stylus perplexes me.  The idea of writing with such an attachment to your stylus tip is akin to walking with a sack of flour tied to one leg.  Sure, you can do it, but why?  Of course, there is some technological reason why this works and why you would want to do it, but that is beyond me, and it seems so unnatural.  Further, I have read that these disks wear out and need to be replaced.  I have also read that if your screen is not completely clean and you write with a stylus that employs this type of disk, you can actually scratch your screen.  In the end, it's just weird, in my opinion, and it leaves me thinking THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY!PERFORMANCE: Yes, it works, for writing, for tapping/selecting, for swiping, or for anything else where you would normally employ your finger.  However, I am still of the opinion that unless it replicates a true writing experience like a pen to paper, I'd rather just use my finger.  I am giving this stylus 3 stars because it's not bad, but it's not good.  It's just OK.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC6ISCSGK3C90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R33ZWI2#wasThisHelpful","RC6ISCSGK3C90","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have 3 kids ages 4, 4, and 6 who are homeschooled, and I thought this map would be a great learning tool for them.When it arrived, the kids were excited to work with me on the project of unfurling the laminated map and hanging it on the wall near their play area. The metal grommets on each corner were much appreciated on my part, as I have been frustrated in the past by trying to hang things on the wall in a secure manner. For this map, I used 4 cheap plastic Command Hooks (search Amazon for part number B000OEGCL8) from 3M--1 for each corner grommet hole, with the top 2 hooks oriented right side up and the bottom 2 hooks oriented upside down, in order to keep the hung map from curling due to the memory of the rolled up paper. Be sure to use the part number above if you want to use Command Hooks, as not all Command Hooks fit through the holes. We were pleased with the completed project, which is now beautifully displayed in all of its colors in our play area.Next, we decided to place the included stickers on the map, such as where we and family members live. This was fun and engaging for the kids, as it facilitated much discussion. We did find, however, that most of the stickers weren't that relevant to us, and the kids mostly wanted to put all the stickers all over the map, which isn't exactly the point, and I was concerned that the stickers would not remove easily once applied. Therefore, I ended this part of the activity and have since misplaced the stickers somewhere. Not a big deal, though, since we already used the ones relevant to us.Overall, I am quite pleased with this product. I am taking it down 1 star to 4 stars because it could have easily come with the 4 plastic Command Hooks. Not everybody has these lying around, and using a nail or screw is certainly not preferred when kids are involved. Also, since hanging the map, the kids haven't spent even a moment looking at it in a couple of weeks. I thought it would have more ongoing interest for them, but so far not. We will use it as a teaching tool, in time, but for now it is mostly just a colorful addition to the wall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S9WCY48Z1WD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLFWDFM#wasThisHelpful","R3S9WCY48Z1WD8","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To some, it's just deodorant. To others, it's as important as the choice of shirt, pants, and accessories. Think of it more like cologne.

"I'm a big OXO fan. Whenever I need something basic, I usually marvel over the OXO version and sometimes even splurge and buy it. That's why I jumped at the chance to replace one of my nasty, rigid metal sink-bottom protectors with an OXO version. The concept had me sold--soft, cushiony, washable, heat resistant, rust proof. What could possibly go wrong, I thought. Oh, let me count the ways!- HOLE CUT OPTIONS: Universal fit was NOT achieved for me. Yes, my drain hole is off center, but I needed options for front/back, not just left/right. No, I could not rotate the mat, as my sink is wider left/right than front/back.- UNSUPPORTED STUBS: Fully intact and uncut, the promise of sink protection seems credible. However, if you fall for the enticement of cutting out your sink hole access, you'll be left with a massive hole (much bigger than you really need) and little stub extensions up to the edge of the massive hole that are no longer supported by the rest of the webbing in the mat. These stubs would easily be moved around by sharp objects and other rubble in your sink.- IRREVERSIBLE DECISION: Once you cut the mat, you are toast. There is no going back. You will wish you'd never considered something so dumb, but you'll be stuck with the decision for the rest of your life. If you are fortunate enough to have gotten the mat to try for free, you can just throw it away and try to forget about it, but the memory of it wil haunt you again and again. Don't do it. If you insist on buying this mat, take my advice and NEVER cut out a hole.I am back to using my nasty sink-bottom protectors. Someday, I am certain, OXO will release a 2.0 version of this mat and all will be forgiven. Until then, I am not speaking to my OXO kitchen utensils anymore.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UXFECBH3307Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCEBMH0#wasThisHelpful","R3UXFECBH3307Q","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Seeing this professional-looking hoop reminded me of the cheap hoops I used to have hanging on doors 30 years ago. Like everything else, I expected things have come a long ways since back then, and I was right.There is much to like about this setup:+ Quick assembly in 10-15 minutes max. Just 4 bolts and nuts, 1 net, and 1 ball to inflate.+ Ample padding on all contact points to protect doors.+ Spring-loaded rim to prevent damage with expected rough play (with limits, see below).+ High quality details, including relatively thick plexiglass, sturdy metal rim, high quality net, durable protective padding, and surprisingly nice ball.On the downside, I found few faults:- Backboard flexes when rim is pulled down with spring mechanism. This tells me that eventually the backboard will crack and break. You can tell kids to play nice and not hang on the rim, but it's gonna happen!- No ball inflation needle is included, even though it would cost the manufacturer next to nothing to include one. This led me on a hunt around the garage that took me longer than assembling the unit itself.- Door fit is not perfect. I tried putting it on 2 doors and closing them to secure the rim better. Both doors had a fair amount of resistance before they clicked shut. Seems like they could have designed this to fit a bit tighter/slimmer over the top of the door. It is intentionally oversized up there to accommodate various door thicknesses, and this results is excess, rather that compactness.Overall, this is a fine product that should perform well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DKXV84PX01VQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOIPVNM#wasThisHelpful","R3DKXV84PX01VQ","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It takes twice as long to charge the PowerPack as it does to run it to empty when charging devices at 2.4 amps. Who has more than 8 hours to wait for a PowerPack to fully charge?!? This was totally unacceptable to me, as I could not even count on it being recharged with an overnight charge, since I only sleep 5-6 hours.Also, I read another review on this product and saw that a purchaser tried to charge an iPhone and an iPad at the same time to see how it passed the stress test. For that purchaser, the PowerPack would not even work, though the manufacturer replied that the PowerPack must have been defective. I doubt that claim, as my PowerPack failed this same test. It simply would not function at all with devices plugged into both outputs.Incidentally, an Apple Store employee actually told me that charging an iPhone at 2.4 amps is completely OK.  Therefore, give the choice of charging at either 1 amp or 2.4 amps, there is really no reason to choose 1 amp.The only thing positive I have to say about this PowerPack is that it's really attractive, but style does not win over substance with a charger.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZU0LE1V6PVBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRD3QKE#wasThisHelpful","R2ZU0LE1V6PVBZ","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over several generations of iPhones, I've tried more cases than I'd like to admit.  There's usually something about them that bugs me.  This is the first case that I truly love (yes, I Luvvitt!).So, what's to love about this case:+ Shows off your beautiful iPhone, doesn't hide it like other cases.+ Grippy enough to help you hold it more securely than a bare phone.+ Plenty of clearance around camera lens and flash to prevent interference.+ Clear access to silent switch, headphone port, and charging port.+ Ample cutouts to prevent interference with speakers.+ Snug/slim fit while still protecting phone with some shock absorption.+ Unique, soft feel without being stretchy or a magnetic for pocket lint or other dirt.+ BONUS trick I discovered by accident.  Turn on your LED flashlight, and lay the phone down on a hard surface in the dark.  The entire phone illuminates.  Pretty cool!One of my daughters dropped my iPhone on a tile floor from a height of probably 3.5 feet with this case on the phone, and there is absolutely no sign of where the case hit the floor--no scratched/dinged case at all.  Also, the sound that it made was reassuring.  It was a soft feel, not like something hard hitting the floor.I'm a believer.

I filled two of these bottles with ice and drinks before the ride, and they were still cold HOURS LATER! Ordinary bottles would have had warm drinks inside within an hour, based on my experience.

"A techie colleague at work mentioned that he bought this device in order to finally part with a half dozen remotes and control his system with his iPhone.  It all sounds too good to be true, and, well, you know how the saying goes.First, the system took a good hour or so to get unpacked and set up.  I expected it would take less.  Still, I would have been fine with it if it worked.Second, because my TV, sound bar, Roku, TiVo, and Blu-Ray player are all flat against the wall, I struggled with what to do with this doodad.  It needed to be located somewhere atop or behind the TV where it could somehow control everything.  I finally ended up mounting it a bit above the TV on the wall, where it was visible.  It's not the ugliest thing, but it did look a little odd.  Still, if it had worked dependably, I could have lived with it.Third, even though it worked when I first got it set up, it didn't work consistently.  Sometimes, it would work ""partly"", which means that it would turn on the TV, but not the sound bar, or it would turn off the sound bar, but not the TV.  This was always frustrating, and I cannot figure out why it wasn't working.Fourth, when my wife was home during the day when the room was bright, she said it performed horribly--so badly that she went back to our 5 remotes.  I did verify that it seemed to work better in a dim or dark room.Fifth, it was slow as molasses at times.  If I selected a function, such as opening the YouTube app on Roku, it would take FAR LONGER to open than if I had chosen that app with the Roku remote.  This was a mystery to me.Sixth, the look of the buttons on my iPhone was disappointing, and there was not an audible sound click when I pushed something, which always led me to wonder if I had actually pressed the button.  Anybody who has owned a TiVo knows that blip blip blip sound that is so reassuring when using the remote.  Using my phone was so lifeless and lacking.Seventh, and last, the unit failed just a couple of weeks into usage.  Even after reboots, resets, unplugging and replugging, it would not do anything other than turn things on and off.  No other buttons worked at all.  This is when I threw in the towel.  It is going back to Amazon for a full refund.  What a disappointment.Never again, Logitech.  Years ago, my dad tried again and again with one of your universal remotes, to no avail.  Now, I have endured the pain myself.

"My 5-year-old son is a Disney Cars and Planes nut who has seen all the movies multiple times.  We are also owners of the LeapFrog LeapReader device that you need to enjoy this book (device not included, just the book).  So, when I was given the opportunity to try this book out for free from Amazon Vine, it was a no brainer.My son was quick to test out the book when it arrived at the house.  I was not home, but my wife said that he was very engaged and happy with the book.  I asked him myself if there was anything he did not like, and he said, ""Nope"".  I asked him how many stars I should rate the book.  He knows that 5 stars is the highest, but he told me, ""58 stars!"".  I'd say that was a positive review.Just last weekend, my son asked me to take him to see Planes Fire & Rescue at the local theater.  My wife had taken him to see the movie a few weeks earlier, but now it was my turn.  I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would (actually, I loved it), and now it gave me an excuse to try out the LeapFrog book myself.I was not sure what to expect with the book, as I had never actually used this system myself.  Would it be the real movie voices, or just some boring narrator?  Would there be sound effects and cool, unexpected features?  The answer to these questions is simple.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY by the experience--ALL the real movie voices, sound effects, story line, and even some music (yes, AC/DC music is in the movie and the book).  How does this thing work?  I have absolutely no idea.  You might as well ask me the meaning of life.  I am dumbfounded, but I am awestruck at the same time.  Point the LeapReader device at any character or scene on any page of the book, and the character will speak, or make sounds, or do something that will remind you of the movie.  I could have spent hours with this book, seriously, but I pulled myself away.

"I'm not a car nut.  I'm just a regular guy with a 13-year-old Lexus IS 300 who thought it would be pretty cool to have shiny black tires.  So, when I was offered a chance of trying out this concoction for free from Amazon Vine, I took the bait.**Outside the Box**I quickly inspected the box to see what was inside and how much work this was going to be.  There were 3 things inside, and each was pictured on the box: tire cleaner in a spray bottle, Endura-Shine Tire Coat in a bottle, and an applicator sponge.  I guess there was also a pair of cheap plastic gloves inside.  Use your own rubber gloves, as I did, if you have them.  The gloves that came with the kit reminded me of the 3-cent gloves they use when making sandwiches at Subway.  The directions were simple--just 3 steps: (1) clean the tires with the tire cleaner, (2) apply the first coat with the applicator sponge, and (3) wait 10 minutes and apply a second coat.  Heck.  I thought I could handle this in less than an hour with no problem.**Cleaning the Tires**The spray bottle with cleaner has its own instructions.  Pretty simple--wet the tires with water, then spray on the cleaner, wait a few seconds, then rinse off the cleaner.  I was too lazy to drag out the hose.  I actually wetted the tires with a wet paper towel and rinsed the tires with another wet paper towel.  Worked fine, judging by my results (detailed below).**Applying the Tire Coat**The applicator sponge is pretty nifty.  I like the ""treads"" on it that are like tire treads.  They work perfectly to hold the coating solution, which is, as the packaging describes, very runny.  Soon, the sponge was saturated with the solution, which made applying it to my tires a snap.  I was impatient and worked on a couple of tires at a time, since you have to wait 10 minutes between coats.  I was pretty careful, but not careful enough, in applying the tire coat.  You'll learn more about this below.**Second Coating**Just like the first coating, the second one went on like a charm.  It couldn't have been much simpler.  I was around the car in just minutes, once the 10-minute wait time between coats had elapsed. By the way, my tires still looked wet when I put on the second coating, but I'm not sure if they were still wet or just looked wet.  It doesn't matter, though.  I was too impatient to wait for a dry tire before applying the second coat.**Cleanup**I noticed that I had dripped some of the black tire coating on the garage floor.  I went back and poured a little water from a bottle on each spot and wiped it up.  Unbeknownst to me, this was one of the smartest things I did.  Again, more on this below.**Results**The next day, I took my car through the car wash.  If this tire coating survived a wash and dry and looked awesome, then I would be a believer.  I went through the wash and dry, got out of my car, and gazed proudly at my very shiny black sidewalls.  Pretty cool, except I was also a bit shocked by something I hadn't expected.  See WARNING below.**WARNING: HEED THE NOTE IN FINE PRINT!**So, the one ding I will give this product has to do with the incredible sticking power of the tire coat to surfaces you do not want colored black.  When I got out of the car wash, I was disappointed to see that the drips and runs that I made on my alloy wheels by accident while coating my tires had not come off in the car wash, as I expected.  Oh well, I figured.  I would have to clean it off myself at home.  Another few days elapsed (now several days after the coating) before I had a chance to hand clean the wheels.  I started with a paper towel and some Windex.  In seconds, I knew that this was going to require something MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE.  In the end, it took about 30 minutes or work with a steel wool pad going around my car to get the drips and runs off my 4 alloy wheels.  Ugh!  I was sure that I did not read any such warning on the box, but I had saved the box.  I went back and read the box.  Nowhere in the ""Directions"" was this warning provided.  Not even in the ""PRO TIPS"" was this warning provided.  However, in fine print at the bottom of the box, there was a ""NOTE"" that read, in part, ""Wipe excess product from wheels immediately with a damp cloth.""  I sure wish that this had been more prominent on the box.  I would have avoided a lot of aggravation and wasted time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11Q3WSBXM4XDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOBSXQ0#wasThisHelpful","R11Q3WSBXM4XDH","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I believe it should be responsive to pressure, just like a pen. So, if I want to get a darker line, I should be able to just press harder. This was a key selling point for me on this stylus, and it was the key feature that I could not wait to test out.Overall, I have to admit that I am really impressed with this stylus, after using it. It does truly deliver on the pressure sensitivity it claims, and it feels natural. Unlike other styli I have used that oddly did not make the line appear directly below where the tip touches the screen, this one gets it right. The line is directly below the stylus tip, as you would expect. This makes writing feel just like writing on paper.As for other positives, I have several:+ Comfortable Grip: Rubberized grip section feels luxurious. I love it.+ High Tech USB Charger: Very cool magnetic USB charger included. Just plug in the USB charger, turn your stylus upside down, and sit your stylus on the magnetic USB charger. It quickly lights up to indicate it is charging. It will not tip over. The magnet is very strong.+ High Style: This is the coolest looking stylus I have ever seen. It will get attention. I am sure of it.+ Simple Setup: Took just seconds in Adobe Sketch to get it working perfectly.So, you wonder, why am I only giving it 4 stars. There are several negatives that I still see here, which make it impossible for me to give it 5 stars:- ONLY WORKS FULLY WITH 2 APPS: Yes, you read that correctly. I could hardly believe it myself. The pressure sensitivity does not work in my favorite tablet app for writing--Penultimate. Sure, you can use it without pressure sensitivity, but that's like driving a Porsche under 25 mph. I was so disappointed by this, though I know this is just temporary until more apps are developed to work with this advanced functionality. Right now, it works with Adobe Sketch and Adobe Line.- No Clip or Other Retention Feature: How in the world will I transport this stylus? It has no clip to hold my notebook or shirt. It has no magnet to hold it to my tablet computer. I hate to out it in my pocket. It is too nice, and I fear it will get scratched or broken in my pocket. This is a basic need that is left completely up to the buyer, and I don't like it. To make matters worse, it is completely round and prone to rolling around or off from a desktop.- Mysterious Shortcut Buttons: The manual describes how the buttons near the grip can be used for shortcuts. That is a mystery to me, as I found nothing about that when using Adobe Sketch.Congratulations to Adonit for making the best stylus I have ever used. Unfortunately, I still think it will get limited usage by me, due primarily to limited app compatibility (first drawback above). It won't be long before Adonit hits a grand slam. This one was an exciting triple to try out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T43B1E43TITL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFAG64O#wasThisHelpful","R3T43B1E43TITL","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She read this book, and the review is from her.Charlotte Caine decides to move back to her hometown of Hope's Crossing and run her candy store and live a simple life.  She has numerous friends and her father and brothers also live in town so it seems like the perfect idea.One day she runs into her old crush, Spence.  He had moved out of town and was playing professional baseball.  She thinks they have nothing in common and that he wouldn't even recognize her.  Little does she know that their lives would be connected in the most unusual way by the things she least expects.She is surprised by Spence's past but their is a twist to it towards the end of the book.

"We have 3 little rug rats at our house--twin 3-year-old girls and a 5-year-old boy.  They all love cool doodads, and this mat fit the bill quite well.  They all enjoyed using the magical markers that go on with invisible lines that instantly turn the color of the marker.  Very neat technology and worthy of some oohs and ahhs for our kids.  It's a sizable mat that allows all 3 of them to work at the same time.I would rate it 5 stars, but there were a couple of things that we would have liked to see improved:- Water Brush Eraser: This set comes with only 1 eraser, which would be fine for most households, I suppose, but in our household, one of anything equals a fight or two.  It would have been nice to have at least a couple of these erasers in the set.  Aside from having only 1 in the set, the eraser only works so-so in our judgment.  The cloth that comes with the set seems to erase better than the water brush eraser.  Ideally, we found that using the water brush eraser followed by the cloth is the best eraser combination, but that is a lot of work for little ones.- Cardboard Stencils: The stencils are neat, but there is no way they'll last more than a few weeks at our house, given that they are made out of cardboard that can be torn easily.  I wish they would have made these stencils out of plastic, which would be more rigid, waterproof, and tear-proof.  Oh well.  We'll enjoy the stencils while they last.Neither of the above concerns are significant in the overall scheme of things.  Our kids will enjoy playing with this set for some time, I believe, and we would definitely recommend it to others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30B5TAU6MXB1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K77WBJO#wasThisHelpful","R30B5TAU6MXB1O","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I typically buy Ziploc storage and freezer bags at my local club store, but they don't offer this type with the slider and gusseted bag bottom that allows the bag to stand up for filling. I must admit, I am more impressed than I thought I'd be with such subtle differences compared to what I usually use. The slider works like a charm--no double checking to make sure you have the zipper completely closed with your fingers. Just zip it and forget it. Silly as it might sound, my 3-year-olds prefer these, as well, since they don't need Mom or Dad to do the zipping for them. That's right, these sliders are so simple that my twin 3-year-olds can do them all by themselves. As for the gusseted bottom, that was an unexpected surprise. Yes, the idea of filling up a bag while it sits flat on a counter is novel. You are still going to want to hold onto the bag to make sure it doesn't get away from you, but this is a nifty added feature that takes away some of the challenge in filling a bag. I am quite certain that these bags are more expensive than the more basic ones that I usually buy, but if you don't use a lot of them, it might be worth the few extra cents per bag. We burn through bags like napkins in our household. We'll stick with the standard ones from the club store, until they begin offering this slider version. Then, I may pay a bit more and stock up on them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WFELNT9JICRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXCNRYO#wasThisHelpful","R2WFELNT9JICRA","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I paid over $700 for my iPad Air. I've tried a few different cases in it, and my favorite, by far, is the Aerb X case Aerb X Armor Series Shock Proof Case with Audio Amplifier Design for New iPad Air, Grey (X-I5). What do I think of this Kensington case? Well, let's just say it has a unique distinction. It is the only case I have ever refused to put on one of my electronic devices.  The entire inside back of the case is hard, textured plastic. That's right, you spend hundreds of dollars on an iPad, then you put a hard piece of textured plastic on the back of it to protect it.

"In the interest of full disclosure, my wife is the bookworm in the family. This is her review of the book under my pen name.Brett Bohlinger, 34, works in marketing at Bohlinger Cosmetics where her mother is CEO.  Her mother develops breast cancer and passes away.  As the majority shareholder, Brett is sure that her life is set and she will become CEO of the company and also inherit millions since the cosmetics company was very successful.At the reading of the will, Brett's two brothers are told what they will be receiving.  Brett gets nothing.  That is right.  Not a penny.  Instead she must complete a life list that she wrote when she was 14 in order to get her inheritance.  She had completed some items and then threw it in the trash.  Her mother found it and dug it out and the will requires that she complete the items that are left within one year.  Brett is stunned.  How could her mother do this to her?  They were so close and were the best of friends.Since Brett is single, she feels like she doesn't have much support in trying to complete many of the items on the list.  She does find some close friends going through the process of completing the items.  She also learns that life is not about money and more about the challenges we face and how experiences can make us better people.  Brett meets people that are in far worse situations than she is and actually realizes how good she has it.This is an excellent book.  There is some suspense wondering what her experience will be in trying to complete each item.  I truly enjoyed this book and did not want it to end.  The book flows smoothly and is wonderfully written.  I would also say that the ending is a surprise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R164ZUEEDBK1UC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345540875#wasThisHelpful","R164ZUEEDBK1UC","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The outside is made of semi-rigid material so it is quite durable.  There is a plastic sleeve that could hold a title page to indicate what is inside the binder.  There is a snap to close the cover.Inside the Trapper Keeper, there are two pockets on the left hand side of the binder to hold documents.  The pockets are only on the bottom.  I remember the old Trapper Keepers having a pocket on the top, side and bottom to prevent papers from falling out of the folder.  There is a 1.5 inch 3 ring binder on the inside.  The binder has 5 color coded, hard plastic dividers.  An elastic loop is attached on the inside for holding a pen.Overall, I really like this Trapper Keeper.  With a 1.5 inch binder, it can hold a lot of documents and I didn’t have to go out and buy dividers to organize my papers.  It would be nice if it did include the pockets on the top, side and bottom to prevent items from falling out though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R286EBBYNMPESM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O3GQ4E#wasThisHelpful","R286EBBYNMPESM","AKHFY3VCNZL2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKHFY3VCNZL2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very plush and great padding underfoot.  I bought this for a small bathroom, just because it looked acceptable and was inexpensive.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised when it arrived.  The color I got, Coffee, is a nice, rich brown.  But, most importantly, this is really a thick, comfortable memory foam rug.  It feels wonderful underfoot.  Yes, footprints show when you step on it - it is memory foam - but it springs back to its original shape quite quickly.

"I just ordered my third one of these.  The first one quickly broke - the prongs stopped folding down properly.  The company sent me a free replacement.  The replacement is still working great and I ordered a third as a preset.As others have noted in reviews, the prongs sometimes quit working and, if that happens, you lose the function of being able to use it without a separate charger cord and transformer.  I used the original for a while with an external charger cord and transformer.  Then it stopped holding a charge.  However, as I stated above, the replacement is still going strong after close to a year.I'm willing to try it again because I love the convenience of no extra cord - when it's working.

"My husband uses his iPad as a laptop, typing on it constantly.  I'm constantly looking for a paired keyboard which works well with it.  This finally seems to be what he needs.The design is very Apple-looking.  When attached to the iPad, it is a single, slim, Apple-silver unit.  The fit when closed is secure and the keyboard cover functions with the magnet in the iPad - just like Apple's cover - to put the iPad to sleep when closed.When opened, the keyboard has to be removed from the back hinge for use, but it sets up quickly and the back clip design is more secure than other keyboards he has tried.  The keyboard itself is also very Apple-like.  Not a large keyboard (given the size of the iPad it can't be), but the keys feel and function like a normal keyboard.

"This is formatted for Windows, but is still almost plug and play on my iMac. Anything with ""Apple"" on it seems more expensive, so I bought this, plugged it into my iMac, told it to format when I got the prompt, and it's working great. Plenty of room for Time Macine, plus full backup of my several thousand photos and Elements catalog - plus room to manually add a backup copy of my documents.I originally looked for a drive to use the ""faster"" Thundebolt connections. They are MUCH more expensive. And when I researched, they are no faster in practice if being used like this as a backup.  Although Thunderbolt can carry more data at a faster rate, the practical speed can't be faster than the external hard drive can write - no matter what the connection.  I'll save my money until a solid state external drive with Thunderbolt becomes affordable. That will be faster.I was a little concerned that I might have to stand this up as a mini-tower as shown in the pictures.  I have three large, energetic cats who might knock it over.  However, the vents are on the top, back and bottom of the unit as you are looking at the pictures.

"This just arrived today, and I've spent quite a bit of time with it trying to arrange lenses, filters.  Whether this bag will work for you will depend on your system and what you are looking for in a bag.For information, I have a Nikon D7000 and keep a fairly large 18-300mm lens with rubber hood on it.  For extra lenses, I have a Tokina ultra wide angle (medium size), a Nikon 35mm f1.8 (quite small) and an alternate Nikon 50mm low light lens (also quite small).  I only carry one of the small lenses at any time.  I normally keep the camera out of the bag so it is more easily accessible, but, occasionally, I want to be able to put it in the bag to protect from bad weather that blows up.  Then there are a couple of filters I always want with me, spare battery, extra lens caps and sometimes a flash.I can get all the gear I carry in the bag.  It is a pretty tight fit.  With the camera out, as it will usually be, there is actually too much room and I'd prefer something smaller - but then I don't have the option of putting the camera in a bag for weather protection.  Nothing is perfect.The bag comes with 4 padded dividers, which seems adequate.  I have lots of padded dividers from other bags over the years so that is not an issue for me.  The interior of the bag is well padded.  The 2 little pockets on the lid of the main section easily hold a memory card, although getting it out isn't easy.  My spare battery will fit in the larger of the 2, but I don't trust it not to fall out when I open the bag.  The front zipper compartment will hold filters and extra lens caps easily.  The compartment between the front zipper compartment and the main compartment actually IS a compartment.  It has sides (but they are rather low), is held securely by the front buckles and is roomy enough for lens caps, filters, cleaners, etc. The 2 mesh compartments at the ends are nice.  One has a circular bottom for a drink bottle; the other is smaller.  The straps at the bottom of the bag would work for a tripod or, more likely for me, a jacket.As for weather protection, it took a while to find the little rain cover under the velcro at the very front bottom of the bag.  When I did, however, I checked it out and verified it fits fine, even with the bag fully loaded.  However, I still need to work on repacking it to the smallest size.  It affects the size of the front zipper compartment and the compartment between the main body of the bag and the front zipper compartment.With my camera out, the bag is comfortable to wear.  With the camera in it, it is bulky and heavy.  If it is overloaded, it can tend to roll forward if the waist strap is not tight - and if it is tight you can't move the bag from back to front easily.In summary, I'm still not sure how well I like the bag for my uses and I could not make any recommendations to someone else - everyone's preferences are different.  I think it will probably be a good compromise for me between too small to actually hold a camera if necessary and too large to be usable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R250CDX8QUH3R8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016JA2W0#wasThisHelpful","R250CDX8QUH3R8","A1J7LKMZG3ZVLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J7LKMZG3ZVLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These provide some insulation and look beautiful doing it - unlike other insulated mugs.  The very first Bodum 10-ounce mugs I bought were a little fragile.  In the years since, Bodum has made the sturdier.  I had to drop a metal coffee pot on the last one I lost before it broke - and even then what happened was the 2 walls separated right at the seam at the top - no shattering.I am sold on these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36D1VRCOFZRIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JF9HPSM#wasThisHelpful","R36D1VRCOFZRIV","A1J7LKMZG3ZVLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J7LKMZG3ZVLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I previously bought one of the Dreams And Company sleep shirts which was just below knee length.  I loved it and bought several others.

I haven't had the nerve to dry them, but they have survived several washings with line drying and there is absolutely no shrinkage.  The colors stay bright.

"I've always used OtterBox - plain, sturdy and woks fine. I switched to this case for my new iPhone 6 because the description said it was lighter, less bulk and still good protection. I haven't tried dropping the phone to verify the protection, but it looks like good protection. Definitely lighter and less bulky. I'm not particularly crazy about the look of it, but I like the grip provided by the irregular shapes on the sides and back. The iPhone 6 with its curved edges can be slippery without a case.I almost took a star off for the screen protector. I'm a perfectionist and usually get screen protectors on very smoothly. This one ended up a mess and I ordered some replacement Halo protectos to replace it - the first of them went on fine.

"I bought this quite a while ago.  I carried it in my camera bag and used it only for the brush.  I was afraid to use the other end on my lenses.  Then, I was going to sell an old lens my husband had been using and discovered it covered in smudges.  I tried my usual cleaning with gentle breath and soft cleaning cloth.  Smudges still there.  I figured I had nothing to lose so I dug this out.  Took me a time or two to perfect the technique, but this sucker did seem to ""suck"" the smudges right off!  I would put it flat on a part of the lens, press it and roll it slightly to make sure I had good contact, then lift it.  By the time I finished, the lens was completely clean and the coating looked untouched.  I experimented a little and discovered it gently and effectively lifts off dust spots and the very, very hair that seems to land on a lens occasionally.  I could seem them on the black cleaner stick and blow them off.  I'm convinced.  It is worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PVDKEO67HTKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UJ2HVK#wasThisHelpful","R2PVDKEO67HTKX","A1J7LKMZG3ZVLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J7LKMZG3ZVLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this for a 72mm lens which goes from 18mm to 200mm.  It doesn't show in picutures if folded back all the way.  However, it can't be used as an hood - even at the first, shortest setting when you start unfolding it - at any wider angle than 35mm.  Below 35, you see the hood at the picture corners.  And if you extend it all the way, you really have to zoom out to avoid seeing the hood.I have an old, similar hood which is smaller, but even it cuts off corners below 20mm.For what it is, within those limitations, it is great.  I find it much more convenient than the hard plastic ""tulip"" hoods which come with my lenses.  When those are turned around to attach to the lens when not in use, they interfere with zoom and manual focus (which I need occasionally).  Despite the limitations, I'm keeping it and will use it.  I'm going to try it on a lens which has 67mm threads, with a step-up ring, and see if that helps some.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA7TE1WS1TO3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002K4L7XS#wasThisHelpful","RA7TE1WS1TO3C","A1J7LKMZG3ZVLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J7LKMZG3ZVLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bras used to be easy.  I was a 36C, pre-menopausal, in good shape woman.  But now, past menopause - with the resulting drooping - and carrying extra weight, I had just about given up on  finding a bra I really liked.  I wore sports bras, or terribly uncomfortable bras for as short a period as possible when I went out.  Until this bra.I now wear a 42D.  This one fits perfectly.  The cups are substantial enough to prevent nipples showing.  Much to my amazement, the bra is VERY comfortable with great support and shaping.  The underwire is very well padded and does not cause discomfort  The U back really seems to work.  I had been wearing racerback bras to keep straps on my shoulders, but that meant straps showed in boatneck blouses.  No more slipping straps, no more straps showing.  Because of my extra weight, I had a problem with uncomfortable, and unsightly, bulging at the back and sides of bras - but not with this one.I don't know yet how well the bras will hold up, and they are a little pricey to constantly replace.

After several months of not using Parallels - and realizing that I had to pay for yet ANOTHER upgrade of Parallels to use it with the latest free Apple OS update, I just removed Parallels.  Don't miss it a bit.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FEGA0IZ1GNA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FDK7J6#wasThisHelpful","R3FEGA0IZ1GNA2","A1J7LKMZG3ZVLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1J7LKMZG3ZVLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The large handle, extended strap to go around the bag, and the feature so that it beeps when the reading is complete then holds that reading for several seconds all make this luggage scale very easy to use.  I checked its accuracy against our very accurate bathroom scales and our accurate (large) meat scale.  It seems to be right on.I saw criticism of construction quality in other reviews so checked it carefully, expecting to have to do some repair on the stitching.  The item we received is well constructed.  I also saw criticism that the batteries did not last long.  The scale automatically turns itself off after a few seconds to conserve battery.  However, the on button is on the top of the handle so it could get turned on inside a suitcase - repeatedly - and run down the battery.  I made sure that wouldn't happen by saving the small plastic piece placed between battery and contacts which prevented it from being accidentally turned on in its original packaging.  It will be impossible for it to turn on accidentally in our luggage.

"If you want a smallish, cute water gun this is it.  If you want something a lot more fun, truly gets others wet, and holds more water, go with the one of hand pump action SuperSoakers.  At the same price point (~$10), you are MUCH better off getting the regular Scatterblaster, which a preschooler can easily use too).  This small squirter only lets out one little stream of water with decent range, fun to annoy, but doesn't do much outdoors.  The light is pretty bright, brighter than the Zombie Scatterblaster and uses 3 AAA batts in a rubber O-ring sealed orange compartment (under the nozzle).  Everytime you squirt, the palm of your hand will also push the light button as well.  This is convenient if you want the light effect, but after awhile it gets annoying since it digs into your palm repeatedly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P1AHTCHT8S6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXT4TP8#wasThisHelpful","R3P1AHTCHT8S6X","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well made product sturdy cup and baster with Tritan plastic, which is break and heat resistant.  This is BPA-free and was developed and marketed by Eastman Chemical (formerly Eastman Kodak) to great success.  However, if you google the plastic, there is a little controversy whether this is truly a ""harmless"" product.  Normally, I wouldn't care too much, but since this might hold hot oven temperature liquid, it is on my mind.The fat separator itself is easy to use with clean water.  But using actual oven roasted chicken/potatoes/rosemary sauce, it was frustrating.  With clean water, there is no leakage from the bottom of the cup with the silicone plug, and pours out great.  With actual chicken broth that was not see-through, the space between the silicone stopper and hole just wasn't big enough.  I had to use a chopstick to constantly stir things around to get the goodness to drip through.  Seemed like it took forever...  I eventually got through the whole container, and was pleased with the separated juice.  I merely wiped out the excess grease from the cup (not good for plumbing) and let it sit in soapy water before putting it in the dishwasher.  It cleans very easily.The baster is nicely made too.  The silicone bulb and tip both screw off easily for cleaning.  The bulb is very pliable and easy to squeeze.  It can easily fill up the entire baster (50 ml of liquid) with one squeeze.  This works beset with low particulate juice, like water/clear juice.  The holes on the end are small, which may not let you suction fast if you have a lot of fine particles in the juice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7M08RJBMWTK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WG6FQCI#wasThisHelpful","R7M08RJBMWTK9","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have lots of Melissa and Doug sets, and they are generally of good quality.  This set is probably not the best set IMHO.  The playdough is enough to play with for one sitting, but what you get in the four small containers is it.  You'll need to supplement with some extra Playdough.  The rollers have wooden handles, but the rollers themselves are made of plastic.  On the other M&D playdough set, they were all made of wood.  The plastic scissors work okay only if the dough is rolled thin.  Also, I like to use the Amazon packing paper as a table cover, but this playdough sticks to it.

With the right angle, I can launch an accurate good stream of water a good 40-60 feet (all the way to the end of a long pool), giving this the longest range by far of all the supersoakers.  The only drawback is it's a one shot deal, hence this is best as a pool toy.  You can also use a bucket in the back yard, but you're at a big disadvantage when you want to refill.  Ours has lasted through a full summer with no problem.  You cannot really find this in the store, and have to order online.  I got it for <$10/pack on sale by Amazon last year.ASIN: B00EAHXYG62.  Scatterblast Blaster, 22 oz.:  This is frequently on sale for $9 at Target and is normally priced at $10 full retail. There is plentiful supply and easy to buy.  It has a single nozzle that has 4 little holes around 1 bigger one.  The range is decent and the pump action is smooth.  This one is a favorite of my preschooler, which is not surprising considering how easy it is to hold and operate.  Even though the reservoir is on the smaller side, because it is a basic water gun with one nozzle, it actually lasts quite awhile before getting empty.  This is like a shotgun, scattering a decent amount of water over a wide area.  Overall, because of the low price point, durability, ease of use, and good soakage, this is my favorite of the pack outside of the pool (then it's the tube blaster).ASIN: B00EAHXWQI**  Barrage Soaker, 84 oz.:  This thing has a huge reservoir that allows you run around the yard with impunity.  The adjustable nozzle twists to select one of three settings, but the nozzle does not twist all the way around.  The 1st setting is a not-as-good version of the Scatterblaster (stream is so wide it devolves into three small streams and mist).  The 2nd setting is a regular steam with limited range.  The 3rd setting is a thinner steam goes much farther.  The money's at the 3rd setting, and it is very effective, especially if you can keep a good distance from your target.  The giant reservoir with the 3rd setting combines for a fearsome combo in a water gun.  This gun is best for older kids (at least upper elementary) as it is pretty heavy when full.ASIN: B00EAHXYHU3.  Double Drench Blaster, 27 oz.:  This water gun is a lot of fun with it's double barrel multi hole goodness.  It has good range and great spread of water as expected.  You don't have to be accurate at all.  In fact, you probably don't even have to look when you fire.  You'll hit something...  You might feel like a bad boy walking around with this double barreled saw off shotgun water toy.ASIN: B00EAHXYPC** Floodfire Blaster, 43 oz:  This thing holds quite a bit of water.  It fires a single large stream of water at long range, but you have to hold the trigger down AND use the pump action.  This is because it also connects to a garden hose and the trigger releases the pressure from the hose for ultimate range and unlimited soakage.  The hose connector works well and is a quick on/off twist. It's nice to just connect and fill up fast.  However, why use this with a hose when you have a Flippin' HOSE at your disposal?!  I'd much rather drop this on the ground and pick up the actual hose if I'm really getting mobbed. Another thing, it's heavy when fully loaded.  My 8 y/o complained about it after awhile.  It does hold a lot of water and the thick stream has good range, so buy it for that, not the hose function.ASIN: B00MXT4T94** Flashflood Blaster, 23oz.:  This water gun is truly unique as it combines a Scatterblaster with a Tube on top.  If you want to be conservative, just use the pump action scatterblaster.  But sometimes you just really need to drench the other person, and the tube is perfect for that.  You have to have to be careful, though since the tube will use up the standard size reservoir pretty fast.  The Scatterblaster and Tube both have decent range.  But the tube is a little awkward to use and doesn't push in as straight as the Tubeblaster, so you do not get anywhere the speed nor range of the regular Tubeblaster.  However, you do have a portable resevoir so you can venture away from the pool with this one.  The model leaks a lot of water when full, so be careful if you're filling it up in the house.ASIN: B00MXT4SZ4** Zombie Strike Scatterblast Blaster, 35 oz: A cousin of the Scatterblast blaster, but the light is superfluous.  The battery compartment has a rubber O-ring to keep it dry (3 AAA batts).  I wouldn't bother, the light is so weak, especially in daytime.

"This set comes via freight service.  They'll call you to arrange a delivery window that suits your schedule.  Two boxes were delivered in good shape.  There were black shoe prints all over my boxes, but nothing was damaged inside.  The edges of the box were all reinforced with stiff cardboard edgers which really help with protection, yet are recyclable.  Great move by the company to keep the contents in good shape without a ton of Styrofoam(though there is some still in there for padding).  When I opened up the boxes, which were not terribly heavy, I expected to have the chemical smells from the Malaysian manufacturing plant waft out of the box, but this set actually smelled pretty neutral.  Nevertheless, I let it sit out for a few hours before I brought the pieces inside to assemble.I took some pictures of the assembly manual so readers could get an idea of the setup involved and if they would want to do that for this bed.  This is not just a headboard that needs a metal base, but has a full slat system that you have to assemble yourself.  The pieces are light though, and I think this can be done by most people by themselves, though two people obviously goes faster.  The quality of the materials are actually really great.  Hardwood supports, and the slats are quality thick plywood that are sanded smooth (came bundled nicely).  I was impressed. The leather is prefect and seams are straight down on the headboard.Once assembled, it is a handsome bed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZR56ODWSNHRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIONPMA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZR56ODWSNHRN","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Best feature of this pencil sharpener is the auto-stop.  That ensures that you're not oversharpening the pencil and wasting wood/lead.  I tested it on quite a few pencils from the school designs ones, regular yellows, and colored pencils.  Always a good tip at the end.  The shavings trap is very easy to pop out and dump, and leaves barely any mess.  In fact, the thing is so small, you can just put the whole thing over the trashcan before you tap out the trap to make sure that you don't get wayward shavings on your desk.I recommend holding a little pressure directly downward as you sharpen.  Otherwise, the pencil has a tendency to move around a little and your point will be off-center.  Also, the base will move around as well if you don't apply a little direct downward pressure via the pencil.The motor is powered by 4 AA batteries.  You have to set your expectations accordingly.  This is not a loud, wall plug in, heavy base, super motor model like school ones.  It's compact and runs on batteries, so the motor can only be so powerful.  For some, it may seem way underpowered.  But it gets the job done reasonably well.  You might spend literately 1-2 more seconds sharpening, but unless you have a whole boat-load of pencils to sharpen as a hapless underpaid intern, it's inconsequential.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UJEQSSNZRGG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHVICR0#wasThisHelpful","R3UJEQSSNZRGG7","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I compared this router to the Verizon Actiontec FIOS router (only 2.4 Ghz) and a Linksys 6350AC router (2.4/5Ghz, AC).I was instantly pleased when I opened the box.  The build quality is very nice and solid.  There are vent holes all around the body that keep the unit noticeably cooler than the 6350AC.  It, however, is quite a bit larger and blockier looking.  It looks like a much bigger version of the much older ubiquitous WRT54.Setup was not a breeze.  While my cellphone (HTC One) instantly found the router setup page (which loaded automatically), setup got hung up twice.  I don't know if this was a problem with the router or my cellphone, which is a admittedly a little quirky with WIFI connections lately.  I resorted to hardwiring the router into my desktop, and that worked like a charm.  The configuration page of the WRTAC1200 is basically the same as the 6350AC, which is excellent.  It's very easy to navigate and get to the options you need to modify from basic to advanced settings.  I plugged a Sandisk 3.0 USB drive in the back, and it was easy to find.Using app WIFI Analyzer on my  cellphone, the WRT1200AC has the strongest signal of all when I'm in the same room as the router, even better than the 6350AC, and definitely better than the Actiontec.  However, climbing the stairs to the opposite corner of the house, the advantage starts to dissipate as the signals start to become more uniform in strength at the 2.4 Ghz band.  This is not surprising as the 5Ghz connection is for speed closer to the router while the 2.4 Ghz is more for a good connection at a distance.  The 5Ghz connection is also to help avoid interference from other devices in the home.  You can find a list of devices and easy to read explanation on Wikipedia when you search for ""what devices use 2.4 GHz bandwidth"".  Baby monitors, Microwaves, and even Bluetooth are all culprits.  Current cellphones have AC wireless standard, and that is definitely a worthwhile upgrade if you have an older router that doesn't have have AC wireless and you do heavy data activity like streaming and uploading/dowloading lots of pictures and files.I also took a picture of the back of the box, so you can see the differences between the routers.  As you can see, the main differences in the routers (besides the current  $70 price differential) are specs that pros care about more (of which I'm not one).  For normal residential use, the extras of WRTAC1200 should not make much of a difference and the 6350AC will give you savings and great performance already.  But for those that desire just a little more power & have tons of streaming devices to link, this router will will be very pleasing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D30MVMFLAO5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN20T0#wasThisHelpful","R1D30MVMFLAO5H","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perfect pool toy.  Just dip in the water and pull to load  Since you're at the pool already, you never have to worry about running out of water.  This is one of preschooler's favorite water toys, and he can fill it up by himself and squirt with ease.  My wife has to be careful since he can be a little mischievous at times, and this toy can get you soaked REALLY fast.  An adult can get ~40-60 feet of stream, no problem.I also bought a bunch to use at my older kid's birthday party in the yard with buckets.  The other water guns could not compare when it came time to get wet.No leaks, held up all summer very well despite being treat roughly as outdoor play items.  I stored them over the winter in the garage and plan to pull them out again soon for more fun this summer.  I paid <$10/pack on sale for them last year.(We also have other water guns.  Another really good one to get is the Nerf Scatterblast Blaster.)UPDATED:We have 7 different NERF Supersoaker models for a total of 10.  We like to use ours around the pool and the backyard for super wet fun.  We have tried other brands of water guns from other makers, but NERF seems to make the best ones generally speaking.I wrote my take on each model, but put my top two favorites for OVERALL performance (ASIN# used to facilitate looking it up on Amazon website).1.

Scatterblast Blaster, 22 oz.:  This is frequently on sale for $9 at Target and is normally priced at $10 full retail. There is plentiful supply and easy to buy.  It has a single nozzle that has 4 little holes around 1 bigger one.  The range is decent and the pump action is smooth.  This one is a favorite of my preschooler, which is not surprising considering how easy it is to hold and operate.  Even though the reservoir is on the smaller side, because it is a basic water gun with one nozzle, it actually lasts quite awhile before getting empty.  This is like a shotgun, scattering a decent amount of water over a wide area.  Overall, because of the low price point, durability, ease of use, and good soakage, this is my favorite of the pack outside of the pool (then it's the tube blaster).ASIN: B00EAHXWQI**  Barrage Soaker, 84 oz.:  This thing has a huge reservoir that allows you run around the yard with impunity.  The adjustable nozzle twists to select one of three settings, but the nozzle does not twist all the way around.  The 1st setting is a not-as-good version of the Scatterblaster (stream is so wide it devolves into three small streams and mist).  The 2nd setting is a regular steam with limited range.  The 3rd setting is a thinner steam goes much farther.  The money's at the 3rd setting, and it is very effective, especially if you can keep a good distance from your target.  The giant reservoir with the 3rd setting combines for a fearsome combo in a water gun.  This gun is best for older kids (at least upper elementary) as it is pretty heavy when full.ASIN: B00EAHXYHU**  Double Drench Blaster, 27 oz.:  This water gun is a lot of fun with it's double barrel multi hole goodness.  It has good range and great spread of water as expected.  You don't have to be accurate at all.  In fact, you probably don't even have to look when you fire.  You'll hit something...  You might feel like a bad boy walking around with this double barreled saw off shotgun water toy.ASIN: B00EAHXYPC** Floodfire Blaster, 43 oz:  This thing holds quite a bit of water.  It fires a single large stream of water at long range, but you have to hold the trigger down AND use the pump action.  This is because it also connects to a garden hose and the trigger releases the pressure from the hose for ultimate range and unlimited soakage.  The hose connector works well and is a quick on/off twist. It's nice to just connect and fill up fast.  However, why use this with a hose when you have a Flippin' HOSE at your disposal?!  I'd much rather drop this on the ground and pick up the actual hose if I'm really getting mobbed. Another thing, it's heavy when fully loaded.  My 8 y/o complained about it after awhile.  It does hold a lot of water and the thick stream has good range, so buy it for that, not the hose function.ASIN: B00MXT4T94** Flashflood Blaster, 23oz.:  This water gun is truly unique as it combines a Scatterblaster with a Tube on top.  If you want to be conservative, just use the pump action scatterblaster.  But sometimes you just really need to drench the other person, and the tube is perfect for that.  You have to have to be careful, though since the tube will use up the standard size reservoir pretty fast.  The Scatterblaster and Tube both have decent range.  But the tube is a little awkward to use and doesn't push in as straight as the Tubeblaster, so you do not get anywhere the speed nor range of the regular Tubeblaster.  However, you do have a portable resevoir so you can venture away from the pool with this one.  The model leaks a lot of water when full, so be careful if you're filling it up in the house.ASIN: B00MXT4SZ4** Zombie Strike Scatterblast Blaster, 35 oz: A cousin of the Scatterblast blaster, but the light is superfluous.  The battery compartment has a rubber O-ring to keep it dry (3 AAA batts).  I wouldn't bother, the light is so weak, especially in daytime.

"Feeder came perfectly packaged.  It was very easy to setup and hang.  One packet for red colored nectar was included (makes 8 oz) which fills 2/3 of the reservoir.  It does come with a little metal S hook which you may have to look for.  Still looking for hummingbirds, but some of my other seed feeders took a month before the birds found them.  I may move it to another location after one more week.Edit:  the hummingbirds have found the feeder!Actually, I was most interested in comparing my experience with setup with others who had problems:1.  Leaks:  No leaks for me.  The only time it leaked was when I flipped the feeder around to hang it after screwing the reservoir to the base, and even then, only minimal (so obviously, flip the feeder outside).  I checked the concrete under the feeder for days and I don't see anything there.  However, if the feeder is tipped quite a bit (like a squirrel or heavy wind), some nectar will flow out of the ""flowers"" as planned.2.  Extra insects:  I hung it high up off a deck rafter.  Haven't seen any bees nor swarms of ants.  There are plenty of them in the yard, but I guess they haven't found it yet, or it's it's too high for them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32AT17T3UM0YO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBFYT3A#wasThisHelpful","R32AT17T3UM0YO","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wrote an easy to read Amazon review of the newer version RX100 MII camera.  But I really started with this, the original version, until it got lost, about 2 years ago.  I liked it so much, I replaced it with the RX100 MII as it just came out.  However, the two cameras are fairly similar.  Both utilize the same size awesome sensor and both have full auto - manual controlability.  At a lower price point, the MI original may make the better deal.  Both cameras were heavily used and abused and they showed it, but still functioned perfectly.  That's a testament to the build quality.  So if you're wondering if you should spring ~$150 more for the newer (2 years old now) camera, or ~$350 more for the newest MIII, just know that it's not a big upgrade and maybe you'll want to save some money and still get a great camera by going with the original.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T0IZ1O6LMUO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00889ST2G#wasThisHelpful","R1T0IZ1O6LMUO4","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...and it is an awesome camera.I actually had the original RX100, which either got stolen or recycled.  Either way, I had to get a new one and the MII just came out.  Me, my wife, and my preschooler are the main users of this camera.  Preschooler you say?  Yes, he likes to take pictures and for some reason I let him use this $750 (back then) camera despite it flying in the face of reason.  This camera goes all over house, outside, purse, pitched around the car, dropped on the floor.  It's tough.  It's shows it's battlemarks on on the view screen and body, but the lens is pristine and the camera works flawlessly.  So 5 stars for toughness.Picture quality is superb mainly because SONY makes pretty good cameras and has experience writing the processing firmware coupled with an outsized sensor for the camera size.  The sensor really is much bigger than other P&S and it allows much better indoor shots.  With the compact and easy portability, it's often the first camera we pick up when take impromptu shots indoors or go on trips.  If I know that I'm going somewhere for serious pictures, then I go for the 4/3 cameras that otherwise mostly sit around.  Colors are good, sharpness is great.  There is a little bit of the big-nose effect that is hard to avoid with small cameras like this.Compared to the original version of this camera, it's really not that much better overall.  If you can get a screaming good price on the MI, then I suggest going for that instead.  Right now, the price difference as sold by Amazon is about $150.  The newest MIII is around $200 more than this middle one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25YA7POZXHM1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DM8R866#wasThisHelpful","R25YA7POZXHM1Y","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No kidding.  Even though egg is one of it's ""main active"" ingredients, it's actually smells quite good.  Lots of minty and essential oil type smells.  They do not recommend spraying near food plants, but if you look at the ingredient lists, it's looks pretty ""natural"" to me.  No weird chemicals in there.The black handle has a pull out suction loader, and then you press the trigger to release until the handle is empty.

"Sweet keyboard.  It's very solid when folded (2 folds like putting a letter size paper in an envelope).  Even the back is made of brushed aluminum.  However, there is a lot of give in the keyboard, such that I would not recommend using in your lap or on a bed (or other soft surfaces like those).  It's best to use it on a desk where the give lessened.  Otherwise, the keys are easy to push and work great.

"Nice regular size power squirter.  The container is very soft and easy to squeeze, but seems durable enough to get tossed around the field/gym bag/playground without worry. The mouth is big enough to easily throw in a bunch of ice cubes to keep things extra cool.Once washed out, fresh water tasted good, like water.  If I let the bottle sit outside all day, then it did pick a little plasticky taste. which was not unexpected (not much worse than a plastic water bottle from Costco).  It's labeled as BPA free, and so you can feel good about one less chemical that might leach into your drink on a hot day.The top is kinda fancy, but it works very well.  It has a silicone stopper cut in a ""x"" hole.  It works very well to keep liquids in even when the spout is open and I'm shaking it upside down (water).  I haven't tried it on carbonated beverages since I really don't drink fizzy stuff when it's not in a can.  We'll see how long the silicone stopper keeps it's integrity, but other products that use a similar silicone stopper system seem to last long term for me.The spout pops up easily with a simple push of a button.

"First question people are thinking is probably ""is this sturdy?"".  YES.  My preschooler and toddler like to step and walk on it to get to the other side.  This hasn't warped the top board and everything works just fine.  There are two braces underneath the board.Play:  The action is pretty good for such a small surface area, and delights little kids.  The pucks and pushers slide pretty easily without catching anywhere on the board and ricochet well.  The only thing is, there is no lift in the 4 corners, so the puck will get stuck there if it ends up there (-1 star).Practicality:  The low profile means I can store this under a bed.  We play on carpet, and the fan has no problem sucking up air and providing lift for the puck.

"For $60 on Woot/Amazon, I thought ""why not?"".  I've known about Lytro since a couple of years ago when the buzz was starting to build up prior to their first product launch.  I thought the premise of a modern implementation of light field photography was really interesting and very exciting.  The first cameras (this one) were very expensive.  I'm not sure it ever really caught on since I've never seen one used and these cameras are now on Woot (basically clearance).The good things:* Camera is lightning fast to start up (practically instantaneously).* Fairly easy to use controls (note: zoom is on the silicone above the screen, not the screen itself).* Updates for the software and camera firmware installed easily and quickly.* Interesting shape and gets people curious when you are taking pictures.* Software has features for adjustment, playback, and even 3D (red/cyan, or double picture).The bad things:* Even on optimal sunny outdoor shots, a lot of pictures still didn't turn out well.  There is a bit of bleeding between shadows and light, some of the eyes of of my subjects would turn into blobs.  Pictures still look soft.* Indoor shots and outdoor dusky shots yielded grainy photos.* Perspective with trees is messy.  This can be understood as tree branches do not line up uniformly in a plane.* The vast majority of the pictures you take don't even come close to what is seen on the Lytro website.  Don't be fooled since those photographers have probably set everything ""perfect"" for a good Lytro type shot.  I still don't know how they got such good resolution on those pictures as the resolution on my pictures seem like they were taken with a 1 MP camera from last decade...* Lytro turtorials and products are centered on the Illum.  This product is practically forgotten already.* The lens cap is neat, but the magnet is too weak and it keeps on falling off when you put it in your pocket.In the end, I, like many others on Amazon who have reviewed this camera, feel underwhelmed.  I haven't decided if I should return this camera or keep it as a ""toy""... a curiosity item.  Maybe the Illum is much better since it seems to have about 4x the ""resolution"" according to their website.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16ZN3XA667WOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AR7QGRM#wasThisHelpful","R16ZN3XA667WOJ","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Currently I STOCKPILE Bounty (green wrapper) paper towels.  But I also have some Brawny and generic store brands around my house as well.  My household goes through a crazy amount of paper towels (hey, I have three kids) and we use them to clean little and big spills, wrap all kinds of things, cover items in the microwave, and as napkins.  I have no problem reusing a paper towel pieces laying around on the floor or the table if I need one quick, so I need them to be very sturdy.Bottom line:  These Basic edition will do the job but I won't be buying them.Basic 12=15 rolls.Green Select-a-size 12=20 rollsThe finer points:These feel cheap, rough, wrinkly, and the rolls have lots of air in between the sheets.  The packaging is almost misleading since if you squeezed the air out of the rolls, you could probably compress the whole thing 25% or more.  They are decently strong, even when wet, but you do not get a feeling of very high quality when using them.  Even generic store paper towels feel better than these.  All the down sides would be okay if the price was low.  But the price on Amazon currently (~$35 for 2 packs) is more than what I paid at Target for two LARGER packs of Bounty green Select-a-size rolls this spring.** If you want something quite a bit better, and more economical, go with the Bounty Green Select-a-size rolls.  The sheets are perforated at the halfway point, so you can use 1/2 or 3/2 sheets if you want.  We often just grab a 1/2 sheet at a time, and the rolls last way longer compared to pulling a full sheet every time.

"I'm giving this set 5 stars on one quality alone:  it's a true ambidextrous set.  Using your R or L hand are equally easy to cut paper and cardboard.  A lot of scissors that are labeled as ambidextrous are really good with R hand use, but leaving the L hand lacking (either in comfort or cutting ability).  So I applaud this set for making it imperceptible which hand I'm using to cut.But there are other things that not so good about this set, and really are 2-3 star.  The build quality of the set is really variable.  Some scissors were totally awesome and opened and closed very smoothly with little effort.  Some scissors were mediocre and either were too tight or too loose to open and close.  Some had very smooth cutting edges.  Some had very rough cutting edges that made them harder to open and close.  For little hands who don't have a lot of power nor dexterity yet, the bad scissors are a real disservice.  I'd like to say that the bad scissors were rare, but quite a few of the scissors in the set were sub-par.

"The actual housing of the feeder itself is very attractive and clear/clean plastic.  The suction cups, however, not so much so.  When I first took it out of the box, they looked old (white discoloration, like old plastic) and felt stiff.  But, after cleaning the window and the cups with a little Windex, they seem to be okay.  The bottom cup definitely sticks better than the top cup.  So far in sun, rain, and direct sunlight, the feeder has stayed plastered to my window.  They don't look as good from the back side, and if the manufacturer would switch the sourcing of the suction cups, it would make the whole unit look better out of the box.I put sunflower seed in my feeder, though you can also do thistle with the included adapters.  It also comes with a small wooden perch if you elect thistle seeds.  The package says that once you pick the type of seed, it's permanent.  However, I was easily able to attach and detach the sunflower adapters that have small built in perches.  I didn't try the thistle as I definitely don't plan on using that seed.

"Don't be daunted by the sheer size and weight of the box.  Once you unpack and separate out the pieces, it turns into a more normal sized kitchen appliance.  But, so much better quality than what you might typically purchase.  The stainless steel components and heft really make you feel like you just bought something of quality and longevity, unlike so many kitchen appliances sold these days.The quality of construction and generously powerful motor makes pretty much all kitchen tasks easy.  It's particularly evident when you are using the dough hook and need little more power than the average mixer.  The test I haven't got a chance to run was ice in the blender since my ice maker is currently broken, but from how it's handled everything else, I don't think that's going to be a problem.My only quibbles are twofold:1.  Using the food processor/blender attachments is kinda weird since they attach at the top of the machine.  In fact, shorter people will not like this or may just deal with it and get a step stool.  Tall people may actually like this, since it'll be more at their level.2.  It's too heavy to put away.  Our KA mixer has it's spot in a cabinet to keep the counter space uncluttered.  You're probably not going to want to do that with the hefty Kenwood, so scope out a permanent spot for it before you buy.  On the other hand, the Kenwood is really a space saving 3 in 1 machine.Fortunately, I have a short empty minicounter in my kitchen as well, and may just stick the Kendwood there as it's resting home, which takes care of both minor inconveniences.  I don't mind leaving it out since it's such a good looking appliance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IWGWHXT98ERX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYFICRO#wasThisHelpful","R1IWGWHXT98ERX","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a USB mouse with a generous braided cord (with velcro cord band too!).  It's truly plug and play, no software/drivers are needed nor included. Hooray!  The polling and DPI switches are hardwired in the mouse itself.  I actually like that since I hate loading extra drivers for keyboards and mice.  This makes this mouse exceedingly simple to set up and use. I need the mouse mostly for cursor movement and plot everything out on the keyboard (I don't want the mouse to morph into a keyboard too).  That said, there are not a whole lot of buttons on this mouse relative to other slightly more expensive gaming mice.  I guess this will depend on your setup style.  The scroll wheel is quick and sits right below your middle phalanx of your finger.  I wished they moved it ever slightly more forward so that I could move the wheel with the tip of my finger more easily.  Major surfaces are coated with a thin silicone layer that helps grip and feels good.  I have small to average size hands, and the mouse is comfortable for me.  People with large hands should probably look elsewhere.  Overall, this mouse has a very nice quality feel.In terms of performance, I found it to be VERY accurate, fast gliding, and decently light.  Some gamers like the control of DPI on the fly switching.  I was never into that, and so I'm fine with the switches on the *bottom* of the mouse.  Switch choices are Polling 125, 500,1000 Hz and DPI 500, 1000, 1750.I also recently reviewed an fantastic mouse pad from Turtle Beach as well, which would go well with this mouse if you want a nice gaming duo.(Previous mice = Various Logitech optical and laser, MSFT gaming mouse)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36SGC25TAPSYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJH1EOM#wasThisHelpful","R36SGC25TAPSYM","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So easy to setup.  So easy to use.  The filter is set at it's height just below the spout, no adjustment like a regular french press mechanism.  However, that's perfectly fine as the whole point of the filter is to filter out the solids, and this works well for that purpose.  Whether the solids stay on top or bottom is not terribly consequential.  However, it does look better to have stuff at the bottom, because sometimes things stick to the sides when only half full, and it doesn't present as well per se.  Also, as can be seen from the picture, it'd be impractical to have a metal rod that long.The glass is relatively thin for a pitcher, but what's what I expect from borosilicate glassware.

You also put your arm through the rear hole so that your left forearm can act as a brace to counter the ""heft"" of the full hopper.  It's a great design that makes holding this for long periods of time very easy.

"This is a very nice unit with solid build quality.  The cuff is very simple to insert in the machine and is very comfortable to wear.  Initially, I was wondering why the cuff has such a stiff built in roll, then I realized that it makes putting on and strapping the cuff much easier to do with one hand.  The buttons are solid and easy to push.  The instructions are spot-on.  The wall adapter has enough length to leave it comfortably on a desk if the outlet is not too too far away; the batteries (4 AA) option is great for travel.  It stores 100 measurements per person (2 people = 200) that is also portable via Bluetooth to your smartphone (easily found on Google Play store, but not on Amazon store).

"This is a fairly sturdy gate, a bit short, but fully capable of holding back a toddler from escaping.  It came well packed, no scuff marks, and with all the pieces, including drywall screws (x4).  The instructions were clear, but if you only go by the pictures, it'll be a bit confusing from the way they draw the gate pieces.  Just make sure to look at the ""letter"" parts and then you should have no problem putting the gate together in the configuration that you want.The auto close works as advertised by a small plastic piece in the shape of the triangle at the hinge.  If the door is open all the way to flat part of the triangle, the gate will stay open.  If you open it up only to the slanted part of the triangle, the gate will close by itself.  This works whether you open the gate towards or away from yourself.My qualms with the gate are two fold:1.  It's not as quiet as advertised.  I thought that it would be a soft closing sound, but instead it's a fairly loud clank as the plastic lock engages.  It is quieter than the Summer Infant full metal gate when it closes hard, but not by much.2.  The colors are kinda ugly.  Who has dark wood and grey metal on a staircase or wall?

"Upfront, the Rapesco is a totally awesome stapler and deserves a 5/5 star rating.  I recommend using Rapesco staples for best results, but you can get by with that ol' box of Swingline staples if needed.I tried stapling cardstock, thin cardboard, Amazon box cardboard, and regular old copy paper folded to multiple sheet thickness (from 2 up to 16 sheet thickness).The Rapesco has the best finish of all the staplers, and generally speaking also requires the least exertion to staple besides the Swingline Lighttouch.  The best finish is because as I felt the back of the staple, you can feel the bumps of the Swingline staples (which got my finger sore after all this trialing) versus the flat Rapesco stapler's finish.  Even when you pull the pages apart, the Swingline curved staples jut out just a bit more.Rapesco has a nice gentle spring for loading staples.  It also comes with small piece that sits on top of the staple refill so that it stays in position as the handles closes.  This is in stark contrast to the Swingline staples which have a very strong spring that snaps shut really fast and hard; sometimes the staples do not sit right during closure.  Also, if you get your finger tip accidentally caught when the handle comes to close on the Swingline, it hurts like a b****.The Swingline Lighttouch was by far and away the EASIEST stapler to use (in terms of pressure needed to staple) but it is a bit bigger than the Raspesco and of course doesn't leave the staples nice and flat on the back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13QMCJ8AMQN0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WNNSWI#wasThisHelpful","R13QMCJ8AMQN0V","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Braven is really going gung-ho in making high quality, well thought out speakers lately.  In fact, it's rare to find such incredibly good packaging and thoughtful design in equivalent tier speakers or even ones that cost a bit more.What lies inside a regular cardboard box will probably leave you pretty impressed, and that's before you even turn it on.Packaging:  First off, it comes nicely protected in thick Styrofoam casing, with two solid plastic clip straps that make sure they stay together.  It's probably more for stylistic points, but it looks nice and you can certainly find other uses for the two straps.Accessories:  Wow, I couldn't believe my eyes, INTERNATIONAL PLUG adapters.  So, if you want to host your pool party or pick an extra contractor job in Europe, you're set...  I figure Bravia just wanted to ship one unit internationally, and the cheapest way to do that for them was to include the major adapters needed.  The adapters are tips only, and easily snap into the back of the wall-wart.  A 3.5 inch AUX cable and Micro-USB cables are included as well.Build quality:  Top-notch.  The silicone casing is thick and basically perfect all around.  The only break in the silicone is the side panel where you access the plugs.  That panel is perfectly smooth and flat when closed.  The speakers have a nice brushed aluminum finish, non-glossy.  Small LEDs for the battery level are perfectly aligned and just bright enough. Overall, it's feels like a quality piece in your hands.Bluetooth paring:  Easy and picks up every time.  With direct line of sight, I was able to get 180-200 feet away down my driveway before the music started to break-up.  For pool parties, and especially contractor jobs, it's nice to have that range of movement.Sound quality:  For a 2 hands size speaker, they are pretty good.  The bass is certainly lacking on my HTC One phone with Beats Audio, but an EQ app is able to increase the bass response.  At high volumes, the bass can majorly distort, no surprise there.  The mids are stand out and are very clear and clean, even blasting the speaker at high volume.  So vocals are easily heard and distinguished even at very high volumes.""Extra benefits"":  Water resistance.  Shock absorbing silicone exterior that is also slip resistant.  This thing will even charge your phone/tablet.  So, it becomes a portable battery as well, may be good for those who get a lot power outages.  Maybe your phone is running out of juice at the party/work site and you just happen to have this speaker around!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14HRBONY2I281/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SU3XOI4#wasThisHelpful","R14HRBONY2I281","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really nice quality.  Thin, yet effective as pot holders.  I also have the red silicone gloves, but they are much bulkier to use.  The caveat is for deep or top ovens, the silicone gloves cover your wrists and part of your forearms as well.

"This is a very slick looking headset.  Aesthetically, I'd give it five stars.  It's also super light and flexible which makes you forget that you're even wearing it.  I got the hang of the controls after wearing it just once.  Basically, volume and talk on L, music controls on the R.  The buttons are easy to find and push with tactile feel while wearing the headset.It paired up with my HTC One phone with no problem, and repeated pairings were no hassle.  I just turn the headset on and it connects without problem.Listening to music was a pleasure, though I had to boot up a EQ program on my phone to glean a little extra bass out.  Various types of music were clear and vocals were decent.  I'd say these compare favorably to other $20-40 dedicated headphones.  Very decent, even sound.  And when you're done, the buds magnetically pop into holding position at the end of the headset.  It's nice not to have a dangling cord.Talking on the phone was very easy, if a little clunky dialing out using Android.  Voices were crystal clear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK95EEU98WE96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FO0IHMY#wasThisHelpful","RK95EEU98WE96","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best feature of this toy is the portability.  It's easy to stack the cups within each other and pop the top on.  A small twist and the top is fairly secure, making this a truly portable toy that fits easily in a purse or diaper bag.As far as stacking goes, you're acutally better off with the traditional FP rings on a pole for little ones.  The Playskool version cups are easy to grap and stacks easily, but do not have a lot of lip on them.  Little 9 months old babies at the beginning stages of learning how to stack are not going to be able to stack CAREFULLY and PRECISELY enough and will topple this set a lot and probably not get much past 2-3 cups stacked until they are a bit older.One solution:  The middle of each cup has a cutout shape, and if you put a chopstick in the middle that will provide a little support to stack all the cups without completley toppling over.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3026XMHGVV26T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3T3GSS#wasThisHelpful","R3026XMHGVV26T","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Same prep time, and the noodles came out perfectly.  No broken pieces and no excessive stickiness.  Tastes what you expect multigrain pasta to taste like with all the extra nutritional benefits.  The texture is just slightly chewier than regular semolina pasta.When you look at the nutritional information, note that you should look at the 2 oz servings info, as that is the usual serving size on other boxes of pasta (they list a whopping 17 g of protein... but then it's for 3.5 oz serving).  Also, it's pretty good on vitamin nutrition for pasta, but not so so much better than an ""enriched"" pasta product.  The fiber % is basically double, though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QRTRNCDTO2X3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBKA33K#wasThisHelpful","R3QRTRNCDTO2X3","A1HFT68GJ42LTM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HFT68GJ42LTM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you aren't an experienced gamer or you're planning to introduce this to casual gamers or nongamers who are interested in the GoT franchise, be aware that this isn't a true ""gateway"" game like Catan or Ticket to Ride, etc. The rules are not overly complex, but they do take some focus to learn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NEJ5VD5QTHCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633441903#wasThisHelpful","R2NEJ5VD5QTHCN","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Extraordinarily lightweight and easy to maneuver on 4 wheels (upright) or 2 (tilted).  I wish there was an external compartment like some hardside suitcases for easier access to small items, but the inside storage is excellent.  One side has clip straps and the other a zippered section, so it's pretty easy to segregate clothes by type or by clean/dirty.  There also is a small internal zippered pouch which is good for storing small electronics or toiletries.

"Very convenient and easy to use.  The initial setup process is super easy, and the headphones themselves talk you through the process.  It took my wife around 20 seconds to set up the first time.  The Bluetooth connection to her iPhone was excellent - rock solid and speedy to connect even after power cycling and dormant periods.  Long battery life, easy to control.The sound quality is excellent and has reasonably well-balanced treble/bass.  Noise isolation was very good in situations involving droning noises (airplanes, trains) and ""good"" the rest of the time.  (the passive noise blocking isn't as good as the in-ear, earplug-style headphones I usually use, so you can still hear extraneous noise from people, cars, trucks and whatnot fairly clearly).The new Soundlinks are fairly large.  They fit my large head just fine, but they're kind of overlarge on my wife's comparatively small noggin'.  They make her feel a little self-conscious wearing them, and I don't think either of us would want to work out or do anything really active with such large headgear.  Also, while they're very comfortable, they can feel a little hot after extended wear in warm weather.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G5PJY4PG0HQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117RGG8E#wasThisHelpful","R1G5PJY4PG0HQ6","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you already are a fan of Fluxx or one of its other variants, Adventure Time Fluxx is going to be totally familiar to you and easy to pick up.  There are a few modest changes to the rule mechanics (e.g., Creepers), and of course the cards are heavily themed to match the Adventure Time cartoon, and many of the Goals are at least loosely related to the plots of the show. But on the whole, it's much the same game as basic Fluxx.  If you like the original you'll like this one too. Conversely, if you already own one of the other games (Fluxx or Star Fluxx), then I really think there isn't much reason to buy this one unless you are a big-time Adventure Time fan.If you're new to Fluxx, then the basic idea is that it's a sort of a ""metagame,"" where you start with a small hand of cards and a minimal set of rules, mechanics and goals, and as the game progresses - drawing and playing cards - your actions change the very rules you are following and goals you are pursuing. The strategy, such as it is, is to manipulate those rules and goals so that you are able to fulfill them, thereby winning (and ending) the game. It's a ""good"" casual game but not a classic. IMHO, its chief disadvantage is that the game has a tendency to feel kind of random because all the unpredictable changes make it impossible to plan much of a long term strategy.  The game length also is very unpredictable: it can end in five minutes, or it can still be going after an hour. It's a good casual game to pull out from time to time, and easy to teach kids and novice players.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZR6ZJ3ZRDQ9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCTMC7E#wasThisHelpful","RZR6ZJ3ZRDQ9N","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This a good multipurpose notebook computer.  We got it for miscellaneous use around the house, and as a backup computer for use running Word, Excel, Chrome, etc., by our two young students (we have two kids entering grades 4-6 but only one desktop computer).  It's relatively large and thick, but light and well-built. Definitely portable, but a bit clunkier than a true ""light and portable"" notebook.  The screen is bright and colorful, but while the native resolution of 1366x768 is plenty sharp enough for browsing and office apps, it's got a noticeably lower pixel density than the typical HD screen on a modern tablet.Here are some benchmarks, for people who are into that sort of thing.  Geekbench 3 scores:  32-bit / single core: 2602, multi-core: 5137  64-bit / single core: 2792, multi-core: 5528You can compare them other models on the Geekbench website.  In short, this is perfectly workmanlike performance, but it's not going set anyone's hair on fire.  When the system gets really taxed by anything (games mostly, but you'll see something similar when running intensive photo/video editing apps or benchmarks) the fan kicks in at a fairly high volume. With the system's modest speed and built-in Intel 5500 graphics, you certainly can play some games but it isn't the best use of this model.

"This chair is big and comfortable.  My wife and kids immediately started jockeying for it, and three weeks later it's still the most popular chair in the room.  Soft without being too soft, and large without taking over the entire room.  So far the recliner mechanism seems reliable and easy to use, but we'll have to wait a few months or years to get a real feel for its true durability.  Looking at the internal components, my guess is that this chair will be very durable, though it doesn't seem to have the same super-heavy construction of some of the higher-end chairs you can buy at a higher price point.  Although I was a little concerned with the idea of ""faux"" leather upholstery, in person it looks very good, and the feel is terrific (sort of a cross between distressed leather and suede).Finally, I have to throw out some kudos to Amazon's local delivery service, which was great.  They worked around our schedule, arranged a tight delivery window, and came when promised.  The chair arrived in great shape.

Crucially, too, it has really sturdy wheels, handle, hinge and latch.  Internal storage options are pretty good for a hardside (though I find hardside bags in general don't have as much internal organization as a good soft side bag) and the telescoping handle and wheels doesn't take up too much of the internal space that otherwise could be holding possessions. It has been an easy fit in every airplane upper cabin compartment that I've tried it on so far, including older Southwest 737planes.

"You already know the basic story from the publisher's description:  Sometime in the near future, something (""the Agent"") unexpectedly breaks apart the Moon, and leaves behind a rapidly-disappating cloud of debris, some of which enters degenerating orbits with the Earth.  Within a couple of weeks, scientists and governments realize that in approximately 2 years the Earth will be sterilized by a rain of lunar rocks that will last thousands of years.  The first 2/3 of the novel follows a large cast of characters as they prepare to build, stock and escape into an orbiting habitat that would allow them to avoid the sterilizing hellfire of that bombardment.  And the last 1/3 introduces a new cast of future characters and addresses what happens afterwards.I've a long-time fan of Neal Stephenson, but skewing to his earlier works (Snow Crash, Cryptonomicon, Anathem) more so than his recent novels.  As usual, in this book Stephenson is a world-builder par excellence.  I really enjoyed the story, along with all of the engineering, scientific and political problems the lead characters grappled with as time marched on.  Stephenson viscerally conveys just how difficult and dangerous the project would be - how many technical problems would have to be solved, how many resources poured into it.  I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed Anathem, which this book reminded me of in many respects.All the same, this was not a perfect book.  I know that most people are going to say that Seveneves is a ""long book"" (and it is), but if anything, I think most of the shortcomings of this story are that in places events felt rushed and characters underdeveloped.  Some of my more specific comments and critique, INCLUDING SPOILERS, follow below:(1) Although I loved some of the characters (""Doc"" Dubois (aka Neal DeGrasse Tyson), Sean Probst (aka Elon Musk / Jeff Bezos), Dinah, Ivy and a few others), but on the whole, I didn't feel an especially deep emotional connection to the individual characters.  Billions of people died Earthside, and yet most of the time it felt like a pretty remote detail.  You could write a whole book the characters soming to terms with these kinds of issues, but here that sort of thing was just a background event, a table-setter for the chosen engineering narrative.  And the actions / reactions of many of the main characters were frankly inconceivable much of the time.  In fact, the parts of the book that were the least believable to me were the parts most heavy with human interactions, in part because most of their personalities and motivations seemed either underdeveloped, inscrutable, or 2-dimensional.  That's a great pity.(2) My biggest nit to pick with the plot is that the big ""twist"" that happens at the 2/3 point of the book is given away by the publishers in their ad copy.  Hint: it's not just the people in orbit who survive the calamity.  But if this *was* meant to be some kind of narrative surprise, why did the publisher let the cat out of the bag?  Why did Stephenson himself give it away so many times, and so many ways, in the text?  On the other hand, if the survival of people Earthside *wasn't* meant to be a narrative surprise, then why was the subject (a very important one, I'd argue) virtually ignored by the cast of main and secondary characters, by the US President, and the novel's otherwise fairly detailed description of the Earthside political situation?  Certainly the Earthside political leaders - all of whom knew that at best only a couple of thousand people would make into the orbital ark - would have tried to take steps to shelter people underground by building sprawling shelters in deep caves, former mines and filled-over quarries.  This kind of thing is bound to spawn a long speculative Reddit thread someday, but at a minimum, wouldn't the subterranean preppers have had a lot of adcantages over the ones in orbit?  They could have stockpiled almost unlimited tools, generated unlimited power, accessed mineral resources and water, experienced Earth-normal gravity and enjoyed total protection from cosmic radiation and explosive decompression, just for starters.  The subject could have merited an entire book of its own:  maybe Stephenson will write a sequel focusing on this side of the story.(3) Anyway, as we know Stephenson instead chose to focus his narrative on the people who choose to evacuate Earth.  Much of it was thrilling, and all of it was interesting.  All the same, I kept thinking that some of the just-so occurrences happened mainly because they were convenient for purposes of driving the story.  For instance, no engineers at any space or defense agency thought about running a propellant-needs projection for Izzy and the Cloud?  Really?  How is this possible, except as pure artifice to set up the Sean Probst subplot?  Also, after going through so many unexpected perils and technical difficulties that resulted in something like a 99.5% mortality rate for the people in orbit, how are we to understand that once Izzy reached Cleft everything (including particularly the same food production system that failed so spectacularly through the entire Cloud and doomed its residents to cannibalism) suddenly started working perfectly for decades, giving the remaining 8 women time to lead long lives and begin repopulating the species?  I have no idea.  Again, a whole book could have been written explaining these kinds of things, too.I give this 3.5 stars, rounded down.  A fun read, but not one of Stephenson's better works.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4RSZPAEJUU7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062190377#wasThisHelpful","R4RSZPAEJUU7W","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've got a medium-large house with a few wifi dead spots in some areas, so I was looking for a base station with more power.  In short, the AC1750 works pretty well for normal use, but I was disappointed to learn this doesn't really seem to be the high-performing wifi router the ad copy claims.Before installing this router I took a series of baseline wifi strength measurements all over my house using an ios wifi analyzer app of the signal strength for my existing 2013 model Apple AirPort Extreme (which, as of the day I wrote this review, is available for +/-5 dollars of this AC1750).  Then I powered down the Extreme, and installed the AC1750 in the exact same location, following all the manufacturer's directions, and connected to the 2.4 Ghz band. Wireless speed was about the same, but signal strength was noticeably WORSE in many parts of the house for the new AC1750 than it was for the Extreme. I checked multiple times, repositioned the antennae, rechecked firmware settings to ensure radio power was at 100%, and tested again.  Once again the new AC1750 matched the Extreme's performance in around half my house, but in the rest of my house the AC1750 noticeably lagged.  And the 5Ghz range was simply dismal...two rooms away, and I was at one bar and dodgy speed. So the Extreme wins narrowly but indisputedly at wireless range, and because it wins hands-down at reliability (years of use with no need to reboot or debug) I'm sorry to say that the AC1750 is going back into the box.  To be a really compelling choice, for my dollar, the AC1750 really needs to undercut the Extreme by around 25-30% on price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDC0YDPYWLI0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQ7SLDO#wasThisHelpful","RDC0YDPYWLI0A","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two kids (9 & 11 yo) who incessantly borrow my wife's iPad Mini and subject it to drops, fingerprints and the occasional close encounter with foods and drink. This case fits the iPad Mini 2 perfectly: all buttons, switches and camera lenses are unobstructed. Based on a few weeks of use and travel, I think it'll stand up to most routine neglect and protect the tablet inside from the occasional accident that even careful kids sometime make. I found it easy to snap together, and the case is strong and its components sturdy (though I figure only half the money you pay for this is going to the cost of the case itself:  probably half is going into the manufacturer's reserve for its insurance / warrantees against breakage).I'm docking it a star for several reasons: First, the price is very high, even compared to Apple-branded products and more so to second-party kits. Second, no integral stand, though I understand you can buy an accessory. Third, the kit contains a shoulder strap that is just a total throwaway - unless my kit was defective (which I doubt, though it's possible), it was impossible to attach the strap securely without its attachment loops coming loose and/or bodging something together with clips or superglue.

For example, I own and have enjoyed a CamKix case that I bought from Amazon.  Over 1000+ other people gave that unit 5-stars, and as of today, at least, the CamKix unit is much cheaper than the Thule.  I'm going to compare some of the pros and cons of each to show why I'd go with the CamKix again over the Thule:(1) The Thule case is significantly larger than the ""small"" sized CamKix - in fact, it occupies approximately double the volume in my suitcase that this CamKix does. This should mean that the Thule could hold around double the components of the CamKix model, but in practice the two hold approximately the same amount of stuff.  Probably partly because the Thule has thicker, more robust foam on the inside (which is good), but it does take up space and it's a higher-density foam that can't be customized as easily as the foam in the CamKix unit (which is not so good unless you happen to have precisely the kit the manufacturer built it for).(2) The nice-looking blue handle on the Thule isn't very useful, and it actually obstructs the zipper to a certain degree.(3) The zipper on the Thule is heavier-duty, but it doesn't open/close as smoothly.  On mine, at least, it catches a lot.So anyway, the Thule isn't a bad product at all, but in my humble opinion is just doesn't compare well to other products that occupy a significantly lower price point.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13NWOOITKF1P9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8K8WHI#wasThisHelpful","R13NWOOITKF1P9","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The optics are good, and the frames extremely comfortable. When using them as intended (for instance, sitting at a table or desk in an office, and frequently looking up and down between close books/papers, middle-ground computers/screens, and more distant objects like people) these glasses are a treat because the multifocal lenses really do work. Just be aware of that if you were just trying to focus on a single thing – such as if you've curled up to just read a book, they have the opposite effect – multifocal optics mean that only PART of the page you're reading will be in focus, in effect forcing you to read out of the bottom of the lenses. So these things really don't replace traditional readers so much as supplement them for some uses some of the time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QF8Y8PWSDFBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHUV8AQ#wasThisHelpful","R3QF8Y8PWSDFBO","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The spray trigger locks in place to prevent accidental discharge in a bag or pack, twists an eight turn to the left to open up.

"Honestly, I'm very conflicted about this review. Large parts of this book are simply excellent.  Mr. Soucie writes very well and engagingly, and he has a real knack for telling interesting stories chocked full of fun anecdotes that vividly evoke the sense of what it's like to fly fish abroad. He gives a lot of excellent big-picture advice on how people ought to philosophically approach this kind of travel to enjoy themselves no matter the weather or their luck on the water. He talks about the importance of patience, realism and preparedness, as well as the importance of acting like well-behaved guest traveling in someone else's country, without sounding like he's sermonizing. Sage advice throughout for working with guides, tour operators, lodge managers and fishing companions.  This book also includes countless detailed lists for packing and planning which, even if they probably are far too complete and complex for any single traveler ever to need/use, they certainly get you thinking ahead. All in all, I think that this is a book very much worth reading for the traveling flyfishing enthusiast.On the other hand, it is only fair to point out that this book felt very uneven to me. Parts of it felt like it was written many years ago, dusted off and only superficially brought up-to-date. Many of his specific anecdotes relate to fishing trips in the Kola peninsula decades ago, before the USSR split up.  A couple of the international travel agents and outfitters specifically mentioned in text have gone out of business (or at least seem to have, based on my preliminary Internet research), others seem to have changed their business models or products. Obviously, that sort of thing happens, and the author cannot be expected to keep the book absolutely up-to-date as to these 3rd parties. However, since the publication date on the book was only four months ago, to find so many changes seem surprising. You see some of the same in the sections devoted to medical advice, where I think the reader would really be much better off visiting his or her personal physician, local travel immunization clinic, or the CDC website for current advice rather than relying too much on the book alone because I can attest from direct personal experience that portions of the book's advice on vaccinations and malaria prophylaxis definitely are out of date. Ditto for the section is devoted to ""film security"":  i.e., like inadvertently damaging your canisters of film or VHS cassettes (!) while going through airport x-ray machines. I haven't even taken a film photograph in the last 13 years!  Modern digital photography (waterproof cameras / housings, rugged cameras, video, aerial drones with cameras) is only alluded to superficially.Most importantly, the book gives a lot of excellent advice about the sovereign importance of thoroughly planning ahead for your trip, researching your destination, and having a good grasp of natural and cultural points of interest in case the fishing does not live up to expectations.  But The author is talking about the kind of research people would've done of the 1980s.  There is NO mention of the actual importance of email, Google, online mapping, tripadvisor, Wikipedia or yelp in modern travel planning, and indeed the word ""internet"" only appears twice in the entire book, and neither time in the main body of text. This is astonishing, considering that the Internet is where I do 85%-95% of all my research before making any major travel plans.So in sum, about two-thirds of this book are delightful, engaging and timeless. But to one degree or another, much of the balance of the book feels like it was written in the pre-Internet age, and as such its value to the modern traveler is limited.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R135RPOJA72RYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MLNBIP0#wasThisHelpful","R135RPOJA72RYX","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my 11-year old son before a 2.5 week trip to India.  We wanted to pack light, and yet we needed clothes suitable for daytime temperatures in north India in December (roughly 50-70 deg F) and later in the same trip Kerala in south India (85-90 deg F).  This shirt packed easily and looked great.  In cool weather he rolled down the sleeves, and in warm weather he rolled them up.  My son washed it himself in the sink a few times in the evening, and by morning it had drip-dried and looked good as new.  My son loved it and wore this shirt at least 7 days out of 15:  it got to the point where we joked it had turned into his official uniform.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CEERL6TQF9NE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCZJMG8#wasThisHelpful","R1CEERL6TQF9NE","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think that this is a truly excellent semi-automatic (not fair to call this ""fully automatic"" as in the ad copy, for reasons discussed below) espresso maker for someone who wants to make great coffee drinks without the overhead of a fully manual espresso machine.  I'm giving it 4.5 stars, rounded up.It makes delicious espresso and ristretto, and it has very useful and easily-set options for, e.g., setting the coarseness of your grind, setting the amount of grounds per shot, setting the volume of water per shot, etc.  The auto-capuccino accessory (basically, a plastic hose which uses steam suction to prepare either hot milk+crema or crema+foam, depending on whether you twist it to cafe au lait or cappucino mode, respectively) is a very nice feature that works well.  So apart from the usual cups of espresso and ristretto, you can use this machine to make very good cups of cafe au lait/latte, capuccino, americanos, steamers or hot chocolates, for instance, with great results and minimal fuss.  Within a week, my 11 year old son already knew how to operate all of its major settings and felt comfortable using it.All that said, there are a few things that could be a little better, or which people at least need to know about before plunking down what is by all accounts a lot of money to buy this unit:Maintenance:  Be aware that this isn't designed for the same kind of one-button operation as a Keurig, for instance.  It isn't (quite) as easy as slipping a cup under the spout, pressing a button, and then throwing an empty K-Cup in the trash.  Most importantly, of course you should remember that you'll need to clean (or at least rinse) the milk steamer every time you use it (by that I mean you don't literally have to rinse it after EVERY cup of coffee - if you're making 2, 3,4 whatever cups one after the other for guests you just need to rinse it at the end of the procedure before you leave it sitting around unusued for a day).  And if you use the auto-capuccino accessory (i.e. the little suction hose contraption for frothing milk) you need to rinse it out as well.  You also occasionally need to empty the ground collector and empty the drip pan (which also serves as a discharge/outflow for steam and the unit's internal rinse water, so that it'll fill up eventually even if you never ""drip"" your coffee into it).  Finally, you need to be on the lookout for electronic reminders to descale the internal plumbing, which thankfully doesn't seem to happen that often.  My aforementioned 11-year old son is not as good at *cleaning* this unit as he is at *operating* it.[UPDATE: After two months, the machine prompted me to replace the unit's water filter.  On Amazon, that part cost around $20.  So factor that sort of ongoing maintenance expense into the total cost of ownership, if you do decide to continue using the (optional) filter.]Size:  Some other reviewers call this unit ""compact.""  Personally, I think that's stretching things a bit.  Width is fine, but both height and depth are significant.  For sure, this unit is a LOT smaller than a professional model auto espresso maker, but by the same token it's significantly larger than the kind of normal coffee maker, Keurig, or most entry-level non-automated espresso makers that people buy for their own kitchens.  Honestly, I think that some people might have trouble finding space for this to sit permanently on a countertop, especially under overhanging wall cabinets which wouldn't leave a lot of working room to load beans or remove the rear water reservoir.  And it's way too large, heavy and fiddly for you to plan on keeping it in a closed cabinet and only bring it out when you want to use it.  The upshot:  measure your space before you buy this!Coffee Bean Hopper:  The bean hopper on top is easy to open and load.  However, it's integral to the unit, so it's not as easy as I'd like to remove beans already in there.  This means that in practice the hopper usually will have some not-yet-used beans sitting in it, and if you don't keep using them relatively quickly they'll sit up there and start to oxidize and lose some of their freshness.  It also means you can't easily or quickly switch back and forth between different kinds of beans - regular or decaf beans, for instance, without using your bare hands to pick them out.  I wouldn't even want to try.Bean Limitations:  The instruction manual cautions you against using beans with syrupy coatings (like flavored beans) because they can get stuck in the internal mechanism and affect the machine's operation.  This was good to know, and it doesn't really bother me because who wants to pay this kind of money to make espresso with ghastly pre-flavored coffee beans anyway.  But of more concern, it also says that this same thing can happen with very dark roasts like the ""Italian Roast"" which naturally have highly oily surfaces - and many reasonable people actually DO like to use that for espresso.  The manual suggests using medium-roast beans most of the time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32QV454N8BYV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JS2NW60#wasThisHelpful","R32QV454N8BYV1","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an extremely fun game with terrific graphics.  Generally, the visuals are extraordinary - it's a lush and detailed depiction of a quasi-north Indian/Nepalese state, with immersive detail in plants, geography and buildings.  Individual missions have an essentially linear structure, though you can mess around with enough exploration and side-quests to keep you busy for a while and make it feel organic.  Controls are very complex but reasonably intuitive and can be mastered with practice.  Violence and profanity make the game unsuitable for kids and younger teens, IMO.FWIW, I didn't own, and never played, earlier games in the Far Cry series.  I've read a lot of online commentary and can understand some of the Sturm und Drang over the developers' changes to this game and the debate over whether that makes the current version 4 better or worse than 1-3, but as a newcomer to the series I can only that this game, taken on its own merits, is a heck of a lot of fun to play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HLWXC52MZ6QX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAED850#wasThisHelpful","R2HLWXC52MZ6QX","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Five stars for value, three stars for performance.  It's remarkable what a couple of hundred dollars can buy these days:  here, it gets you a nice-looking, well-built, and reasonably functional intro-level Windows machine for students or home users who need to run basic internet, MS Office apps and normal social media/communications programs with a minimum of fuss.  Build quality is good, with minimal creaking and flexing, and the keyboard and touchpad are pretty good.  Overall weight and balance are comfortable.  In short, I think this is a very serious high-value computer for use by young students (especially if you want to give them a machine that doesn't encourage excessive gaming), and as a secondary machine for home or light home-office users.All this said, this isn't a miracle product, and you need to have realistic expectations.  Processor speed is limited by modern standards (especially multi-core) and graphics power is very limited.  Don't plan on using this for gaming!  In my experience, even relatively nontaxing games like Minecraft push this hardware to its limits.  E.g., Minecraft Pocket Edition runs MUCH more smoothly on a $179 tablet than full Minecraft runs on this computer.  Also, the screen isn't top-notch:  it looks ""fine"" in actual use, especially for the intended Office, email and internet apps this machine was designed to run.  However, its color, contrast and brightness will suffer when viewed head-to-head with better notebook computers or modern tablets: the screen looks best head-on, and if you move your head left/right or up/down the screen shows color shifting and brightness dropoff much more quickly than better screens.  But as I said, this is being kind of picky: the screen is just fine for intended uses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R175EGE81BPJUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSHLUBU#wasThisHelpful","R175EGE81BPJUP","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's hard to get too worked up emotionally over a charging cable, but I definitely like this one.  First and foremost, the price is right and it has been 100% reliable as a charge cable for several of our modern iOS gadgets, both iPhones and iPads.  The color is a nice match for the current-generation iPhone's ""champagne"" finish, though the effect is subtle and hardly necessary over the usual white cable except for people who insist on being color-matched.  Finally, the outer shell of the cable is sort of braided rather than smooth plastic, which gives this cable more toughness, stiffness and texture than the regular Apple Lightning cable.

"I think that most PC gamers looking to buy a 17"" notebook would be very happy with this computer.  I've been using it for three weeks (as of this review), and I like it a lot: I'm giving it 4.5 stars, rounded up for value.  The construction, fit and finish is very good.  Maybe not the equal of category-leaders like Apple Macbook Pros with their aluminum construction and impossibly tight tolerances, etc., but Acer did a fine job with this Aspire using traditional materials at a much lower price point.  The case is built well:  there is no creaking, groaning or crackling when flexing the computer or opening/closing the monitor.  There is very little for me to complain about.  I really enjoy the keyboard (illuminated red - nice touch, slick looking).  The touchpad, though, sometimes is less sensitive than I'd prefer.  Especially when doing a two-finger scroll, it sometimes scrolls intermittently.  Not a big deal because I use an external mouse for gaming, but it's a little annoying.The screen is big and beautiful.  I'd say that the sweet spot for maximum viewing quality (uniform brightness and color) is around +/-30 degrees left, right, above and below centerline, so around a 60 degree cone of highest visual quality.  After that, you can start to see some typical fall-off in terms of brightness and uniformity, but the screen is readable and not-unenjoyable almost edge-to-edge, I'd say roughly 135 degree field of view.  Still very good.The fan is very quiet, even when running full screen games.  Lots of ports, all easily accessible.  And the speakers, though hidden on the underside of the case, definitely sound powerful (at least when the computer is on a hard surface like a desk or table) and are surprisingly full-range: they're very good not only for gaming effects but also for movies and music.For those of you who might want to compare this unit's raw performance figures against other computers, I ran Geekbench 3 benchmarks immediately after configuring the computer out of the box and installing all Windows and hardware driver updates.  Here are the summary results:64 bit:Single Core: 3,470 / Multi-Core: 13,010  Integer: 3,612 single / 15,041 multi  Floating Point: 3,452 single / 15,709 multi  Memory: 3,225 single / 3,552 multi32 bit:Single Core: 3,284 / Multi-Core: 12,320  Integer: 3,295 single / 14,040 multi  Floating Point: 3,292 single / 14,983 multi  Memory: 3,248 single / 3,556 multiThis all seems good for a gaming notebook at this price point, but I'll leave it to others to tease out the nuances.  Add a comment if you want a complete report.  Apart from these synthetic benchmarks, I can report that in practice, the machine is ""very fast.""  Our family currently doesn't play a lot of the most cutting edge games requiring maximum horsepower (we typically play titles like Civilization V, Minecraft and older FPS action games like TeamFortress 2), but all of them run in at high frames per second with maximum detail/quality modes at the screen's native resolution.  There's little doubt in my mind that this computer won't be able to keep up with a high end purpose-built desktop gaming computer, but it won't disappoint users with realistic expectations.Fair warning: out of the box, I did run into the usual slate of typical Windows incompatibilities, made harder than necessary to solve by Acer's policy of blocking user-installation of normal Intel drivers.  Short story: out of the box, Minecraft wouldn't work.  After extensive debugging, it turned out to be a conflict between the Acer-certified version of the Intel 4600 video driver which was installed on the computer out of the box (and which, as of the date of this writing, was only around 4 months old) and the much newer version of JRE/Java Runtime Environment available from Oracle.  It was easy to verify that newer generic Intel drivers were available, but by default Acer blocks installation of video drivers they haven't certified.  So I had to perform a manual removal and deletion of the installed Acer 4600 drivers, reboot using generic Windows drivers, followed by a manual installation of current 4600 drivers from Intel (not Acer), and reboot again.  This resolved the problem, but as the computer is marketed as a ""gaming computer,"" it seems reasonable to expect that it wouldn't interpose arbitrary limits on video drivers needed by commonly-played games - or at least allow you to circumvent the block with a simple driver upgrade rather than force you to take these extra steps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FNNRV5Z9YH0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJNFW1C#wasThisHelpful","R1FNNRV5Z9YH0X","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a general matter, I'm not a fan of nonstick pans - I prefer to use cast iron or stainless where possible for a variety of reasons (durability, mainly).  But this pan might make a convert of me.  The nonstick surface seems to be very effective - foods just glide across it - and after several weeks of use, it seems to be highly durable.  It doesn't hurt that the pan is PFoA free and dishwasher safe, though neither is crucial to me personally.Other points worth underscoring are that the sides of the pan are high enough to make it more suited to stir frying (albeit not super high-heat wok-style frying - note the maximum recommended temperature of 400 degrees, which I assume is to prevent breakdown of the nonstick surface).

"I bought this from a local brick & mortar store because I was in a hurry to get something before a long road trip to hold my iPhone 6+.  Big mistake.First, the assembly instructions are presented as cryptic pictograms rather than narrative text.  Those pictograms leave out one important step:  to install it properly, you need a small screwdriver to tighten the ""legs"" which are meant to stabilize the mount.  Not a big deal, but a screwdriver isn't included in the package so make sure you have one.Second, the ""legs"" really are an essential part of the unit's structure, necessary to stabilize it.  This limits your installation options - you have to be able to attach it to a vent immediately above a blank surface they can rest upon.  I am certain from using it myself that some cars have dashboards that simply won't allow that.Third, even after everything is tightened down I found the whole structure to be very wibbly-wobbly, especially with the kind of larger/heavier phone that this unit actually is intended to hold.  The mount does not explicitly require a horizontal vent - and it is absolutely clear that you CAN mount it on vertical or even angled vents.  However, horizontal vents probably will be a lot more stable.  My car has vents that are angled by around 30 degrees, and the phone has a tendency to flop side to side.Summary - not recommended.

"Every blade I've personally tried that was made by Schrade at this price point seems a little bit stiff to open and close, which makes them rather hard for young persons' hands to manipulate (and hence a little dangerous for older kids and younger teens to use, in my opinion - you don't really want kids straining with sharp tools).

"True to other reviews, this keyboard has a great feel that is terrific for gaming as well as for routine typing.  The footprint is small enough not to take over our desk but large enough to make it easy to assume a comfortable posture for long gaming/typing sessions.  The adjustably-backlit keys are very sharp, and all of the main characters are extremely easy to read in any light.  Unfortunately, the secondary key functions are a little harder to make out under the backlighting (they're a little dim and undefined compared to the main digits), but it's not quite enough of a problem for me to dock they keyboard a star.

"This is a really marvelous book for several reasons.  First, I love the organization.  Each map has a full double-facing-page display of the entire map so that you can appreciate it in its entirety.  The full map is followed by a double-page spread with blow-ups (the so-called ""visual tour"") focusing on many of the individual items of significance embedded in the map - techniques, cultural motifs, unique items of importance with concise explanations why.  Doubtless something analogous could have been done on a computer, but as it stands this is a really good use of the paper/hardback medium that would be difficult to replicate in an ordinary ebook.  Definitely buy the physical volume if you have a choice.  Second, this book spans a wide range of cultures, times and subject matters, from mosaics in the ancient world through intermediate maps of kinds I never knew existed (for instance, the Portolan Chart by Pizzigano, which is a detailed early navigational map reflecting ports' locations based on compass angles of travel) on through modern realistic depictions of the ocean floor and on through very contemporary graphical innovations like the stylized maps of the London Underground to maps which have been intentionally distorted in ways that add information to the map.  Terrific examples of great design abound.I've read many interesting ""coffee table"" books - the kind of large format volume that you're supposed to pick up and flip through idly for a few minutes when you're killing time.  But this is one of the very few that I've actually enjoyed so much that it's difficult to put down once I pick it up.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCSYKSKKFZ1UL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465424636#wasThisHelpful","RCSYKSKKFZ1UL","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent, inexpensive addition to anybody's car or home emergency kit. It's built reasonably solidly out of good materials - I wouldn't say it's built like a tank, and I would not take it out for any epic survival missions, but it should be more than enough for the intended market: which I assume is normal consumer use in the event of a blackout, storm, earthquake or so on. Some general comments:1. The internal battery is more than powerful enough to run this unit for a long time, and the multiple recharging operations are excellent. The crank recharges it surprisingly quickly, and of course the solar cells aren't no-brainer if you leave it sitting around in bright lights when you're not using it. Just note that has the manual clearly Sabbs, the solar panel will not fully charge the device on its own.. The internal battery has a  lower capacity than the lithium ion batteries in most modern communications gadgets, though, so you have to have reasonable expectations what this will be able to fully recharge. Remember that the purpose is to recharge your phone enough to give you some emergency communication time, not to fully charge a dead tablet.2. I found the FM reception to be quite good, but the AM reception was a little less then I can get on the other table radios. Both are more than strong enough to pick up emergency information. Also, the NOAA radio seems to work very well for me.3. The flashlight is more than bright enough for most ordinary use, and it's nice to have it built in so you don't have to go looking around in the event of a blackout, for instance. However, once again it's fair to say that it is nowhere near as bright as a modern dedicated high-intensity flashlight that you can buy online for 10 or $15.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE74RF6JJHZ07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSFDE6Y#wasThisHelpful","RE74RF6JJHZ07","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It flushes powerfully even under a ""heavy load,"" and the bowl design has a good ""target zone"" which minimizes unsightly staining after use.

"I was more than a little disappointed in this bag.  First, the shape and internal design is adequate for carrying around a basic kit DSLR or mirrorless ICL with a couple of lenses and gear, but it isn't very innovative.  It's not great for large lenses or hoods, nor is it ideal to hold a camera + lens (and certainly not with an external flash) in a ready-state between shoots.  You can remove or open up the internal dividers and just lay the camera in there the way you would inside of any sack/bag/purse, but this isn't really purpose-built for that kind of use.  Crucially, though, the inside has limited space, so you have to rely on the external pockets much of the time.  Trouble is, the external stash pockets are not very secure and cannot be closed up (there is no zipper, flap, snap, elastic, etc.), so things easily can slip out.  Medium marks on functionality.Second, I think that many men will be concerned that its size and shape make it more purse-like than they might prefer.  I got some gentle ribbing from men and women of my acquaintance.  Paradoxically, the women I spoke with told me that they didn't like the idea of using it themselves, either, because of its utilitarian style and color.  So low marks on style and appearance.My normal go-to bag was and remains the Domke 701-J83 J-803 Satchel (Black), which is a smallish satchel with removeable internal dividers and external pouches for camera gear, an internal sleeve for a tablet or thin notebook PC/Mac, and a style that carries over equally well to office use (e.g., carrying files) when you remove the internal dividers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NBQAFXEI85WS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039NLS3I#wasThisHelpful","R3NBQAFXEI85WS","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I enjoyed it - it's a nice volume to keep next to your easy chair when you have a few minutes to spare but you don't want to surf the web or start reading a regular book.  Great photos and graphics, and I found most of the entries genuinely interesting.  You definitely can see its Field & Stream heritage, it reads like an enormous fishing magazine without the ads.It's fair to say, though, that like most books that try to cover all aspects of a very broad hobby, it can be accused of being a mile wide and an inch deep.  For instance, of 317 entries, large minorities are devoted to fly fishing, ocean fishing, bass fishing, and so on - separated not by chapters but shuffled together like cards in a deck.

"The Sony BDV-N8100W is a nice unit with a ton of features.  Rather than write an enormous review of every possible function, I'm going to zoom in on the things that seem to matter most to me.  If I don't mention something, it's either because I don't want to repeat what other reviewers already said, or because I just don't use it.First, I was happy to see that fit and finish is very good for the price.  You don't get all-metal enclosures, wooden speaker boxes with Kevlar cones, or large-gauge cables, but materials and workmanship are a good deal for this kind of package at this price point. The main unit and subwoofer tuck away nicely, and the speakers are unobtrusive in our living room.  Note, though, that we wall-mounted the front speakers, discarding the tall stands that come in the box.  Wall mounted, they produce good sound and visually match up well with our fireplace-hung LCD TV.Second, it was very easy to set up and configure.  Physically, it takes a great deal of time to place everything just so, route cables and power, etc., but at no stage was it difficult.Third, though, the UI menu system is characteristically ""Sony"" in that - like every Sony camera and other gadget I've ever owned - ordinary usage requires you to navigate a large and fairly discursive menu system. This can actively hamper everyday use.  For instance, astonishingly, there is no function to let you select a particular input mode!  By this, I mean you cannot press a single button and jump to HDMI 1 (etc.).  Instead, you have to press a function button repeatedly, cycling one at a time through all of the many input options until you get the one you want. Alternatively, you can call up the main menu, navigate left or right to the input control settings and then up or down to the one you want. It's pretty much the same either way, because it takes a lot of button mashing and more importantly it makes it hard to use a procedural universal remote control (like a Logitech Harmony).Fourth, sound is remarkably good for the price.  On movies, TV and music (whether 2-channel or simulated surround) the sound is equal to or better than the separate components I bought for a higher price some years back. And the wireless rear surrounds produce extremely good sound for the purpose, and I've never experienced a dropout or disconnection.UPDATE November 22, 2013:=============================In recent weeks, something has gone wonky with the sound in this unit.  My guess is that one of the firmware updates did something to change sound processing algorithms, because all voices now take on a weird, distorted kazoo-like character at low volumes.  It's not completely unlistenable, but it is distracting.  It affects all of the DSP settings (Auto, Movie, Music, etc) except, oddly, 3D Surround Sound mode, so I keep in that mode almost all the time now. A manual software reset did not solve the problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVRMSWG4M59P9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C27S3WG#wasThisHelpful","RVRMSWG4M59P9","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is far and away the most useful stylus I've tried for my iPad.  Great battery life, good feel, and usable as a basic pointer in any application.The absolutely killer feature, though, is palm recognition - a feature that is missing from every other stylus I've seen.  Without palm recognition, your writing hand constantly touches the screen and causes stray marks, zooming and re-positioning of the screen.  To avoid that, you need to hold most stylii in much the same way you might use a paintbrush, which is uncomfortable for me and causes poor accuracy and illegible handwriting.  But to enable this palm recognition, Adonit uses technology that doesn't work system-wide: it only functions in certain applications that were specifically coded to recognize this stylus.  Check before you buy to see if your preferred apps recognize the Adonit.  As of today, there only are a couple of dozen, though many of them are very good.  Pressure sensitivity works similarly - only in apps that recognize it.  Some apps recognize one but not the other, so do your homework if this is important to you.The fine point on the stylus makes it easier to write with precision (compared to the big stubby foam/rubber tips of many other stylii), but the ""gap"" between tip and LCD panel caused by the thickness of the screen's glass is very visible and can be distracting until you get used to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17HFNEB7QDDGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AO1L1RG#wasThisHelpful","R17HFNEB7QDDGS","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoy using this camera.  Well-manufactured with good fit and finish, strong image quality, long zoom, good auto focus speed and responsive shutter.  It includes some more advanced features like WiFi hotspotting (though I think most people will be frustrated the first couple of times they use it, because it takes some getting used to how to setup and configure networking functions).  And as usual, Sony's menu control system is a little more complex than it needs to be when compared to similar cameras by Canon, Panasonic, etc., but I've used so many Sony cameras now that I'm getting used to this issue.Fundamentally, the DSC-WX300 is Sony's answer to Canon's superlative S100/S110 line of compact cameras, and I think it should appeal to the same kinds of users: (1) the casual photographer looking for a compact, jack-of-all-trades point and shoot with good image quality, and (2) the more serious enthusiast who wants a pocketable camera with a big zoom when they don't want to lug a larger SLR or interchangeable lens mirrorless camera kit around.The rear LCD screen takes up most of the camera body.  IMO, it's likely to be a major scratch and crack risk if you aren't accustomed to taking good care of your cameras.  If you  often drop yours in a backpack, purse, drawer, etc., with other things, you might want a screen protector.  I bought the cheap but excellent GGS Optical Glass LCD Screen Protector 3 inches for Digital Cameras, which fits perfectly, and couldn't be more pleased with the result.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GTSIYPEDIGY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEHQKPW#wasThisHelpful","R2GTSIYPEDIGY3","AFQBS241UKPAZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFQBS241UKPAZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Allison Taylor and her daughter, Melanie, need a fresh start. Recently divorced, she moves to the town that she spent summers as a child, where her surrogate mother Frannie, and best friends Elizabeth and Sharon, still live. Things seem to be going great, but as anyone could have guessed, it is not meant to last. A former love interest that she hasn’t seen in over a decade shows up, and things start to go sideways. Soon after that, a murder happens in this small town, and everyone’s dark secrets are being dragged, kicking and screaming into the light. Can Allison’s relationships survive all of the turmoil?For a debut novel from this author, it is a very enjoyable book. The characters were interesting to read about, and the relationships between all of them were very believable. I did think that there were some areas of the plot that kind of meandered, and kind of took away from the suspensefullness that the author was trying to build with the rest of the story. But those are things that are to be expected somewhat from a debut author, and it’s definitely not a deal breaker.This is the first book in a series, and I will definitely put the next two books on my ever expanding to read list. The character writing was so good, that it will definitely be worth checking back in on. If the pacing issues are fixed in the next installments, this series will quickly become a must read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFH1EJ4PSF27W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KU144W#wasThisHelpful","RFH1EJ4PSF27W","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It’s up to Sara to figure out this brand new world, before it’s too late.Alright, let’s get this minor annoyance that I had with this book: This is the first book in the series, it is absolutely not a prequel. Prequels come later, hence the name pre-sequel. Whew, I feel a lot better getting that off my chest.That being said, I really enjoyed this book. As far as sci-fi and fantasy novels of this kind of scale, it is relatively short (under 300 pages is shorter than you would expect), but it doesn’t waste a whole lot of page real estate. The story picks up very quickly, and doesn’t let up at all. Not even when the book ends, since it’s only the first volume in a series! I think the over-arching concept of the story is immensely interesting, and even if it wasn't a very well written story, I would probably continue with the series. But the author is a very talented story teller, and I am very excited to continue on this journey.But seriously, not a prequel. I’m sorry, it just bothers me….","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE13X07DW7H8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615938442#wasThisHelpful","RE13X07DW7H8X","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes I am in the mood for a huge series, whether it be a book or TV series, where it is crucial that you start from the very beginning, and follow the larger storyline throughout the entire thing.  Other times, I enjoy a series that doesn’t really have an overarching narrative to speak of, that I can jump into and off of whenever I feel like. The Social Magus is the latter.The fifth book in the series sends Agent John Mordred to investigate an up and coming new party in British politics.  Seemingly popping up out of nowhere, this new party has gained the attention and support of the youthful apathetic contingent of the voting public, and gained the attention and derision of the governmental establishment.  Mordred is tasked with investigating where this party came from, and who is behind it.  He quickly finds that there is more going on than he originally thought, and things even get personal, when he finds that his sister is inexplicably in the middle of all of it.  Can he save his sister, and get to the bottom of the case?  I mean, he is an MI7 Agent after all, I would hope he could…This is the first book in the series that I have read, and from what I have gathered, they all have different lead characters, and can all be read independently from one another.  I thought that the backdrop of British politics, and the inner workings of all of it, made for a very interesting and suspenseful read.  The author was able to convey the intricate ideas very well, and I found that I was able to understand what was going on, despite not knowing anything about British politics.If you’re looking for a new political thriller to sink your teeth into, I would highly suggest checking out J J Ward’s many novels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AU0QDJKHKPJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VYXVD08#wasThisHelpful","R2AU0QDJKHKPJT","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Comedy can be a tough thing to write.  It’s not a universal thing that appeals to everyone the same way.  The world doesn’t move to the beat of just one drum.  What might be right for you, may not be right for some. But they got Diff’rent Strokes…. Oh, that’s a theme song for a TV show.  But the point still stands, that comedy is difficult, and it is kind of risky to write an entire book of funny stories, and the like.Edward Shafik is the author and creator of this book, which is a large collection of stories, thoughts, and observances throughout his life.  Are you interested in reading humerous stories about celebrities such as John Lennon, Donald Trump, or Dolly Parton?  Did you want to read, quite frankly, an alarming number of stories centered on hot dogs?  How about stories about Disneyland, The Happiest Place on Earth?  Did you catch that I used “frank” as a pun when talking about hot dogs?  Well, that’s the kind of content that you can expect in this book!  Except for my terrible hot dog pun….This book is an overall enjoyable experience.  Coming in at a little over 400 pages, it will take you a good long while to get through, considering that it is best enjoyed in smaller chunks.  Most stories are entertaining and funny, but every once in a while, one of the stories falls flat.  Which is to be expected, with such a large variety of content, that not everything works.  But I think that this is definitely worth picking up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16OPYSV05WR70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1514817454#wasThisHelpful","R16OPYSV05WR70","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chasing Joseph is the story of Jamal Joseph D Robinson.  It tells the story of him coming up in the world, and trying to be an upstanding member of society, and his community.  His intentions were for the most part good and genuine, but I am always reminded of that old adage, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions”.  One bad decision after another pulled Jamal further into a world that he would have never imagined he would be in.  A world introduced to him by his own mother, no less, a world that included welfare fraud and murder.  However, at it’s core, this book is a story of redemption, and how Joseph (he calls his “former self” Jamal, to further distance himself) brought himself out of that situation, and changed his life for the better.The first thing you need to know about this book is that it is an autobiography, from someone who isn’t necessarily a writer by trade, so it is a little rough around the edges.  However, that is what I really enjoyed about this book overall.  It didn’t feel like it was overwritten, and every word perfected into conveying the exact idea that the writer wants.  It was raw, and genuine, and I think it helped to convey the emotions of the writer more than the writer agonizing over the perfect phrase.This is a fairly heavy read, but it is certainly worth checking out.  It is fairly short, (118 pages) so it’s not a big reading commitment, but I am confident that you will be glad that you read it.  You might not be “happy” after reading, per se, but it will definitely have an impact.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNH0J88RN2MA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EK2QAW#wasThisHelpful","RNH0J88RN2MA4","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to stories and story-telling, you k now what we have in excess? HAPPY ENDINGS. If you’re like me, sometimes “happily ever after” is not what you want, and not what the charaters themselves deserve. I would list my favorite endings along those lines, but I wouldn’t want to spoil The Cat In The Hat for anyone. Whoops… So, if you’re like me, that doesn’t always want a happy ending, then buckle the ffffffffront of your big boy pants, and dive into Deadly Short Stories.I’m not even going to go into each story, since each story is so short, that going too deep into the plots would be pointless. However, I can say that each story is different enough from the last, and each are so short, that you can’t really seem to get your footing on anything the entire time. You will feel uneasy, suspenseful, hopeful, queasy, or downright horrified, and then the author shifts gears with a twist in the story, or a completely different story altogether.I really enjoyed this collection of “flash fiction”, which is a type of story shorter than a short story, and not made up stories of a man only wearing a trenchcoat, as I originally thought. Sometimes I can’t understand how someone like Stephen King can write an absolute tome of a book like The Stand, and keep it interesting throughout, and other times I can’t understand how someone like Carl Plumer can get me so invested in a story in such a short time. I am very impressed, and will keep an eye out for more releases of this ilk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22UASZA4HHI56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3TFHBA#wasThisHelpful","R22UASZA4HHI56","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a religious person, but I am endlessly fascinated by religion itself. I enjoy reading about many different faiths, and educating myself on their beliefs, both good and bad. I was drawn to The Angel Of Antioch because of this.It centers around the mysterious character of Elias, who one day shows up in The Great Synagogue in the ancient town of Antioch, and is able to recite verse after verse of scripture from memory. Before the gathered people can find out more about him, and talk to him themselves, he vanishes. But he returns, on the next Sabbath, and does the same thing, before vanishing once more. Word spreads quickly throughout Antioch: Is he an angel sent to spread the Word of the Lord? Is he a prophet? Whatever the case may be, the religious leaders are threatened by his presence, and try to discredit him to the rest of Antioch. Turmoil between Elias’ followers and the religious leaders ensue, threatening to tear the Capital apartDespite being a fairly short read (110 pages, according to Amazon), I enjoyed this book immensely. The character of Elias is very intriguing, as he is the voice of insight, wisdom, and sometimes doubt, against the monolithic reach of religious beliefs, which as I’m sure we are all aware, are the Word of God, and can not be questioned. I am almost always on the side of the person that asks questions, and doesn’t blindly believe and follow whatever they are told, and this is no exception. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story, and will definitely look forward to reading more of Daniel Molyneux in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27J8BXASXU62P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S37875C#wasThisHelpful","R27J8BXASXU62P","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After writing A Birth of an Assassin, Rik Stone decided to return back to the world that he created, with The Turkish Connection: A Birth of an Assassin Novel.The story centers on Mehmet, who is basically a street urchin, in Istanbul, Turkey, circa 1951. It follows his day to day struggle to survive, while learning some of the less savory ways, including thievery, and sometimes violence. As he grows, he realizes that this life that he thought was forced onto him by the poor choices of his father, has actually been manipulated by a third party. Is he able to free himself from their grips, and turn his life around?This is an interesting look into a world that most of us do not have any frame of reference. Not just growing up in poverty (something that is more relatable), but actually being homeless, and having to fend for yourself, with absolutely no support structure to fall back on. It is a very harrowing story, and one that is, at times, difficult to read. I especially enjoyed the fantastic melding of the two parts of the story, of Mehmet as a young boy, and as an adult. It was interesting to see how the situations, lessons, and overall backstory that were presented to Mehmet as a boy, informed how he turned out as a man. The evolution of Mehmet seemed believable, and I very much enjoyed reading it throughout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23K4P6TW3MGO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W81WMOQ#wasThisHelpful","R23K4P6TW3MGO6","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw that this book was released recently, and it piqued my interest.  Set in the 70’s, during the conflict at Wounded Knee (a moment in history that I was not entirely familiar with before reading this), it centers around Rick Putnam, who is a motorcycle courier, and his girlfriend Eve Buffalo Calf.  Both of which obviously hit the jackpot in the “Super Rad Name” competition.  They stop in the small town of Wounded Knee, to help some activist friends of Eve’s, bringing them supplies and such.  And since it would be a little boring of a story if things worked out perfectly, things actually don’t work out perfectly,  when they find themselves being chased by a cult, who is intent on killing them.As I said, I wasn’t very familiar with the Wounded Knee incident, but  I was intrigued all the same.  I did a little research (see: Wikipedia) before digging too far, so I had a broad idea, and I think that it doesn’t really matter how much knowledge you have before reading this, that you will enjoy it all the same.  Terry Irving does a spectacular job of painting a picture of the time period, and filling the reader in on the tumultuous time period.  The characters of Rick and Eve are fantastic from start to finish.  Another reviewer mentioned that Rick reminded them of a Liam Neeson-type of character, a la the Taken franchise, and I think that is a perfect comparison.Overall, I enjoyed this book greatly.  If you’re looking for a great political thriller with motorcycles, then you’ve come to the right place with your very specific needs!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DW6MLUUFJJCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010GKWK88#wasThisHelpful","R3DW6MLUUFJJCQ","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the far-flung future, it is widely known that there are zombies, werewolves, and vampires running around.  The only thing that is stopping people from being turned into monsters left and right is?!  RED TAPE!  No, that's not some new superhero with the power of bureaucracy;  The Bureau of Reassignment handles everyone's ""transition"" from human to something else.  Extensive testing, therapy, permits, and injections are needed before you make this big leap in today's world, but there is a rash of unregistered and illegal zombies running the streets.  Senior Serenity Ambassador Vic (also the winner of Time Magazine's ""Coolest Job Title"" award) is tasked with figuring out what is going on, and stopping him.Alright, I have to say, that the premise for this book sucked me in right away.  Government regulated zombies, werewolves, and vampires?  That's just an entirely new level of crazy, that I can totally get behind.  The book, while somewhat short, does a fantastic job at hitting the ground running, story-wise, and manages to tell a very inventive and original sci-fi story along the way.  Plus, there's even a love interest thrown into the mix, and it doesn't feel like it was slapped on at the last minute!Overall, I think this book is really well put together.  Like a Frankenstein!  Idea for the next book, perhaps?  Among the cavalcade of zombie stories that we have had in recent history, it is nice to see someone able to weave an entertaining and original story in the tried and true zombie genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GTBBW7PNSG9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615746330#wasThisHelpful","R3GTBBW7PNSG9Q","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deedee is in a relationship that is all too common in this day and age.  Trapped in a marriage with someone she has realized all too late is not right for her, and he takes everything from her, including their daughter, Bea.  Deedee escaped to America, to get away from her old life, and make a new start.  She meets Christopher, a French baker, and quickly falls deeply in love with him.  He promises her that he will help her get her daughter back, and bring her to America.  This harrowing tale is actually based on true events, which makes the entire read even more amazing!Considering that this is Doina Moulin's first novel, I will give it the benefit of the doubt.  It is not BAD by any means, it just doesn't seem like it was proofread enough times, or didn't go through an editing process rigorous enough.  I hate to harp on grammatical and punctuation errors in this review, but they are a big enough problem for me to take notice, so it is worth mentioning.  I hope that the author's next work is more polished, because I did enjoy the story very much.  It was a touching and heartbreaking story at times, and I would definitely read the author's next book based on that.This is a very personal and harrowing tale, that is marred by small writing errors that could have definitely been taken care of with the right editor.

"Were you watching Lord of the Rings, or Game of Thrones, and thought, “Do you know what this needs?  GUNS!  AND ROBOTS!  PEW PEW PEW!!”  Oh, also, you're playing with army men and dragon figurines...  Anyway, if that sounds interesting to you, then you should definitely check this book out.Terrorists armed with mystical powers kill a plane full of people with a dragon, and use their souls to start The Change across the country.  And that just STARTS the story!  We are then introduced to Steve Rowan, who is transformed into a powerful wizard, with a less than stellar success rate.  He is hired by Barnaby, a computer that has gained sentience, and along with Navy SEAL Ace Morningstar (who is a woman... You can't really tell from the name), sets out to figure out what is going on, and how to stop it.Once I read the setup for this book, I was pretty much sold right off of the bat.  I was very impressed with the opening, and what follows after that is a crazy mesh of fantasy and real-world/sci-fi elements, that is a delightful read.  The characters are varied and unique, and the interactions between the three main characters is fantastic.Considering this is the first book in a planned series, a lot of questions are asked, and not a whole lot is answered.  But the questions that have been explored so far are enough to get me to come back, and see where this story goes from there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RUFD98KY1O89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZUAL9U#wasThisHelpful","R2RUFD98KY1O89","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

His job obviously makes him some very dangerous enemies, whether he fails or succeeds, and he is always looking over his shoulder.  During one of his missions, he rescues a beautiful girl, and then all Hell breaks loose.  Literally!  Alright, NOT literally...  A lot of powerful and deadly people want this woman dead, and it is up to Jack to figure out why, and keep her safe!Normally I just relax while I am on break at work, and give my eyes a rest from the computer screen.  While reading this, my breaks could not come fast enough for me to run to the break room, and continue reading!  It was a thrilling read, that flowed really quickly throughout the storyline, while at the same time feeling TOO LONG, simply because I wanted to know what happened next! I was drawn to this book partly because I went and saw Captain Phillips when it came out in theaters, and there is obvious connection between the two.  The main difference would be if Captain Phillips, and the special forces people that took out the pirates were the same person.  This story was definitely different in major ways, but they did have the same feel of  overall suspense throughout.

It isn't as heavy and dramatic as some other romance novels I have read, and I very much enjoyed the change of pace.  It was refreshing to read a book that is written in that way, instead of the overly serious and moody style that is so common in romance novels.Of all the things you could say about this novel, one thing that you couldn't call it is slow.  Both the story, and the romance included in the story, hit the ground running, and do not slow down for a second.

"This book is a nice short story about Sarah, a young child attending a Catholic school.  While on a class field trip to the City of Moon, Sarah wanders off away form the group.  When she returns, she has found that they have left without her!  She waits for awhile for them to come back, but eventually wanders to the nearest building, which happens to be a mosque.  The man that she meets contacts the school, and introduces Sarah to his granddaughter, Raya, who quickly become friends.  Sarah's class comes back to get her, and everything works out, and Sarah  and Raya remain friends.This is a really nice short story, about children, and how judging someone for their skin color or religious or personal beliefs is not something that you are born with, it is something that is learned as you grow older.  Everyone is taught these things, and it is really hard to unlearn them, and understand that everyone is the same:  To regress back to our childlike understanding of how the world works, and what our differences mean.  I think that this is a wonderful story, and every parent should read this to their children.  Or, every child should read this to their parents, so their parents can finally understand the moral behind this story.The author of this book works with orphaned and needy children, from all walks of life, and all different backgrounds.  Some of the proceeds from purchasing this book will go to helping those children.  I was happy to purchase this book for that alone, and the story itself is a nice plus!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T47VRW87VV3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYZJLMA#wasThisHelpful","R1T47VRW87VV3Y","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came right off of reading the first book in the series, Tesla Evolution Book 1, and I enjoyed it so much, I dove directly into the second volume.This is the continuing adventures of Sebastian and Melanie.  Melanie, who was weeks from succumbing to cancer in the previous book, has just found out that she has been cured, due to the radiation emitted from Sebastian himself!  However, she is warned that, if she continues to stay in close contact with him, she could be in danger of dying from radiation poisoning.  They have arrived at the Steam Academy, one of their main missions in the previous book, but soon realize that it is not the salvation that they had hoped it would be.  Food shortages and civil unrest threaten everyone's livelihood, as well as the outside threat of the cyborgs.Going from Tesla to Decay was a very nice transition, but not exactly the same.  The author's style has changed slightly from the first to second volumes, as has the overall tone of the book.  This book is significantly darker than the previous volume.  While not automatically a bad thing (I certainly enjoyed the change, overall), it should be noted that, while things were definitely bleak before, it becomes much bleaker this time around.This has shaped up to be a fantastic series, and I am very much looking forward to reading the next in the series.

"I don't know what is with post-apocalyptic stories that grabs me so much.  They're not happy and lighthearted stories, and a majority of the time, they don't even have a ""happy"" ending (I'm looking at you, The Road!) Maybe it is just the simple notion of reading something, and being able to say ""Oh man, at least my life is going better than these people's lives!""  But I digress...  I came across this book, and after reading some of the reviews, I decided to check it out.The story centers around Seb and Melanie, two teenagers struggling to survive in this post apocalyptic landscape.  Seb is an orphan, who is being chased by cyborgs, who want him dead.  Pretty normal.  Melanie is dragged in to the adventure against her will, and is tasked with getting Seb to the Steam Academy for his own safety, among other reasons.  Together, they will learn to take care of themselves, and each other, in this dystopian landscape.I have been really enjoying this run that we have been having, of Young Adult novels that have actually been very good books.  Some people have the idea that, because the audience is younger, they need to be talked down to, to comprehend the story.  In my experience, being condescending is never a good strategy.  This book (and series, since I have read the next one already) manages to write this story in a way that would appeal to young adults, while at the same time, not talking down to them.  The characters are compelling, and I am ecstatic that this is the first in a book series, so I can continue to read The Adventures of Seb and Melanie in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R51QO5U4FJ6SI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJ52TJE#wasThisHelpful","R51QO5U4FJ6SI","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This time, he is trying to relax on a trip to Hawaii, when wouldn’t you know it, he stumbles upon an international plot against the United States, involving international terrorist groups, and caches of military grade missiles.  Don’t you hate it when that happens?  NCIS and the police do not believe that he is just an innocent bystander in this, and thinks he is intimately involved.  He, along with the “Bond Girl” of this novel, Leilani, have to stop the plot, and clear his name in the process.It is surprising that, after six installments of this series, I still enjoy the antics of Jack Lazar, and his cavalcade of leading ladies.  But it definitely is just as entertaining as the previous installments.  Jack is a fantastic character, as always, and Leilani is a great partner/hero/damsel-in-distress, just as the other ladies in the books have been.  While these books can probably be read individually, and in any order, I highly suggest you start from the beginning, and work your way through the exciting life of Jack Lazar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FGAU7IIDOCA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TSI2YUE#wasThisHelpful","R3FGAU7IIDOCA5","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was recommended this book by someone, and I was almost immediately turned off from the description on the purchase page.  Mat is a “geek-turned-hottie”?  A) that is a very clichéd main character type, and B), being a Geek and being attractive are not mutually exclusive.  You can be both….  BUT, I decided to look past that, and try the book in spite of my previous misgivings.The story centers around Jeanne and Mat, a bartender and politician, respectively, who cross each other’s paths at an engagement party.  And for whatever reason, they just seem to keep running into each other!  Is it fate?  Or is it because they are the two main characters in a romance novel?  MAYBE BOTH!?  The story follows their many romantic dalliances, and their budding relationship.  These two crazy kids are such different people!  Can their relationship ever work?  Yeah, probably.It’s funny, I don’t have a whole lot to say about this novel, at the end of the day.  It is a nice read, but nothing really stands out as spectacular, and I also can’t point to any real negatives in the story, either.  Which may be my main problem with this book:  there’s nothing to talk about.  It is a well written, straightforward romance novel, that has compelling and relatable lead characters, and is overall enjoyable.  And that’s it.  It is a little rare for me to finish a book, and not really have any strong feelings one way or the other.  I would recommend this book, if only because I have no major issues with it overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BGXIP3HA57SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MY3BW2Q#wasThisHelpful","R3BGXIP3HA57SS","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am normally not the type of person that reads nonfiction books.  It’s not that I don’t enjoy nonfiction, but I would much rather read a fantasy or sci-fi novel, if given the chance.  Moreover, I am a very big fan of historical fiction, which is the perfect melding of the two worlds.  When I came across this book, I noticed that it is filed under fiction and historical fiction, (although after reading, I don’t think that’s 100% accurate…) so I decided to check it out.It tells the story of Antonio Ponton, the first Hispanic person executed in the electric chair in the United States.  He was the troubled son of a tobacco farmer, who emigrated from Spain to Puerto Rico in 1870.  His father sent Antonio to Albany Law School in New York in 1911, but no one could have predicted what was to come next.  Antonio is convicted of murder, and executed by electric chair in 1916.  What is even more heartbreaking, however, is that he was wrongly executed.  This story tells the confluence of events that set in motion the events that led to this horrible injustice.The story that is being told in this book is an amazing read, but I have to say, the way that it was written leaves something to be desired.  It felt to me that the author would get bogged down in the details, instead of keeping the plot moving at an even pace.  Sometimes the slight deviations are welcome and add a lot of background to the story overall, and other times it sort of seems like filler, and I found myself skimming some parts, to get back to the main story.  Overall, though, I think it’s a compelling read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKPXI4YC3AITQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ORLRBS2#wasThisHelpful","RKPXI4YC3AITQ","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bone Wall is a dystopian novel, centered around twin sisters, Rimma and Angel.  They are tied together through powerful magic, and not only that, but when they are together, only one is visible to the outside world at a time.  They are thrust into a dangerous world that has been all but torn in two by two warring factions, that will stop at nothing to gain control of the entire planet.  The sisters not only have to contend with the warring factions, and the rapidly decaying planet, but also with the actions of each other.  Angel normally takes the path of peaceful conflict resolution, and always looking for the good in everyone in any situation, while Rimma is the fight first, as questions later type, that is looking for revenge over peace.  Together, they will keep each other safe, in this world that they are thrust into.The dystopian world the author creates is a very compelling setting.  It is a future that isn't actually that difficult to believe actually happening:  Polluted water supply, megacities in disarray, and two factions diametrically opposed in their core belief systems.  Sound familiar?  The twin sisters are fully realized characters, that are entirely likable and relatable.  The dynamic between the sisters' personalities, while somewhat obvious on the surface (passive vs aggressive), works perfectly with the idea of the two sisters not being visible at the same time.This is a fantastic Young Adult Sci Fi novel, that could be enjoyed by anyone.  I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GAV5E4RA6S3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFWFDAG#wasThisHelpful","R3GAV5E4RA6S3Z","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know why it is, but I have a knack for finding books that I very much enjoy, but are very hard to explain, plot-wise.  Enter A Hungry God by Pia Chaudhuri.  It is the story of two women, Aruna and Maya, who are brought together during a very bizarre chain of events, that involves magic, and blood, and an enchanted forest.  It sounds like it is a fantastical story, but it is really the story of these two women, and the trials and tribulations that they endure, on their path through life.For a story that has very fantastical elements, this novel seems to be a very personal story told by the author.  In her short biography on the Amazon page, it mentions that as a young child, she showed an innate ability for writing, that was nurtured by her mother, but she rebelled in later years, before giving in and following her ""destiny"".  Having that background information puts this particular novel in a different night.  It turns this intriguing mystical story into a compelling story of strong women that are not the ""damsels in distress"", but the heroes of the story.  It is refreshing to read a story that has strong female characters, although I am a little bummed that having a strong female character is something to be celebrated, because of the rarity.I very much enjoyed Pia's first novel, and will definitely be waiting patiently for the next one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OTZ09IQ3D9UB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1506061052#wasThisHelpful","R1OTZ09IQ3D9UB","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Plus, we are both complete fools. If only there was some kind of instruction manual to teach us how to earn money on our website, that is so easy, even fools like us could not possibly screw it up!This guide actually has a lot of good ideas.  It starts you out with the basics, and an overview of the different kinds of revenue streams that you can have, and then it delves deeper into each one.  From impression advertising to affiliate sales and marketing, there is definitely something that you can utilize, and would feel comfortable using for your blog.The explanations in the guide are very simple, and it offers tips on how to get the most out of each form of monetizing.  If acronyms like CPA, CPC, CPM, and CPV seem like pure gibberish to you, and you think one might be a type of accountant, then this guide is perfect for you.  It introduces you to these concepts (they are all types of ads, by the way), and how each works, and which would be most beneficial.

"I am a sucker for a good time travel story.  There is something about learning how each particular stories rules for time travel works, and wrapping your head around it.  This story not only has time travel, but ALIENS as well, I was completely on board from the start.Naami is from the latest 21st century.  She leads a group back in time to 1505, to change history.  It is there she meets Mohkave, a SON OF A Chief, who wants to gain some favor back in the eyes of his father, who is disappointed in him.  But they soon find out that they are not the only ones that are traveling back in time, to meddle in the affairs of human history.  Which is rude.  It was Naami's terrible idea first!  Avram and Lilith are aliens who have been steering the course of human history for a very long time.  And they are not about to let Naami ruin their carefully laid plans.While the time travel ideas do not work the way that I think they should (that's an entirely different discussion...), I very much enjoyed reading this author's take.  It was interesting, and complex, without being frustratingly so.  All of the main characters are interesting enough, and have unique perspectives on the situations that they have found themselves in.  I especially enjoyed the interaction between Naami and Mohkave (considering the latter met the former during a ""vision quest""), and am very interested in seeing the next installment in this series, to see where this story goes!Who knew the fate of the world was already fought for, in North Dakota, in 1505?","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CLBB0LSK5GV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEUODOK#wasThisHelpful","R1CLBB0LSK5GV2","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FBI Agent Joe Roberts has finally found that one person that completely changes his mind about love and romance.  Problem is, she is partnered with him, as a mole for the company that she is working for.  When Dr Madeline Price learns of a criminal network run through the medical facility that she works in, she is recruited to collect information for the FBI, to shut them down.  Joe, along with Police Chief Matt Connor (and his wife / Joe's sister), are out to bring back their quiet little town to what it was before the meth labs took over.  And boy, is this situation going to get methy.... Sorry.There are two competing story types in this novel:  Detective/Cop Thriller, and ""Forbidden Love"" Romance.  For me, I came into this book looking for the former story type, and not as interested in the latter.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy romance stories, as both the main, and side stories.  But I enjoyed this book as a thriller so much, that the romance part was a little bit of a distraction.  If both halves were equally compelling to read, I wouldn't have a problem at all, and would gladly give this book 5 stars.  The medical mystery that is the main focus of the book is excellent, and it was definitely worth the read, but I would have enjoyed it much more if the story wasn't sidetracked sporadically by the love stories.Bottom line, if you are looking for a romance-thriller novel, this might not be exactly what you're looking for, but if you're looking for a thriller-romance novel, you should check this out!

"Bea's life is very complicated.  Trying to cope with the death of her mother from a strange terminal illness, her and her father move to a small california town, for a fresh start.  There, she meets Luke, a 17 year old surfer, and they both fall pretty hard for each other.  Then this book is pretty straight forward, and it ends... WRONG!  It's called TWIST!  Did you think that was it?  Turns out, Bea's father is a fugitive, and running from the FBI for unknown reason.  And, a video of her and her boyfriend ""together"" somehow ends up on the internet, and is passed around like wildfire.  The story follows Bea and Luke (both main characters and narrators of the story), as they try to carry on with their lives, and try to find out what is really going on.I very much enjoyed this story.  There are a lot of twists and turns throughout (as there should be, with a name like that), and it kept me hooked all the way through.  I especially enjoyed the storytelling style used by the author.  The perspective switched from Bea to Luke, so the reader can see different points of view of the same story.  Not that there's a lot of backtracking or overlap, the author does a good job keeping things linear and consistent, while at the same time showing both points of view.  It is really well done, overall.This is being sold as a Young Adult novel.  We have had many Young Adult novels recently that have been good reads for all audiences, and I hope that the ""stigma"" of a book being in the YA section has been softened a bit, because this book definitely deserves to be given a chance by everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OEVQK2K39KF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBL6MBU#wasThisHelpful","R2OEVQK2K39KF2","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zara loves her brother, Zach.  She loves him so much, that she will do whatever it takes to help him out of the situation that he has found himself in.  Zach owes Cal a lot of money, and Cal knows exactly what he wants as a form of payment:  His sister.  The deal is simple:  Cal basically owns Zara for three months.  She has to do everything that he says, and comply with any of his darkest desires.  She reluctantly agrees, and soon finds out how far Cal is willing to go to get his moneys worth.  From BDSM to exhibitionism, Cal and Zara cover the gamut of sexual experiences.I have to say, I wasn't that big of a fan of this story.  That might be because I am not a ""huge"" erotica fan, but I have read several different stories that I have really enjoyed.  But it seemed to me that the overall story was just a flimsy excuse to get from one sec scene to the next.  There was a little bit of setup for all of the characters, but not a whole lot of development after that.  But hey, if that's what you're looking for, then by all means, jump right in:  The sex scenes are very good overall, and worth the price of admission, but I am looking for a little more character development in stories.The ending did leave some room for a next installment, but I don't know if I have enough interest in the characters to keep going.  Then again, the author certainly has talent, judging from the erotic scenes, so maybe a second installment will allow the author a chance to refine their story telling, and bring a much more character developing story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A8LIIRBJK9EA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LORA04E#wasThisHelpful","R1A8LIIRBJK9EA","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for a book on how to properly make yogurt at work at my desk, and I was thoroughly disappointed...I'm kidding, of course. This book is not about making the delicious and healthy snack; It is a book about creating a very efficient and happy work culture, and how to help all of the people in the group grow. I will admit, I wasn't that familiar with this type of team building idea, but as a new small business owner, with a group of five people total, I thought I would check out some ideas on how to make everyone's workplace a little better.One of the things that stuck out to me was that he says that there is more to Agile and Lean practices than doing things exactly by the book.  The best way to implement the ideas in this book is to take them as a jumping off point, and tailor them to your workplace, the best way that you see fit.  That is what the author tends for you to do with this guide.  I think there is a lot of good advice in this guide, and you could learn a lot from this author.The main problem that I have, is that there are many errors in spelling, grammar, and entire sentences being in incorrect places, things that a good editor would have easily seen, and fixed.  I think that is what this book was ultimately missing:  A second pass by someone, to tighten things up, and make things flow smoother.However, the ideas in this book are interesting, and if you can look past the issues in grammar and such, this is definitely worth a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R214BG79KY23EE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LF4U5U0#wasThisHelpful","R214BG79KY23EE","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alright, I know that if you see that this is skewed towards 7-9 year olds, and you don't have any children, you might dismiss this right away.  It's a book about animals going on an adventure, and it's not for you.  But I think that, even if you don't have children to read this to, you should still give it a chance.It follows Banna and Bree, two baboons that are transported to The Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda.  Once they arrive, they meet the rest of the wildlife, and soon learn firsthand the dangers that they all face.  Poachers have been capturing or killing the animals for their own profit, and they have their eyes on the gorillas, who are worth a lot to them.  The animals band together, and make plans to protect each other, and their land, from these invaders.I'm a little torn when it comes to this book.  It is really well written, and it was a good story overall.  I enjoyed the interactions between the different kinds of animals, and all of their different personalities.  My main problem is, I don't know if the targeted audience is correct for this.  In some points it is definitely skewed younger, but when the animals plan their defense and attacks, it is kind of like being in a war-room for a country's military, planning their tactical strikes.  Plus, the whole ""poachers"" plot line is a little dark for kids that age, if you ask me.  Their entire profession centers around killing or catching animals to sell, that's kind of dark for a kids book.  I would say that this book would skew just a little higher than is currently stated on the books page.  Maybe put it to a YA audience instead?It is the juxtaposition of a purported children's book dealing with such adult topics, that I have to give it four stars.

"Note to evil spirits out to kidnap people for their own purposes:  DO NOT kidnap someone that is married to a supernatural expert, because you're going to have a bad time.  But that is EXACTLY what happens in “The Anarchy Scroll”.  The expert, and friend, set off on an adventure that sends them to a different world where magic is prevalent, and what we call ""supernatural"" in this world, in the other is ""regularnatural"".  The only way to stop this rising tide of darkness is for them to find The Anarchy Scroll, and save that world, and ours.This book brought up an interesting question for me:  in the future, are the “ancient scrolls” that people are going to be searching for going to be on Kindles?  Honestly, you never see paper in the far flung future, so these “world-saving MacGuffins” are going to have to be data stored on thumb drives, or on e-readers.  That seems like kind of a bummer to me.  Anyway…This book is a very interesting read.  I love a good supernatural story, so I was immediately invested in the story.  I joke about the Macguffin, but honestly, every story like this, where people ""go on an adventure to save the world"", have something that they are adventuring for, and are ultimately trying to acquire or unacquire.  It is a solid paranormal story overall, with interesting and fully realized characters, but this book does have some issues.  The author tends to explain things that are inconsequential to the story, and over-explains things that are actually relevant.  It took me a little out of the story each time it happened, and I found myself skimming those parts, to find where the story picks up again.  But then again, there are parts of even my favorite books I skim through in the same way.Problems aside, this is an enjoyable book.

But what if I told you that there was an actual, real-life cat that has survived harsh wartime conditions, and even won a medal?The disappointingly ordinarily named cat Simon (considering how awesome this cat is)  is smuggled aboard the HMS Amethyst, a Modified Black Swan-class sloop of the Royal Navy during WWII.  He, and “ship dog” Peggy have their own fight aboard the ship:  Rats.  Yes, while the British Naval Servicemen were fighting Chinese Communists, Simon was fighting a scourge of rats aboard the ship!  When the Amethyst runs aground, and is stranded for 101 days, Simon fights his fight, to save the food stores for the men aboard, so they could fight for us all at home.  There is more to the story, and I won’t spoil everything, but Simon did win a medal for “Animal Gallantry in Wartime”, which is military talk for “Wicked Brave Cat”.Alright, I will admit, when I first looked at this book, I thought it was ridiculous.

"The story follows Detective Jason Scarsdale and Police Analyst Dani Mueller are investigating a murder in Austin.  The victim in question, however, is a suspected pedophile, killed in unusual circumstances.  Both main characters have had children, so they both obviously have a personal connection to the acts perpetrated by these people.  But Dani, who changed her name and moved away to escape her past, has an even more personal investment in this case.  Her own 10 year old daughter was raped and murdered, and the man responsible was set free.  Obviously seeing that verdict as unacceptable, Dani takes the law into her own hands, and takes care of the killer.  Now, in a different city, she is trying to leave her past behind, but it is quickly catching up with her.There are obviously two main characters in this story, but I was much more focused on Dani's side of things.  She was a very compelling person to get to know, and to travel with on this journey.  Reading what her and Jason have to go through solidifies in my mind that that line of work would not be for me, because I don't think I would be able to look at each case objectively.  It was interesting to see the two investigators wrestle with their own emotions and background, in order to do the job that they are tasked with doing.  The story itself moves along at a brisk pace, without a lot of lulls in the drama.  The twists and turns throughout added to the already suspenseful narrative, and the result is a gripping and thought provoking police procedural.If you are looking for a compelling crime drama, with many shades of grey, you should definitely check this out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10QGXSWB6X4AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GYGDZ5G#wasThisHelpful","R10QGXSWB6X4AJ","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again, we delve into the complex relationship and love life of Kelly and Sam, in the latest installment of the ""Experience"" series.  As with the previous installments, this book explores once again the ever evolving kinks and interests of the couple, when Sam surprises Kelly with a trip to Europe.  It's not just a sightseeing trip, however:  Sam meets up with an old friend, who takes them on a tour that is more than likely not in any run of the mill travelogues out there.  They are introduces to clubs and gatherings that Kelly didn't even know that she was missing out on, culminating with a session with an actual dominatrix!As soon as I saw that Kelly and Sam see a dominatrix in this book, my first thought was ""Yeah, of course they are!  I'm surprised that hasn't been brought up yet!""  Which is not a bad thing, mind you.  I just saw it as the obvious progression of this couples relationship.  If they wanted to keep getting more and more adventurous, this was definitely going to be on that path eventually.  Kelly and Sam's relationship continues to be a compelling read, and I still enjoy their relationship a little more than I like the erotic sections of this series.  And those are very well written, as well!If you have been following this series up to this point, this is a no-brainer.

"Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water…. Now you have to worry about drug smuggling surfers!  Wait, what?  I have to admit, “Drug Smuggling Surfers” is what convinced me to check this book out, and I am glad I did.This is a true story of a group of friends who are airport baggage handlers by day, and surfers by the rest of their time.  They come up with a plan to smuggle drugs into LAX with the help of accomplished marijuana smuggler, August Taracina.  They are making tons of money, until the airport changes procedures and security, and they are forced out of the smuggling trade.  But they soon find another, more lucrative way to make money:  A heist.  They are able to pull the whole thing off, though, but things don’t turn out that easy.I had a couple of issues with this book.  It was an exciting and entertaining read, but every once in a while it seemed to languish in details that was not pertinent to the story.  There were several instances where I was reading, and thought “Wait, why do I need to know this?”, and most of the time, it didn’t really come back around and pay off.  It also tends to change tone in places.  One minute it is written like it is trying to give an honest and concise account of what happened, the next it’s a seemingly exaggerated description about different characters escapades, mostly concerning August.  This book does list 2 different authors, so that might be where the disconnect of the two styles comes into play.Amazon classifies this book as a Memoir, but I couldn’t really find any evidence stating that this story actually took place.  However, regardless if it happened or not, it is still worth the read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R367GODIL06B68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007AITXOO#wasThisHelpful","R367GODIL06B68","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Man, Michael Corrigan really likes historical fiction, huh?  Fortunately for me, so do I!  After previously reading and enjoying “Mulligan”, a book set during the Irish Potato Famine, I decided to check out what else this author has to offer.Down the Highway is a story told by two old friends, Terrance O’Hara and James Dean (no, not THAT James Dean), reminiscing about their past adventures.  And what adventures they had!  During their trip across England in 1962, they met such legends as Bob Dylan and Ringo Star, and were witness to the construction of the Berlin Wall.  They also reminisce about more personal, or “intimate” moments in their travels, especially Pat, the third piece in the love triangle that forges between the two old friends.While I was reading this, I kept thinking “Wait, so this is “Forrest Gump: European Vacation”?”  Which isn’t a bad thing (Forrest Gump is an amazing movie), but it definitely had a similar feel.  It was entertaining to see these two guys interacting with such monumentally influential people, before they became important figures in society.  I also enjoyed the relationship between Terrance and James that is portrayed in both the flashback stories, and current day.  They both felt very genuine and fleshed out as characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed listening in on their conversation about their past.It is an entertaining, and relatively short read.  I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBC1N1N35C28D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5GMC7U#wasThisHelpful","RBC1N1N35C28D","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Human Beings only utilize 10% of their brain power.  Imagine what we could do if we used 100%.”  Sounds like an over-the-top tagline to a movie that has actually already been made a couple of times recently, right?  Well, A) the whole 10% thing is not actually correct, and B) in some areas, we actually use our brains TOO MUCH.Have you ever had a decision to make, and vastly over thought every possible hypothetical outcome, that it actually caused real life stress?  Trying to factor in how people will think about the decision is another mistake that people make.  What this book tries to get you to do, is to make more decisions based on intuition, rather than outside factors and motivators.  To rely on intuition, and let your sub-conscious have a louder voice in the debate, allowing you to focus your brainpower on the more important things in your life.This book is very well segmented into the different ideas and rules set forth by Rajith Rajappan.  It is easy to understand and follow, as far as self help books go, and manages to not be “super preachy” about his ideas.  He even states that not all of the ideas he puts forth will work for everyone, and you should instead focus on the ideas that work best for you.  No really, it’s a self help book that doesn't spend an obscene amount of time convincing you that their guidelines are going to work, and less time actually going over the guidelines themselves!  It’s a fairly quick read (49 pages by Amazon’s count), that is simple, and to the point.  I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SM0TN5K4T9IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYSIF56#wasThisHelpful","R2SM0TN5K4T9IX","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the final Hobbit movie came out this December (seriously, THREE hobbit movies?!?!  Come on…), I was ready and raring to go for a fantasy novel full of dragons once again.  I realized that I had never actually finished The Dragoneers Saga, a series that I very much enjoyed, so I decided to end this epic dragon saga, as well!Honestly, I don’t think I can give a concise summary of a sixth and final book in a series if I wanted to.  But this is obviously where the human fecal matter collides with the air circulating machine, and it pits King Richard against pretty much everyone that you have come to know and love in this series.  And it’s not even that simple, either.  Even though this is the final book in the series, it does not stop the author from introducing even more terrifying foes for the protagonists to tangle with amidst everything else.  Who will live?  Who will die?  Find out in the thrilling conclusion of The Dragoneers Saga!  That last part should be read in your best radio announcer voice…Endings are hard.  For every incredible ending to a story (The Dark Tower series, Breaking Bad), there are terrible endings (That show where it was all in that kid with the snowglobe’s mind?).  They are obviously not an easy thing to write, both in execution, and actually bringing yourself to write it.  I mean, come on, you CREATED these characters and this story, now you’re supposed to close the book on them, literally? While I have a feeling that we will see the characters in future works, I have to say that this is a hugely satisfying ending to an already fantastic series.I would not really suggest jumping onto this series with this volume, but I would absolutely recommend you checking this book out, if you are a Tolkien fan, or a fantasy fan in general.  Both the series, and this final volume, are a very enjoyable read from start to finish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XETNX6NE8I4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQRJGUM#wasThisHelpful","R1XETNX6NE8I4C","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cloud Atlas is one of the most interesting books I have read in the last five years.  That book consists of six different stories, each of which is in another one of the stories, in one shape or another.  It was an interesting idea, that worked well in conveying different peoples points of view, in similar circumstances, and how we are all connected by these experiences.Epiphany uses this idea, although in a much more concise and focused way.  It concerns 2 different stories. One focuses on Rosetta Melki, a tarot card reader, and Matthew Weissler, a finance executive, who are magically brought together by time traveling sprites from another era.  That “other era” being the 18th century, where author Edward Lillibridge is working on a fantasy novel, that turns out to be anything but fantasy.  It deals with an empire that is obsessed with gold, and the aforementioned sprites that they are oppressing, whose only wish is for there to be a kind of “Currency of Kindness”.  This book is actually a history book, chronicling the beginnings of the global monetary system, and is filled with warnings of the past, and a possible roadmap for the future.  Rosetta and Matthew need to work together, in order to bring about the Silvering, a new age for this world.For Sonya Deanna Terry’s first printed work, this is a very ambitious novel.  It perfectly balances the two stories/time periods, and somehow manages to make both halves better as the whole work.  The real world storytelling and the fantasay novel type stories might not necessarily work 100% on their own, but together, they create an intriguing and mesmerizing story, that I am very excited to see how it ends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XO5S9W09GSKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RF4A9YG#wasThisHelpful","R2XO5S9W09GSKY","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone is looking to make their lives better in some fashion.  Whether it’s with more money, a better job, or better relationships with family and friends, everyone is trying to make things better for themselves.  The real question is, are there lengths that you would NOT go to, to accomplish this task?  Dari Ghaznavi would.  And did.Dari is a man who grew up in Pakistan, who pulls himself out of the gang lifestyle, and joins the Pakistan Air Force.  That eventually was not enough for Dari, so he moves to America, in pursuit of “The American Dream”.  Which obviously involves running drugs as a pilot over the Mexico/America border.  And you would also be surprised to find out that that isn’t necessarily the craziest thing that happened to Dari in his life’s journey.This is a no holds barred account of Dari’s life, that at times delves into the unbelievable.  And I don’t mean “Then Dari totally fought a dragon”.  I mean “Then Dari did some crazy things that he honestly should not have survived, but he is the author, so I guess he did…”.  It is an intriguing read, that deals with money, family, and religion, among other things.  Dari’s story  is a captivating look at the Pakistani life, the Islamic faith, and the ill-conceived notion of the American Dream.  I highly recommend checking it out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KGNNBOL65FRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2OOEIE#wasThisHelpful","R1KGNNBOL65FRZ","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gifford Ulrich is living on the streets of St Louis, when a string of murders perpetrated against homeless people is taking place.  He decides to pack up and move from downtown, into the possibly safer (and possibly more dangerous), Benoit Neighborhood, full of abandoned buildings full of drug dealers and users, and other less than savory folk.  He is thrust in the middle of a horrible situation, created by even more horrible people, and he must use his previous military training to survive.This is the first book in a planned series of books, with Gifford Ulrich as the main character.  Gifford is an intriguing and troubled character, that makes for a fantastic read.  What this book does really well is portraying the depressing reality of the large amount of homeless American soldiers in this country, most of whom suffer from some sort of PTSD. It brings to light issues facing our service men and women today, and also shows that the idea of “if they would just get a JOB, they wouldn’t be homeless!” isn’t always so cut and dry.  It puts a human face on an issue that most Americans do not want to think about, or confront in any way, because that would admit how poorly we take care of the people that take care of our country.  Sorry, let me step down form my soapbox, and continue my review…This book is a fantastic thriller mystery novel, and a great first installment in what I hope to be a long running series in the future!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F5T5I9QVW5H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXVM6B6#wasThisHelpful","R1F5T5I9QVW5H1","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Demon Days is a story about a large group of friends, each with a more ludicrous name than the one before them, living in New York City in 2035.  Who just happen to have to deal with a massive crime wave, full of kidnappings and murders, perpetrated by demons.  From outer space.  You read that right.  It is a fight for survival in this brave new world!The main problem that I had with this book is the overall tone.  Sure, the author is trying for this zany and crazy feel, but it comes across as trying too hard at times.  I mean, there’s a character whose voice is auto-tuned all of the time (albeit, he IS a demon…).  The story itself is written rally well, and I enjoyed it for that in itself, but I did not enjoy the personality of the book.  Plus, it had NINETY SIX references that linked to passages in the back of the book, that would make you click each reference link, read a sentence or two of flavor text, and go back to the story.  Sure, they are optional, but it kind of took me out of the story each time I had to do that.However, I would say that you should read the sample of the book before you make the final decision.  It did not connect with me in a style sense, but the story overall was solid.  If you can look past the style issues that I had (or if you enjoy them), then I would definitely suggest you check it out.  If not, then I might suggest another work by this author that I very much enjoyed, Zombie Ever After?","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BM6MCZANG2F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4G7DQY#wasThisHelpful","R2BM6MCZANG2F9","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw the term “space opera” to refer to this book, the first thing I thought of was “FLASH!!!!  AAAAHHHHH!!! Savior of the Universe!!”, which as we all know, is the worst Queen song ever written.  However, I am a sci-fi fan, and I do enjoy dipping my toe into new YA series, so I checked it out.The story centers around Guy Erma, a 13 year old boy who has had a lifelong dream of joining the Dome Elite, which are kind of like ""Space Marines"".  He teams up with an unlikely ally:  Prince Teodor, who has recently been kidnapped.  They must work together if they want to survive.  It is a story of action, danger, blade fighting, cyborgs, shape shifting aliens, and Gorons, which are, in the easiest way I can describe them, RACING CATS!I have to say that YA novels can be hit or miss sometimes.  For every “Harry Potter” or “The Hunger Games”, you get “One That Isn’t Good, That I Don’t Know The Name Of…”.  But I am happy to say that I really enjoyed this book.  It has a lot of setting up to do, considering this is the first book in a series, but that’s obviously to be expected.  The sci-fi elements seemed grounded in the story, and very natural.  There was a definite lack of actual opera, though, which was disappointing…This book is a great YA novel:  It’s fun, exciting, and a blast from start to finish.  I highly recommend it, and will definitely be on the lookout for more adventures of Guy Erma in the future!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBXQH4AC7TKQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU5XPXC#wasThisHelpful","RBXQH4AC7TKQY","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not necessarily the “targeted demographic” for The Adventures of Jo Jo.  It is a book comprised of eleven short stories centered around Jo Jo, written as bedtime stories for the children of the author, James Lawless.  I decided to check it out regardless, since they are short stories, and if I didn’t enjoy them, I wasn’t out that much time and money.There are a wide variety of adventures that eight year old Jo Jo finds herself in, ranging from meeting Rudolf (as in, The Red Nosed Reindeer), to helping squirrels cross the street.  …Alright, that doesn’t SOUND great when I describe it, but the stories themselves are whimsical, and fun.  They are all that kind of lighthearted yarn that is perfect to read to your child for bedtime.  Except for The Moving Door Handle.  That was kind of creepy, honestly…This book might not be one that anyone reading this review will pick up for themselves.

"I know what kind of book you have been clamoring for all this time.  You are looking for a book like Twilight, but the male in the relationship is human (Donovan), and the female (Cathren) is a zombie, and instead of all of the melodrama and moody everything about Twilight, you have a much more upbeat, fun, even humorous storyline throughout the book.  Also, you weren't actually looking for a book like Twilight at all, and the card you were thinking of was the six of clubs.  MAGIC!In the midst of a zombie outbreak, Cathren and Donovan are trying to survive a zombie outbreak, as is the rest of the world.  The main difference, however, is that Cathren has been bitten by a zombie.  But she, for some reason, has not went “full zombie” as of yet.  The couple are trying to deal with that situation, as well as the aforementioned zombies, and other survivors, to find peace in this world.When I saw this book compared to Warm Bodies, I was a little skeptical, as that book did not compel me in any way.  But after reading this, I guess that is because that character was “full zombie”, whereas Cathren is something in-between.  It turned the fairly straightforward relationship of the two main characters, into a much more complicated and interesting one.In an entertainment market that has been completely inundated with zombie stories in the last couple of years, this is a breath of fresh air from a pair of rotting lungs of a shambling corpse that is RIGHT BEHIND YOU WATCH OUT!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VLWIWK81ZZFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LAK1ATE#wasThisHelpful","R2VLWIWK81ZZFM","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With everything that has been going on in the world today, especially involving Russia, I have been very interested in learning more about the USSR.  So when I stumbled across this thriller by Tim Tignor, it made my purchase of this book a no brainer.Alex Ferris is ex-CIA, who leaves the agency to become an international private investigator.  Which hasn't been working out that well, and hasn't exactly been paying the bills.  One day, he received a phone call from his twin brother, asking for his help, who very quickly ends up dead by an apparent ""suicide"".  While investigating in San Francisco, he uncovers a plot being run by a group in the Soviet Union, that is trying to steal US intellectual properties, in order to use them to create new patents, and bring huge amounts of wealth into Russia.While Putin himself is not in this book, we do have a fairly good replacement:  Vasily Karpov.  He is an interesting character, and the most compelling part of the book, in my opinion.  He was an ambitious and cut-throat KGB officer, that only wanted what was best for Mother Russia.  I enjoyed Karpov so much, that him by himself would have been enough for me!

"This book is an amalgamation of several different sci-fi tropes rolled into one.  James Hood was a Captain in the Earth Defense Force,  when humanity first ventured into space.  Transported on their trip by rockets made by the Epherium corporation, the colonists set out to find another habitable planet for the human race to colonize.  Then suddenly, ALIENS!  Sorry.  The remainder of the human race is thrust into a war against an alien race, which they eventually, and barely, survived.  During and after the war, secrets about the Epherium Corporation are discovered, revealing what their plans for humanity really are.First, I want to say that, even though I say that there are “several different sci-fi tropes”, there is a really good balance overall.  None of the separate stories seem rushed, or smashed into the middle of the book, just because they could. The odd part is that all of this stuff is included, and it is only the FIRST VOLUME in a new series!  The character of Hood is a compelling character, as well.  Sure, he is the “savior of the human race”, and “everything rests on his shoulders”, but would you really want to read a story like this with an inconsequential main character?  How boring would that be?  “And Captain James Hood just kicked back and read a book, as the Earth was saved by someone who really should have a book written about them, to be honest…” …..Great, now I want to write that book…..A somewhat straightforward start to a sci-fi series, that I am really excited about continuing in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BRREX5EIUIMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKBISIE#wasThisHelpful","R3BRREX5EIUIMI","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Historical fiction can be a tricky genre to write.  The story that you write could be fantastic, but if the “history” part of the book is uninteresting, you’re kind of sunk before you push away from the dock.  it is also important that YOUR story, and the TRUE story, mesh together well, and believably.  You can’t have a story about cyber bullying in Ancient Rome, it wouldn’t make any sense.  The difficulties that arise with this type of storytelling are why I am drawn to historical fiction, and especially this book.The story centers around Michael Mulligan, an Irish Freedom Fighter around the time of the Irish potato Famine, and the American Civil War.  Michael emigrated from Ireland because of the Famine, and, among other amazing things that happened to him in his lifetime, found himself fighting in our Civil War.  Numerous plot lines and motivations shape this haunted man into the person that you grow to know in this engaging and fascinating read.The worries about historical fiction that I mentioned earlier are completely unfounded in this book:  Mulligan’s story is a personal and harrowing story, and the historical context makes it all the more incredible.  The author is able to weave these two aspects of the story very well, and the end result is an all-around great read, for any fan of the genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TCT5CXYJ4B1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BA0E7IU#wasThisHelpful","R1TCT5CXYJ4B1C","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Siri’s Heart revolves around Siri Wright, a Vegas exotic dancer and “adult entertainer”, that loved what she did, and did who paid for the privilege.  Her happy and exciting life is interrupted, when she is called back to her hometown, to take care of her injured mother.  Leaving her previous life behind, for a much quieter and secluded one, she happens to meet Aurei Moore, a helicopter pilot and neighbor.  When she first lays eyes on him, she feels that electricity that she felt when she was still in Vegas.  And the feeling is definitely mutual.  They have an immediate connection (wink wink!), and lets just say it definitely earns its “erotica” genre status!For an author’s debut novel, I have to say that this is a very well written story.  The characters of Siri and Aurei are compelling and likeable, and I was genuinely interested in their stories as they played out.  Which is fortunate, since this is Book 1 in the Siri Saga;  It would be bad to have a planned series with characters that the reader could not care less about.  But, if you’re reading this review, you probably just want to know how this stacks up as an “erotica” book.  It is definitely racier than your average romance novel, without being shockingly obscene, just for the sake of it.  It seems like a genuinely real relationship between the two characters, and I am definitely interested in reading more in this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15CMN2NLYSIAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NDAS3RQ#wasThisHelpful","R15CMN2NLYSIAV","A1NLWXTRON9H0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NLWXTRON9H0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Don't let the relatively large budget fool you. The Cannon Group was flush with junk bond cash at the time, and greenlighting practically everything, including this pointless mashup of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and BLADE RUNNER. Supermodel Kathy Ireland was hired for the lead, despite having a speaking voice like Minnie Mouse and all the acting ability of a deer in the headlights. (As far as acting goes, she fits right in with the rest of the cast.)It's the top-drawer riffing that makes this fifth season episode so enjoyable: Mike and the 'bots are not only improving Kathy's dialogue, but doing such beautifully arcane throwaway jokes as one referencing Laurence Olivier in THE ENTERTAINER -- yeah, this is the kind of thing I really like -- and, in a display of early '90s über-geekiness, there's a LOTR reference, years before the Peter Jackson movies.

"The RiffTrax shorts compilations can be hit or miss, but PLAYS WITH THEIR SHORTS is one of their better packages. There's not a dud among the comedy offerings on this disc.If there's a theme here, it seems to be how paranoid American society was in the mid-twentieth century. ""What it Means to be an American"" is a propaganda film that becomes increasingly unhinged as the stentorian narrator contrasts the virtues of American life with that of the godless Commies, while ""Teenagers on Trial"" raises the apocalyptic threat of juvenile delinquency. The view of teen life in ""Understanding Your Ideals"" turns borrowing your dad's car into an existential crisis, while the wartime ""Women in Blue"" demonstrates that women can do men's jobs, which America would work hard to forget just a few years later.""Constance Bennett's Daily Beauty Rituals"" squeezes a lot of useful, Depression-era beauty tips into five minutes (such as, have a servant make sure your bath is at the proper temperature).

"Loosely based on SEVEN AGAINST THEBES, OEDIPUS AT COLONUS, and a handful of comic books, HERCULES UNCHAINED turns a game of mix 'n match mythology into Steve Reeves' second (and final) outing as the title character, who must escape the clutches of the Lydian queen, Omphale, in time to save his wife Iole and his hometown of Thebes from a war between two power-mad brothers.It sounds more exciting than it actually is, but there's the riffing to make up for it. Truth is, I give the edge to the host segments this time: not only do we get Crow and Servo's spirited debate on puppet ontology and classification, but there's Mike Nelson's priceless portrayal of a latter-day Steve Reeves, and the SoL crew in ""hedonistic"" Roman drag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C81VJ63ILU7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004B0US5M#wasThisHelpful","R1C81VJ63ILU7Y","A3OD9DU3A0NCCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OD9DU3A0NCCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The words ""French pantomime artist"" can strike terror into anyone's heart, but the eight movies (five features and three shorts) in this collection are still worth watching. The influence of Jerry Lewis and Jacques Tati on Pierre Etaix is inescapable, but Etaix's character -- not as juvenile as Lewis's, not as sentimental as Tati's -- would happily settle into bourgeois society if he could, but the material world and the people in it simply won't let him. The character is a misfit existing on the fringes of consensus reality.The movies are wry as hell, and in ""Yoyo,"" Etaix attempts a slapstick mash-up of silent comedy and Fellini-inspired autobiographical fantasy -- not a winning combination.

"Richard Schickel at 82, taking a leisurely, rambling journey through the history of (mostly American) cinema, noting that what he liked as a younger viewer he probably likes now -- with qualifications.This isn't some tiresome list of masterpieces, or for that matter, a niche list of anti-masterpieces. They're largely familiar fare, though Schickel does direct our attention to such underrated genre pictures as AIR FORCE and NONE SHALL ESCAPE. These brief essays are most fun when Schickel delivers his informed, contrarian opinions on sacred cows: that M, for example, has been coasting on its reputation as a great film; that THE MALTESE FALCON and GONE WITH THE WIND are not particularly interesting to watch; that Frank Capra was a better filmmaker and Orson Welles a worse one than we've been lead to believe; and, mortifying for a professional critic, his admission that he just doesn't get The Rules of the Game. But he brings something extra to his consensus views too, such as his summary of TAXI DRIVER as ""perhaps the most terrifying great movie ever.""It's not a strictly linear, chronological take on Schickel's lifelong love of movies; it takes interesting detours and backtracks, ending for no particular reason in 1987 (BABETTE'S FEAST and WINGS OF DESIRE, anyone?).

"This is one strange mama jama of a movie. Coleman Francis's 1961 directorial debut is not only one of the last (and worst) of the ""atomic monster"" movies of the 1950s, it's also a trial run for his next feature, that incoherent melodrama THE SKYDIVERS (1963). Tor Johnson is a scientist, fleeing through the desert from his KGB pursuers, when a nuclear bomb just happens to go off. Wackiness ensues.The movie was shot without sound, so instead of dialogue there's Coleman Francis's stream-of-consciousness narration: ""Jim Archer. Joe's partner.

As in THE SKYDIVERS, there's a trigger-happy cop in an airplane, shooting at someone below (in this case, a guy who's not guilty of anything except lousy acting). There are the ""trademark Coleman Francis butt shots,"" and Francis himself in a cameo as a lazy gas station attendant.

"Howard Waldrop's stories are proof, if you need it, that science fiction isn't a collection of tropes (far future, space travel, technology, etc.); it's a way of seeing things. While there's no such thing as a typical Waldrop story, a familiar Waldrop protagonist keeps surfacing: working class, tough-minded, practical, contrarian. This is the character who has to figure out how to live when the bottom drops out of his universe (""Calling Your Name,"" ""King of Where-I-Go,"" ""Mr. Goober's Show"").But then there's the sheer otherness of the bulk of his stories: a thirteen-year-old African boy obsessed with writing a history play; secret agent Kit Marlowe, dispatched to terminate the sorcerer John Faust; an obsessed American director using CGI to create a French New Wave art film starring himself; a wily sheriff vs. H.G. Wells' Martian invaders in 1898 Texas; Mickey, Donald, and Goofy at the end of time; and have you heard the one about the three Romans and a centaur? (""The only way I'll write a fantasy story is as if it were happening to truck drivers,"" says the author.)Science fiction, Waldrop keeps reminding us, is a great way not to make money: he points to ""US"" (included here), the shorter, better version of an idea that Philip Roth ran with in the later novel THE PLOT AGAINST AMERICA, as Exhibit A in a long career of one-of-a-kind, Hugo- and Nebula-nominated, perennial best-of-the-year-anthology stories that hardly anyone seems to know about.You should get to know them.

By the way, if you haven't yet seen ""The Creeping Terror,"" it's a terrible micro-budget 1964 movie produced, directed, and edited by its lead actor, Vic Savage, and it reaches depths of incoherence, cheapness, and cinematic incompetence worthy of Ed Wood. It's so unintentionally hilarious that it barely needs the MST3K treatment, but I'm happy to have it; Mike and the 'bots hit this one out of the ballpark with one of the show's funniest barrages of riffs, ever, and that's while barely acknowledging the director's undisguised foot and leg fetishism. This is an episode for the ages.As for the other episodes, ""The Skydivers"" (1963), the second film in the infamous Coleman Francis trilogy, is a bizarre melodrama about an extramarital affair that leads to murder, without anything actually happening onscreen. Like ""The Creeping Terror,"" it's a Mike-era masterpiece of savage riffing, but ""Skydivers"" reminds me more of a Daniel Clowes fever dream than of anything else in the history of cinema. It's unwatchable, but unmissable.After that, the Joel-era episode ""Catalina Caper"" (1967) and season six's ""Bloodlust!"" (1959) are disappointing by comparison. ""Catalina Caper"" is a beach party crime comedy with the anodyne Tommy Kirk, a musical number by a high-as-a-kite Little Richard, and the unfunny pratfalls of Robert Donner and Jim Begg.""Bloodlust!"" (1961) has Shaggy, Fred, Daphne, and Velma in a ridiculous version of ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" which explains everything. It substitutes shock effects (boiled heads, etc.) for suspense, features future Brady Bunch star Robert Reed squeezed into a skintight T-shirt, and has a Vincent Price knockoff as the maniacal hunter. Interesting that Crow's wisecrack ""Scooby-Doo, the Movie"" was both accurate and prescient, 'cause just a few years later...This disc's short is a considerable improvement. Two city kids enjoy a working vacation on ""Uncle Jim's Dairy Farm,"" which Mike and the 'bots rip to shreds, of course, in one of the funniest shorts in the show's entire run.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H4LJCRWSN54J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YT9IT2Y#wasThisHelpful","R3H4LJCRWSN54J","A3OD9DU3A0NCCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OD9DU3A0NCCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Solid, swinging, no-frills jazz recorded live at a New Jersey nightclub. The set list is about evenly divided between repertory jazz tunes and pleasant if not-too-memorable originals, and Bob Ackerman, who carries the weight of the solo space on tenor, flute, and clarinet, is a lively and engaging player.The DVD duplicates the CD's contents, but was filmed with a stationary camera, and the video resolution is atrocious.

"Apparently no one alive now knows what a ""swing parade"" is, but who cares? Even without the riffing, this movie would be worth watching for one of Curly Howard's last performances before his career-ending stroke, for Louis Jordan singing his R&B hit, ""Caldonia,"" and for rare footage of the great Connee Boswell singing ""Stormy Weather."" (Much fun is made of her elaborate dresses, which concealed her paralyzed legs from the audience.)Gale Storm (which sounds like a stripper's name) would go on to become a 'fifties TV star, but here she's the more interesting half of a romantic couple faced with various money and legal troubles. The disc gives you the option of watching this corny but amusing 1946 time capsule with or without the riffing, but the jokes do kick it up another level.

"There's a whole lotta Mehldau goin' on in this 2006 recording, but Moller's arrangements of classical and pop tunes are so devilishly clever, and so well played, that he'll win you over anyway. ""Clair de Lune"" becomes an unrecognizable juggernaut, the poco allegretto of Brahms's Third Symphony is now a 5/4 montuno -- Brahms meets salsa -- and Sting's ""When the Angels Fall"" is heard as an insistently rhythmic nocturne.

"If ERASERHEAD's Henry Spencer had a cinematic father, it's surely Dr. Henry Krasker, the eccentric psychic sleuth of THE DEAD TALK BACK (1957). The amazing salt-and-pepper hairdo is a dead giveaway, and Dr. Krasker's obsessions, including a radio that communicates with the dead, and a blonde cadaver he keeps in a display case in his lab, are over-the-top weird. It's pretty funny for a super low-budget supernatural whodunit, but it's preceded (and almost blown out of the water) by the short, ""The Selling Wizard,"" which demonstrates why Anheuser-Busch got out of the ice cream display business and concentrated on selling cheap, crappy tasting beer.HOBGOBLINS (1988), the sleaziest horror/comedy of 1988, is GREMLINS as softcore (very soft!) porn. A wise old security guard instructs his young, minimum wage apprentice in the ways of fighting the murderous, mind-controlling hand puppets that escape from a magical film vault to terrorize the city, which seems to consist entirely of the red light district. It's risible, but not terribly funny; it's a failed comedy, after all.Bill Rebane is nobody's fool. Having abandoned his 1961 Chicago-based horror movie after his investors refused to put up additional funds, he sold the uncompleted footage to exploitation king Herschell Gordon Lewis, who retitled the film MONSTER A GO-GO, releasing it in 1965 on a double bill with Lewis's own MOONSHINE MOUNTAIN. Rebane went on to film THE GIANT SPIDER INVASION (1975), and to run for governor of Wisconsin as the Reform Party candidate.What can one say about MONSTER A GO-GO? It's a low budget movie so inane, so inept, and so dull it makes MANOS look like THE SEVENTH SEAL. (Unlike MANOS, an over-the-top anti-masterpiece fueled by its director's sexual obsessions, no one connected with MONSTER A GO-GO seems to've had any interest in it whatsoever.) The creepy scene involving the truck driver and the helpless female motorist is the movie's defining moment of ickiness, much more so than the ""monster"" that staggers through the picture like a wino in search of his next bottle of Night Train.The defining moment of THE PHANTOM PLANET (1961) is Lt. Ray Makonnen's windy speech about the wise and the best, the good and the beautiful, just before he's taken out by a meteorite to the head. It's a typically dopey sci-fi film of the era, the kind of story that plays out as if science fiction hadn't evolved since the planetary romances of the 1920s. Funny? Yes, especially with a Pinto Colvig alien on the loose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JA2BILLWEH7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BI1YS8#wasThisHelpful","R3JA2BILLWEH7L","A3OD9DU3A0NCCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OD9DU3A0NCCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What happens when a mad scientist and a former vaudeville impressionist go into the grave robbing business together?Imagine Tod Browning's FREAKS crossed with a Three Stooges short and you get the flavor of MANIAC, a 1934 exploitation movie loosely (very, very loosely) based on Poe's ""The Black Cat."" The story, such as it is, is meaningless. What matters is the film's endless chain of bizarre images: cats pouncing on mice in a morgue; a madman running through streets deserted except for cats and dogs fighting each other; a drug-addled mental patient abducting and raping a dazed, female zombie; a bare-knuckle fight to the death between two plump matrons, and a human heart devoured by a cat named Satan; all this, interspersed with images of witches and demons, as well as with long blocks of dry, clinical text supposedly taken from the medical journals of the day.On top of all that, there's the unintentionally hilarious overacting of the two male leads, and the leaden non-acting of almost everyone else on camera. The film is the ultimate in found objects: a profoundly disturbing piece of folk art repurposed by RiffTrax into a masterpiece of dark comedy.There's a bonus feature: a 2010 panel from Comic-Con, with the guys riffing the short, ""Buying Food"", and then riffing on their fans as they line up to pitch ideas for the next RiffTrax movie. And I've asked this before, but I'll ask again: who the hell is Veronica Belmont?","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TL6FJEJVCD85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EBYC8M#wasThisHelpful","R3TL6FJEJVCD85","A3OD9DU3A0NCCI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OD9DU3A0NCCI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lately I'd noticed my dishes were developing a film that was impossible to remove. I also noticed any greasy dishes took several attempts to get the greasy feel off, especially plastic. I could pour dish soap right on the sponge and wipe the dish and still, it would feel greasy after it dried. I read reviews on Mrs. Meyer's Lemon Dish Soap, purchased it, used it, and immediately threw away all my other dish soap products. This dish soap is so wonderful that if I leave a container with used dishwater in it, the next morning if I put fresh water in, the bubbles come right back (not that I use it). It lasts! This soap cuts through grease immediately, no reside left over. I can use one squirt for all my dishes, without adding more. I will never use another dish soap but this brand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BIN2JCKQF08P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ID2NGHQ#wasThisHelpful","R1BIN2JCKQF08P","A1JH5EKCDJPXSH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JH5EKCDJPXSH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you've never used any Deva Curl products, you owe it to yourself to try this product immediately. The Deva products help your curls look healthy, well-defined and non-frizzy.

The next morning, if I dampen my hands and run them through my hair, it is like it refreshes the product again! My hair is permed and before I used this, my curls were beginning to fade, looking like I needed a new perm. This product was recommended and I tried a very small bottle. After a week, I purchased this 32 ounce bottle because that is how much I love what it did for my curls. They bounced back and were perfect!

"I love this colorful classic comic for it's wonderfully wacky, inspired, illustrations as much as I do for its timeless wit.  It's so nice to see the entirety of Jack Mendelsohn's strip in chronological order.  I can remember laughing out loud at what I preferred to think was a wise ass kid with anarchy on his mind -- although I probably read a lot of my own somewhat deviant perspective into it. It was hard for me to accept that an adult actually created this because it was so unfiltered and the art was so utterly, perfectly childish.  It takes a genius to pull this off and Mendelsohn is just that.  There's a terrific biographical intro that reveals the amazing accomplishments of the man behind the strip.  It appears he's partially responsible for creating the millions of laughs classic comedy shows generated including Laugh In, the Carol Burnett Show and the ""titcom"" Three's Company (among many more).  Oh, and Mendelsohn is one of the credited writers on the Beatles' Yellow Submarine animated classic.  This guy sure gets around.  I can't recommend ""Jacky's Diary"" strong enough!

"Ever since I was a kid, the story of Noah and the Great Flood has been a source of fascination.  And I'm not alone.  After all, it's the most-told story on the planet.  By a casual count, there are about 200 independent ""flood"" stories that are organic to cultures both modern and primitive.  Of course, Christianity, Islam and Judaism share the same core story.  But was there a cataclysmic event at the far edge of history that accounts for all these rather similar stories about one family and the seeds of life surviving a deluge brought on by angry gods?  And what does it mean?  We still call big natural catastrophes like floods or earthquakes ""acts of God"" even though few of us believe it to be literal  -- or do we?The intensity of the story is so persistent numerous expeditions continue to search for the remains of Noah's ark on Turkey's Mt. Ararat, the region of the Biblical landing place.  During the 90s, I co-produced a segment of NBC's popular ""Unsolved Mysteries"" on the subject and shot footage around Ararat and interviewed eyewitnesses who saw something huge and manmade that has been preserved in the permanent ice cap of Greater Ararat.  I showed a special cut of this footage (RIDDLE OF ARARAT) at our local Short Film Festival a few years ago and was invited to show it in London.  Both screenings got wide attention and drew full houses.What is it about this story that still resonates with us on such a deep level?Darren Aronofsky has been working on his NOAH film for 15 years in one form or another.  He's known as a visualist and uncompromising filmmaker who loves stories about obsessive loners who are compulsively driven to the brink of madness in their quest to find God.  In NOAH, he has fashioned a $130 million epic film that reboots the Biblical myth with a bold look and modern sensibility.  The film has already raised the ire of some conservative religious groups that think they have the only interpretation of this scriptural disaster story.  They don't.  The power of myth is that it has relevance to each successive age and Aronofsky has delivered a film that's a fine fit for the 21st Century as well as a great return to the popular Biblical epics of 50 years ago.The fine cast features Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson and Ray Winstone.  Crowe is a wonderful Noah who may be fighting a private madness.  He is a dark and intense protagonist full of existential angst.  Who can't relate to that?  He does not exactly hear the voice of God, but get's the message of his mission and the impending disaster in an acid-like dream.  Anthony Hopkins is a scene stealing (and scenery-chewing) Methuselah who endorses his grandson's dream.  If there's an antagonist, it's Ray Winstone as Tubal-cain, an environmental raping leader of a rogue army who attempts to hi-jack the ark.  There's a terrific ten-minute battle sequence that looked like something out of Tolkien.The production design and art direction throughout are superb and I liked the computer graphics that made the migration of the animals and the horror of the flood vivid and hyper real.I hope this film makes connects with a global audience (and makes big bucks) so that other mythic and Biblical tales can be realized on the big screen with all the personal vision of artists like Aronofsky.  In many ways, he's the Kubrick of the 21st Century.Forget the negative things you may have read or heard about NOAH.  Be assured, it is not sacrilegious, even though it may not be what you expect, it is an authentic retelling of this ubiquitous, enigmatic and powerful story.  For those conservative believers who are uncomfortable with the movie's theme of environmentalism and stewardship of the planet, it might be helpful to read the Biblical book of Revelation that specifically damns those who ""destroy the earth.""But does NOAH have meaning?  Well, that's up to you.  For me, it's a potent reminder that we are one human family and the earth is our ark.  No matter how you look at it, we are truly all in the same boat.  But first and foremost, NOAH is a grand, big screen, spectacularly satisfying entertainment that dazzles the eye and provokes the mind.  What more can you ask for?PS  If the ancient world and Biblical myths are of interest, you might consider reading the fascinating ""GOBEL TEPE Genesis of the odd"" by Andrew Collins.

"I gave our little 14 year-old terrier ""Bullet"" a piece of Waggin' Train Chicken Jerky Tenders and he eagerly took it and carried it around the house in his mouth, but he eventually dropped it without taking a bite.  So, my wife soaked one of the dry, brittle pieces in a mug for a half hour and then cut it in smaller pieces. Happy to say Bullet seemed to relish it -- but only at first.  He never finished the pieces we gave him.But it may be that he has only had soft treats for the last several years and was stumped when he was given a hard one.  He's also an older guy and rather spoiled.NOTE: When I taste tested the Waggin' Train Chicken Jerky Tender, I thought it was a fine snack.

"I love the feel of this ""task"" super light weight Tee.  I am not a clothes horse kind of guy, and I live in a place that has a lot of sunshine, so I usually wear sandals and shorts and comfortable shirt.  This shirt is perfect for me.  It's casual and looks stylish enough to step out in.One thing I noticed is that there is no washing instruction tag nor is their any suggestion of what kind of material from which it is made.  Apparently it is organic cotton and ""viscose"" from bamboo.  Does that make it synthetic?  Not sure what that combo is, but it does not stick to me when I perspire and the fabric seems to breathe.  It feels very much like cotton -- only better.  The material is extremely soft, light and comfortable -- almost like no shirt at all.

"Ever since I was a kid and first became aware of the impossible seeming migrations of our fellow dwellers on this planet we share, I have been fascinated with any explanation for this incredible ""instinct"" - whatever that means -- that very small and large creatures share.Bernd Heinrich's deep interest in the mystery of the natural world and his marvelous, sometimes mind-bending prose, draws the reader into another dimension that borders on the miraculous, at least to me.I need not detail the specifics of ""HOMING INSTINCT"" here, but among other things it covers solar, smell, visual imprinting, magnetic fields and other facets of the so-called mysterious homing instinct.Frankly, I could hardly put this book down.  Many more questions are raised by the partial answers in Heinrich's book.  But it's the ""why"" of it all that most fascinates and how it all relates -- and is shared --  by humans.Admittedly, there's a lot we don't know.  Perhaps embracing the mystery is the first step to understanding.  In many ways, I could not help but feel the natural world is still programmed by another world that barely exists.I was equally enthralled by Heinrich's ""MIND OF THE RAVEN.""  That one dispelled the last vestige of any notion that ""bird brain"" is an insult.Highest recommendation.

"Brutal and intense, writer-director Peter Berg's superb combat film, based on the vivid New York Times bestselling tale of heroism, takes a look at the 19 American deaths - and lone survivor - of an ill-fated incident in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan.Bloody and poetic, the incredible true story follows four Navy SEALS on a secret mission to kill a Taliban leader when they stumble across a trio of goat herders.  The SEALS choose the difficult decision to release and not kill them.  That act of mercy is rewarded by a relentless firestorm from at least forty Taliban fighters who quickly surround the four.Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) are the brave SEALS.  Ben Foster and Eric Bana also star.  And they do justice to the real men they play - and honor.  Berg's smooth direction captures every horrific moment whether it's a bullet's impact or a treacherous fall.  We always have a sense of where we are and the camera movement is not frantic but wide-eyed - it's shot in the same way we remember frightening real-life moments.  The editing is tight and the performances never seem anything but real.  But in the end, it's the big questions that linger.  This ambiguity gives heft to this fine film and raises it to a level of meaningful contemporary art, especially with the ironic and satisfying ending that bookends the act of mercy the men showed to the goat herders.LONE SURVIVOR ranks with and is, in my opinion, superior to ""Platoon,"" ""Battle of Algiers,"" ""Paths of Glory"" and the sentimental, boring ""Saving Private Ryan"" in its visceral and moral intensity.  But finally, this brilliant film is about our common humanity and not the the hell of war.  Over the end credits, there are photos of the real soldiers who sacrificed their lives for what they believed to be a worthy cause.  I wept.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8HEYIMGPDV6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEPEBWC#wasThisHelpful","R8HEYIMGPDV6C","A3H9JSM1SUTE4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love adventure -- both on the page and in real life.  I think I read most of ""The Lost City of Z"" at one sitting.  Similar books are hard to find.  Now I am enjoying ""Mother of God.""  Paul Rosolie's thrilling adventure in the Amazon jungle is a wonderful escape to a pristine place unexplored by white men and where the untamed planet functions with it's own awesome power, harmony and balance.  Here's a sample of Rosolie's vivid prose:""The jungle at night is the greatest freak show on earth.When the sun goes down the landscape welcomes a churning nightshift of murdering, slithering, creeping, fornicating, stalking, swimming, glowing life.  To walk the Amazon by night is to enter a world where you are gravely disadvantaged compared to millions of sensory savants.  Some exchange chemical signals, others complex vocalizations outside our auditory spectrum, and almost all have night vision.""There are passages that will haunt your dreams.  Rosolie's dedication to preserving this last, vast natural patch of wildness on our planet is admirable and worthy of large scale support.  But it is his personal, solo, up close story that seduces the reader.  And to top it off, it becomes a love story.  Jungle love prevails in this truly awe-inspiring read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27SIW5ELPF6DV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062259512#wasThisHelpful","R27SIW5ELPF6DV","A3H9JSM1SUTE4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Attorney Bushkin's non-linear anecdotal account of Carson's flaws and Buskin's own career seems to be more about defending his (Bushkin's) actions (and firing by Carson) than a serious look at the enigmatic Carson who maintained a consistently upbeat, engaging, funny on-camera persona along with an apparently troubled, lonely, mean, unhappy, indulgent private life.  Carson once remarked (not in Buskin's book) that he had recurring nightmares of a big camera lens pointing at him and that he'd wake up screaming.  The dichotomy of the public and private Carson is revealing and certainly fascinating but Bushkin's bio of Carson seems like a vindictive last word in what must have been a long simmering anger at the man who made him very wealthy.  Bushkin glibly writes he hopes Carson would be pleased with this book.

"It's been over 40 years since Leatherface terrorized us on the big and then smaller screen.Now Leatherface has returned, and in the true persona of actor and poet Gunnar Hansen we find a funny, self deprecating guy who is intelligent and articulate and with great recall skills.I was captivated by his observations of the low-budget  filmmaking process and the numerous complications behind, in front of and around the camera as well as the wider repercussions after the controversial and violent film was actually released under a wave of unkind -- to put it mildly -- reviews.Gunnar has an acerbic wit and a philosophical bent that makes his behind-the-scenes account of this indie and dangerous production somehow meaningful.  ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is more than a blip in the rear view mirror of our dubious pop culture.  All the energy and time that went into the making of this film and the ripples that remain from just knowing it exists is a testament to something I cannot quite name.  Hansen debunks some of the myths that have attached themselves to this iconic film that ironically is now part of esteemed museum collections.I recommend this entertaining volume that was written with insight that not only details a sub-culture of low budget horror filmmaking, but also a sense of the absurd.But what still puzzles me is why we eagerly pay to be terrified and repelled at movies that depict the unthinkable nightmares that paralyze us?  There's an art to dabbling in fear, even if it's done on a shoestring and naively.  And there's an art to writing about it.  This is an unexpected book.  I loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC2YM7Z313YZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452114498#wasThisHelpful","RC2YM7Z313YZW","A3H9JSM1SUTE4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The book begins with the mostly accepted notion that they Knights Templar began in the early 1100s to protect pilgrims to sacred sights in the Holy Land or Palestine.  (I have found here other historians who suggest the Knights morphed from a much older secret tradition.)I was engaged with the details of the rise and fall of the Knights Templar.  I have heard stories -- not  recounted in Hodge's excellent volume -- that the Knights still exist and have been active in Chechnya where they have recovered and removed nuclear warheads while both warring sides stood down anklet them pass.

"On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated as he rode in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas, Texas.  That is a fact beyond dispute. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of JFK's untimely death, a remarkable collection of exclusive footage reconstructs the story as it happened, moment-by-moment.Kevin Spacey narrates the story of that tragic day through the memories of some of the people who played a part in those extraordinary events - from the journalist who was with the Kennedy family all day to the nurse who checked his vital signs at Parkland Memorial Hospital to the cop who was with Oswald when he was murdered by Jack Ruby.  New interviews and striking, rarely seen footage and photos make vivid the emotions and drama of that day.  In all fairness, it must be noted that this Smithsonian sanctioned production comes with the imprimatur of the federally funded institute and as expected, there is no deviation from the official government approved scenario of Oswald as the lone shooter.  Even a superficial examination of the now massive evidence raises doubts to the notion that Oswald acted alone - if indeed he acted at all.  That said, this is a remarkable collection of images, impressions and memories.If this documentary had included any elements that alluded to the multitude of doubts that Oswald acted alone as well as the many eyewitness accounts of another shooter, I would have given this otherwise fine compilation 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYOWTE05LLH50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENP2QZA#wasThisHelpful","RYOWTE05LLH50","A3H9JSM1SUTE4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you miss old-school, 80's style action dramas with iconic leads, look no further than ESCAPE PLAN.  There's no deep meaning here.  The big (?) draw is watching Sly and Arnold share the same screen, and they do in numerous scenes.  This complicated prison-break thriller from director Mikael Hfström was mostly shot on a great set built in a NASA compound in New Orleans.  There's a futuristic feel to the oppressive, high-tech setting, ""The Tomb,"" in which Ray Breslin (Stallone) finds himself as a hired ""volunteer"" prisoner to determine the security in this brutal prison under the control of a sadistic warden (Jim Caviezel).Quickly Stallone realizes he's been tricked and wrongly imprisoned -- for life!  Now he must team with fellow inmate Emil Rottmeyer (Schwarzenegger) to devise an escape from this incredibly fortified fortress.  But things are not exactly add they see.  Isn't that really the plot of almost all movies?  Yes, it's all kind of ridiculous, but it looks great and there are some big twists and surprises.  Co-stars Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson, Vinnie Jones, Vincent D'Onofrio and Amy Ryan are all on the same page.  This is a manly movie. It's a testosterone fueled, brawny action thriller, but the audience I saw it with was skewed mature with a majority of women.  And there was applause over the end credits.  Go figure.At the screening I attended, producer Mark Canton was present before the film started but we were told he had a ""medical emergency"" and would not return for the much anticipated Q&A.  Rumor had it that Canton made a date with two comely women he met in the lobby, invited them to dinner and discovered there was no escape.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OKI5QUC93913/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYQ48#wasThisHelpful","R1OKI5QUC93913","A3H9JSM1SUTE4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They all have a sturdy signal for their various study, ahem, needs.  I'm told game play is also strong.  I like the clean, smallish design, the range extender button (not sure why it is not always ""on"").  I am thinking of getting one for our home.  Mainly to extend our wireless network into the shaded, park-like far corners of our yard!

"I finally got around to watching the extended director's cut (at 3 three hours) of this 2006 film that was finally released theatrically in 2011 and for home theater at the end of last year.  Wow, I was mesmerized by this unexpectedly compelling -- almost operatic -- story of a 17-year-old New York City high-school student (Anna Paquin) who believes she has unintentionally caused a traffic accident that killed a woman.Her desire to set things right is met with opposition at every step. Torn apart by guilt and frustration that justice is an increasingly distant option, she punishes herself with self-loathing and hurts those around her as she realizes the real world of adults is a nebulous place where doing what's right is a foggy ideal seldom clearly defined.Margaret is not a character in the movie but rather a reference in Gerard Manley Hopkins 1888 poem ""Spring and Fall."" Hopkins asks: ""Margaret, are you grieving, Over Goldengrove unleaving?"" and then answers at poem's end ""...It is the blight man was born for, It is Margaret you mourn for.""The theatrical release has a running time of 150 minutes and it's the Blu-ray disc on the combo pack.  The far superior, more richly detailed and moody director's cut is 180 minutes and is on the DVD.  But it's the latter that seems shorter.  The superb supporting cast includes: Matthew Broderick, Matt Damon, Jean Reno, Allison Janney, and Mark Ruffalo among others.  It's safe to say this singular film has already garnered a cult following as an ever-growing number people continue to stumbled on this hellish emotionally journey of realization and redemption.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HU9XWBU97HKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIGF0#wasThisHelpful","R2HU9XWBU97HKC","A3H9JSM1SUTE4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This amiable, meandering and finally satisfying documentary follows Chris Overton, a self-taught rural Quebec stonemason as he plans to build a 1,000-foot long stone wall in eight weeks.  Ten years into the project, the wall does not seem to be fully completed, but the obsession and the process has yielded a film about expectations and two guys - the other guy is filmmaker Bill Stone (yes, stone) - who are stumped to explain exactly what they are doing and what it means - if anything.  Clearly the lesson learned - at least by the viewer of the film - is that art and life are much more about the process than the thing itself.  Or maybe not.What I really liked, and why the movie is worth seeing, is for the last 30 minutes which are spent in Scotland with a ""diker"" who has spent 20 years learning his trade of making free standing hedgerows and explains why his is the best life possible.  I found a new way to think about stones that help in my own quest to be ever more mindful of the precious passing moments.Like Tolkien said, ""All we have to decide is what to do with the time we have left.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B5MQ2EB6E9T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGZ1Y5G#wasThisHelpful","R2B5MQ2EB6E9T8","A3H9JSM1SUTE4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Directed by Julian Pölsler, award-winning German actress Martina Gedeck stars in this riveting, allegorical tale of survival set in the spectacular Austrian countryside.  Exquisite cinematography propels this puzzling and thoughtful story of isolation and its impact on the human spirit as it is forced to rejoin the breathtaking but indifferent natural world.Naturally I thought of Stephen King's ""THE DOME"" (both the book and the cheap looking, seemingly endless CBS series with the god-awful music) as the movie began.  But this is a different take on a similar premise with superior satisfaction and rewards for the viewer.Gedeck delivers a tour-de-force performance as she endures all kinds of physical and psychological challenges when she discovers, to her horror, that she is trapped behind an invisible, impenetrable wall in a remote mountain area. This compelling, mind-bending adventure that's seasoned with philosophical, psychological and sci-fi elements kept me involved.Based on Marlen Haushofer's highly-praised 1962 novel (the only novel of her works to be translated into English), THE WALL is the story of Gedeck's unnamed character -- The Woman -- who is vacationing in the stunning Austrian mountains when an invisible wall suddenly and inexplicably encompasses the countryside and cuts her off from the civilization she left behind.  Though the blue sky, chirping birds and surrounding nature appear to be normal, The Woman is in fact cut of from all human contact and separated from the rest of the world.  With her loyal dog Lynx as a sole companion, The Woman becomes immersed and enmeshed in a pristine world hardly touched by civilization and ruled only by the laws of nature, which prove to be both benign and dangerous.  As she grapples with her bizarre circumstances, The Woman begins an inward journey of spiritual discovery and eventually transcendence.  At one point we hear her voice over narration (taken from her journal): ""I pity animals and I pity people, because they are thrown into this life without being consulted,"" she says. ""Maybe people are more deserving of pity, because they have just enough intelligence to resist the natural course of things.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35L32S1DZRV34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1RTCE8#wasThisHelpful","R35L32S1DZRV34","A3H9JSM1SUTE4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A wonderfully goofy -- and arguably classic -- exploitation film collection that includes infamous movies about getting ""doped up"" and paying the consequences of such dubious behavior.  The films, in various degrees of preservation (I use the word loosely), are campy and unintentionally hilarious -- except of course if you take any of it seriously.  The mindset presented in these unintentionally hilarious cautionary stories was in fact somewhat representative of the conservative concerns of the 30s, 40s and 50s.  And no doubt in some cases people still living.  As an art form, this sub genre can be enjoyed on more than one level -- and not just as an excuse for breaking out that medicinal marijuana stash.  I still have a warm place in my heart for TERROR OF TINY TOWN (a western with a cast of small persons and their shetland ponies), and CHAINED FOR LIFE (starring the real life ""Siamese twin"" Hilton sisters (no relation to Paris).

"Since I was a kid I've been a film buff and as an adult have been lucky enough to work in the film business in several creative capacities from screenwriter to animator.  My fascination has never wavered with those dancing shadows on the screen and the shared experience of a global audience.For over 50 years Badiou, the French philosopher, has been musing about film and it's cultural, artistic, political and sociological significance.  His writing is fascinating to me and I was able to get past what at first may seem like ""pretentious high-brow hog wash,"" as a friend recently said.I love that he, Badiou, is able to look at cinema as a subject that deserves serious philosophical consideration in style, theme and subject.  He loves film but I feel he loves thinking about the medium even more.The casual reader must be warned -- or reminded -- that Badiou is French and he writes from a decidedly French philosophical context and perspective and this English translation can be a bit hard going at first.But yes, I do recommend this collection.

"The is an excellent addition to a desktop if you need a lot of extra USB ports.  The unit that sits on your desk is well made and takes very little room.  It has a  rather large power supply that you have to plug in, so you won't want to haul it around with a laptop.

It works on my Mac Mini with OS X (Yosemite) and also has worked on my Windows 7 desktop PC.  It has one port that provides power but no connection to the computer so you can charge a device that you're not synching to the computer such as a spare battery.  It works with my Brother and Epson printers, with a external hard drive, and with a webcam, among other things, but it doesn't work with an Apple SuperDrive DVD.

"The major advantage of the Dyno vs. a comparably priced Brother label printer is that Dymo labels print with less than 1/2 inch of leading and trailing  tape, so you don;'t waste a lot of tape between labels.  In contrast, current Brother models leave about 1-1/4"" of tape unused at both ends of the label, so you waste a lot of tape (and buy more sooner from Brother).  A second advantage is that unlike Brother units you can set this to stay at a default the size, turn it off, and turn it back on without the size changing.  My Brother labeler defaults to large type when it's turned off.  Again, that can waste a lot of tape.BUT:  The disadvantage of the Dymo is the very poor keyboard layout vs. Brother labelers.  There's an oddly placed caps lock but no shift key to change just one or two letters to upper case, and there are almost no symbols on the keyboard.  Even for common symbols like ""&"" and for commas and periods you have to go into the Symbols menu.  This means a lot of extra keystrokes and extra time.  A minor issue is that Demo offers just a couple of label types vs. Brother, which has several.  Bottom line:  If you don't make a large number of labels at one sitting, the Dymo is  a good choice because of its efficient use of tape.  If you use the labeler a lot and make several labels at a time, you can set a comparable Brother to narrow margins and save some tape, and save a lot of typing time and annoyance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XS70H2M44RW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B1FIW2#wasThisHelpful","R2XS70H2M44RW1","A9J4UURM4OSDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9J4UURM4OSDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Colormunki colorimeter does reasonable job of setting profiles for LCD monitors, but the setup and execution are seriously flawed in annoying and stupid ways.  Three stars may be too generous, given these flaws.I have a Mac Mini purchased new in July 2015, and it is running OSX 10.10.  The primary monitor is a HP LP2575w with an excellent IPS display.  The secondary monitor is an aging  Samsung SynchMaster 906BW.  The software recognized both monitors and asked which one was being calibrated.  The annoyances and stupid flaws are:The CD that comes in the package has Version 1.0.1 of X-Rite’s software.  There’s no message one the CD offering to look for updated software.  When I tried to install the Mac version from the disk, it displayed a message saying that the software could not be installed on the internal hard drive (which has over 1TB of free space).  I went to the website and downloaded Version 1.1.1, which installed OK.  The downloaded version is dated December 2013, so X-Rite has been shipping units for almost two years with CDs that have outdated software.  (Either that or the one I bought has been on Amazon’s shelves for that long, which seems unlikely.)Second, after I plugged the ColorMunki into a USB port and started the software, it displayed a message saying that there was no ColorMunki detected.  It was plugged into a powered USB hub, so I switched it to a port on the Mac Mini.  Same result – no ColorMunki detected.  I had to reboot to get the software to find the ColorMunki. If I have to plug in directly, the opening screen or the printed quick start directions should tell me that  And why isn’t it detected after it’s been moved from a hub to the computer?  If I should have rebooted after installing the software, tell me that!Third, I was calibrating dual monitors on the same Mac Mini.  The software has a nice feature – it offers to match the display of the second monitor to the first.  Sounds good, but the match was inly so-so.  When I selected the option that starts the second monitor's calibration, second display was switched so that it appeared at the \primary display. It was necessary to open System Preferences on the Mac to switch back.The software offers two calibration modes – “Easy” and “Advanced”. It took about 14 minutes to run the “Advanced” mode on the first monitor, and about 6 minutes to run the “Easy” mode on the second monitor.  Monitors should be recalibrated every few weeks, but a 14-minute routine is a deterrent to checking calibration often.All in all, this unit is OK if you can live with the annoying flaws in the software and the slow calibration process in the advanced mode.  The flaws should have be long gone by the time X-Rite published version 1.1.1.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HAKV9I18OZXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055MBQOM#wasThisHelpful","R2HAKV9I18OZXN","A9J4UURM4OSDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9J4UURM4OSDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very handy little keyboard for an iPad, and it also works with Apple TV and Macs.  (You can get a different version, Logitech's K810, for PCs and tablets).  I bought it to use with an iPad Air after trying the Logitech Ultrathin keyboard/cover.  That one puts the iPad into a slot just in front of the keyboard.  The Ultrathin is the same width as an iPad, so the keyboard is somewhat cramped, and having the iPad in a slot just behind the keyboard made it feel even more cramped.  The Easy-Switch has a full-width keyboard with a full set of keys including arrows and a proper delete key, and it can work with almost any Apple device with Bluetooth connectivity.  The only negative is that it's a separate item to take with you, unlike a keyboard that attaches to an iPad (or one to which the iPad attaches). SO while the keyboard can rest on your lap, unless you're willing to cradle your iPad in on arm and type with your other hand, you need a stand for the iPad, and you have to be near a table to make use of it.  Still, if you're mostly taking notes at a school desk or in meetings around a conference table, it works perfectly.  The keypad is ""clicky"" and the keys have good travel. It would feel very good to a touch typist, and as a fast hunt & peck typist I'm happy with it.  It's light enough to be taken with you in a backpack and the case is aluminum, so it's solid enough to survive as long as it's not banged around.  (Logitech could pry another few dollars out of my wallet if they offered a nylon carrier for this keyboard.)There are several neat features, the most obvious of which are the ability to store the Bluetooth connection data for three devices and the backlit keys.  Once you pair the keyboard with, say, an iPad, you press a button to store the connection, and next time you're in range of that iPad, the keyboard will automatically connect with it.  You can do that with two additional devices, since there are three storage keys, and you can toggle back and forth between them -- say between an iPad and a Mac.  The advantage of illuminated keys should be obvious, unless you always work in a well-lit area.  They're great for use on a long plane flight, and even in moderate light it's helpful to have the backlighting on -- at least for a hunt & peck typist like me.  You can adjust the level of the backlighting.There is a full range of dual-purpose functions keys across the top.  They can work as either a regular function key for the application you're in or you can use them as special keys to adjust the backlight, or to select one of the three Bluetooth pairings, or change the volume or the backlight setting, or start and stop a video.  Taken altogether, if a separate keyboard fits your way of using APple devices, this is a great portable choice -- highly function, small, light and well-designed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WI9NQIH79P6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0099SMFP2#wasThisHelpful","R2WI9NQIH79P6G","A9J4UURM4OSDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9J4UURM4OSDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Smart TVs have come a long way since the first clumsy tries at integrating TV with access to the Internet.  This one is a good example of what's been done right, recognizing that there are still problems with the interface.  The TV has a neat remote control that projects on screen when you're setting it up so you can easily enter the info needed to get access to the Internet features.  You point at a series of on-screen prompts and you use the same interface to navigate the on-screen keyboard when you set up the TV, so you get through the setup process quickly and painlessly -- very different from the not-so Smart TV I tried about 2 years ago.A range of Internet services including Netflix and Amazon Prime are included so you can stream movies and recent TV shows.  You can select from a range of inputs including a Roku or Apple TV box, cable TV, or a computer, and the TV comes with built-in wi-fi that's simple to connect to your home network,  You can also plug it directly into your router using standard Cat. 5 cable, or connect it via a Powerline adapter.  This model has four HDMI inputs and various other ways of loading content, including a USB port.  What's still missing?  The Netflix and Amazon Prime apps don't take advantage of the excellent user interface built into the Samsung remote, so you're back to moving around their on-screen keyboards using direction keys rather than simply pointing at the letter or number you want.  You can make that process less painful by buying a Logitech keyboard for 70 - 100 dollars, but that shouldn't be necessary.  Perhaps someday soon, all of the installed Internet apps will respond to the type of remote interface that Samsung has come up with.Of course all that connectivity stuff wouldn't be much good if the TV didn't have a high quality HD picture, and it does.

"Michael Pearce finds a way to take us back 100 years and convey a superb sense of place, and then he takes readers on a enjoyable detective journey.  The detective story is nothing special, but the way he recreates the setting is worth the price of admission.  In this case he takes us to colonial Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and right at the beginning he captures the tentativeness of the Levant.  Two workers in a transport depot come upon a box - a crate, really -- that's leaking unpleasant fluid and emitting a foul odor.  Sounds like there's a body inside right?  Call the cops?  Get a crowbar?  No, that's altogether to proactive.  And so the story unfolds from there, a good but not great murder mystery told with wonderful tongue-in-cheek humor and a superb sense of place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R331QOPZUS5NS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DN8GOW4#wasThisHelpful","R331QOPZUS5NS3","A9J4UURM4OSDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9J4UURM4OSDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using Office for years, probably since it first arrived.  I bought 365 because (1) it has an iPad version that allows the creation of documents on a mobile device and (2) that capability is supposedly integrated with OneDrive, the MS cloud storage offering.  So you should be able to create a document on an iPad and store it either on the iPad or on OneDrive, where you get a free terrabyte of storage with your subscription.Alas, while Word and Excel work very well on a keyboard-equipped iPad, there's a big glitch with OneDrive. Large numbers of users (including me) can't connect iPad Word or Excel directly to our OneDrive accounts.  So you can't create a document on the iPad and save it in your OneDrive account in one step.  If all the threads on the MS Office 365 support page are right, this problem has been unsolved for months, and it's a deal-breaker for many people. There's a work-around: Download the iPad OneDrive app from iTunes and open docs stored in the cloud from there.  While that's OK for documents already created and saved in OneDrive, it's no help for docs you create on your iPad.  You can save them there, but if you want to use the cross-platform capability you paid for and store them in OneDrive, as far as I can tell you have to email them to yourself, open the email on a computer and save the document in the cloud.  That's a stupid workaround, and if anyone who can tell me how to fix this, please adda comment to this review!  And it's very strange, because it's easy to connect to your Dropbox account from the iPad and access your documents, and it's easy to connect to OneDrive from an iPhone!Apart from the sad problem with Office apps on an iPad not connecting directly to OneDRive, Office 365 works well and the apps for iPad work surprisingly well.  If you want to use Office on a mobile device, subscribe for a month to try it out and see whether the missing link to OneDrive is too much of a pain to bear.Having said all that, it's only fair to say that the installation process on a computer was surprisingly easy despite the large number of one-star reviews.  When you install Office 365, it doesn't remove previous versions of Office applications (Word 2010, etc.) but it DOES keep all of your settings, including plug-ins for programs such as Dragon Naturally SPeaking.  That was a surprise and a great relief.The opening screen for Word and the other applications differs earlier versions of Office.  Instead of a blank spreadsheet or document, there's a screen offering to open create a new document. If you click on Open and then Browse you get to the usual Windows Explorer list of folders and files.  There may be an extra mouse click involved, but from reading some of the unfavorable reviews, I think people were thrown by the changed interface.  It's really OK -- it's just different and you have to get used to it.So... all in all, I'm still very unhappy by the inability thus far to figure out how to connect Word on my iPad to One Drive without a lot of stupid work-arounds, but the new version does integrate OneDrive so that you can access it from multiple computers.  That puts all of your stuff up in the cloud where it's not going to be destroyed by a hard drive crash.  And oddly, I could get to the files in the cloud seamlessly from an iPhone, but not from an iPad.  If I find a way to do that, I'll edit this review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1125Y6DMF5C0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SPTUW2#wasThisHelpful","R1125Y6DMF5C0X","A9J4UURM4OSDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9J4UURM4OSDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a three-way level to hep you get a perfectly level horizon or perfectly vertical lines when you're shooting landscapes and architecture.

"EDITED 1/6/2015 after 6 weeks' experience.Slingbox is a great idea, but the Sling website and some of the software is awful, so it's hard to know what rating to give.  A zero for support and the awful app that that runs on an iPhone (and costs an extra $15!!).  A 3 for picture quality, and a 5 for the Slingbox software that runs on a laptop.We bought this so we could cut cable service in a second home and still get local channels from where we live.  We planned to do that by ""screencasting"" to a WiFi enabled TV in the second home, using an iPhone or iPad as the remote receiver for the Slingbox, and using WiFi to connect the iPhone/iPad to an Apple TV box and then to the HDTV.  That didn't work well at all.  There were too many WiFi jumps, and each one degraded the picture. But there's a work-around that's OK.Setting up the Slingbox on the TV at home was quick and easy.  After the box is hooked up, load SLingbox's PC/MacBook app onto a remote computer and you can even see and use a virtual remote control that looks exactly like the one that comes with your home cable box.  But when you try to use the Sling remotely for screencasting from an iPhone/iPad or laptop to TV via a set top box like Apple TV or Roku, TV, it barely works.  The picture quality gets maybe a 4 out of 10, and there are many times when the buffer runs out and the screen goes blank.  So rather than screencast to the TV using WiFi, we connected an HDMI cable between the computer and an Apple TV box.  (You could also use a Roku box).  You need a PC/MacBook in the same room as your remote TV to do that, and you need right adapter to connect the computer to a standard HDMI cable, because laptops don't usually have standard HDMI output.  (Apple TVs and Rokus have standard HDMI inputs.)For us, it was worth the effort and the kludgy work-around.  We had a old MacBook that can connect to our Apple TV box via a 25-foot HDMI cable, so we can avoid the unsatisfactory screencasting via WiFi.  The picture to the TV isn't high definition by a long shot, but cutting the cable in the second home will pay for the Slingbox in 6 weeks.  And the Slingbox app that runs on your PC/Mac laptop is quite good and it's free, a startling contrast to the expensive, awful iPhone software and the useless Sling website.The lack of decent, detailed information on the Sling website is very odd considering that this is a company that sells Internet-connected devices.  Examples: The instructions to screencast to an Apple TV are nowhere to be found on the Sling website, but if you poke around on the unintuitive Slingbox iPhone app (for which you had to pay extra...), you'll eventually blunder onto the right sequence of screen taps.  The website's Knowledge Base doesn't have information on the full range of products, and info on the Slingbox M1 I notably thin.  To access your account you have to go to a different web site altogether, but there's no link on the Sling home page and nothing on the main web site tells you that you need to do that.  But wait, there's more! The apps that allow you to access your Slingbox don't have consistent interfaces, and they're not linked.  Sure, you can set up a list of favorite channels on the Sling iPhone app (although there's nothing on the web site or in the help screen of the app that tells you how).  But the favorites don't replicate in the application that runs on your computer.  And if you search for instructions on setting up favorites on your computer, you only get info on how to do it on a mobile device, not on a computer - at least not with a Slingbox M1.  And all this lack of connectivity is from a company that makes it living selling Internet-enabled devices... strange.Once you figure out how to use this thing, it's possible to view your TV 100 or 1,000 or 10,000 miles from home on your mobile device or computer.  It's a neat trick. And if you can put up with the hassle, you can get a so-so connection to your remote TV so you several people can watch without having to huddle around a laptop screen.Four suggestions to reduce the hassle:(1) If your cable box isn't turned on at home, Slingbox doesn't work, and that's an ugly surprise whether you're 10 or 10,000 miles away.  But: If you have the free app for the M1 on your computer and click on the icon to show your cable remote on screen, you may be able to turn the cable box on remotely.  (The website doesn't mention this, of course.)  Just be sure to install the little IR booster light that comes with the Slingbox and place it right in front of the IR receiver on your cable box at home.(2) If you want to display the output from the Slingbox on a remote TV, forget about using WiFi from a mobile device - it's not worth the effort.  Instead, use a laptop and connect it via HDMI cable (not by WiFi) to your Apple TV or Roku.  If possible, use a wired connection from the computer to the router rather than wifi.(3) You may also be able to connect your laptop device directly to your HDTV as a computer monitor.  The picture quality may or may not be satisfactory, depending on the video card in your laptop, and you need an HDMI cable and the right plug converter to get from your laptop to you TV.  But it could save you the cost of a Roku or Apple TV, and like the HDMI connection in Suggestion (2), it reduces the reliance on WiFi.(4) If you can connect the Slingbox M1 to a wired connection to your router, do that rather than use the built-in wifi capability.  Even if your house isn't wired for a local area network, you can buy a ""Powerline"" adapter and connect via your home's electric wiring.Final advice: For watching on a remote TV, screencasting via WiFi is a weak link. Multiple leaps via WiFi seem to degrade performance significantly.  If you can eliminate all the WiFi links, the stability and quality will improve a lot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EAN67T3BLBJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIP10KK#wasThisHelpful","R1EAN67T3BLBJA","A9J4UURM4OSDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9J4UURM4OSDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whiteside makes high quality router bits, and this one is exactly that.  It's a dual purpose bit, which accounts for its relatively high price.  It has bearings at the top and bottom so you can trim around the edges, flush with the face of our workpiece, or set the top bearing to ride against a pattern for pattern routing.  It has a 1/4"" shaft so it's not for heavy duty routing -- for that you may want a bit with a 1/2"" shaft, and Whiteside makes that type as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKJA25IO7HRS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012JCTFC#wasThisHelpful","RKJA25IO7HRS5","A9J4UURM4OSDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9J4UURM4OSDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a solvent that works by dissolving the two surfaces of acrylic that you're putting together.  It works well when the two surfaces are quite smooth.  It doesn't fill gaps well, so if you're putting a cut edge of acrylic onto a flat piece, the edge has to be sanded smooth and flat to make a secure bond.  For example, an edge cut on a table saw is too rough to be adhered without sanding it first.  For smooth surfaces, it works quickly and seems to make a very good bond.  It has a solvent odor, but it's not overwhelming or objectionable.  Use thin rubber gloves when you apply it,  If you use  a brush, let the brush dry after use and the solvent will evaporate.  The open time for this version of Scigrip is just a minute or so before the solvent evaporates.  Scigrip 3 has a longer open time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZ9888PZ7FPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFPF0UQ#wasThisHelpful","R2MZ9888PZ7FPM","A9J4UURM4OSDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9J4UURM4OSDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well-designed, well-made tool.  It's smaller and less powerful than a standard sized 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 HP router, so if you're buying your first router you should look elsewhere - the DeWalt 618, Bosch 1617, or Porter-Cable 690.  The DeWalt 611 has a 1-1/4 HP motor and it's small enough to be held with one hand, but it only takes bits with a "" shaft, whereas a standard router will accept both 1/4"" and 1/2"" bits.  If you use it with one hand, be sure to keep your other hand clear of the router bit.  It's good for chamfering, rounding over edges, edging countertop laminate, and for trimming the stick-on facing used on the exposed edges of plywood.  It might make shallow dados, but for any moderately heavy work it's better to use a standard two-handed router.  Similarly, it wouldn't be sensible to mount the DeWalt 611 under a router table, because the lack of extra power would limit the depth and width of cuts.The design of the fixed base is similar to the Porter-Cable 690, which is a classic.  The motor rotates inside the base like a big screw inside a big nut (the base).  So it's easy to make fine adjustments up and down.  A rotating collar lets you set zero and then rotate the motor to a specific depth.  A locking collar holds the motor securely so that the bit stays at the desired depth.  The adjustment mechanism probably makes it a better choice than the Bosch Colt trim router, with which it competes, and it has a couple of refinements vs. the Porter-Cable trim router, even though both brands are owned by the same corporation.  The motor has a soft start, which makes it safer and easier to use as a hand-held tool.  There's a shaft lock you hold so that you can tighten or loosen the bit with one wrench instead of two, and it works better than most router shaft locks.  The wrench that was included (in Nov. 2014) was made from heavy gauge steel - heavier than the wrench included with the larger DeWalt 618.The plunge base included with the 611PK kit is well designed, with four turret stops and a threaded stop rod that can be used to make very fine depth adjustments, so it's suitable for doing marquetry and inlay work.  You can orient the router in both the fixed and plunge bases with the cord facing toward you or away from you.The 611PK kit comes in a heavy duty nylon bag rather than in a hard case, which some reviewers complain about.  I think it's fine as long as you don't fling it around.  The only complaint I have is that the instructions are printed in 8 point type, which is just too small.  That seems to be a corporate policy for Porter-Cable routers, and P-C owns DeWalt.  Even the downloadable PDF manual uses tiny type, and if you enlarge it and print it at home, the image fuzzy.  Bosch makes a much more readable instruction manual and DeWalt could learn from that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C39H3MYNJTFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049ZFUK2#wasThisHelpful","R3C39H3MYNJTFE","A9J4UURM4OSDW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9J4UURM4OSDW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After doing the whole tanning bed/sunning phase in my 20s, I found myself at 38 years old having a huge basal cell carcinoma removed from the top of my butt crack...the scar made my b/c look like it was 2 inches taller. At 40 I had a second huge basal cell carcinoma refused from my left butt cheek. I *never* laid in the sun naked, just the tanning bed, FWIW. At 44 I had a blue nevus with melanoma 'spindles' removed...it literally wasn't there and then 3 days later it was there on my shoulder. I honestly wouldn't have found it if I hadn't been using my Fake Bake Flawless Darker. So, theoretically, self-tanning can save lives :)  I started self-tanning several years ago and have used Tan Towels, generic tanning towels, Jergen's lotion, and Jergen's foam. I caved and bought Fake Bake Flawless two years ago, started using it during the end of winter so I could figure out how to apply for a truly flawless finish before summer arrived (with built in bronzer it is possible to streak). I've gotten my application (whole body) down to under 10 minutes. I've learned what works best for me: On Sunday evening, when I take my shower, I shave and I use a Scotch Brite scrubber (that's right, those green kitchen scrubbers...laugh all you want, but they are THE BOMB and so much cheaper than body scrubs!!!) to wash myself with a good moisturizing body wash. I get out, towel dry, use my towels to cover where I'll stand on the floor (overspray is inevitable), mitt up, spray the mitt, start from the feet and work my way up. I can do my entire body except the center of my back. I rub and rub and rub each section until it is obviously dry before moving on to the next section. I wear loose clothes to bed. With the FB Flawless Darker I can go longer between re-application (necessary after a week but I usually do after 3 days, just without applying as many pumps of the spray for maintenance applications) and the color is crazy good. Whereas my natural tan was a sort of beige tan, this is a bit warmer (though not scary Kardashian bronze).

"Have been using Xanthan Gum for a couple of years (after discovering how much cheaper it was, because I had to use so much less, than the Thick-It 2 food thickener.  Unfortunately, my kid developed something that is shortened into EoE, and the three triggers are dairy, nuts, xanthan gum.  I had really hoped that Arrowroot Powder would have the thickening capabilities of Xanthan Gum, but it sadly does not...not by a mile.  I would guess this is more consistent with using plain corn starch.  By the time I used enough to barely come close to the thickness we needed (stiff pudding), you could taste the Arrowroot Powder and were also aware of the chalky texture from needing so much Arrowroot Powder.  Also, as my kid is a heavy drooler, after a few bites, if any of his (slobber) was on the spoon and re-entered the bowl, the Arrowroot thickness would disappear.  I can't recommend this for medically necessary thickening (for poor swallowers), but it might be fine for baking or what have you.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFWX5DZAEIHCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008GG75QC#wasThisHelpful","RFWX5DZAEIHCB","AFD7SX9OK0BX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFD7SX9OK0BX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Such an easy at home solution for those averse to tanning beds and/or sunning.  Nice color; I know what I look like with a tan and that cannot be replicated, but this is the best cancer-free option.  I sometimes do a 'threesome':  I start with Tan Towels and rub myself down all over.  I follow-up with the Jergen's Natural Glow in the darker tone (I'm blonde, green eyed, and lily white but remarkably tanned pretty dark back in the day), applied all over.  I finish with the Fake Bake, applied all over.  I use the FB last since it has the temporary bronzer.  I also should note that I use nitrile exam gloves to do all of my self-tanning, because no amount of any miracle product and scrubbing REALLY gets all that stuff off your palms.  As dark as I self-tan, it still isn't visibly noticeable on my hands.  (Sun from driving?)  Anyway, my 1-2-3 approach gives me really, really, REALLY amazing results that last about a week without touch-ups.  But, most of the time, I'm just too lazy to spend all that time self-tanning, so I just use the Jergen's because it is, by far, the best of them all as a stand-alone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I1Q8VVWXISB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001YTD3G4#wasThisHelpful","R1I1Q8VVWXISB","AFD7SX9OK0BX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFD7SX9OK0BX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Actually it is, for me, more like 4 or 4.5 stars BUT because the issue I have is due to personal taste and not the functionality, I'll give 5 stars. I viewed this product three times before deciding which size of the exact same product to purchase - on my iPad 4, my Droid 4 phone, and on my Dell AIO/desktop. I mention this so that no one will berate me or my screen resolution for not noticing the finish (which is where my personal taste preference issue lies). The actual fixture is a great deal shinier white finish, moderate to high gloss, than what I perceived it to be (my perception was that it was a satin or even matte that was reflecting flash from the camera that captured the image). For me the finish gave the fixture a clinical feel, like the shiny white you see in hospitals or other medical facility lighting...admittedly our family has spent more than our share of time in hospitals, so it's probably just my problem (thus I gave it 5 stars). I happened to have a can of the matte white textured paint on hand, so I just gave the fixture a couple of quick, light coats and I think it looks great. The fixture, in my opinion, needed the grainy (almost like fine salt mixed in the paint) matte finish to go with the opaque glass. Easy to install (one gal with mediocre patience and one ladder, plus my 12v cordless drill [but a screwdriver would suffice]). Make sure, if using the CFL bulbs that the lumens are higher. I've noticed that some 60 watts are as low as 800-something lumens and some are as high as 1100-something lumens.

"Works perfectly with my Andis UltraEdge 2.  I actually prefer the jagged teeth blades to the finishing blades for cutting my Havanese, it just goes faster and smoother (which I know they appreciate).  This is a good length for one of my six - the only one with an uber-curly coat (and no way do I have the time or patience to dreadlock him, which I think is the 'thing' for the curlier Havs after a dreaded Hav won an AKC National event) for his summer cut.  His fur is so much thicker and silkier than the rest that he really needs the shorter cut.  One thing I'd like to suggest, if the blades getting hot is an issue (and I think it is for most anyone), I've invested in 2 of almost every blade I have and I keep one in a Ziploc in the freezer to 'chill' while I use on the clippers.  I check every couple of minutes on my forearm and as soon as the blade heat is uncomfortable to me, I swap the blades.  It is more expensive, obviously, but not even worth mentioning when you see a poor fur-baby on the 'net with burns that require a vet because some big-box groomer used a student to groom the dog.  (Plus, I have six... that was $240. plus tips every six weeks.

"My older teenaged son is medically fragile with pervasive developmental delays; while he is quite small for his age, his bladder is not.  He's at the weight where he has about 10 more pounds and he will outgrow these (he's 102 pounds at 5'3"" height).  I've tried some of the XS adult 'diapers' that claim to hold up to 30 ounces of liquid, not because he wets that much at once (who does?!?) or because I allow him to stew in his own filth all day, but - quite bluntly - because parts of him that inside the 'diapers' has a tendency to come out the top or the leg hole of these 'diapers' that are made for pre-pubescent boys.  The adult XS are just huge on him and cause more leakage issues with the large leg openings and massive stretch allowance in the waist of the adult briefs than we accidentally have with these sometimes.

"Having a 'perpetual' child (special needs/medically fragile/developmentally delayed), I've used just about every bed pad known to mankind: They're all pretty good, but none are large enough for more than a twin bed or crib. My 'big kid' needs more than a twin sized bed - he's very much a traveler when he's in bed (imagine how two year olds are all over a bed...now imagine a two year old the size of an adult all over the bed) and he ALWAYS came off the twin sized ones, whether it was up or sideways; he even manages to get along the edge of the bed and then have his accident down the side of the bed).  This size will fit the top of a king size mattress, so it hangs off the sides of a full and definitely is full coverage on a queen.  Another plus, for me, is if you don't want to bleach bed pads to remove urine stains, these can be washed with the detergent of your choice, and you know they are clean without a dingy yellow cast that only bleach can remove.  If there is a detraction from these, it is that the fabric on the back side is knit so so tight, to keep anything from going through, that it kind of makes your own body heat radiate back up.  In other words, they can be warmish - even under a quality sheet.  For us, though, that's not an issue.  I have MANY of these pads, so if there is an accident in the middle of the night, he can be changed and the bed pad can be swapped without too much hassle.  When you do need to launder, throw 'em in the washer as if they were a load of towels - they're durable enough for multiple washings on even a whites setting (hot water, etc.).  Price is, on a price per square inch basis, much better than the white cottony bed pads.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G49N8TA12V9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004F8Z4GS#wasThisHelpful","R2G49N8TA12V9V","AFD7SX9OK0BX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFD7SX9OK0BX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One does leak a bit here and there, but only sometimes.

I don't know what, if any difference, there is between the two brands but not one night has he slept with just this product.  The result we see is none, it's as if he didn't get this given to him at all.  Maybe this product has more of the stuff in it that makes it timed release, so the other brand gets more into his system quicker.  I don't know.  He does sleep through the 'night' by the time he finally falls asleep, but if I give this product at 9 or 10 pm, I kind of expect him to be out by midnight and it's normally 2 or 3 am.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQYHNX4JA19TO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD620C6#wasThisHelpful","RQYHNX4JA19TO","AFD7SX9OK0BX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFD7SX9OK0BX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though my storage containers are still a mish/mash of glass and plastic, screw lid and suction lid, etc., everything was really brought together by the labels.  It's almost like my kitchen has a cool eclectic look.  Only word of experienced warning:  Do apply the labels and *then* write on them with the liquid chalk pen.  The pen dries quickly and then when you peel the labels the chalk kinda chips off and makes your writing looking spotty.  It takes a minute or two to get the hand of writing on the side of a glass cylinder, but thankfully a wipe down with a damp paper towel and a sufficient air dry and these labels look brand new.  I imagine if you wanted to make your label more permanent you could spray with clear coat to set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R134P90DGDMVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EEKJSIW#wasThisHelpful","R134P90DGDMVL","AFD7SX9OK0BX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFD7SX9OK0BX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I pick my cuticles and just peel, peel, peel away.  (That scene in Black Swan ain't no joke!  People really do that.  Thank God I don't peel the tops of my fingers.)  There are no real treatments for dermatillomania other than behavior modification ($$$$$$ or your first three offspring is the going rate for that) and the suggestion of using acrylic nails.  For some reason acrylic nails do help me a good bit; I would say I pick 60% to 70% less on average.  There's something about putting on an acrylic nail that makes the picking less (whatever - picking is not pleasurable or comforting, but there's really no right word.  We don't pick because we want to just like those with eating disorders, or alcoholics, or drug addicts don't have their vices because they want them.  It happens and in it you find that ""control"" that you need in that moment and you're hooked.  It sucks! It really, really is gross!! It just sucks!!!) Anyway these nails help more than anything else.  So, why 4 stars instead of 5, you ask:  The color isn't as pretty pink on my lily white skin as I'd hoped; it's almost an 'electric rose'.  Kind of hooker-ish for my tastes.  (Nothing against hookers, they just have a more outgoing color-scheme preference to mine).  I had hoped I wouldn't have to paint them, but I do as a matter of personal preference.  That isn't necessarily anything I'd deduct a star for; I did deduct a star because I find that once I cut these down to my desired length (just beyond the tips of my fingers) and then file them to my desired shape, they do break/crack and then peel very easily.  Perhaps that's because I just glue mine on, cut, shape and leave 'em.  Maybe you absolutely are supposed to put the acrylic gel on top every time and so my deduction of a star is unfair.  If that's the case I apologize to whomever may be offended by my deducting a star.  BTW:  You have to get the Bondini glue that's sold on Amazon.  It makes the beauty supply store/monster-mart glue look like a joke.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQYXGSJTTQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AK0TX3U#wasThisHelpful","R1WQYXGSJTTQ1","AFD7SX9OK0BX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFD7SX9OK0BX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I've had all my looms for years, I rarely have the time that I wish I had to actually sit down and complete a project.  I've made half a dozen or so hats, a handful of scarves, and started (then frogged) about 3 or 4 afghan/blankets/throws.  Hats are my favorite thing to make because I can actually finish a project in one day.  I also belong to several FB loom groups, and one day another member posted photos of a work in progress and the stitch was amazing.  I don't know why, but I just fell for that stitch.  She mentioned that she'd gotten the stitch from this book.  I perused Amazon (<3 <3 <3 my Amazon!) and found it available both paperback and spiral bound.  I chose spiral bound because, after receiving the book VERY QUICKLY, I plan on *making* time to learn most of these new stitches.  I think most books out there are by one of a handful of authors, and sometimes you end up with two or three of these books and realize that - pretty much - two books could've covered everything (but, of course, there's no money in that).  Ms. Erling's book is sort of a different perspective with more than a few stitches that I don't have in my other books.  Really, really glad I got this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U20IULQ58BPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00540TUKC#wasThisHelpful","R3U20IULQ58BPR","AFD7SX9OK0BX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFD7SX9OK0BX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just received the FM Transmitter today. It took me all of 5 minutes to set-up (most of that time was taking it out of the box). Just used the buttons to set the frequency to 87.5 FM, then set the radio to 87.5 FM, plugged the audio cable from the IPOD to the audio in of the unit and voila ... worked great. No noticeable static or noise. (We did replace an existing unit, so all the cables, etc were already in place). When powered down, the Transmitter retains the frequency selected.

"I am not going to go thru the story line .. other reviewers have done that. I just want to say that in my opinion, this has turned into another West Wing.  As we watched season 3, we felt that we had tuned into reruns of that old series. Until I received season 3 (We had watched season 1 and 2 from borrowed DVDs from my brother-in-law.) We watched the BBC series of the same name, that this series was based on. I had purchased it years ago, but didn't watch it, as my wife thought it was boring. It was worth watching, to see how closely this series was based on it. Once we got into it, it was just as riveting as this American series is. Then we watched season 3 of this series, still interesting, but not as intense as season 1 or 2. However. we will probably get subsequent seasons just to follow it out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DSOJ50XS1YOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHAJ24S#wasThisHelpful","R2DSOJ50XS1YOC","A1UCAVBNJUZMPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UCAVBNJUZMPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice case .... it's just too bad it didn't work for my ASUS T100TA transformer tablet. The bottom part of the case that holds the keyboard covers the right and left hand keys along the edge. This renders the keyboard useless. Other than that one big flaw, it is a nice leather case for the price. I am sure it may fit other ASUS models, but definitely NOT the T100TA.UPDATE: My mistake ... The case came with no instructions, I realize now that I had the case on backwards. I only realized this when I looked closely at the product photos.

"I use PDF's extensively for archiving all online bills, statements etc. I have the full blown PDF Converter Pro on both my PC and laptop. I just purchased an ASUS T100TA tablet (Running Win 8.1). Since I plan on using this tablet only for periodic trips, I did not want to spend up to $100 for another full blown software package. I considered PDF Create, but read some reviews about constant requests to ""upgrade"". The free ""Cutewriter"" was also said to have ""Ad"" problems. At $35 this seemed a reasonable alternative. The download was simple enough (I will admit I had to do a second install, as the first one did not seem to take). But doing a ""remove"" and re installing wasn't that big a deal. Once up and running, the software simply creates a ""printer"" on your system named Win2PDF and you select it to create a PDF of what-ever-it-is you want to print, be it a document, webpage, etc.  I've only used it a few times, but it appears to be doing exactly what I wanted it for.UPDATE:  11/5/15  When I went to use this program to print from IE, it errored. It also errored with Firefox. I decided to remove the program and then re-installed it. That seemed to fix it. It is working for now. If this re-occurs, I will update again. For now I removed 1 star due to its apparent instability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N5LL9EDCZ0VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CNTEPA#wasThisHelpful","R2N5LL9EDCZ0VA","A1UCAVBNJUZMPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UCAVBNJUZMPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not bad ... it works and does feel like MS Word enough that you can use it fairly easily if you normally use Word itself. I needed it on my ASUS T100TA tablet (Running 32-bit Win 8.1) and they wanted a monthly fee to activate ""MS Office"" on it (well over $100 a year).

"This series was lent to us by a relative. From the very first episode, you are hooked. If this series is even remotely close to how our government works, we may as well give up. My wife and I finished this series in about 3 days. The story and plot are absolutely riveting ... and you can not wait for the next episode to see what happens next. I am NOT going to go into details, I am just going to say the casting and acting were absolutely superb. There was only one single character in the entire series that you will even remotely like, and that was Freddy, the ribs guy (yet even he turned out to be flawed to a degree). We realized that there was not a single politician, lobbyist, staff member, military, etc that the series portrayed that was at all sympathetic or likable.

"I am rating this only 2 stars because it worked only one night, when we refilled it for the second night, the on/off light stayed red, indicating the tank was empty. Emptied the tank and let it dry-out overnight. Tried it again .. same thing, it never sensed that there was liquid in the tank. I returned it for a replacement, and will update this review pending how or if the replacement works.08/28/15 UPDATE: We received our replacement diffuser yesterday and we used it all afternoon and overnight. It seems to be working fine. I opted for this unit because it was recommended by my sister and sister-in-law. All the Amazon reviews were positive, and we had tried it out while visiting my brother and liked it. The seller contacted me and was very apologetic about the unit that failed, and was extremely sincere about making sure we were happy with the diffuser. Well .. we certainly are happy with it. I have one suggestion for users. I had a small unused measuring cup that had come with one of my wife's large washing machine detergent bottles. I measured how far to fill the cup so the amount would refill the diffuser just up to the fill mark. I put a score mark on the cup at that level.

"This was a very interesting read, but I did not find anything I haven't seen touched upon in my many years of reading sci-fi. That said, they have been put together cleverly in this narrative. I did find the pace to be fast and it did keep my interest. It was a bit frustrating that  although man has reached the stars, the dregs of society came with him. Not only do some of these scum not deserve to live, but with the advent of disintegrator beams, they don't deserve to even exist.

"OK - first of all, I feel this is more fantasy than Sci-Fi. There is very little actual ""science"" in it at all. The plot bases its drama on the stupidity and naivete of its main characters. I actually felt that some of them deserved what they got. I could not imagine calling these ""aliens"" intelligent. I found myself skimming over a lot of the paragraphs and pages, as they were just so ""wordy"". The main thing that kept me shaking my head, was that after witnessing and experiencing so many ""miracles"",  the characters were still letting their pride and egos guide their own selfish motives. I totally agree with the premise that a certain middle east fanatic religion will cause the end of civilization if not the world.  The projection of the ultimate welfare state of this country's future is right on. The author has basically projected the future based on present circumstances and situations. If you remove the fantasy stuff, this is ultimately a political thriller. Not sure if I will continue reading after these first 3 books, the sample of book four indicates more of the same. More problems caused by naivete, arrogance, pride and just plain stupidity. I hate it when characters never seem to learn.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14565WI5G5XHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GS2W6T2#wasThisHelpful","R14565WI5G5XHE","A1UCAVBNJUZMPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UCAVBNJUZMPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While on a trip to NY/NJ from NC to visit relatives, I inadvertently left my Kindle at our first stop. We weren't returning there for our trip back to NC for a whole week. I was in the middle of reading a book and wasn't very happy. Then I remembered that I did have my laptop and Amazon did have a PC app. Found it, downloaded it and it works great. I was able to download the book I was reading and continue. I really like the dual page option, as it is very much like opening a book and having two pages in front of you. Don't even need the mouse, the L-R arrows move the pages forward and backward. Most of what it does is intuitive ... I was able to use it within a minute or two. A great alternative to the Kindle. (But I still will use the kindle, as the laptop is definitely not what I want to lug around in place of it).

"When I first thought about this necklace I figured it was going to be cheaply made and something for a kid, especially for $20. But I was pleasantly surprise when I received the necklace. It comes in a plastic bag in a nice velvet drawstring bag inside another plastic bag. It was well protected and had the feel of finer jewelry.The horse has some weight to it, it does not feel flimsy. It is a touch bigger than a quarter. I also really like how the stones are set into it. I usually see some that are half-heartedly glued in. These stones are set into the horse and look like they belong there. Not a hint of glue anywhere.I admit that I am not a fan of the chain. It is an 18” ball chain with an extra 2  inch extender. This is not a bad chain but to me it kind of makes the horse look a little cheaper. But I found a nicer silver chain and switched it out, which is really easy with the big loop on top of the horse. Not it looks really elegant.If you are looking for a nice horse jewelry piece I recommend getting this one. Although I don’t agree with the $50 value I agree that $20 is a good price to pay.Shawn KovacichAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FEOIAWQPV3ZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQCDDFS#wasThisHelpful","R3FEOIAWQPV3ZF","A246YIFE5M6M2C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A246YIFE5M6M2C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that I am a long time Adobe fan, approaching 15 years and am currently the owner of its latest Masters Collection. However, I have to say that this software and other Corel software have me truly appreciating what Corel has to offer for a fraction of the cost of similar Adobe products. In addition to cost, I also find that the Corel software is often times a lot easier to use than the Adobe software and that is really a great selling point for me. Does this software offer everything that a similar Adobe software offers? No, but often times you don't really need all those extra bells and whistles unless you are a professional editor or perhaps even use it extensively in your business. But if you are the average person trying to create some beautiful work, then I would definitely give this and other software from Corel and definite look because I don't believe that you would be disappointed at all.Shawn KovacichAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCYQMHLPP7CWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C60D8#wasThisHelpful","RCYQMHLPP7CWL","A246YIFE5M6M2C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A246YIFE5M6M2C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just recently received this product and at a very fortunate time I was getting ready to go out hunting shortly after it had arrived. Therefore, I was actually able to take this out in the field and under actual conditions to try it out, and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed at all with the results.To start off with, this rangefinder arrived in a very well packaged box and had incurred no damage during shipping. Always a bonus! It is very lightweight and easy to handle even with gloves on, although it the gloves are to big and bulky then you more than likely will have some handling issues with it. I am not particularly a fan of camouflage, but I have to admit that it does look nice on this rangefinder. A lot better than hot pink anyhow. I didn't have any problems with it at all in the cold, and it did get below freezing and worked flawlessly. I was able to get it to range out to just over 500 yards, but I don't know if it will go much further than that. The manufacturer advertises 500 meters/yards and I would have to say that claim was accurate as far as I could determine. I used it for about 10 hours off and on throughout the day and found it to be very reliable.Shawn KovacichAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21R2GUV3WRSHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015FM1ZWY#wasThisHelpful","R21R2GUV3WRSHE","A246YIFE5M6M2C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A246YIFE5M6M2C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that I have been a huge Adobe fan for going on 15 years now and have the most recent Masters Collection. My only complaint is the pricey upgrades that also seem to pop up every year or so. But anyhow, on with the review for this product.This is a much simpler and more basic version of the Adobe Photoshop software so therefore it isn't capable of doing everything that Photoshop can, but it does offer a lot of awesome possibilities for someone who doesn't need the full version. Each successive version of this product, just like all the other Adobe products, does offer some improvement upon  the previous versions and this one is no different. Now I am not going to go into lengthy detail on all of the features as other reviewers have already done so and to repeat it would be annoying and redundant. However, I am going to say that this is a very reasonably priced product that is well worth the price for the features offered. It is more than adequate for the average user and is only outshone by the full Adobe Photoshop version.Shawn KovacichAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QTJ38V9O5XJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GP8XGM#wasThisHelpful","R2QTJ38V9O5XJO","A246YIFE5M6M2C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A246YIFE5M6M2C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought that this would be an early Christmas present for my cats. When I got the box it was pretty good sized and heavy, I recommend moving the box with help. I had to try and squeeze it into my truck and drive home with the lid unlatched.I took everything out of the box. All of the pieces are pretty easy to figure out and the sisal wrapped poles have numbers on them so it was very easy to figure out what went where. You will assemble this cat pole from top to bottom. I admit that this confused me for a little bit but once you start assembly it makes perfect sense. I have assembled other cat poles before and they work from the ground up. Then there are some places that are not as secure as they could be. When working top down you can get everything tight and not worry about wobble from the cats scratching it.This is a fair sized cat pole, just over 2 foot by 2 foot on width and length and about 5 foot high. When I set it up I expected the cats to sniff and ignore it. I took the box to the trash and by the time I got back in the house I had two cats on the pole. Within an hour several had come by and scratched it.The little round beds have a little padding in them and I have had a couple of the cats already sleeping on them. The round cylinder with two holes doesn’t have a cut out so they can go from top to bottom but I did have my stocky 13 pound boy crawl into the top hole.The only thing that I am wondering about on the design is that this pole looks like you can put it in the corner of the room. On the round two hold cylinder there is a section of sisal to the cats can scratch it. When put together it is basically facing a wall and there is no access to the scratcher.Beyond that, this is a great cat pole and a great price. It is very sturdy and has handled my cats racing onto it, tearing it up, and catapulting off again. If you are looking for a smaller cat scratching post I would recommend checking this one out.Shawn KovacichAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6R8FMAPTFORF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY25P7Y#wasThisHelpful","R6R8FMAPTFORF","A246YIFE5M6M2C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A246YIFE5M6M2C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful pair of hoop earrings made of 10K yellow and rose gold. The Rose gold is a little heart at the bottom of the hoop. There is beautiful scroll work that also says Mom. I admit that I didn’t see the Mom at first because it blends into the scroll work. The scroll work also has some decorative lines in it and makes the earrings sparkle like they have a gemstone in them.These earrings have a click-top clasp and if they are pulled down I could see losing one. But if you notice that one doesn’t seem to be catching as well, just push the clasp together a tiny bit and it will fix the problem.The earring are a touch over ½ inch in diameter so they are not too bulky and delicate enough to look like other expensive earrings. These are one sided earrings so you will have to pay attention when wearing. They are designed to have the Mom on the outside of the earring. The other side is just the plain hoop.This would be a great gift for any mom, new or grand.

"Okay, the first thing I have to say is that I was really impressed that it came with its own batteries and I didn't have to go purchase more in order to get it to work in the first place. So major kudos to the manufacturer for including batteries with their product, I know I am not the only one that is going to like that. So besides the fact that batteries are included, how does it work? Well, it actually works quite well and doing a wide variety of tasks. The one thing that you MUST DO first and foremost is to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS first before attempting to use this device. It may take a few minutes of reading, but it will make using this device much simpler and with a lot less headaches.Not only does it measure in a straight line, but it also works measuring angles as well. Now they say the range is 165 feet + or - 1/16th of an inch, and I would have to say that the plus or minus part is accurate, only I can't say for sure at the distance because I have yet had the opportunity to measure it out that far and see if it really works out to that distance. Sure I could have went out onto the sidewalk to test it, but I preferred to test it under normal conditions in the house and garage. Okay, hand on a minute and I will run outside and give it a try...(Approximately 3 minutes later)Okay, I just got back from running outside to try the 165 foot claim from the manufacturer and I actually got it to measure out past 170 feet. Not to sure on the plus or minus accuracy statement at that distance as I don't have a tape measure that will reach that far, but if I had to guess I would say that the plus or minus statement is probably pretty accurate, even at that extreme distance. I know it is accurate well under that distance as I tried it out inside the house and the garage.The case appears to be well made and feels really sturdy and should hold up to the normal demands of a construction project. However, I don't think I would purposefully drop it from any kind of height over say just a couple of feet for fear that it probably would cause some type of damage to it. I mean it is an electronic device so you should exercise better care with it than say you might with a hammer. You can also download some really nice apps for even more measuring capabilities, such as; floor plans, documents, etc. The apps are free and although they do take a few minutes to download and figure out, they are actually quite user friendly.The manufacturer also claims that you can take up to 10,000 measurements before needing to replace the batteries. I have absolutely no idea if that is a correct statement or not and I have no inclination whatsoever to try it out. I really would like to maintain my sanity and I think sitting, standing, lying, or even walking and taking 10,000 measurements of anything would be enough to drive the sanest person in the world over the edge. So on that claim I am going to take their word for it.Highly recommended!Shawn KovacichAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGFM0U86FGRVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015FCJTEA#wasThisHelpful","RGFM0U86FGRVK","A246YIFE5M6M2C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A246YIFE5M6M2C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I already have an OtterBox protective cover on my Galaxy S5 and it works great! Very well made and solid design that protects my phone from accidental drops and dings. However, this new protective case from OtterBox fails in that it sacrifices the normal amount of protection in order to give you an admittedly kind of cool gimmick. And that is where you can swap out the back of the case with a wide variety of inserts, although only one insert comes with this case and you have to purchase any others that you may want, that you can exchange in order to customize the look, which I guess for some people is more important than protecting your several hundred dollar phone.I have to admit that it is a neat idea, I just think they could have implemented it better where you don't have to sacrifice the protection and still add the cool changeable inserts.

"At Lux, a large think tank, in Rhode Island a Dr. Willard Strachey has been in charge of the restoration of the West Wing of Lux. But while working he discovers a strange room with no door. After being in there he reseals it and tells no one about it. He then starts displaying strange behavior, attacks a co-worker, then kills him self in a brutal fashion.Jeremy Logan, who used to work a Lux ten years prior before he was forced to leave, is called back to figure out what happened to Strachey. Jeremy is known as an enigmalogist, he specializes in the paranormal and finding explanations to the events. This is not going to be an easy investigation since there are still some people around that knew Jeremy when he worked a Lux and they seem to be ready to give him a hard time.Jeremy does have his empathy abilities to help him out with the investigation. He finds the secret room and a strange machine from the 1930’s. Somehow this seems to be what caused Strachey’s problems. It’s now up to Jeremy to figure out what it is, how it works, and why it caused Strachey to kill himself.I am an avid Lincoln Child fan and I recently read The Third Gate and loved Jeremy Logan. He is a great character. This was an interesting story; I admit I was hooked from the beginning about the Loch Ness monster. Anyway, there is a lot of action and secrets. It’s hard to know who to trust and what to believe. I felt for Jeremy when dealing with former co-workers, but I loved the whole mystery around the strange machine.This is a great, quick story. I got wrapped up in it quickly and couldn’t wait to see where it went. I admit that it’s a bit different than the Pendergast series but it is still a really good book.Shawn KovacichAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R78PHJU91DLE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385531400#wasThisHelpful","R78PHJU91DLE1","A246YIFE5M6M2C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A246YIFE5M6M2C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I am sure that somewhere down the road someone will come out with one that is even better, but not today! This product was easy to put on and is really durable and damage resistant. Notice that I sent damage resist and not damage proof. Nothing is damage proof, but you would really have to go out of your way to damage this product. You should be able to go through your day-to-day activities and not be concerned about causing any damage to this product, which in turn means that your iPhone is going to be even more so protected.

"Okay, I am not into ""selfies"" nor do I have any inclination to ever do so. However, I found this to be an excellent device for getting overhead angles when filming various projects. Now you have to play with the angles a bit in order to see exactly where you need to film, but that pretty much goes without saying as you really don't have a way to view the subject matter that you are filming at the time. I found everything to be functionally correct as advertised and I didn't really have any issues with any of the features, although there can always be more options available.

I have had this product for several weeks now and decided to really put it to the test before posting my review on it. I have used it during normal day-to-day activities, as well as, on weekend excursions and it has held up each and every time. Now I am not much of a wine drinker so at times I put in a bottle of sparkling grape juice, etc. and it more than stood up to the challenge of constantly being moved around from location to location and I never had a single issue with it.

"I actually was quite surprised that I would really have an opinion on this product other than it was a plastic storage bag. However, these are really very sturdy and I have been using them to storage a variety of non-food items and they hold up extremely well. Very nice in size and not to small like a typical sandwich, or those even smaller snack storage bags. These bags also have the ""slider"" opening and closing tab unlike the typical press and seal type storage bags. This makes it a lot easier to open and close, which is always a plus.

"I guess the best place to start this review, like any good story, is at the beginning. When my packaged arrived, I had one hole torn out in the corner of the box and one on the opposite side of the box about 8 inches from the opposite corner. And in both cases, parts of the product were sticking out. Thankfully this is metal, so other than a minor scratch or two there didn't seem to be any major damage. I did end up having a few missing screws, but I merely went down to the local hardware store and got replacements. Yes, they should have been in the box and yes, I wasn't very happy about the missing parts, but if that ends up being my biggest complaint then I guess that is okay with me.I ended up installing this in my garage and mounted it from the ceiling beams, which by the way I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were at the standard distance as they seem to be the only things in the house that were built to the proper specifications. It took me about 30 to 40 minutes to get it installed with my girlfriends help. Once installed it easily held my weight of just under 200 lbs. with no signs of trouble.

"Okay, what can you realistically put in a review about a memory card? I mean it either works, or it doesn't work. Sure, you can have varying degrees of storage space, like for example this card has 32 gigabytes of memory while others have less and still others have more, so you really can't comment on the storage space unless it doesn't meet the amount advertised. Now perhaps they can start putting them out in a variety of colors, but what sense would that really make, I mean you are only going to see them for a short period of time so it's not like you would need to be color coordinated with your outfit. Now there is also the possibility of some kind of formatting issue, but really, I haven't ever had an issue like that with any of the memory cards that I have purchased in the last several years. Sure, I often times have to get everything synced up with the device I am using it in, but never have I not had a memory card work for me.

"I received a sample of this for free from BulkSupplements for the purpose of reviewing it.I've found Tyrosine to be a wonderful addition to my life. My mood is better, I seem to have a little more energy (which could just be related to my mood), I sleep better, and I feel a better sense of general ""well-being.""What a vague load of unverifiable crap, I know, but it's true! Tyrosine is an interesting compound that, through several mechanisms of action, signals your body to produce more dopamine, thus also adrenaline. Between the two, you'll feel just -better- and also respond to stressful situations with more ease. I don't believe there is anyone out there who wouldn't benefit from Tyrosine supplementation, honestly.N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is a variety of this amino acid bound to Acetic acid, which increases the bioavailability and absorption rate. Arguably, NALT is superior, but Tyrosine still works!As always, Bulksupplements has fast shipping, good packaging with reasonable listed doses, and good pricing. I find that the taste of most amino acid powders is unpleasant, so I ultimately decided to go with tablets for my Tyrosine needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD4CHWZ83ZWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENQL6AU#wasThisHelpful","R3CD4CHWZ83ZWM","A3O8UWK94J4GQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O8UWK94J4GQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Full disclosure: I did take it with grapefruit juice, which has some citrus bioflavanoids that change how some compounds are absorbed by the body.)I received a three-capsule trial of this product with an order I placed through a different website. I checked the ingredients first, and it all seemed reasonable. A couple herbal extracts and something called ""methyltheobromine."" I'm familiar with theobromine as a compound present in cacao, which gives energy without the jitteriness or dependency of caffeine.My experience with it was pretty intense - there wasn't much to speak of at first, but about an hour later (near the tail end of my workout) I noticed I was pumped full of energy and speed, as if I had consumed quite a bit of caffeine! I was getting into the music like never before, and felt great! My appetite was shot all day afterwards - barely ate a thing - and I was just shy of vibrating with energy for about 10 hours straight.So, pretty good stuff, and the ingredients are interesting if not intentionally misleading. See, I try to watch my caffeine intake as I'm relatively sensitive to it. I typically try to keep it at under 90mg / day because of irritability, insomnia, and anxiety. So, when I saw this had no caffeine, I was excited... And then I google searched ""methyltheobromine"". Caffeine. 160mg of it. That's not a super huge amount or anything, but it's more than zero and that is more than they make clear on the bottle. Heck, the instructions even say ""do not take with caffeine"" which is absolutely hilarious.As for the other ingredients:- White Willow extract: known to reduce fever and pain, which will increase your endurance a little bit.- N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine: the amino acid L-Tyrosine bound to acetic acid, which increases tyrosine's bioavailability and absorption rate. NALT increases the production of Dopamine which is closely tied to the production of Adrenaline. There's more to NALT than that, but that's a whole essay in itself.- Naringin: Remember what I said about grapefruit and bioflavanoids? This is one of them, built right into the capsule. Generally speaking, it will increase the bioavailability, absorption rate, and duration of most compounds - notably, caffeine.- Cymbidium Goeringii extract (""Orchidlean""): An extract of a Himalayan orchid that this company touts as ""THREE TIMES STRONGER THAN DMAA"" (a substance recently banned by most sports anti-doping agencies). There isn't much information out there about this particular ingredient as a supplement aside from what this company is stating, and there's a pretty dire conflict of interest there. I wouldn't assume this actually does anything.- Pikatropin: GABA and Niacin combined. Between the two, they are anti-anxiety and vasodilating (widens and softens blood vessels for increased circulation), and Niacin helps the body produce energy as well.This is a well-rounded supplement, and the ingredients are decent. Just keep in mind that the majority of the effect is likely to be the caffeine, and you could probably replicate the most noticeable effects of this supplement by getting Niacin, grapefruit juice, and caffeine pills - for considerably less than this product. It's worth getting if you don't want to get the ingredients separately, I would say - the price is reasonable for the quantity and effect. Certainly, the appetite suppressant aspect was most notable to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP8P8JZ84K4HD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FLI323I#wasThisHelpful","RP8P8JZ84K4HD","A3O8UWK94J4GQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O8UWK94J4GQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a lot of protein mixes, and this is probably my favorite. It doesn't have the best flavor out of all of them, but what it does have is, hands-down, the best muscle recovery blend I have seen.I've been a fan of hydrolyzed collagen for a while now. It helped me get rid of my loose skin around my stomach and it also boosts the appearance and resilience of your skin and joints.What isn't often touched on with this ""beauty"" product is that it also helps with muscle development. Hydrolyzed protein is broken down to bi and tri peptides, which are more readily absorbed by your digestive system. Indeed, within 30 minutes of ingesting this on an empty stomach, those peptides are already getting to your tissues - be they muscles, ligaments, or skin.I prefer to use this pre and mid workout, and as a nighttime snack. To avoid protein uptake competition, I eat it on an empty stomach. That also ensures the BCAAs inherent in the protein are at their optimal ratios for recovery and muscle building.My skin and muscles have never looked or felt better. This is going to be a staple of my regiment until I find something superior - which I strain to imagine. Between the high-quality proteins, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and delicious taste, this is a hard one to replace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REE7BCLNLGRDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EWW20K#wasThisHelpful","REE7BCLNLGRDV","A3O8UWK94J4GQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O8UWK94J4GQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this product for free in exchange for a review. In my time using it, I have noticed absolutely zero effects whatsoever, even in the slightest degree. I have not taken it for days straight, taken it for days straight, alternated, taken it with meals, taken it on an empty stomach, taken it in the morning, evening, and afternoon... I have yet to notice any effect whatsoever.HOWEVERThat does not necessarily mean that this product is not working. By it's own description, the effects it purports to have are subtle and ideally would not be noticed by anyone who was not taking blood samples and/or regularly monitoring their blood pressure. As such, I cannot honestly downrate this product, but I also cannot positively attest to its effectiveness.I can tell you a few things about the product's physical characteristics, however:- It seems to dissolve and mix relatively easily.- It is a somewhat coarse brown powder.- It has an unpleasant odor, somewhat reminiscent of mold.As a 26-year-old athletic and physically active male who has no major health concerns, I cannot say that this product is worth the expenditure for anyone in a similar situation. I was hoping for some kind of aid in my exercise regime - blood thinners and antioxidants have many uses in that setting - however, I noticed no increased vasodilation and no perceivable increase in performance.I have had very positive experiences with Bulksupplements in the past, and have no reason to doubt that the substance is at the very least what it claims to be.

"I have been impressed with this product for a number of reasons:- Taste: I was initially hesitant to order an unflavored protein powder - especially one that mentions it might be ""less smooth tasting"" due to the hydrolyzed why component - but I was pleased to find the taste was almost neutral, if slightly reminiscent of Mozzarella.- Mixability: AMAZING! A full scoop, which is quite substantial, mixes very easily and quickly into as little as 4oz of water (as suggested on the label! I still didn't believe it when I read it and looked at the scoop size). However, it does not mix -perfectly-, as there is a consistent teensy granular residue left on the inside of whatever container I use. That said, the only protein powders I have seen mix -perfectly- used quite a bit of fat and/or soy lecithin as emulsifiers. It's unsurprising that this doesn't dissolve completely, is what I'm getting at.- Nutrition: OFF THA CHAIN. WHAT. 27g OF PROTEIN FOR 113 CALORIES? THAT'S NOT JUST CRAZY, THAT'S CRAZY SAUCE. THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT SAUCE AND BOIL IT TO REMOVE WATER SO IT BECOMES A CRAZY REDUCTION. YOU CAN THEN DRIZZLE THAT CRAZY REDUCTION AS A GLAZE ONTO YOUR MUSCLES. Also, it has very low fat! 0.3g per serving! Fantastic.- Digestibility: As someone who typically gets gas and bloating from dairy, I can report that I get zero such issues with this product.- Functionality: Very high! I drink one serving in 4oz of water at night, immediately prior to bed, to stay anabolic throughout the night. I also use it for my post-workout shake!- Affordability: This is easily the most expensive jar of protein mix I have purchased, but the number of servings and the quality and ratio of ingredients make it perfectly justified. It really just is a big jar of quality, source-traceable, well-balanced protein. It's exactly the kind of thing I never knew I wished existed.This powder adds almost no flavor whatsoever, so you have a pretty blank slate to work with. Also, given that it has almost no fat, it is a very light and watery substance when mixed. I like to use 12oz of water and add cacao powder, maca powder, hemp oil, and coconut sugar (2 tbsp / 1tbsp / 1tbsp / 1 tbsp, respectively) to the mix to give it a nice, thick, creamy, nutty flavor and texture. (Of course, that also adds about 400 calories, but, eh.)If you're relatively serious about nutrition or bodybuilding, I strongly recommend this. It's the perfect protein mix for building lean muscle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CL8FR96WAFDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQ5CIWM#wasThisHelpful","R3CL8FR96WAFDU","A3O8UWK94J4GQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O8UWK94J4GQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stuff is so effective I wish I could take it every day. Alas, one of the characteristics of this compound is that it loses effectiveness if taken for too many consecutive days. I always take this pre-workout in the morning, and I noticed increased mental focus and clarity along with visibly (!!!) increased circulation.I'm on my third bottle, and these results are pretty consistent:I seem to be able to get the full effect out of this for two days in a row. On the third day, the mental effect is notably diminished, but the circulation boost is still there. On the fourth day, there seems to be no focus boost AND the circulation boost seems to be greatly diminished as well.After day three or four, I seem to only have to wait about 24-48 hours before it will work again, albeit to a notable diminished degree. After 72 hours, I seem to be able to get the full effect out of it.So, in my experience, the ideal consistent intake methods are:- on two days, off the next three days, repeat- on one day, off the next, on the next, off the next, repeat- on two days, off one day, on one day, off two days, repeat (this is what I do now, as it means the most consecutive days at admittedly diminished efficacy.)This is the only nootropic and pre-workout supplement that I have to give a schedule, but I find it's entirely worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XNV66OSX8HQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007A2E0W#wasThisHelpful","R1XNV66OSX8HQN","A3O8UWK94J4GQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O8UWK94J4GQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been taking this pretty consistently - once a day in the morning with a small meal - for a couple months. I have noticed a slight bettering of my mood, and it seems to work synergystically with centrophenoxine and phenylpiracetam - magnifying the effects of both. By itself, the effect is subtle and seems to build on itself with repeated use.These are all things that I noticed, and then discovered had been documented as observed effects of this substance - so, I'm fairly confident in what I have stated here. I wouldn't say it is worth buying by itself, but, combined with either of the aforementioned substances, it's a great thing to have.I've seen some concerns about addiction, as this substance may directly influence your dopamine receptors. I had stopped and started at varying intervals prior to when I became consistent about taking it, and noticed no impulses or withdrawals. However, I have taken just the one 500mg capsule daily, and many people are likely to take more and more often. In that case, addiction may be a valid concern.I did take 1500mg in one day once, and noticed no significant difference. Certainly, I noticed that there was a difference, but I had spread the dosages across the day and that probably mitigated any of the stronger or potentially ill effects it would otherwise have had. Certainly, I don't recommend taking more than one a day, as it really is quite enough and makes the bottle a pretty decent value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XKM7HWB0L3MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HX767U0#wasThisHelpful","R1XKM7HWB0L3MX","A3O8UWK94J4GQN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O8UWK94J4GQN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked these up on a whim just a little before I was scheduled to work. I took one just about a half hour before I got to work, and by the time I had clocked in I felt like I had taken a caffeine pill. I was firing on all cylinders and ready to go.It's worth noting some things, however:- I'm 26, male, and active. I work out daily, and make a point to exert myself at all opportunities.- My job involves quite a bit of walking and lifting.- I eat a high protein / high carbohydrate diet, and I snack consistently throughout the day as opposed to having what would typically be considered meals.I am not sedentary, I am not overweight, and I was moving around the entire time. As I carefully monitor my diet and the supplements I take, I am very confident that the drastic energy boost was from the 7-keto.I did also notice that I felt a bit warmer than usual, but that could easily just be psychosomatic as I had read the label and had seen ""thermogenesis "" as the intended effect.This feeling lasted about four hours in total for me. I also noticed that I didn't get nearly as hungry as I typically do during a work day.I really like these, and will be making them a staple of my workouts. At a cost of twenty bucks for 60, that's ten bucks a month for rage-workouts without the need for caffeine. Done deal. Sold.

"This knife has no business being as nice as it is. It costs too little for how well put-together every aspect seems to be:- KVT Bearing pivot. It snaps open quickly, smoothly, and easily without any wrist-flick or a spring.- Gorgeous stonewash finish, which is both attractive on its own and has the benefit of hiding scratches.- Wonderful hand-filling-but-not-clunky handle, and the ""k-texture"" grip on the G10 fiberglass handle scales provides great retention even with wet or greasy hands.- The absence of a thumbstud makes it that much better of a cutting tool - there is no metal nub to get caught on whatever medium you're cutting through, and the fully flat-ground blade makes it wonderfully effective.- Deep-carry pocket clip, seamlessly integrated into the handle.I also like that it's essentially a frame-lock knife with a handle scale overlay, as opposed to a bare frame or a linerlock. It makes for a lockbar with a confidence-inspiring thickness without sacrificing grippiness or symmetry.This knife has a lot of the features and qualities that I expect from substantially more expensive knife.

"I'm not entirely sure how effective these are, honestly. While I have no reason to doubt the contents of the tablets, I wonder if either the delivery method or the amount is somehow ineffectual. I've been taking HICA consistently through BCAA mixes, and decided that I would like to use the tablets as well. After three jars, I have been left with the overall impression that it didn't do a whole heck of a lot when compared to the BCAA mixes. Off or on, it didn't seem to have any considerable effect.I tried multiple methods and times of ingestion: 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes before and/or after, during, with or without protein, carbohydrates, fats, or other amino acids. Any combination of those, I have tried. I've tried taking multiple over the course of the day, taking 2-5 at once...

"Judy, though only in her 60s, becomes aware that she's losing her memory. Not the simple misplaced purse but whole sections of the day she can't remember – finding herself out dog-walking and unaware of how to get home. Her daughters Laura and Kelly find a respite place for her and it rapidly becomes apparent that she can no longer cope. While clearing her house, Laura finds part of an A4 pad on which her mother has started writing about her youth, with special reference to a mystery disappearance. Laura's own life begins to echo some aspects of her mother's. Things come to a head with a family wedding.This is a super mystery story but it's also a detailed and affectionate look at a mother's failing mind. The day to day difference between a good day and a day when things go completely haywire is well observed. Judy is sometimes irrational or anxious which makes Laura's exploration of her past very difficult. We finally discover the truth about the past but it wasn't as simple as Judy, or her daughter, believed. A splendid story, highly recommended.I received an advance copy for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VEENU0J78LJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016H02O3W#wasThisHelpful","R2VEENU0J78LJU","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In the first, Strange Shores, a teacher who has lost his wife to cancer, find a way that he believes he will reach her again. In Alfonso’s Looking Glass a young man who has lost his wife has spent three years wrapped in grief. His grandfather’s looking glass offers joy or despair. He finds a way to utilise this for his own happiness.

"I suspect most of us reading Nowhere Child will have already read Stranger Child and been left with – not an incomplete story, but one with a few dangling edges. Tasha has deliberately made herself homeless and Emma won’t rest until she finds her. The problem is, Tasha doesn’t want to be found. She fears that Emma hates her. After something happens to the young man who shares her homeless state and looks after her, she begins to fear that she brings misfortune on those whose lives she touches.This novella has some very exciting points which I can’t tell you for fear of spoiling it.

"I really enjoyed this creepy story set in the US farming community of whispering Pines. The Red Church is now no longer used for worship but as a storage area for hay bales. Then a local man returns from California after twenty years away to open it again to an uncomfortable style of religion with midnight services and some dubious activities. The sheriff is riddled with guilt over his little brother's death years ago and the great grandfather of the new incumbent is still seen to haunt the graveyard - the hung preacher is a local legend. The local 'old blood' families are being preyed on and young Ronnie Day is in danger of being the next.This is a compelling read. Any story set in a place cut off or set apart, as this small mountain community is, has a feeling of claustrophobia which greatly adds to the horror. It occupies a familiar niche within the horror genre but it does it very well. I was on edge to the end to see what would happen and there were some shocks along the way. A great read for horror fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R248DX8ENGV30Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032FPYD8#wasThisHelpful","R248DX8ENGV30Z","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second of Paul Levinson's Exo-Engineers books.A suspended chord has a dissonance which creates tension and a feeling of unease and incompleteness. Just before a settler is killed by an out-of-the-blue lightning strike, the birds which inhabit the planet being investigated for signs of intelligent life are heard to sing suspended fourth chords. Jack, the husband of the woman who dies, is convinced the birds were issuing a warning. He investigates sudden deaths to try to discover if the birds are able to anticipate or predict a death.I've really enjoyed both of these short stories and the ideas underlying them. I feel the cost for such a short ‘book’ will deter people from reading them. It’s great to read intelligent ideas about intelligent life. A book full of these stories would definitely merit a five star review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ERSBEEMHP30V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011T0JPBY#wasThisHelpful","R3ERSBEEMHP30V","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Actually, three and a half. I read and really enjoyed the author’s thriller for adults, M.O.D. so I thought I’d try his Young Adult fiction. In this story, the first of a trilogy, Rick is single father to teenaged daughters, and has effectively adopted some of his children’s friends. One of the girls finds an artefact which turns out to be the key to an amazing hidden cave in which it’s possible to access other times. A time machine! Rick’s lady-friend is an archaeologist and during the course of the book they become closer and the girls act as cupid to ensure that she moves in. There are several little threads like this woven together which make for plenty of interest.I found the beginning hard going. It rested heavily on the girls’ sporting prowess and competitions and matches. I’m sure some people would love this but for me it held up progress. I bought the book for the time aspect and fought to get there. Once the artefact and the cave were in play, the story ripped away and I enjoyed it a lot. The writing isn’t too heavy and young adults will enjoy it and not feel talked down to. All in all, I found it a good story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14GNH93LMVH9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007XKFDFM#wasThisHelpful","R14GNH93LMVH9K","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kate is still grieving for the loss of one of her twin daughters to cancer, a circumstance which destroyed the dregs of an ailing marriage. She meets Mark who comes to make shelves for her new cottage. He has experienced the loss of his partner Emma’s young son in a house-fire for which Emma blames him because he slipped out for a few minutes to the shops and that was when the fire broke out. Then children die in fires up and down the country – wherever Mark is. He knows he is in the frame. Can Emma believe him?The story touches on guilt, family rivalry – Kate’s sister is a detective working on the cases – friendship, loyalty and love. Kate’s husband reappears to insist on taking his daughter out at weekends and also, to Kate’s horror, refusing to allow her to be alone in Mark’s care. It’s an interesting study in why people fall apart and what helps to pull them back together to remake their lives. I enjoyed this story which is a thriller with a psychological edge. Highly recommended.I received an advance copy of this book for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33FXSBE7L1NJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168JSGJI#wasThisHelpful","R33FXSBE7L1NJJ","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Book 1 of the Exo-Genetic Engineers series in which humans are searching for evidence of intelligence in the wider universe. A group arrives for a research mission on a planet with life, but nothing suggests any of it has the kind of intelligence they are searching for. Then they start to eat the fruit of the trees.It’s an interesting concept and I enjoyed the ideas concerning how one would define intelligence – is it deliberate interference with evolution, for example? The writing, as I’ve found before from Paul Levinson, was crisp, interesting and accessible and I’ve already bought Book 2 to find out more. The only criticism is that for ‘books’ of 25 or so pages, they are expensive in comparison with a full novel. I’d have preferred to see a collection of stories like this marketed as a single book.

"In this American High School story our narrator, Miles Halter, is a shy young man with few friends. He becomes part of a small group including the bouncy Alaska. She has a boyfriend at another college and most of the group of friends fall under her spell. She's dynamic, enigmatic, occasionally moody but often fun. We are often allowed into their secret smoking and drinking as well as their classes. Miles, who loves reading of people's last words, is particularly entranced by the religion class run by The Old Man who wheezes his way through lectures.This is intended, I believe, as a book for young adults but it grabbed my attention and never let up. After a catastrophe for the group, Miles is forced, not only by his own obsessive need to know, but also by the final paper set for the religion class, to consider the meaning of life, the finality or otherwise of death and the whereabouts of Alaska.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R144WAO1SYHWQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142402516#wasThisHelpful","R144WAO1SYHWQZ","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed Slur, the first book in this series, not least because it is set in the part of Manchester where I was born. The action in A Gangster’s Grip takes place four years later and the girls have matured considerably. Rita and her husband Yansis return from his native Greece for a protracted stay in Manchester for a reason we discover later. She finds things at home are not as cosy as she’d come to believe from letters and phone calls. Her sister Jenny is visibly pregnant to a dodgy and bullying partner. When Rita and her friend Julie try to help Jenny to get her life back, they find she isn’t the only person under this man’s influence.The characters here are believable and I wanted things to work out well for Rita, Julie and their families. It’s easy for the reader to become involved in this story and there’s plenty of action and excitement.

"This is the fifth in the Pitkirtly Mysteries series and is a rather claustrophobic adventure in which Pitkirtly is cut off by snow for the Christmas and New Year period. There is a robbery at the jeweller's and the local police force is seriously hampered by the weather. All my favourite characters were there and the remarkable Amaryllis Peebles, donning her pink PI bulletproof vest, decides to take on the jewel robbery, when it's discovered that the most expensive item on the list turns out to be a fake.This is another great little story in which, although there are murders and bodies, the reader is never subjected to gratuitous violence. This series is full of quirky characters and is delightfully written. I’m pleased to see that I have several more to read. A bit of a mystery wrapped in a wonderful gentle wit is just what I enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35HUP02VCLOHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009L9F24U#wasThisHelpful","R35HUP02VCLOHJ","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the nail-biter ending of Book 1 we pick up exactly where we left off – which I won’t elaborate on for fear of spoiling Book 1 for anyone yet to read it. Barnes and Woods end up on two opposing sides but still working together. They have a method of leaving coded messages – which Woods needs help to decode. My opinion of various of the characters shifted as I read and because Angie Smith can juggle so many threads and can breathe life into such a lot of characters, I was sucked into it as into quicksand. I couldn’t have got out until the end!As the title implies, we discover secrets about some of our characters, including Maria Barnes. She must be one of my favourite characters in modern literature. She and Woods go deeper into the secrets of the Intelligence Service and turn up some nasty things crawling under there.

"I bought this ages ago and have no idea why I left it so long to read it. Something else must have cropped up to distract me. I found myself really pulled into the story of Hannah, her dreary husband Cliff and her loose-moralled sister Jill. They holiday together with their children (one per sister) and Jill’s gay friend, the chef Tristan. One day when Hannah’s out, there’s a phone-call from Cliff’s brother which throws Hannah’s composure out of the window. Her son Luke has an accident and this, too, makes her re-evaluate her life and its direction.This is one of those books where you don’t instantly fall in love with the characters. There are, as in life, those you warm to and those who make you squirm. I liked Hannah, though I sometimes wanted to shake her, found Jill annoying and Cliff cold. The children and Tristan were people I liked. I couldn’t guess the ending (I think there’s more to come in another book) and I thoroughly enjoyed the read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16PFV8P8RQ2NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090L9FEW#wasThisHelpful","R16PFV8P8RQ2NC","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have a young person with a sense of humour and a thirst for knowledge in your life, you really need this book. I ordered two copies. My nearly -11 year-old grand-daughter will really appreciate it, but I wanted one for myself. Why should the youngsters get all the fun? Each full page illustrations (for example, Felix Mendelsswan – the cover character) faces a page with a little information about the animal and a brief biography of the person. It’s beautifully done, with delightful pictures and is both fun and factual. If you buy one to give away you’ll want another to keep! For the number and quality of the illustrations it’s an absolute bargain.The author writes for young people and doesn’t talk down to them. It’s all done with wit and imagination.

She faces the deterioration of her five year-old daughter’s health with a condition which is terminal. Another crisis occurs in her life to make this even more poignant – if you can imagine anything worse than losing your only child. Clinical trials on the use of a hormone have been halted and Victoria, a vet, together with her father-in-law Frank, is determined to try this to give her baby the only chance of life. Would you commit a crime to give your child life?The story is well told and I enjoyed it, but I didn’t find it at all credible. However, as someone who likes sci-fi and fantasy, I can suspend my disbelief to an extent. I didn’t find it likely that Vic and Frank would switch character so suddenly.

"Edward Stanton is 39 years old and lives with Asperger’s Syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder. His life is only bearable because he has established a routine of collecting data about the weather and his waking times and the familiarity of it allows him to cope. Any deviation from this sets him worrying and makes him frantic. He sees a therapist once a week and likes her because she is logical. He loves logic and facts. The darker part of his life is his relationship with his father, a character I couldn’t warm to either. A new neighbour with a nine year-old son changes his life and he has to make some decisions.I really enjoyed this book. I see others have labelled it repetitive which it is but this highlights Edward’s condition and the fact that the slightest variation from the routine he has established for himself renders him unable to cope. He manages his condition but knows it isolates him. This is a very difficult concept to explain but here the author has shown us the mind of Edward. He is frighteningly literal and a character I could feel very fond of.

"Newly born Rebecca is the product of a short-lived relationship between Sarah and Cal, both due to go to college. Sarah has qualified for Yale but with the birth of her baby, won't be able to go. At the start of the book, Sarah hasn't bonded with Rebecca and refers to her baby as 'it'. The author brilliantly captures the tedium and despair of days and nights spent with a restless, crying newborn. The problem for me was that the book became a bit tedious at that point too. I think that early part would have been better edited down.It’s spot-on with post-partum depression and it also covers homosexual feelings and the way people can make a young person feel ‘evil’. We learn about Sarah's sexuality, her mother's deep and fundamentalist religious faith and Sarah's own attempts, through her relationship with Cal, to try to be 'normal’. Her friend Tiff is her saviour and we see relationships coming to fruition in spite of a couple of blazing rows and some violence. I thought, at about 30%, that the story was too slow with insufficient action but I have to say, the author pulled it all out of the hat and by the second half I was totally hooked.

"Ted, retired from the police force, works as a private detective. He has some regrets. If he had killed a child-molester who got off through the incompetence of one of his colleagues, he knows he could have saved further harm to children but his conscience wouldn't let him kill. He's called in to look into a murder in a remote hotel. Heavy snow traps him there and we find out more about him - and the occasion on which he actually did take a life.David Haynes has created a claustrophobic story which works very well as a horror novel at surface level. It's as creepy and spooky as you could want. It works as a metaphor too, of the cages in our minds where we hide our secrets or our fears. The literal and metaphorical cages in this novel make you shudder. There are hauntings of different types here and the slow crumbling of a mind.

"Dexter and Emma meet at their graduation and the story follows them on that day each year (St Swithin’s). It’s so compelling because it takes the hopes and enthusiasms of the young people and we watch the dreams unfold. As with all of us, life never really turns out as we expected, whether for good or ill. Emma is rather earnest but I liked her. She’s true to herself. Dexter seems fairly shallow and sybaritic and, to me, much harder to like. I loved the story throughout, with its up and its, sometimes very low, downs. Each takes a partner but there’s always that pull between them. I was on edge wondering how it would end and I was nowhere near in my guesses.I loved this story and although my university experience was long before theirs, I recognised the idealism, the aspirations, and enjoyed following their careers. I also felt the class and north/south divisions hadn’t changed. I was the prickly, working-class northern girl! This is a memorable story and feels real.

"This story of the man who leads a paedophile ring is both bleak and gripping. Dr David Galbraith is that suave, educated and plausible man who, in the guise of a saviour to children in crisis, causes them further, unimaginable pain. There is little graphic child abuse described so don't be afraid to read it. It's the story of a troubled family; a weak father who leaves home to move in with a younger woman, a dominant mother who is a rather unpleasant and manipulative person, much though she loves her children, and those children themselves, the younger of whom suffers badly at the family breakdown. The referral to the doctor is meant to help.It's a grim and exciting story as we follow the family's troubles and the police and child protection workers trying to help them. The author has considerable professional expertise in this field and the authenticity shines through. I have issues with the dialogue however. People don't use one another's name all the time in conversations. They really don't. It's a tactic to avoid using 'said so-and-so' but once the characters in the conversation are established (and this happened even in phone calls where there were only two) then they speak alternately. No need to keep adding Trevor. It was infuriatingly distracting.This niggle aside, it's a powerful story and I hope people read it and take care who they trust with their children.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B2G8W95KT95B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VR8X45W#wasThisHelpful","R1B2G8W95KT95B","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Almost the entirety of this novel takes place around a dining table where a number of disparate characters discuss, argue and flirt over a long meal. Naturally, much is said and even more is intimated by allowing us to be privy to the thoughts of those whose point of view we are currently reading. It makes for a most unusual book. Initially I admit I found some of the conversation stilted. Later I tried reading it to myself in my version of a South African accent (that’s where it’s set) and it began to feel more alive. I felt that the author got into his stride in the second half of the book which flowed much better for me.The author admits to a quirky sense of humour. Much is based on puns which are not my thing at all so it wasn’t a rib-tickler for me but its strength lies in its illumination of the workings of the South African political scene and the lawlessness and police corruption which accompany it. That’s not to say it was a heavy-handed political diatribe – not a bit of it. Wry observation was interspersed with details of the personal lives of the diners. The denoument was a bold exploration of the following eighteen months. I don’t want to spoil it by saying how but I’ve not seen a story wrapped up in this way before. A good sneaky peek through a window on South Africa.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RN1SZKM9NKA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJMW5WA#wasThisHelpful","R1RN1SZKM9NKA1","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this a really good read. I enjoy a complex thriller with good characters and I found that here. The police are investigating a series of murders in which roman numerals are left at the scene. There’s a connection; they just have to find it. Investigation throws up earlier deaths which also had the roman numeral connection. Investigating officers are sent an extra man to help on the team but he causes more problems than he solves. Woods and Barnes are a fantastic duo and worked well together in this story. Barnes has hidden depths and we’ve obviously not totally plumbed them yet.I loved the involvement of the establishment figures who were just as shady as I’d expect them to be. It’s a conspiracy-theorist’s delight, this story! It was an exciting ride all the way through. Just be aware that it stops rather than ends as it’s the first of a series.

"The story is told by a man remembering his childhood and events which happened when he was seven years old. The memories are triggered by revisiting the place where they happened. I started it with an open mind, aware that it was being referred to as a modern fantasy and a fable. Its strength for me was that it was told simply and I genuinely felt the effect of seeing through a child’s eyes. By a third of the way through, I was completely hooked. It takes a lot to keep me up beyond my bedtime but this book did.I could feel the helplessness of a child at the hands of adults. Children have no power of their own and here, the boy has put himself in danger and his friendship with the three women who live near the pond, the ocean of the title, come to his help. One blames herself for putting him in that danger initially. They reminded me of The Muses – the maiden, the mother, the crone – with their wisdom and antiquity.

Shard is a man pursuing revenge for the killing of his brothers and comrades-in-arms in the Kosovo liberation army. Alice kills in a vigilante style, executing those who have escaped or evaded justice. He follows her and exacts punishment on her few friends and family. It’s a real cat-and-mouse game with two people who are not afraid to go to extremes.There are some great characters in this book, although most of them are of dubious morality. The men running a club with eastern European girls held as prisoners to be used as prostitutes, with no rights and no defence, are utterly despicable. The girls, one in particular whom we get to know, are sad and without hope. Both Alice and Shard take her plight to heart and it adds a richness to the book. The story is very fast-paced and the ending is harsh but satisfying. I’ll be very happy to read more by this writing duo.Thanks to Marble City, the publisher, for a review copy of this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FW26VMQ7K8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LOTHXQ#wasThisHelpful","R3FW26VMQ7K8N","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title is the name of a 1970s rock band and after a come-back they die one by one under inexplicable circumstances. You can only believe in so much coincidence. Danny Lancaster Investigates! Danny seems superficially to be a bit of a Jack-the-lad but his charisma and character are such that his friends willingly put themselves in danger to help him. In this case, he finds he’s been invited to investigate a case which then sets him up as the major suspect in a multiple murder. How is he going to get out of this one?Bill Todd’s stories are always complex and, if you pay attention, they are a gripping read. They move fast, there are many characters and nasty things happen to people. If you’re a devotee of the murder, mystery, detective and/or thriller categories, these books will really hook you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14X6T7WSYV7KL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085V9HL4#wasThisHelpful","R14X6T7WSYV7KL","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrew meets Charlotte and his life changes in an instant. When we fall in love we almost want to consume and be consumed by the beloved. Andrew realises that he's seeing Charlie to the exclusion of all others - his best friend, his sister. Is this more than a natural desire to be always together? Then Charlie shows him her jealous side and bad things, even death, happen to his previous girlfriends.This is a tense story where we begin to feel almost as involved with Andrew and Charlie as they are with each other. The clues we are given throughout the book don't lead in a single direction. This is a clever and tangled web and I enjoyed its unravelling a great deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLDRUHLG7QCX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IX0U7NE#wasThisHelpful","RLDRUHLG7QCX8","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a lovely book this is. It's coincidentally the second book set in Crete that I've read in the last month though their themes are substantially different. The half Greek girl Ariadne (Ria), after suffering a tragic loss, finds herself relegated to writing obituaries on the paper she works for. She throws it all up to go to Crete, finds a job and realised she's been wasting her life. She hears the story of a local family tragedy and the rebuilding of a ruined vineyard. She's drawn to Tom who's starting over.This story has several deep themes. There's tragedy and hope reborn. There's family honour and friendships. There's a love of place - the place your family is tied to for generations. There's also the light touch of humour here. Ria's a caring person, a natural journalist (nosy person!) and a good friend. Lily Rose Graham has written a lovely, contemporary romance and I very much enjoyed it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IT70ZT85GL3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YKQ8AMK#wasThisHelpful","R3IT70ZT85GL3W","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cathy is one of four sisters whose parents died in a car accident when she was eight years old. She developed the habit of writing to her dead mother and continued right until she left home, in desperate circumstances. She eventually set up a business in New Zealand – about as far away from her Irish home as she could. She has deliberately concealed her whereabouts for fifteen years but her son is encouraging her to resume contact and invite his aunts to her forthcoming wedding. None of the sisters has had an easy ride through life and I enjoyed this story. It’s a light read but you really want to keep reading!The sisters each had a very different attitude to life and, due to their marriage choices – though one felt she really hadn’t had a choice – they appear to be very different people. We see two personal viewpoints in this story, through Cathy’s letters to her mother and through her oldest sister Rebecca’s journal. There didn’t seem to be a huge amount of sisterly love between them but then, with the death of their parents and one of the sisters always blaming herself, they didn’t have a ‘normal’ childhood. It’s quite gripping in places and I enjoyed reading it a lot, much as I wanted to shake some of them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R361IF0VJ1XSAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1847561691#wasThisHelpful","R361IF0VJ1XSAO","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Benor is a cartographer and he's come to Port Naain to produce a handbook. He makes a home with Tallis, a professional poet and his wife Shena. She's a mud-jobber or as we might say, a beachcomber. Some of her combings include bodies. Everything has a price and families will pay for the privilege of burying their dead and, if possible, finding who caused it. Benor is a natural. He's a nosy person and, with the aid of the wonderful Mutt, a ten year-old wise beyond his years, he sorts out the villains from the corpses. This first short story from The Port Naain Intelligencer bodes well for the rest of the series.

"Louisa is currently standing in for her boss at a conference on Fiji. She arrives just as a political coup has taken place and can’t get to her hotel. She and a fellow passenger are picked up by two men and offered rooms for the night. One of the two kind souls is found murdered the next day and the other, after being seen speaking to one of the shoeshine boys in the town, is also later found to have been murdered. Louise and a local policewoman become drawn in to trying to solve the case, which puts Louise herself in great danger. All isn’t entirely happy on the love-life front, either. Things get complicated.This is a story in which the threads of the murder mystery become entangled with Louisa’s personal life. Her OCD makes life very hard for her when she has to share a hotel room. This story is set on a different island from the first book, Food of Ghosts and I somehow felt a greater sense of place in the first. There was much dashing about here, to different hotels, and even for a day, back to Kiribati where she was living. I like the character of Louisa. She’s earnest and hard-working and, situated where she is, she doesn’t have the might of modern forensics at her command. It’s almost as if Marianne Wheelehan has taken a modern girl and given her an Agatha Christie set-up to work with. The relationships she creates are always multi-dimensional too. A great series and very different.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RVGEDRLUDVTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012TN8PM0#wasThisHelpful","R1RVGEDRLUDVTG","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Danny Lancaster, newly fledged Private Investigator, takes on a number of cases, augmenting his meagre income with a job driving a minicab for a friend. The book introduces us early on to a strong cast of characters and only as the story progresses do we find the connection. He and a couple of mates take advantage of a wreck along the coast, ‘liberating’ a few things which turn out to be hot potatoes. Things soon get deep, dangerous and complex. Danny Lancaster is an engaging character; attractive and enigmatic he is popular with the ladies. We learn about his military service in this first book of the series, and though he's not had an easy life to date, he is determined and has a strong sense of justice.I was introduced to the character in the recently published collection Gargoyle Pixie Dog and this first Danny Lancaster volume has given me a taste for the complicated, interweaving sub plots employed by the author. I really enjoyed this story, seeing it from different characters' viewpoints. The end of the story brought all the threads together in a very satisfying manner. A really good read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCT4CENKVYTVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OVUG6Q#wasThisHelpful","RCT4CENKVYTVK","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that all lovers of the first book in this fantasy series, Alloria, will leap on this with delight. It’s been a while coming. However, all the great characters are there. David Staniforth can create the most evil baddies, the most delightful children – while not making them emetic – and the most trustworthy friends and colleagues. Once again we meet Alloria and her brother, who is under the influence of the most repulsive villain of all time, Glebester. I felt sorry for her brother, Yrion, who was tempted by power before he realised the price he would pay. Alloria and Nat become a little closer as they grow up together. And Bane is just big, irrepressible Bane. Got to love him! They travel the Labyrinth and are instrumental in bringing justice where Yrion and Gleberster have wrought evil. Ymarid, her father, at times seems like a feeble old man but we witness his power and above all, his love.The author is particularly skilled at drawing a fantasy world the reader can almost see, smell and touch. He’s a gifted descriptive writer but doesn’t use it to pad out a floppy plot. The writing lifts and carries a complex stories with all the traditional themes you’d expect in a book of fantasy. A new world, new creatures but above all, compassion and friendship. I love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT8WDI2OXN8YW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0138FIKQO#wasThisHelpful","RT8WDI2OXN8YW","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second DI Kim Stone book. I enjoyed the first very much though I found the character hard to believe in. This time she’s more real, more believable and though she’s apparently a cold, unapproachable person totally lacking in people skills, she’s got loyalty – and even a little affection – from her team. There’s more than one evil game going on in this story and the repercussions echo Kim’s own, very nasty, childhood experiences. It could give her strength or it could overwhelm her.In between a father who’s been abusing two very young daughters and a young, successful and intelligent psychiatrist, Kim confronts fears of her own as well as fears for the people for whom she, as a police officer, swore to find justice. This book is the sort you read to the exclusion of other things (except eating in my case!) and it takes you over. It had moments of great, heart-pumping excitement. I really loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VDSVV69OQFYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7K5F4O#wasThisHelpful","R1VDSVV69OQFYG","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a collection of stories written for Valentine's Day over a number of years. They are all, naturally, concerned with the beginnings of relationships. David Levithan writes for teens and I really loved Two Boys Kissing. This didn’t hit the spot for me quite so much. After two stories I moved on to another book; they felt too similar. I went back and very much enjoyed some of those in the middle of the book. Then I lost the fire again. I felt that some of them were added to make weight.One thing these stories have in common is that they deal with those things young people – and older, for that matter – struggle with – early relationships. It matters not if they are gay or straight, old or young but naturally, most of these are young. We all love in the same, deep and insecure way and his writing captures this so well. I want to give this three and a half stars. It was definitely better than okay.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GX0YZD5MI8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEFQ49K#wasThisHelpful","R2GX0YZD5MI8F","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This excellent story takes place on the island of Crete. Kirsty is a Scottish woman who left home to run a kafenion on the island following a divorce. A beautiful girl, Eleni, and her new husband, Patrick, come for their honeymoon and old memories are stirred up. Memories and enmities. Treachery and betrayal during WWII echo down the years and Eleni, with a half-Greek mother, is drawn in. Kirsty is determined to find the couple when they disappear in strange circumstances.This is a tightly-written and exciting thriller which saw me carrying my kindle around for two days unable to let go. There is some breathtaking writing and some thoughtful comment on the concept of vendetta and how family honour can seem to overtake and overwhelm a whole life. It's not something we and Kirsty understand but by seeing it through Cretan eyes we find an inevitable struggle and a final acceptance. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10FJMX7MCOAGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PM995RI#wasThisHelpful","R10FJMX7MCOAGA","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short book really amused me. If you’re familiar with the stories of Benor the Cartographer from the author’s Land of the Three Seas then you will have some idea of what to expect. Tallis Steelyard is a poet. He makes his living that way. Lambent Dreams is a collection of some of his works and his friend Benor comments on them to give some historical or geographical insight. Then there is the commentary from fellow poet and critic Lancet Foredeck. These remind me of the notes you get on wines from some of the ‘experts’ and I chuckled along with them. Perhaps funniest of all was the fact that, somehow, the footnotes inserted by one of the typesetters were left in by accident; a much more refreshing view is revealed!This won’t take you long to read but I guarantee you’ll smile a lot while you do.

"Sometimes you find a series which you think you will enjoy but you missed out on the start. Do you go to the beginning and hope you’ll get chance to read them all or do you dive in and feel lost? This book, which is full novel length, is a really good way to get a taster of the author’s Danny Lancaster stories. Danny is a private investigator, an ex-soldier who lost a leg in Afghanistan, and, if these stories are typical, he’s never going to get rich. He makes enough to get by but he’s got a soft heart, in spite of some of the things he becomes involved with.I admit to being seduced by the title, though the reason for it becomes obvious when Danny is trying to trace a missing street girl. This is the main story, although there are shorter stories in the collection. I didn’t find a dud in there and I like the author’s style of writing. He comes up with some excellent phrases and isn’t a slave to cliché. I really hope I’ll find the time to read more Danny Lancaster before too long. A great collection and a lesson to series authors in how to give potential new readers a way in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13RTOWU21WI1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010T2CHK4#wasThisHelpful","R13RTOWU21WI1F","A7EFKYVKZ2XYD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7EFKYVKZ2XYD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you enjoy fast-paced action adventures, this is the book for you. It hits the ground running and barely lets up. Holly phones her ex-husband Gabriel for help when she finds her life is in danger. She has in her possession a mysterious vessel which two factions want and will kill to get. She herself was working for one of them as part of a team analysing it. Her boss tells an incredible tale, naming the vessel the Holy Grail though it bears no resemblance to the Last Supper cup of legend. It’s very old but appears super-modern and seems to employ nanotechnology.The story takes place both in the present day and in historic times and is well written. The ex-husband and wife are nicely drawn characters and I felt they still held considerable attraction for one another. The finale is fast and exciting and, having made my mind up right at the end what the denouement should be, I really enjoyed the ending.

"I am such a fan of Sloane Crosley's nonfiction and looked forward to the release of her first novel all year. I was sorely disappointed by it as it was such an unpleasant read. While Crosley's dry sense of humor and quick wit are evident throughout, it doesn't even begin to make up for the actual story, which falls flat right from the beginning. The plot is uneven, the characters are vapid and boring, and the entire book drags and drags. Nothing compelled me to keep going and it took me forever to finish because it was so uninteresting. I am so bummed!

"I have naturally curly hair, and back in the 1980's I used to use hot oil treatments on my hair because there weren't many products on the market at that time for my hair type. I thought I would use this macadamia oil as a hot oil treatment, and I am glad I did. I warmed the oil and then distributed it through my hair and allowed it to penetrate for 15 minutes. I then washed my hair with the Luseta Argan oil shampoo, and lightly conditioned. I noticed my hair was shinier and had less frizz. It also works well on my hair as a leave in serum, but I only use a small amount because it can weigh the hair down and give it a greasy appearance.

"Raw shea butter is an all natural product that really helps improve my skin.  This shea butter from  Beauty By Shea  is 100% organic and unrefined. I've stopped using commercial moisturizers because of all the chemicals they contain. This raw shea butter is great for making homemade moisturizers, whipped butters and soaps. There are many recipes that can be found online. I like to add some my favorite essential oils to the butter, since I'm not real fond of the scent alone. It is nicely packaged in a sealed bag to keep it fresh. This is a high quality, all natural product that I am very pleased with.Sample received at no cost.

"I am pleased with the cleaning power of this all natural laundry detergent by Natural HomeLogic. I usually use one of the brand name laundry detergents on the market that are full of chemicals, and would say that this natural detergent cleaned just as well. I've been using it for just over a week now, and noticed my skin doesn't feel itchy like it does with other detergents, so I am very pleased with that. The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because the fragrance is very faint. I am a fragrance addict, and prefer a stronger scented detergent.Overall, I am pleased with the way this detergent performed, and would purchase it again.I purchased this product at a discounted price.

"Ocean Spray is my favorite brand when it comes to cranberry juice. Most other brands only product cranberry juice cocktail, and it's loaded with sugar. I am very happy that Ocean Spray has the 100% juice as an option. The juice is not too sweet, or too tart.  This was a definite bargain at less that $2 per bottle.

"This wine chiller stick by Unique Effects has made drinking wine more enjoyable. The product is very easy to use, by just placing the stainless steel stick in the freezer for 2 hours. Once the stick is chilled, the foil cutter that is included can be used to prepare the bottle of wine for opening. After opening the bottle, I poured a small amount of wine out to allow room for the stick. Insert the stick into the bottle with the pouring spout attached. It pours nice with no dripping. This wine chiller stick is well made and very easy to use. It keeps the bottle of wine cold for about an hour, doesn't dilute the wine like ice cubes do. There are very clear instruction listed on the bottom of the box. It comes in a lovely gift box, so it would make the perfect gift for that wine lover in your life.I received this item at no cost from Unique Effects.

"I am very pleased with this high quality aromatherapy essential oil set by Calily. My three favorite things about this set are the classy packaging, the variety of oils included, and the potency and consistency of each scent.The oils come packaged in a very nice box, and is sealed with a band with the Calily logo. This is great because it allows me to keep all the oils organized and neatly stored...all in one box. The packaging also makes this perfect for gift giving.There are 14 scents included in this scent, which makes it great for anyone who is new to oils, or if just want replenish your supply. My favorite scents are the orange and lavender. The scent of the oils are potent, but not overbearing. The consistency indicates a good quality oil, but it's not so thick that it clogs my diffuser.

"The NEW Charge HR is working great and working as it should. I am upping my review to 5 stars again due to FitBit's awesome customer service and their lack of argument with my troubleshooting after talking for 5 minutes with them they agreed to send a new one right away. I did not have to discuss its issues with their Tech Support. I AM a E-tech and they knew it! So, 5 days after contacting them, on Aug 18th, I got the new one in the mail via USPS Priority Mail. I AM HAPPY!UPDATE 8/14/15: It died, so I hated it. I hate things that don't work. Especially techy things that I can't take apart and fix for myself as this is microscopic work that uses Ultrasonic wire bonding methods, something I don't have available to use for micro repairs. This Charge HR stopped connecting via its internal BlueTooth, from inside the thing itself to either the phone app or the PC site via the BT dongle. I had to jump through only a FEW hoops to do the processes to attempt to re-pair the Bluetooth of the Charge HR to the PC and Smartphone app. Last thing to do to prove the device itself was defective in pairing was to disconnect the Charge HR from my account entirely, and reconnect it as if it was new. THAT was the final test to determine IF it was, in fact, the device itself, or the phone app, or the PC website or BT dongle. WHEN I tried to set it up as a NEW Charge HR device, it would not connect. Problem solved, device broken. I called FitBit, told them all that, and Customer Service, I gotta give them credit, they are immediately sending me out a new Charge HR as I did what they would have told me to do before they told me to do it (I dislike working on tech things and troubleshooting via phone with any tech support and there is a reason for that). It's elementary troubleshooting for anything electrical or electronic, to me.AFTER, I receive the new device, I will again update my review. Until then. I hate the freaking thing that IS broken!ORIGINAL REVIEW 5/18/15: I have used the FitBit One model for about 3 years and it was functional and reliable, never had a problem at all. It's motivating to get my 15,000 steps, or more, in daily.I upgraded to this Charge HR for advanced features. I have had no issues with the strap coming off, the strap is just like a watch strap with a buckle style closure.It is reliable, and using FitBit Premium service is cool and also motivating. I like having the multiple alarms for reminders.The Tap feature is good. Tap twice and see what you programmed it to show. I have mine set to heart rate, tap twice during exercise and see heart rate immediately. GOOD feature.Easy to set up for a newb, esp easy if you have used any other models of FitBit.Premium is good, at ~50 annually, and has many features.

"Please don't diss my review because music taste is subjective. THIS IS Baroque music from the 15 to 16th Century from Latin America, and played on Lute and other instruments. There are 22 songs on this CD.I enjoy instrumental music, especially Latin Baroque. It's lovely, relaxing, and a style of music which you would have listened to IF you had lived in those centuries in Latin America. It does have some Early Latin Rhythms.I love it, enjoy listening to this while I do my work esp while traveling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LKU41ZKQHFQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000IX9W#wasThisHelpful","R1LKU41ZKQHFQ5","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although I did purchase this BWV 180p bodycam from an outside vendor a few months ago, it does work very well and I have used it during my frequent travels out of town. My only issue with this BWV bodycam is that it did not do real time uploading as the video/audio is being recorded, which I have since resolved by purchasing the Wolfcom brand of bodycam widely used by police throughout the USA, because it is a Police Body Cam, which does have real time uploading of video to an undisclosed server at any time video is being recorded which is unalterable and can be used in any court of law anywhere in the USA. My DH uses it, is a police officer, and because of that, I was able to get the actual Wolfcom brand of bodycam which does do this uploading of all video recorded during real time. That is powerful.I really like the BWV, and it's 1080p recording in HD is tremendously powerful for voice and clarity of HD video and for the average person, I would recommend it. However, I did want real time uploading of video, just as all Police have and it is fully admissible in any court of law for a civilian as well as any Police Personnel. The court cannot say that MY bodycam cannot be used and is inadmissible in court as they are now doing when civilians use cell recorded audio and video.That said, for most people, this BWV bodycam is powerful and will do the job you need it do do, and the quality of recording is that of HD quality, and also does record very clear audio, with date and time stamp which in unalterable and WILL hold up for you in any court of law. I did deduct one star, since it does not have the capability of real time uploading into a server for storage long term.I also have 4 vehicle cams, 2 in each vehicle for 340 degree recordings, which I did write a review on a while back, and they are also powerful with both audio and HD video with unalterable date and time stamp. If you are interested in vehicle cams, I suggest looking up those brands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6ESSDW2XA6Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BL7JWT6#wasThisHelpful","R6ESSDW2XA6Z2","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the wall mount I used for the 70"" Sony TV, although I purchased the mount from the seller where I purchased the TV. My DH installed it, and due to the 100 lb weight of the TV he did find and use the wall studs to anchor the mount as the sales Tech advised him to do. He did. The good thing about this mount, is the way the holes allow you to put the lag bolts into any hole to allow you to match up the holed to the stud distance of your walls. Ours is the typical 16"".  It took DH about an hour to get it mounted properly and safely to support the weight of the TV.I like that I can tilt the TV screen downwards fairly well for the smaller kids to see better while they play video games.A year later, there have been no issues with the TV mount. I did put a bit of machine oil a few months ago onto the swiveling area of the mount as it was getting harder to move it's position. Not a deal breaker, just maintenance.As with all things I review, if the product stops working or malfunctions in any way, I will always update my reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJ0SFDQB7AZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A7WDYYU#wasThisHelpful","R3PJ0SFDQB7AZY","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this 70"" Sony 3D HDTV last mid-year. It is amazing and I've only purchased a few 3D movies for the kids. The color is adjustable using the preselected programs preset for choosing Movies, TV, and other types of watching and the choice automatically sets the proper screen settings for that type of watching. It does have Netflix, HuluPlus, and music such as Pandora and iHeart Radio and YouTube built in into it's remote and on-screen programming which allows you to search for particular YT videos, since I follow a lot of musicians there such as Camille & Kennerly harpists and Paul O'Dette harpist, and others. I had a good sized Sony products coupon so my buying was spontaneous.It has probably the best quality picture of any TV I have ever owned, and now, a year later it continues to work as it did when newly purchased. The color is vibrant and lifelike and having the ability to quickly set the TV for whatever you are watching. I like that it has the USB slot Flash Drives for watching family photographs or home made traveling movies over the big screen (I use Sony Movie Studio programming to make nicely done and edited movies with titles and credits). Overall, the TV is simply Plug n Play. I have Xbox 360 and PS 4 and also a Wii hooked up for fun and games for the kids who spend time with me often when I am home. The  kids love playing the games with this huge screen with the Sound System. Several of the games they play is 3D. My Surround Sound System, which I also reviewed, quickly hooked up and works flawlessly with this set.CONS: None, other than it's so heavy you need help to set it up and mount it on the wall.I replaced my LG 65"" with this, and gave the old set to friends. The Sony has a remarkable LED screen. It's design and sturdy build quality is not flimsy built either. In fact, it weighs about 125 lbs packaged. The TV itself weighs 100 lbs. I did purchase a huge wall mount with swivel. It was a lot of work but worthwhile to do so. Tilting the TV downward for the kids while playing games was key, since they are smaller kids.As with all things electronic or otherwise, if the product stops working correctly or malfunctions in any way, I will always update my reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZNMCDA0ZPYHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPMCN7E#wasThisHelpful","RZNMCDA0ZPYHL","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this axe in early 2013. Since then, I have purchased 9 more, a couple here and there since buying the first one because they are that good. I have 10 now, and I keep them in strategic places to use for whatever I need to chop up or down. They are amazing axes, very razor sharp, all one piece strong metal which extends all the way to the end of the handle, which means the handle won't break off during use. They are the sharpest little axe/hatchet blade I have ever used. I cut paper with it as you would using a razor blade. NICE!It chops wood very well. Of course this is a hand axe to be used for certain tasks when a large axe is not needed. I have several large axes as well, but this is my go to for smaller axing chores. I keep a couple in my miniMH for traveling. You never know when you will need one.I have many Gerber knives and sharp tools for various uses, and I've never been dissatisfied with anything Gerber.I do recommend this Gerber axe/hatchet and I have one wherever I go, many places.

"I've read all of Virginia Woolf novels over the years and enjoyed reading the Orlando tale. In finding that Tilda Swinton was main character in Orlando I had to rent it last month via Amazon via phone hooked up to TV in a hotel, and watched the movie there. I do this all the time. The movie follows the book quite well. I will always say that the reading of a book is always going to be better than passively watching a movie, this is true with the book versus the movie with Tilda. Reading is a requirement to think and comprehend. Watching a movie which is designed to do the thinking for you is passive and the mind has most of the thinking done for the watcher. That said, I still enjoyed watching the movie Orlando. It was well done, the costumes were correct and relevant for the different eras as was the locations chosen for the movie, such as Russian outskirts and England.I am partial to reading versus TV, music versus passively watching TV. IF you liked the book, the movie Orlando was well enough produced and character developed well to make the movie watchable and entertaining. I didn't even consider having DH watch this movie with me, since it will not be too many men's style of movie preferred. Most men wouldn't consider reading Woolf's novels either.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?  Remember what is behind that question? I do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZAE6ZX6IBVFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005599SG8#wasThisHelpful","R2ZAE6ZX6IBVFK","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this transceiver early last year for my miniMH. Love it, love it, love it for traveling and rags. It DXs beautifully. I did purchase the ADMS-4BU programming software for this Transceiver. It is easy to program channels and repeaters. I've programmed mine for 4 Western states and printed out a channel guide so I know which channel is which. I have not ""named"" each channel YET, that is for another day, but I will get there soon. I tried using CHIRP, but the cable with the software is different than that that comes in the software ADMS program. To use CHIRP, you have to purchase a different cable for programming. I use this transceiver with a Lil Tarheel 2 computer controlled and channel programmed antenna and I am having good results from 10 to 80 m. It can be spotty or 3/2 in you are out in the boonies. Repeater line of sight and it is a good experience. Get the fold flat Repeater book from ARRL, especially if you travel a lot like I do.It was time consuming in the beginning to learn all the many bells and whistles, lots of multi functional buttons as well, but over time I learned. This was one of the reasons I did not review the 857 sooner.I also have the VX8DR HT, and I have not reviewed it yet for the same reasons.The 2 Yaesus are better than my Alinco base stn which is older, but functions well for 2 & 10 m.Fun transceiver, reliable, good mic, could be used as a base with a good PS. I do use the QJE PS if I choose to play with the 857 indoors. I need more antennas, and I am building a yagi with stanley measuring tape now, and cannot wait to play with that while on the road at the beach in Los Angeles!

"I love to workout at home or out and about when I travel. The 30 day shred is challenging in the beginning, but is doable. I like the results for my body, after several months of doing the workout regularly and now able to really push myself by getting ""into"" that groove of great movement and lots of sweat! Precise exercise for precise body areas. Jillian could be, and probably has, the reputation to being the hardest workout Queen ever. I believe she is a tough act to follow in the exercise world.

"Very good.Compact, holds my 9 cards. Nice design and I like the slots that hold the credit or other ID cards in the order you want so you know which is where, and makes it easier to find.I have no real way to test this for the RFID blocking, without the use of advanced equipment.I do know that the SS will prevent the passing of the RFID CC information by any reader, according to the research I've done on RFID blocking CC holders. SEE UPDATE BELOW.I also like the fact that my CC RFID cannot be tracked by any agency who has a desire to do so. Conspiracy theories abound these days, and many are plausible too. I'm not paranoid, but I find it disheartening that regular people are being tracked by these silly little RFID chips. There are videos which show how to determine if your CC has the RFID chip, and also how to remove it without damaging the CC. I have done this to 3 cards and it works. No one is the wiser either.If they, whoever they is, want to track my purchase, then that is fine. To track my whereabouts, that's just wrong. Hopefully, this will prevent that tracking from occurring to begin with as people begin to refuse to be tracked. Nothing like a Police State. My DH is a Police Officer, so even he is having a difficult time with the tracking card issues.UPDATE 3/19/15: After going through the metal detector line at the International Airport in Los Angeles in early May, as I put my bag onto the X-Ray conveyor belt, the attendant could not see through the SS card case. I was asked to show them the case and then open the case to show them what was in it. No problem, and then the same thing happened at the Phoenix Int'l Airport. My educated guess is that if the X-Ray cannot see through the case, then it's obvious that any card readers or RFID chip trackers cannot read them either. SO, I feel that I can recommend this case for protecting your cards or IDs from theft or tracking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D2FPPVYPAOKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ8PEWE#wasThisHelpful","R2D2FPPVYPAOKL","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gorgeous lighting and no electricity needed! Very easy to work with and put where you want them for safety or pleasure lighting needs. These are LEDs which last for approx 10,000 hours before burning out.These twinkling multi-colored LED solar string lights are lovely! I have the cool white, and the warm white styles of these solar lights, and I love them all! The colors are bright and very visible and they are so easy to set up too! The wires are coated copper and are fine wires, enough to blend into the surroundings so only the lights are seen. I only wove the lights through my patio enclosures. Very simple to just place them and they stay put easily.The solar panels themselves come with a ground stake, and a metal mounting bracket. I only used the bracket for the skylight, and for mounting on corner of roof soffit edge. So I cannot speak for the ground stake. It does look to be of a good length and sturdy to stay put wherever placed if in an out of the way area.I live part time in dreadfully sunny Arizona, and I placed these colored lights on my patio, with the solar panel mounted onto the edge of patio where they do receive all day sun. They automatically come on at dark and provide pretty twinkling lighting and a pleasant ambience for outdoor patio entertainment. There is also a switch for turning off the lights on the solar panel but I leave mine on at all times. It's just one less thing to do, and the auto turn on at dark saves me money by not having to use my own electricity. I love all of the Brightech lighting products. I did receive samples to use and review.The cool white, I placed in my living room skylight. Mounting the solar panel up against the skylight and tacking the wiring in a circular fashion in and around the skylight shaft. I spend no dollars on night lighting within my house now and this set provides great safety lighting during the night time if anyone is up roaming.The warm white, I placed under the covered driveway park strip near the house's back door along the wall up high.  Husband leaves for work around 4am and the lights are still on and this is safe lighting and does light his path nicely as he loads his truck for work. He really likes them because he always forgot to turn off the porch light and with these solar lighting he has one less thing to do too. Then I don't have to say ""Dear, you forgot.....""I've had all 3 sets of the solar lights up for over 90 days now and they are reliable and useful to light the areas you need for safe foot traffic. I have stayed up until 1am and the lights remain on long past that time of night. I do not know how many hours they do stay on which also depends upon how much direct sun the solar panel receives during the day. As I said, the lights are on at 4am according to the husband.OTHER USES: Before I mounted the solar lights, I took 2 white light sets with us on 3 separate traveling trips. I am considering buying a couple sets to take on future trips as they do light up the area nicely for safety and are sedate enough to not disturb other people nearby by overly bright lights during the night. Our neighbors were interested in the lighting too and are considering purchasing a set for themselves. They are easier to use and cheaper than the typical battery operated camp lighting.As with all my reviews of all things, and especially electrical or electronic, if the product malfunctions at any time, I will always update my reviews to describe the problems found. IF you do not see an update, then the product is still working as it should. I've a 40 year history of electronics technician so I know how these things work and what is wrong when they don't work as they should.EDIT: The price has gone up considerably since I wrote my review.

"I DO NOT LIKE THIS NEW THING OF THE DROP DOWN BOXES FOR DESCRIPTIONS OF BOOKS. IT IS TERRIBLE. I had to pick the 4 categories and for a complex book, they are not correct. I plan on discussing this with Amazon because I feel it is a terrible disservice to both authors and readers and forces the reader to try to narrow down a book style/whatever using one word. That is distasteful of Amazon to do this. I hope others speak up and out and against this terrible issue so that Amazon stops doing this.Ada, or Ardor, is a wonderfully complex but readable story. This is not a book that does your thinking for you, instead, it causes you to think and awareness is heightened as you read but that is the glory of Nabokov, as reading his stories turns any story into a long mental movie because of the quality of his writings.  It is about family, people and their interconnectedness and disconnectedness and about every think known to man is within this book. Yes, every emotion is here. It has psychology of all people. The 4 category method does NOT do justice for this book. This story has everything within, each of the choices given are ALL within this book, and more, much more. The words, and skillful use of them, tickles all your senses and your brain too will be humming faster than your computer processor ever could. You'll be happily surprised and hopefully delighted with Nabokov's masterful style of writing.I enjoy anything Nabokov has written. The complexity of his novels is what draws me into his web of story, having all characters so well developed you feel you know them personally and you know what they even look like. Yet, as the book unfolds, the characters continue to develop which takes away the predictability and keeps me reading on into daybreak. I finally gave up reading at 8am today, slept til 2pm and now I am going back for more story and hours of enjoyment. Scenes described and shows the scene so well you can see it in your mind's eye. This keeps me entertained and engrossed for hours and I leisurely read every word, savoring their meanings when used together to paint a picture. It is not simple writing, it is masterful writing and a complement to the English language. Nabokov does with words what writers can only dream of doing. He was a talented writer, authored many books including that very well known classic and at the time highly controversial book ""Lolita"" which is better, hugely better than the movie could ever be.If you have only SEEN the movie Lolita, and are also a reader, I highly suggest you purchase a copy of Lolita and read it. You will be surprised.I have read many of Nabokov's books and I have not been disappointed even once. I know, that when I sit down with any of his books, I will be there for hours and days, and I will never be bored. Great writers can do that for you as compared to much of the drivel of today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15GG0ASQ5VRB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679725229#wasThisHelpful","R15GG0ASQ5VRB6","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I do like these fish oil caps just for the sake of no burps. I take 2 daily, one with each meal.Occasionally I do get maybe one small but very mild fish oil burp from these caps and so mild that it is not disagreeable at all. But they  are NOTHING like those numerous and horrible fishy burps and occasional indigestion that I get from the spring valley brand I normally buy even when I take them before or during a meal, I still got those nasty flavored burps and they are somewhat smelly burps. I dreaded taking those, and I often didn't take them because of the nasty burps and the unpleasantness of the smell my husband complains of when I burp.At least I am taking these.I have taken them on an empty stomach, and they passed the test.

I can't determine that with absolute certainty, but they do have the GMP seal so their facility has been inspected before product is sold. GMP is good manufacturing practice for quality and purity of products. I would never buy without GMP. (husband works in supplement factory, so GMP is important seal a company could pass)It is my thoughts that the brand name is selling you what they say they are, otherwise they wouldn't be in business long.These are made in the USA and has a 100% Quality seal.The label says Molecularly Distilled fish oil. You can read more about that here omegavia.com/molecularly-distilled-fish-oil/If you want to read about the rankings of fish oil brands, read here labdoor.com/rankings/fish-oilI never realized that fish oil had GUNK in it! My old brand does say 99.99% purified fish oil. That begs the question, which is better?I also read that the molecularly distilled fish oils are how it's now widely done.It comes down to purified versus molecularly distilled and your choice to buy whichever type you are comfortable with.The caps are made of gelatin, glycerin, and a soy based tocopherol (vitamin E from soybeans)1 1/16"" long gel caps as measured w a ruler. They are very large as far as pill size go, but only slightly larger than my old brand, but they are easy to swallow since the gelatin makes them very slippery when wet.I would probably buy these once my supply runs out,  just for the fact that they are burpless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WCNE7R8JWY7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOVLXYW#wasThisHelpful","R1WCNE7R8JWY7E","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazon lost my original post. The page deleted all I had written. I'll do my best though. Next review I will write using Word and then just copy paste onto the review block.My very long gray haired cat, has very very thick hair as well. Her nickname has been ""hairball maker"" and also called FurBall, for over a decade. Not anymore.The 3 brushes are well made and does the job and has a fair price and a few price cutting deals at times. Watch for thoe deals.She had a few mats when I began, and now has none.I've seen significantly less hairballs after 2 months of using the 3 piece set and her coat is soft smooth and shiny. Especially since that was the beginning of the seasonal warmup in sunny Los Angeles.Cat loves the daily brushing and groomingThe wide two rowed brush removes a lot of undercoat, as does the shedder tool. It also works well on any mats found and within a few days, She had no more mats.I have been unable to do regular grooming for her because she didn't like it. Now she does. She, the cat, decided, and keeps coming back demanding more. All I have to do is call her and rattle the brushes together. She hears that and comes running to get her grooming. A win win since I now get the self relaxation by grooming her. I had never felt that before with an animal/pet, and felt akin to a exercise endorphin high.This is one of the few truly great products I have been offered to try and then write my review.They are well made and should last many years. I really like the larger and ergonomically designed handles. I have wrist pain and finger pain so the larger grips can prevent aggravating that pain.Quality--I can't find a visible or unseen flaw in the brushes anywhere. They are strong and well built overall. They look nice, are affordable, and any long haired animal will love them. Myra does love this grooming time too.My doggie, also likes the bristle brush and then the bristle brush for polishing his hair. He's always laid still for grooming.I was given the 3 brush set product to try out and then give a honest unbiased review and like all my reviews, I update them when the quality or function changes. If you don't see an update, then the product is still working as designed. This is the one product, that I felt the many benefits of using, so I love to do a 5 star review on a great and well made product that does what it is supposed to do and also does it well. .","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MWPDIJH60EEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI2GM36#wasThisHelpful","R3MWPDIJH60EEM","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used these headphones while out and about for over a month.I treat them carefully as I do all electronics (I am electronics person not just a user)They are nice, attractive wood, and have a comparable sound quality to other sets which I have purchased for myself. I have bought many headsets from cheap, up to Sennheiser high quality. Of course they don't compare to Sennheiser but to other typical headphones, they are comparable.I enjoy using these, and keep them in my bag for travels. I am a music aficionado so I'm fairly OCD and extremely picky about sound.I am happy with them, and I did receive them to use freely and review.EDIT: the price was around $20 to $25 when I posted my original review, I would not pay 50 for these. Originally I said [For the price, I would not hesitate to purchase these] and with that in mind, it must be considered that of all things electronic, these headphones are made small and with small wiring. Without treating them carefully, like anything else, they could break.I don't think of the wood as being the selling point for me, and I would not consider buying them just for the wood feature, but they do look nice however the music sound is most important. After I put the headphones on, I am not caring for what they look like to others.I dislike glaring white/pink/orange/red or glittery headsets. The darker the better so they fade into the background and aren't noticed by others. That is my goal when choosing color of any headset.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QKE10LAP1PRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFVOTFA#wasThisHelpful","R3QKE10LAP1PRY","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've bought many Stanley tools over the years and have never been disappointed. Some, I've had over 35 years and still going strong.It's a Nice little set of the smaller screwdrivers for working on very small electronics assemblies, or eyeglasses/watch or jewelry parts.The phillips heads are sharp and precise as advertized, the flats are as well. I had no stripped phillips head screws from the drivers not being precise.I liked the rubberized easy grips being larger than most small screwdriver sets, and the shapes of the handles are somewhat ergonomic and easier to grip push and turn.I like the bright yellow color and the case itself to hold the screwdrivers together securely in toolbox.The yellow color of the case is good when you want to grab this set in particular from the small tools box.I do love me my tools to get a small job done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19IAKVYDCL26O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009OYGV#wasThisHelpful","R19IAKVYDCL26O","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I originally posted an initial opinion of the Health Detective, and soon deleted it, as I wanted to USE the detailed analysis worksheets on real people. This review, although the review date says March 18, 2015, my review here was posted today on October 22, 2015.Explanation, on why I feel this is the best book ever written for sick people; it is a rational, concise yet detailed and highly organized step by step analysis of all of your symptoms and possible causes that you have that defies doctors, and that leads to either the wrong diagnosis or no diagnosis at all and this leaves people suffering. It is a fast question system and by answering the questions fully, it will get you quickly to the goal of finding the true causes of your illness(es). The highly concise and organized steps of analysis of cause(s) found there in the worksheets will enable anyone for doing an easy and quick self-analysis of the symptoms they're having and helps tremendously in recognizing their cause(s) of their symptoms. It is the next best thing to empower anyone to do this self-sickness analysis on their own, other than finding a doctor who would agree to spend the necessary time in analyzing your symptoms and causes completely to find the correct diagnosis for you, as the patient. The doctors usually require the patient to voice only one complaint during any single visit and this leads to the patient having to pay for and go for multiple doctor office visits, and even then it might not give a correct diagnosis. Then, going to your doctor, with this information which is easily gained from this book's Health Detective worksheet analysis, can help the doctor in finding the right diagnosis and treatments or possibly medications to help you on the path in getting you well again.This Health Detective book tells you how to figure out the real reasons why you are sick or are not feeling well all the time! Other books, only drone on endlessly and tells you about diseases, symptoms and treatments! They never teach you how to quickly figure out for yourselves of THE REAL CAUSES of your specific illness(es). Some books have tried, but most books have failed too many people in finding out their causes of their disease. This is probably the most important book ever written for anyone who desperately wants to find out how to get well, and possibly stop taking pharmaceutical drugs that treat only symptoms. Those people who soon learn that those treatment drugs don’t often help their symptoms much and they continue to suffer from numerous troubling symptoms, but now are suffering with those common and often terrible side effects of the drugs themselves. Those side effects can be far worse than the disease and symptoms itself that the drugs are used to treat!If you truly want to get well, I would highly recommend buying and following the guides and doing the worksheets found this ""Health Detective"" book. I’m always the skeptical one in any group, as that skepticism is my true nature. I have had his book, and was given it freely nearly a year ago by the author for me to evaluate and possibly write a review. How could I write an honest review based only on what I read but did not put into practice? I simply could not. I knew these diagnostic processes already due to my background education of BSN nursing uni @ MSMU. I also know by experience that to tell a person simply why they were sick does not always work, in fact it rarely works, until the persons' themselves actively work through and DO the processes and think through for themselves the causes of why they are so sick, and now fearing becoming sicker. When the person is desperate and wants to be well, then they are more likely to change their thinking and habits and then will do what needs to be done to get themselves well. It is that process of thinking and getting a grip on reality and then decisions that allows people to overcome their habits or environments.I did this, for almost a year privately and individually with each of my 4 family members who were already in dis-eased states and suffering from pain or from the debilitating side effects of drugs they had been taking. There is not a person alive who will escape from the Human Condition, usually coming in the form of pain and agonizing body symptoms, often those people, nearly all of those people alive who never found the true causes of their troubling illnesses will likely be suffering excruciating pain each and every day for the rest of their lives. Daily living, and enjoying a vibrant life, yet suffering those symptoms of sicknesses simply doesn’t have to BE that way. I know personally of many people living in my town who are now in their mid-90s who are active and vibrant elders who are still independent and out in society still doing paid jobs or volunteering their time. In my curiosity of examining their lifestyles, I find out they are practicing truly healthful living and are quite rigorous in doing so. One man is a fit strong 95 year old who actively works a full time paid job! My family wants to be like those 90 somethings too!I do realize this turned out to be quite a long review but suffer with me through it as it might help you live the pain free and vibrant life you desire to live too. A life which my family members are now living, along with me. During the near year I’ve had this book and shared it several times weekly in the beginning weeks, for my 4 family members, there were many diseases in which I used this book’s teachings and the easy worksheets and guided questions (I printed out several copies) to help me guide my family members’ who were suffering bad and painful symptoms daily and some had already suffered for months and one had suffered for many years.Using the book’s worksheets caused each of them (4 members) to think through for themselves of the things that might be keeping them suffering with agonies of sicknesses, and over and over as time went on, I heard from each of my family members, “Okay, now I realize and I know what I have to do to get well.” It is so often that people find making healthy changes is difficult because they have a rigid routine in their lives that for them seems to be working, when the reality is it is not working at all, but it is keeping them sick and eventually they will likely become sicker and possibly disabled too.They are not suffering these days. They likely won't suffer ever again either. They have done the foundation work and the thinking for themselves by using the worksheets within Mr. Jenner’s book and have then worked with their MDs to find the right diagnosis and the right treatment, albeit some did have to take some drugs temporarily, until they removed the offending source(s) of their sickness and began to become healthier again and then no drugs were ever needed again. They were cured of their diseases once they found the true cause of their illness and by doing what needed to be done. One family member doesn’t even have to GO to their doctor now at all! Now, my family members all have scheduled Annual Health Checkups at their MD office. Once a year! A free service given by most insurance corporations aka Annual Wellness Appointment and also free annual blood labs with their MDs. No co-pays at all. Medicare also provides this free annual checkup where there is no cost for the appointment or blood work. I don’t know about others, but we sure don’t want to keep our MDs rich through the great expenses and sufferings of ourselves!This book “Health Detective” is especially good IF you or a family member or close friends has been suffering an illness where the cause was either known or unknown or have diagnoses that lead to that endless cycle of suffering of endless pain and monthly or even weekly doctor visits, co-pays, and then the expense of trips to the Pharmacy. Pharmacy trips are always costly and endless monthly supply of one or more drugs that treat only the symptoms. No drug is or can be said to be THE cure to so many of the diseases of today (barring lifesaving drugs or antibiotics for infections--Vaccines the jury is still out if you know how drug studies go, studies and do an analysis and finding those typically skewed studies for promoting whatever drug/vaccine). Treating symptoms alone has never lead to a cure and the person will likely become even sicker and more drugs needed to manage symptoms. All drugs prescribed are only for treating symptoms of a disease. Some drugs are useful and usually only when a person is near death in an acute situation and IF they are in an ER somewhere. This is general knowledge folks, and can be easily found on WebMD, or Mayo clinic, just go there and search the name of the drug, or using Google, and nowhere will you find that the drug you are reading about IS the cure for a disease, but is a drug only used to TREAT one or many symptoms of the disease and diagnosis you've been given. Then, notice the many ""common"" side effects. Are those common drug side effects as troubling for you, as they are for me?I used THIS “Health Detective” to help my family members work through the process and make the proper decisions to enable them all to reverse their symptoms and finally cure themselves of Diabetes, Chronic Bladder Spasms and resulting Insomnia, Neuropathy caused by edema, Insomnia, and Fibromyalgia. To help them see the error of their ways found ingrained within their Lifestyle and then to see them have their personal epiphanies of why they were so sick. It was only through using these worksheets with each of them, as I was sitting by their sides, and guiding and helping them fill out the worksheets. I did that simply because I love my family because no amount of repeating and retelling them the causes of their problems ever worked, they had to see for themselves and then decide to get themselves well (my family is of a stubborn sort). Doing this nearly took up all my free time during the past year because it was 4 people I loved. That old adage...You can lead a horse to water...but you can't make him drink, rang true for them.THE FOLLOWING, IF YOU WISH TO READ FURTHER FOR SOURCES, AND EXAMPLES AND DOES DETAIL FACTS REGARDING CHRONIC DISEASES AND DRUG TREATMENTS.I am not referring in my review to treatable infectious diseases, where there is an antibiotic for infections, nor am I referring to Vaccines or Acute Care drugs that are used only in an ER or hospital setting to save lives, and even those lifesaving drugs are generally not long term drugs to be prescribed either. I am not discussing certain diseases, such as Cancer or other diseases. I am not a MD and am not giving medical advice. I am only describing my views and my experiences with MY 4 family members during this past year, by using the Health Detective book and a far more detailed analysis of their symptoms with them and to help each of them see, think and realize their causes and cures and that the drugs they were taking were only making symptoms almost bearable if it weren't for the side effects of the drugs, then only masking the true cause of their dis-ease. All 4, said the side effects of the drugs were far more troubling than the symptoms themselves. Side effects such as daily and frequent sufferings of dizziness, nausea, constipation, low blood pressure, occasional falling down, foggy head or fuzzy thinking, muscle pains, fatigue, tiredness, insomnia, inability to get or maintain an erection, feeling sicker than the disease diagnosis itself, depression, headaches, bone aches, and many more! If those drugs did actually work, they might be called a miracle. But, they are not a miracle, but merely a bandaid to mask the symptoms. THE REAL CAUSE for the diagnosis IS what doctors should be searching for, and actively doing this FOR their patients!The FDA website’s statement on drugs: “Medicines are used to treat infectious diseases, “manage symptoms” of chronic diseases, and “help relieve pain and suffering”. Medicines are generally safe when used as prescribed or as their labeling describes. There are, however, “risks” in taking any medicine. Each year in the United States, adverse drug events—injury resulting from the use of medication—result in over 700,000 visits to hospital emergency departments. Many adverse drug events are preventable.” (http://www.cdc.gov/medicationsafety/)Example: The medical diagnosis of Crohn’s Disease: I quote here what webmd.com said in my search on its site for 'Crohn’s Disease' (a random choice of disease), but notice NO CURE is mentioned, only treatment of symptoms using medications: “Considering taking medication to “treat” Crohn's Disease? Below is a list of common medications used to “treat or reduce the symptoms” of Crohn's Disease.” (http://www.webmd.com/drugs/condition-2084-Crohn's+Disease.aspx?diseaseid=2084&diseasename=Crohn%27s+Disease)The drugs treat symptoms only.The definition of Non-Infectious Chronic Diseases: “A disease that persists over a long period. The symptoms of chronic disease are sometimes less severe than those of the acute phase of the same disease. Chronic disease may be progressive, result in complete or partial disability, or even lead to death. Examples of chronic disease include diabetes mellitus, emphysema, and arthritis.” (http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/chronic+disease)Our USA government stated: “Chronic diseases are now the major cause of death and disability worldwide. By 2020, chronic diseases are expected to account for 7 of every 10 deaths in the world, as they already do in the U.S. These projections suggest that chronic diseases – and the death, illness, and disability they cause – will soon dominate health care costs and are causing public health officials, governments and multinational institutions to rethink how we approach this growing global challenge. According to statistics from the World Health Organization, of the 58 million people that died worldwide in 2005, 35 million deaths were attributed to chronic disease. That puts the death toll for chronic disease, 60% of all deaths that year, at double the number of deaths from infectious diseases (including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria), maternal and perinatal conditions, and nutritional deficiencies combined. The principal known causes of premature death from “chronic disease” are tobacco use, poor diet, physical inactivity, obesity and alcohol consumption."" http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/oes/id/index.htmI would truly recommend buying the Health Detective first. I can only recommend ONE other book, but even then, it is a very LONG and flowery heavily laden with too many words and is a book to read and suffer through to find what you want to learn. You will find it there, but, with the Health Detective book, you might get to the cause of your symptoms in lightning speed.The companion book I wanted to have myself for my family, IS nearly 400 pages LONG! 393 pages to be exact! IF you have ever read ""Walden's Pond, by Henry David Thoreau, (an awesome non drug anti-insomnia cure BTW) then you might know why I describe this other book in this way.IT IS so long & flowery & full of words that even for ME as a voracious reader and writer, it was just a difficult slog through the book because it covers too much and does not focus directly on you as an individual! It is incredibly detailed and describes using many words for causes of a simple headache. But, you might want to have this 2nd book to go alongside and have to read as a convincing companion to the ""Health Detective"".Lifestyle Diseases and the myriad of painful problems/symptoms caused by a poor to bad lifestyle or possibly find that removing only ONE thing from your environment or diet might be the answer to relieving all or most of your annoying physical symptoms. Even an average lifestyle that includes the Standard American Diet, the person is highly likely to suffer, unless they change. This ONE other book I highly regard and would recommend for learning the truth of today’s ""new"" diseases is ""The Disease Delusion"" by Dr. Jeffrey Bland MD and Mark Hyman, and both are highly regarded and are world renowned writers of truthful books on health and lifestyle disorders. Now, when a renowned author and an MD together writes a book on these diseases? I will have to read it and comprehend every word and I will question it until I research their statements until I either believe it, or not. So far, I know these men are telling the truth on the Delusions of these ""newly named"" diseases, simply because I observe people, I do see how people actually do live and their habits that don't give them real health, and so often, especially with the manufactured and fast (non-foods) foods and busy lifestyles of today, too many people WILL continue to live daily in sickness and pain. Dr. Bland stated in ""The Disease Delusion"" that, “133 Million people are suffering of a disease…and is expected to cause a rise in healthcare costs by $80 billion dollars by 2030.” I don’t know about you, but that year is right around the corner for all of us, and most of us expect to live 20-40 years longer and some will live far beyond. I know I want to live a long and brilliantly healthy, active and happy life!Health care Insurance IS also going to rise exponentially to cover those healthcare costs for those 133 Million people here in the USA, and those costs are going to be far beyond most people’s budgets. Either we get control of those diseases or we will ALL have to pay in much higher Premiums for our insurance costs. You can get control of your health and diseases with THIS book that will help you by using the worksheets provided within the Health Detective book and then making the necessary changes to enable you to become well again. Your health won't likely change overnight because it didn't get bad overnight...it probably took a number of years to develop into full sickness by showing up with its typical and painful troubling symptoms.The definition of ""Lifestyle Disease"": “A disease associated with the way a person or group of people lives. Lifestyle diseases include atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke; obesity and type 2 diabetes; and diseases associated with smoking, and alcohol and drug abuse. Regular physical activity helps prevent obesity, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, colon cancer, and premature mortality [aka early death when younger].” (http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=38316)IF you are still interested, I offer true examples of my family members and their illnesses. Illnesses were Fibromyalgia, Diabetes and Bladder Spasms.Take Diabetes for example, with 2 sisters and brother, and after being given the MD diagnosis of Diabetes: MDs will then prescribe Diabetes drugs such as Avandia, or Metformin or other drugs such as injectable insulin to keep their blood sugars lowered. They might even tell them to lose weight and exercise. BUT, we know (read the ADA website) that being overweight and with out of shape or having small musculature keeps the disease of Diabetes moving forward with probable symptoms leading into some pretty scary areas, like amputations or heart attacks. Diabetes Neuropathies? I've heard are nonstop agony and prevents sleeping, a whole new insomnia diagnosis now, and another pill for forcing a person to be able to sleep through the pain of the Neuropathy. There are drugs that do help ease the suffering in some people, but others say they don't help at all, but are those drugs the cures for the neuropathies themselves? Nope, readers, I'm not answering that either. Then, still overeating, remaining overweight, not exercising and taking those pills or even sticking one's body with needle injections of insulin daily just might alleviate and lower the high blood sugars and the drugs for the neuropathies might help ease one's sufferings. BUT, is that the cure? One must ponder for themselves for their own answers on that topic.Although I don't have Diabetes, I fully understand the disease. I have family members who do have Diabetes, and three of them can now say they DID have Diabetes but have now recovered and have left the diagnosis of Diabetes behind and they are excited! They are truly living each day with joyful activities every day, and doing things they were unable to do until THEY changed themselves and habits. They did take some of those medications, only for a while though until they got healthier, and finally was able to do the necessary things to take control of their diets and able to do good and real hard exercise daily and ending up not having to go to their MD or having to take pills or insulin at all. Unfortunately, only one family member was left with a partial Neuropathy, but I do believe that in the long term his body will recover from that Neuropathy too, and he will never have that pain and crawling or burning sensation ever again. I do call this a “Cure for What Ails You.”I have my beloved 3rd sister who was given the diagnosis of Fibromyalgia, and I begged her for nearly 3 months, just to DO what she needed to do to recover...AND SHE DID, and she has never looked back and she shudders to think of the numbers of the awful drugs with such troubling side effects that she took to alleviate the symptoms and seemingly endless daily and nightly sufferings of the Fibromyalgia. She's my sister! I told her and told her ""Marian! You are only out of physical shape! You never was out of shape before! You have let yourself go for too long! You were healthy UNTIL you stopped eating right and stopped exercising!"" Yeppers, she had fallen into those strawman fallacies and beliefs of her fibro diagnosis, like many do, she remained overweight and ate poorly and didn't exercise except getting to the grocery; she was blinded and held hostage and suffering 24/7 by the diagnosis! She wasn’t told the truth! She couldn't see the truth! She never was sick! But, she's my sister, and I loved her! I spoke to her endlessly and unceasing every dang day until she finally listened...maybe it was her good day? I don't know, but she listened that day and we spent hours using the Health Detective worksheets, and over the following several months of a clean diet of real food choices vs processed, quick cooking or fast foods, and doing real exercise going from gentle to what she's doing today! She is doing 60 minutes of really hard exercise at least 5 days a week and she IS enjoying being able to exercise. Exercise, as I well know, is highly addictive and is an addiction of the good kind. She never wants to suffer again, and she sees the benefits of doing real daily exercise and plans each day for only good clean eating. Like me, she never says after exercising, “Gee, I wished I hadn’t of done that!”The author does give a highly detailed worksheet and analysis system that goes in step by step fashion, and is a detailed analysis of symptoms, and will allow even a lay person with no health knowledge to work through their health problems on their own, to allow them to THEN work with their MD to find the root causes of their illness and to find it quicker than ever before by using these analysis worksheets in this book. However, a person does have to be willing to spend a couple hours and trace through the history of their illness to find the root cause. The analysis worksheets are designed to help them do this easily and without any help by an MD, or hopefully not needing help from anyone. After working through those worksheets, and then going to the MD, and assuming that the person DOES want to get well and heal themselves of their suffering illness(s), then being an active participant and willing to advocate for themselves is best. THIS book will arm you with knowledge of your own body's symptoms, and will help anyone do that for themselves. Then you can go to your MD with good questions and then get a treatment program to help to on the path toward wellness and health. Any person, whether just sick enough to feel like crap every day, or a little sick or even very sick, they must take an active role in their health care before they can ever become well.To go to a MD office and sit there and just saying ""I feel sick"" does little to nothing and could take many doctor visits before the person begins to feel better, if ever? I say ""If Ever"" simply because as long as a person is only taking a medication for a treatment where the cause IS a poor lifestyle or environmentally caused, then they might not ever get better and will always suffer endlessly, UNTIL they find and treat or remove the ""root cause"" of their maladies. I know that the majority of people DO want to get well, but some are already so sick that it might take a very long time to get well again. But, we know through Science that our bodies have genetic codes within each and every cell of our entire body that IS programmed to be healthy...but WE have to do our part ourselves.IF you want to END your suffering of nearly any disease diagnosis you might have, and are willing to be your own best health care advocate, then this book just might be the solution to find out those exact reasons why you are feeling sick or are in pain daily. Some people have flare-ups of their diagnosis and awful symptoms that can last weeks to months on end, by their diagnosis(es), and this does not have to be! In fact, the majority of these ""newly discovered"" dis-eases are highly likely to be only caused by 3 things that most truly healthy people already know about and they DO practice healthy behaviors each and every day. The 90 somethings do the right thing for their health. I do what they do daily.1. Dietary habits.2. Environmental causes.3. Exercise habits.Not exploring the causes, and then fixing by doing something about those three things above can and will lead to one diagnosis or possibly getting several diagnoses of diseases. Those would likely be called Lifestyle Diseases according to the definitions given earlier. NO ONE wants to suffer from those diseases and the endless agonies that goes along with them either. There are things you can do to prevent those diseases from continuing or to totally reverse them entirely!It is not by mere coincidence that over 133 Million People are suffering from diseases here in the supposedly most highly advanced medical system in the world, the USA, and the people are mainly being treated for symptoms only with costly drugs, and this does nothing at all to find the root cause of the problem itself. It could be, that those people who do go to the MDs office are only being treated for their complaints of symptoms or pain and then being offered by their MD one or more prescribed drugs, ergo, medications for the symptoms themselves. However, treating the symptoms only by the taking of a pill(s) does nothing FOR the suffering person to END the suffering entirely, and is doing nothing to find the actual cause of the problem itself. The cure is only going to happen IF the person themselves take charge and be accountable for their own health. My Internal Medicine MD said to me, “I try to tell all my patients, but you know? They just don’t want to change!” I hear her frustrations loud and clear. It is a choice, of suffering from chronic disease(s) or getting well. If you have read thus far, I would believe that you want to get both well and healthy too.I can understand this use of drugs, IF the person lay’s dying in their hospital bed, or are sitting in their MDs examining room and might be slowly dying because their disease has advanced past the point of being healed, and only wanting palliative care and only desires a drug's easing of their continuous sufferings and pains. That palliative care always comes in prescribed pills or liquid medications that has to be bought and paid for either by insurance or by the person's cash in their wallet.For Preventable Diseases caused by Lifestyle, those 3 general causes numbered above, and with the rising numbers, said now to be 133 Million People who NOW have the chronic and also newly discovered and named diseases, the costs of healthcare and disability dollars paid by Insurance companies/corporations/Medicare/Medicaid are going to go BUST fast; as will the peoples’ wallets! It is little wonder that Health Care Insurance Corporation costs (corps are owned primarily BY MDs for financial investment, therefore reasons s/b obvious) and peoples’ monthly Premiums are certainly going to continue to rise until no one can afford to pay. BUT, with the Obamacare ""solution"" no one has an option to not pay BIG BUCKS monthly for that mandatory insurance and they must pay each and every month. People HAVE to pay monthly, or be fined by the IRS annually, possibly even jailed. Is this fair? It doesn't matter if it is fair or not, the fact remains that people have no choice. The only way anyone can get through this insane maze successfully, and without having to suffer needlessly OR pay your hard earned dollars endlessly, IS to get yourself well and not have to go to the doctor office each and every month, and then trip off to the pharmacy to pay some more of your hard earned money.This book, “Health Detective” can help you do that! The power is within each and every person to become healthier. Our DNA that is found within every single living cell in our bodies are fully programmed to be healthy, but without giving our bodies both internally and externally exactly what they need, and remove what bodies don’t need, to survive healthily and be strong then our bodies will fail us, because we failed OUR bodies. Chronic Diseases are the bad results. Your efforts are needed for your change to healthy. You CAN do this too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10ERG2LE7RUGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O170J2C#wasThisHelpful","R10ERG2LE7RUGN","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good tea according to my tea tastebuds. I was gifted this tea to use and review. I LOVE a nice cup of warm tea in the evening during winter, since my beloved espresso is too much caffeine for the hour.I was impressed at the large saucer shaped disk of compressed tea. About 6""across and 1"" thick. A good size amount, about 9 ounces/250 grams weight.Easy to chip off enough for a cup or a teapot full. I have never used this style of tea, compressed/dried into disk form.Has a good clean tea flavor, milder and less bitter than the typical Lipton style orange pekoe teas. It's hard to describe.I tried it without sweetening, it was fair, but I liked it better with a spoon of sugar. Brought out the flavor of the tea with a bit of sweetness and toned down the tea ""bite"".The packaging is a conversation starter, with the wrapping and Asian lettering/colors. Someone spent some time designing it. It also came in a very nice Asian designed corded handle bag, reusable. Could be used as a gift bag for a special gift if you want the tea yourself. I have to admit, I do have a thing for saving bags like this from other countries and have many. I use them as a purse quite often. Easier on the body than a heavy purse. Not likely to be purse snatched either. Be unconventional, it's fun.Organic Pu-ehr Puer Diet tea. I do not use it for a diet, so I cannot speak for it as a diet aid, but as is, tea. But, Huzzah to the queen! This tea has a heavier body than the Earl Grey tea the queen probably drinks.I do drink tea daily before 2 or 3pm because like all dark teas, it DOES have a diuretic effect and you don't want to be getting up to go when trying to sleep. I had read in the past, that the English people, drink afternoon tea to prevent water retention. Tea is probably way more healthy than a prescribed drug for a diuretic/water pill. I choose tea over a pill.I did get a little lift in energy before beginning evening chores. YAH, I liked that.I like this tea and have enjoyed a cup each evening for the past couple weeks. I would recommend trying this tea if you are a tea drinker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HVWRVNMPUK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWMUWZC#wasThisHelpful","R23HVWRVNMPUK0","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used the 1990  5 inch thick book version of this 2010 heavyweight tome as I studied. I love the way it presents the material and the care plans, Nsg Dx. I bought it used, to use as a nearly up to date resource for my book and article writings on health subjects. I have always liked the simple layout of the B & S's Med/Surg Nursing books.I can recommend this book, which is the older version for 2010, for nearly anyone who wishes to learn about diseases and treatment modalities for yourself or for other sick/disease family members. The language, can be daunting with medical jargon, but a quick Google search, can clear up any words/meanings.

"Easy to use to get messy cables under control and neaten up the wire jumbles. I received this pack of 4 Neoprene Zippered captive cables, to try and then write my review. It's a good product, appears it will last a long time, quality constructed, zippered and easy to help organize the dreaded wire/cable mess behind TVs and PCs. Holds all the wires coming from my big screen TV which has 9 wires/cables coming from behind. It was a bit of a wire mess, not any more.I really liked the product.

"I may have reviewed this before. Please, musical tastes are subjective so please don't downvote my review because you don't like the music. I do love it. Many of the songs I already play on harp, so it's very nice to listen to the songs played on Lute. Lute music was played in castles but by poor people. Much of the harp Early & Renaissance music of today has been taken from Lute music manuscripts.Relaxing.Pretty to the ears.Nice to listen to when doing sit down chores.Nice dinner movies when you have guests.Nice to listen to when doing research as no voice to distract. Takes some brain pain out of researching endlessly for quality sources.Has a nice insert, ENGLISH and FRENCH language, giving an abridged history of the Lute music.Nearly 68 minutes of music.Quality of the recording is very good.Paul O'Dette is the Lutenist on this recording. Francesco da Milano is a renowned Early Music Lutemist and is author of these songs and he was held in a very high esteem and was considered equal to music as Michaelangelo is to sculpting. Both were named as Il Divino, the Divine. Most of da Milano's music was not transcribed until after his death.A  bit of history: Music played on the Lute that was actually transcribed onto paper, is mostly found from the early 16th century, but prior to that century, Lute songs were passed down via memorization by many Lute pupils and were not transcribed, and those songs also go back centuries as well. During those times and during the Renaissance, noblemen and noblewomen hired court musicians to play for their entertainment at any hour of the day or night. Wealthy families hired musicians for many years, sometimes for life. They were given land and money and held in high esteem and also held a high status in Court. Music and court dance was a favorite pastime during times before today's technology and it's what people did during the Renaissance for company gatherings. Lutenists were often found playing their music during intimate evenings.Musically, the fact was they used dissonance to gather the attention of the court attendees.In my house, TV takes a backstage from music. This CD is that good. I listen to it often and don't seem to tire of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q0RPP744HCMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005MNIY#wasThisHelpful","R1Q0RPP744HCMF","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please note the title of this is ""Casual Lightweight Backpack.""I was provided this Casual Lightweight backpack to use and review. I like it for MY uses, which may be lesser than others' needs. For daytime trips to Starbucks to carry along a few books and a tablet or two and a few snacks it is great.As the title says, ""Casual Lightweight I have done over 14 years of college and my backpack for college averaged 38 to 43 lbs daily. This backpack, I do not recommend to the full time student who carries more than 10 or so lbs in the backpack.WHY BAG IS NOT FOR STUDENTS?The straps are only an inch wide and unpadded. They will not last for the serious full time student. I cannot see how they would ease pressure on shoulders. I've been a student 14.5 years, so I know.The bag is not constructed as a normal heavy duty book backpack, in reinforced sections to prevent hardback book corner blowouts from wearouts, but is a simple flat construction.Full time students NEED quick release closures. However, they do have typical handbag style magnetic snaps for quick release. A good thing but IMHO not reliable for heavy book bag but is a yes for a casual backpack.The lining, in my best sewing/fabric opinion, would not likely hold up to taking large hard books in and out of bag past a semester or two.OTHERWISE:The medium brown silky but stiff lining, has two pockets, one is open and wide, the other is wide and zippered. A good thing.It has a locker hang loop.Straps are adjustable.Two outer pockets are roomy and hold the usual items, cell, brush, small wallet, money, etc. I like the pockets.Construction. Although it is a heavy canvas, it is also well stitched. As a experienced sewing person, it appears as if it will last many years with getting light usage daily. The straps, appear to be made of a upholstery grade of pleather (plastic leather) in the color brown. A very dark brown.My opinion on the brown and black???  I was taught that they simply do not go together as colors. However, the brown is so dark, that it looks like a light black at first glance. So, not really an issue for me.HOWEVER, for others, who carry only a few things, this backpack is attractive and works nicely. The straps are not padded, nor are they wide enough to use it as a heavy carry pack. I will enjoy using it on my day trips, which does not mean carrying a backpack for approximately 2 to 3 hours a day all between classes etc.I can recommend this backpack for Casual use only. I like it. I will probably use it frequently.I really like it for myself. I do carry a couple smaller books and my laptop/tablets (depends what I'm needing) to Starbucks or other places to do my research and writing solely to get myself out of the house. This bag, is nice, very nice, because it goes with everything I wear, and  I enjoy carrying it. The pattern of the canvas is nice. Tribal looking. Sort of an African print.It does need to lose that new car smell. That took a few days. Typical odor of fabric and pleather.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DNFOWHMVF4RH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OR07ZYI#wasThisHelpful","R1DNFOWHMVF4RH","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I received this BlueTooth speaker from Brightech to use and review. Brightech knows I am an electronics and music junky and they know I love Bluetooth speakers too. I play an instrument and I have a LOT of music playing devices and I am VERY picky about music sound quality. This BT speaker passes my I LOVE IT tests. I listen to music at all hours of the day and night. I am a very busy and high energy person and music feeds that quality in me. This speaker is a very nice addition to my bag of listening toys.The front of the speaker is metal with tiny holes in it. Using a bright flashlight, I can see TWO 1 3/4"" speakers and the cones. It does give stereo sounding music.SOUND: Excellent bass, trebles and highs. I measured the bass using a Spectrum Analyzer and microphone. Bass was clear and deep at 248 Hertz. The high soprano, to measure quality, I used Celine Dion (she has very high voice) and also Monseurrat Caballe (soprano opera) and Freddy Mercury Barcelona album, my all time favorite album. Caballe sings high soprano and no loss of the highs on this great speaker! I also tested playing a few classical pieces that are noted to cover the music spectrum from the highest (Flower Duet) to the lowest frequencies (Yo Yo Ma cellist). It was ALL good and I use this speaker at my bedside the most.DISTORTION: Little to none. However, all speakers when overdriven will distort. That is normal, but this speaker handles high volume with little distortion. I've only turned it down a couple times for a small bit of distortion.Pairing was sooo easy for all my Bluetooth devices that have music on them: Galaxy S4, Droid 4, Galaxy S5, iPhone 6,  Kindle Fire, Verizon tablet, iPad, iPod 160GB Classic (Kokkio Bluetooth adapter for iPod). The NFC, or, Near Field Connection is said to work well for one button pairing, but I have a few NFC Bluetooth devices such as tablets and my phone, which has 7 different BT speaker devices paired with. This is nice, I just touch the NFC Bluetooth symbol and it pairs, not having to go into my phone menu's BT devices.All I do for first time pairing, is do a scan on my device, and then push pair Bluetooth icon on the speaker. They pair easily. I had no issues with pairing as I had with my Kinovo speaker which is similar BT speaker as this one, but this one is far more rugged and easier grip for outdoor and on the go use than the Kinovo (I reviewed the Kinovo I purchased and I like it too)It is of very sturdy construction, surrounded in a non-slip rubberized material and perfect for on the go use. Small enough to stuff in a purse or backpack, but large enough to put out some pretty loud and high quality sound. \It looks nice sitting on my side table or bedside table.It has a 3.5mm jack to manually connect a non BlueTooth device for sound, CD player maybe? I still have 3.It has a USB jack @5V 1 Amp to charge other devices, and can be used as a 1800 mAh storage battery bank also, to charge other devices such as a phone or iPod, etc.  It does not work for hands free phone calls. Music stops and phone takes over. Overall volume is controlled by the device you are using.Speaker does work while it is charging. You can also charge your playback device with it while it is paired.Hours of play, at high volume, I got about 6 to 7 hours of play time.The speaker volume is controlled by the music play device loudness control on the device and also by the plus and minus symbols on the speaker itself.The controls are molded into the thick rubber rugged coating that surrounds the speakers, they are indented so they will not wear down. The Bluetooth connect symbol, and >>| which forwards to the next song and then |<<  which goes back one song.The controls are somewhat hard to see if you have eye issues. They are not raised. But I wanted to SEE them. I did take silver tole paint, and a small brush and painted down into the control depressions with the silver paint. Now is very nice and easy to see. You could also use White Out and a brush, but it dries fast so you have to work fast. I have a habit of using White Out on certain common hard to see buttons of my electronics devices in my stereo/tv/SS systems for the On/Off and Play buttons. That works and no flashlight needed. A simple fix for a common problem.It uses a common smartphone charge USB cable to micro hdmi jack, and I use the Galaxy S4 auto charger in my van to charge this speaker. I use any 5Volt charger to micro hdmi that I have and all charge speaker well. I also charged it with my Anker 13K mAh auxilary backup battery.It has an On/Off switch, and the 3.5mm auxilary jack.The light is red when charging, and goes off when charge is complete, and is when I remove from charger. Takes about 3 hours to full charge from a dead battery state.POWER= 3W + 3W @ 4 Ohms Impedence.There is a light on the front of the speaker which tells the battery level. Blue is fully charged. White, means charge soon.I won't go into the size details since every other review and the product description already gives that information, but it is as it looks in the picture and fits in the hand. It is a good sized speaker and robustly built. It weighs 15 1/2 Oz, or, 442 grams. It has a 3 year Brightech warranty. It does have 2 speakers in it, just as my Kinovo does. The sound is actually better and louder than the Kinovo, and without distortion. (I like this speaker better than the Kinovo I paid for)I do recommend this Bluetooth Speaker because of it's quality of sound and durability of construction. I love this speaker! Brightech offers a 3 year warranty on all their products which for me says a lot about how they believe in the quality of their products. LIKE ALL of my reviews, if any item malfunctions, I always update my reviews. IF there is no update, then you know that the item is continuing to function as it should.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MFR75S15EOL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMTN96U#wasThisHelpful","R3MFR75S15EOL8","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is SO cute, was my first thought when I opened the package. I received this 3x3"" cube BlueTooth speaker to use and review from Brightech. It has a 3 year Brightech warranty. You seldom see more than a year warranty for anything these days. For that, and my experience using this speaker, I would definitely recommend it. I have read many other reviews and a couple reviewers had contacted Brightech and their complaints were satisfied promptly. (Customer Service for my Sony products and other name brand products these days seem to be non-existent.)I have purchased several other BT speakers in the past, and also reviewed those purchases. One I purchased is a nice Kinovo BT speaker. I thought it was a 5 star too. So I am comparing this to that. BUT,THIS little ruggedly made BT speaker has a amazing sound that will fill a room considering it is 5 Watts and gives my Kinovo a run for the more money I paid for it. This is a tight well manufactured speaker and is said to be waterproof. I wouldn't be dunking it underwater though.It is loud enough that I did not hear my DH talking to me from my door and sound is without distortion either. I am sooo very horribly bothered by distortion of music via speakers. ALL speakers with enough power input coming from play device WILL overdrive any speaker. We try not to.This speaker, the volume is adjusted by the playback device, phone, kindle or mp3 player.It has a rubber outer shell that is easy to grip. There are 3 symbols, a + to advance to next song, a - to go back a song, and PLAY which simply pairs the speaker to whatever device chosen.Very good sound overall with no distortion. I LOVE good speakers! I love this little but powerful speaker!The bass response for it's size is very good, and I placed the booming speaker onto my chest as it was playing the drum solo on the Metallica CD track ""The Thing That Should Not Be"" and I could feel a nice thump within my chest for such a little speaker. It's a 5 Watts speaker, not 200 !!I did run the different music selection's sound output through an external microphone to the input of my spectrum analyzer, and I was able to see that the range of frequencies generated by this speaker met my expectations well for all music I played. I played Celine Dion for very high frequency (not my favorite shrill voice) and Tribal music for bass notes as low as 258 Hz. Metallica Chill Out sounds lovely too and has all ranges of frequencies.Good treble voice range is good for podcast listening too. Using Player.FM, I listened to several of my favorite podcasts. Nice.It pairs just so easy, just push the PLAY word on the outer case, paired just like that! I have paired it just as easily with my Kindle Fire, Galaxy S4 and my HP Elite PC laptop, just by sitting the speaker nearby and turning off other BT listening devices (my LG headset, other speakers). (My Kinovo is a absolute pain to pair!)I have used it for about 16 hours total, and it does perform well.It has a heavy duty wrist lanyard, easy to remove if not needed. It is red, as is the speaker cover.Speaker cover is metal and is coated with a gloss red coating/paint. Whatever it is, it would likely not scratch easily with the usual use.I am a music NUT-JUNKY, and if it does not sound GOOD then I will NOT like it, not even a little bit. I am also a harpist/musician, so I am picky-er with music than others may be. I use BOSE 200 Watt pair of computer speakers just for quality iTunes listening since my job is at home on my PC. Music is important to me.I also used a 3.5mm jack and attached it to DH computer. He liked it a lot too and wanted to keep it. It was an argument to get it back so I could finish using it for review purposes. I'm keeping it for myself~~for now at least.As I sit here and write, I decided to carry the speaker itself across my house, about 65 feet, into the kitchen to weigh it on my +/- 0.1 gram scale. It did NOT lose signal with my Galaxy S4 Googly Play app. I weighed it in at average of 252 grams. It did oscillate between 248 and 256 grams to the beat of the bass notes of the Metallica song, and LOL and surprisingly, I did not know bass notes would affect my gram scale, but it did. That was an interesting discovery, in that I'd never weighed music before! Well, I was playing Metallica, HEAVY metal! Duh!I don't feel at all like I am going out on a limb and saying YES I DO recommend this great little but powerful speaker. I do recommend this speaker especially for on the go functions, campouts, pic-nics. I also travel around and play with HAM radio, and sleep in my maxi-van, so I can see this as a nice small addition to my van-bed-side table. It has a nice echo inside my van too.Finishing up by listening to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Soooo nice! And, like ALL of my reviews, if you do not see an update then you can be assured that any product I review, especially electronics, that they are continuing to operate as expected. If my views change on any review, I DO update ALL of my reviews when necessary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QXKGGA8SRS9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFFDDLG#wasThisHelpful","R2QXKGGA8SRS9Z","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this bathroom scale to use and review. I used it 2x daily for a bit over 2 months, morning and night. I found that it is a fairly accurate scale for body weight. ALL scales will vary a few tenths of a pound on each repeated weighing of a person, and whether this will bother a person will depend on the level of accuracy which they agree to pay for. That is not a deal breaker. It is relatively accurate for anyone who wishes to keep tabs on their weight and do not obsess over the minor reading differences. My old scale, would vary as much as 5 or 6 pounds from each weighing, not good.In the 2 months I've used it it has been reliableA nice uncluttered low profile designUltra modern detail for design, great for the minimalist people who like a clean uncluttered look.Unobtrusive footprint in the powder room.Glass plate to stand on and black upper and lower edges.Large digital readout even for those of us who cannot see the numbers on the typical analog scaleReads in tenths of a pound.Overall, if a good general scale of this style/design is what you are looking for, then consider this scale.

"I've used this same remanufactured ink on my Epson XP-310 inkjet printer since I purchased it about a year ago. It continues to work as well as the cartridges that came with my printer. I have purchased this ink for my other printer, and Epson Stylus 835 for a couple years but now use a large volume tank system. I print a LOT because I have a small business that relies on very colorful copy/labels. I cannot agree to afford the Epson brand ink when this brand just works--great.Does print nice photographs. I cannot tell the difference in print quality from my 3 printers, one of which is an Epson 5530 that does use Epson brand ink.

"It works very good. DOES come with HDMI cable and nothing else is needed except 2 AA batteries for the remote. Does NOT come with batteries. Out of the box and using within 10 minutes. I have a Roku, so I have no intentions of using a cable to my wifi modem for internet streaming of either Netflix or Prime shows. So I cannot speak for that function. This Blu-Ray player is a ""Factory Refurbished"" product. Normally I would purchase new. But for the price, and for my uses, it is perfect.I'd never watched a Blu-Ray dvd. It is just as awesome of a picture as they say it is. It almost appears like 3D. Vivid color on my 70"" HDTV.The remote does everything you'd expect a dvd player's remote to do, including eject a disc. I was also able to use the remote to adjust the picture colors, as there was too much reds in my picture, which is not an issue for my TV itself.I have used it to play CDs and my recorded mp3 discs for music playback using my surround sound system.

"Great cutters for small things, component leads, wire snipping etc.Springs open nicely after cutting.They do not grip and hold what you cut. Some do, this does NOT.The stand off and 21 deg angle jaw is just enough to allow getting cutter blades down deeper into a circuit to snip a lead/wire close to board and in fact it can cut nearly flat to the board unless jammed with components.Good for removing a jumper wire or block MLCC caps when modding a circuit, or general rework.Very sharp and blades match up well and gives a clean smooth cut.I like the comfortable molded handles and they have a bit of a tacky grip, but not sticky feeling.I also like the finger stop design of the grips to prevent your fingers slipping down onto the cutting area.Just a nicely designed cutters.A useful addition to any electronics tool cabinet. Proper care, proper usage should keep these cutters in good shape. Don't go trying to cut larger than rated for 16 ga wires etc. Using it for what it is intended, cutting smaller things. I use a piece of beryllium microcircuit substrate board to sharpen blades on small cutting tools like these. No tool stays sharp forever, and maintenance is key to prolonging any tool's life. A little drop of machine oil every now and then on the pivot mate surfaces should keep these working smoothly for many years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVTXDC5CPIZ6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZPDG1K#wasThisHelpful","RVTXDC5CPIZ6G","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Small. Works great. Like having the weather channel. Does charge a phone enough to use it. Must turn crank slow to prevent burning out the brushes. AM and FM comes in nicely. NO it's not a stereo, but it gets the job done and done well. The flashlight is great too. I charge this about every two weeks as a safety measure so it's there when we need it for power failures or other emergencies.I also take it with us on camping trips and for other travels. The solar charger works to charge it enough for short periods of use to listen to radio, or give enough charge to a cell phone for limited use time. Then recharge by crank or solar if you have sun. For it's use as an emergency radio/flashlight/charger/AM*FM/weather uses it does the job.I can recommend it for the functions it has, price is reasonable.

"Amazing harp music. I do NOT know these harpists personally! Not affiliated in any way either. Please listen to samples of their song tracks. Music likes/taste IS subjective, please don't diss my review because I love ALL music, but especially harp music...I bought both their CDs, this, and Harp Attack. A fine purchase too. Will be excellent entertainment for many years to come. Amazingly talented and beautiful twin harpists, a joy to watch them play. As a duet, they play together, harmonizing, just so flawlessly! I've played harp 28 years, and I cannot hear a wrong note or a missed beat anywhere, not even one missed beat and I've listened hard for that. It makes me think they got perfect little stopwatches or timers in both their little heads.I Love all the tunes, many brought back memories of when they first came out on the big screen movies' theme songs. And also the newer songs, like the Game of Thrones theme song, are just so well written and done. I know they have studied music and practiced very hard for many years. It takes much work to get where they are. I do hope they become very successful, and in doing that, introduce even more people to the wondrous harp music. <3 <3If you haven't seen these two ladies play, their videos are amazing and entertaining and can be quickly found on YouTube by searching Camille and Kennerly.  64 videos that they have on their YT channel. The husband likes watching them perform on the videos. Many of the sites in which they have chosen for performance are both unique and gorgeous. I recommend viewing their videos, and I got the husband hooked on C&K by showing him the Disturbia rendition of Rihanna's song.If and when they produce a DVD of their videos, I'm going to buy it asap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LOVLOYEFS591/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GYENJAO#wasThisHelpful","R3LOVLOYEFS591","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used this Ipow seller provided sample phone mount in my miniMH for a month daily for phone and GPS. The suction pad sticks very well to my windshield. It holds securely and has not popped off even once. The suction pad is a bit larger than most suction bases of other holders and I think that's why it holds better. A good thing. My Garmin suction pad could not hold the GPS Nuvi without popping off the windshield but this phone mount does work well, very well. The claw is said to fit up to 6""device and fits well and securely holds my Galaxy S4 and S5 and Garmin 5"" Nuvi without wobble or slipping out of claw since it does have a rubber gripping surface on the claws.I plan on using it for my GPS unit and phone for music. Using a good Bluetooth headset you really don't need a holder like this for phone that is voice activated for phone calls, unless you're using phone frequently for playing pre-downloaded music such as Google Play library which you would need phone mounted for ease of music selection. My phone is like an iPod for me.Like all suction mounts, you need to keep the surface of sticky suction pad as well as your windshield clean so it will stick good.One thing I like is that I can mount this very high on windshield and have my devices at eye level. No looking away from the road. I always pull my van over if I have to mess with a device. It's just not worth an accident caused by distraction. Safety for all.Cons: None really, but I wish it came with a slick plastic Dash Disk for mounting onto dashboard. My dashboard on my Dodge MiniMH won't allow any type of suction pads to work and since I travel a LOT I use this daily.. :o(The arm IS FIRM but can be moved easily but I suggest moving it into the general position you want it in before attaching to windshield since trying to make a major adjustment will likely cause the suction to break loose easily.OVERALL, I really like it. I've never had one that worked, so we'll have to see how this one works long term. I always update my reviews, no update means product continues to work well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZC1BOJ9BJJFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDG84I6#wasThisHelpful","R2ZC1BOJ9BJJFI","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pretty nifty flashlight.Attractive classy design with some very nice features.Uses only 14500 batteries. NOT AA batteries.About 4 inches long and 1 inch outer diameter.Has orange on off push button with a rubbery surface.Very good grip, not slippery in the least.Machined surfaces and threads. Well machined.Nice bright flashlight. It is a good purchase.IT does have a light focus function which is unusual for the less expensive lights, by pulling out the end section, also feels as if it has some sort of a rubber O-ring inside that section to allow the focus to remain in place where you want it to stay.At 5 feet from wall, with end section pulled out, it will focus light into a 1 foot square pattern very bright with light rings around it like planet saturn, very good for catching sneaking snakes trying to escape.At the same distance, you can slide up the end section back up and light up about a 8 foot circle of bright light.Silvery hard aluminum knurled dull and shiny surfaces firm grip surface, appears sturdy, well made, and not too easily scratched up.Fits in palm nicely.Small enough for pocket or purse and only weighs a few ounces.Stands nicely, does not tip over easily if table moves a bit.It doesn't take up a lot of room so I can keep it at the ready on my bedside table for nighttime excursions through my darkened house since I have poor night time vision but my cats meow all the way as they help guide me to their food dish near my sink....Very bright. Seems to be made fairly tough.Has a belt clip that holds well on even thicker belts. I can see myself clipping it on my jammie bottoms when out camping. DH likes it too, we're going to either fight over it, or buy another one for him.One thing, which is not a deal breaker, is that you must get a feel for putting the end cap on over the battery because it is a bit fumbly at first. Push the lid all the way in and then back turn it til you feel the click, then tighten the cap down. That will prevent stripping the threads.I do recommend this small $10.00 flashlight, it does use 14500 batteries. NOT AA batteries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GWCDN7JXJGKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJEOYTO#wasThisHelpful","R1GWCDN7JXJGKM","A30YP1B6XWP3S4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30YP1B6XWP3S4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:A window vacuum squeegee, seriously?  How could this be any better than Windex and paper towels, or better than a squeegee and a sponge?  Well, I didn't know I needed this until I tried it.It's just a blend of two tools, a rubber squeegee and a 'Dustbuster' type handheld vacuum.  They supply a microfiber cloth that fits on a holder.  I filled a bucket with some warm water and an ounce of dish detergent.  The cloth did tend to drip on the floor and window sill unless I squeezed it out before each use.  But it scrubbed the window nicely and picked up a lot of dirt I didn't know was on there.  Then the vacuum squeegee did its magic.  Just one swipe from top to bottom leaves the window sparkling clean, dry and streak-free.  There is no puddle of dirty water at the bottom to wipe up.  And the cool thing is if there's something in the way at the bottom (like the sill), you can squeegee from bottom to top with no drips or streaks - try that with a regular squeegee. They also supply an extension tube for higher windows (the tube makes it about 3' long, but top-heavy), which you can fill with a cleaning solution and use the built-in pump sprayer or attach the fiber cloth with it's own regular squeegee, or the vacuum unit.As I was testing on several windows, I thought of a bunch of other things I could clean with it.  So I cleaned the glass front of our oven, the bathroom mirror, then went outside and cleaned all the car windows!  I have to say though that the car windows were more of a challenge because the glass is curved.  But I still got them clean with a few more passes.  I can think of other things I could clean with this tool -- stone countertops, glass table tops, stainless steel appliances... anything flat and smooth.  Cool!Just a couple drawbacks... the water tank, motor and robber squeegee are all one unit.  This can get heavy if you have a lot of windows to clean.  Also, it's kind of bulky to try to maneuver on smaller areas.  It would be cool to have the squeegee part detachable with a hose down to the vacuum unit.  But other than that, if you like clean, streak free surfaces, try this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBD4B8LJIACKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015G1U9JY#wasThisHelpful","RBD4B8LJIACKB","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:There seem to be two different camp showers on Amazon.  There is the cheaper Coleman, Coghlans, Seattle Sports and Viking, and the more expensive Ivation, VN and Advanced Elements.  There are many complains on the cheaper ones about split seams and leaks, so don't buy those.  This Ivation one seems pretty rugged and sturdy.  I filled it up and it weighs roughly 40 lbs when full.  The water stream lasts for about 5 minutes if you leave the spray head open.  I liked the screw-on fill cap and the pockets for shampoo.A couple improvements would be a better hose -- the vinyl one kinked in shipping and restricts the water flow.  The spray head puts out enough water, but leaks around the threads when open and water is flowing.  Other than that, it seems like a durable and functional shower which holds enough water for a decent length shower.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R297KL212AK40Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7BVMDA#wasThisHelpful","R297KL212AK40Y","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:This is a study, aluminum headlight/flashlight and taillight combo.  The headlight is basically an LED flashlight that fits into a handlebar mount.  The headlight beam can be focused for a brighter/narrower or dimmer/wider light.  It does illuminate the road pretty well about 10-15' ahead.  The tail light is small, bright and visible from a good distance.  Both lights have four settings -- off, slow flash, fast flash and steady on.The battery in the headlight is a 3.7v rechargeable, and they supply a wall-charger for it.  The tail light uses two standard 2032CR button batteries.  There are spare batteries included for both the headlight and tail light.  You can also substitute 3 AAA batteries for the rechargeable with an included adapter.My tail light was defective and I wrote to the company -- they immediately sent me two replacement tail lights, so I recommend their customer service.  This set is one of several Chinese bike light sets you can find here on Amazon.  Most are very similar with an LED headlight with 'projector' type lens and the small red tail light.  One set I found has a USB-rechargeable battery instead of the wall charger in this set.  Others offer 2 tail lights.  I would shop around for the best bargain you can find.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BCWXOKYGIBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WS0V3O2#wasThisHelpful","R3BCWXOKYGIBY","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:I like peelers that are inline with the handle.  There are some that have the blades at 90 degrees to the handle, but I find those harder to use.  This peeler is comfortable to hold with a rubber insert on the handle.  It feels solid in the hand and has some weight to it which I think makes it easier to maneuver.  The blades are sharp and it works well for me.

"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:These bulbs are a replacement for the 3157 and related types with a similar base (3057, 3156, 3056, etc).  The numbers with the 1 as the second digit are for brake lights that have two brightness levels.  The 0 in the second digit is for single brightness like running lights and turn signals.  This bulb will work for both.The light it gives off is a bluish tint, probably around 4500K, which will make your brake lights look more purple than with standard incandescent bulbs.  It appears to work fine in my car without an inline resistor.Unfortunately, my Highlander takes a 7443 bulb for brakes, backup and turn signals.  So while this bulb does go into the socket, the base it thinner and it wiggles around too much, so I can't use it.  Bummer, because I think it's brighter, cooler and uses less energy than the incandescent 7443.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HTQ2C9XHNG0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PU0POG#wasThisHelpful","R3HTQ2C9XHNG0X","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:I have always used a windshield-mount suction cup for my GPS and phone.  But it's a pain to reach the phone when it's on the windshield.  Dash-mounts require you to stick something permanent to the dash - no thanks.  So this air vent mount is a welcome change.What I like about this mount is that it clips easily and quickly with a spring onto the vent blade.  It was easier to attach than another air vent mount I tried, the Getron Multi-Angle Universal Cell Phone Air Vent Car Mount (Black).  I also liked the spring-loaded gripping arms, making it easy to mount and remove the phone.  But...There is no 'bottom' on this mount, so the phone could shake loose and drop down through it.  The mount itself was 'loose' on the vent and it swivels around with no ratchets or detent to keep it from turning.  The ball mount works OK and it does tighten down with a screw ring, but the whole mount still swivels freely, which makes it hard to swipe and push the phone while it's mounted unless you hold it with your other hand.If I had a choice, I would go with the Getron mount above.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22WKR89TUGVSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012SUGNSC#wasThisHelpful","R22WKR89TUGVSH","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But once attached, it really holds tight.  The whole mount will rotate 360 degrees but with a click every 30 degrees or so, so it doesn't swivel when you're trying to use it.  Also, the mount is on a ball swivel that you can lock in place with a plastic screw ring.  So this mount is steady and versatile.  The arms that hold the phone also ratchet inward, so you place the phone on the lip at the bottom and then push the sides in until snug.  There is a button on the side to release the ratchet and pull them apart to get the phone out.The only thing I might have wanted different is if the arms were spring-loaded instead of ratchet.  I think that might be a little more secure and easier to get the phone in and out.

This is my opinion:I have reviewed a similar bulb, the Brite Innovations Energy Saving 7-Watt LED Filament Light Bulb Soft White 2700K - Exact Equivalent Replacement to Standard Incandescent A19 60W Classic Bulb This bulb also has a very nice, warm light. It's pretty close in color and brightness to a standard 60w incandescent bulb.  This bulb has 6 'filaments' in it, whereas the other one has 8, but I don't see a major difference in the light output perhaps just a bit less bright.The bulb is not dimmable, and it would be nice to have choices of a frosted or opaque glass so you don't see the filaments. But I think this is a great bulb with no warm-up time, longer life and does not dim as it ages like a CFL bulb.

"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:I attached a few pictures of how I fit the headset into my helmet.  The speakers have Velcro and come with a sticky patch that you are supposed to stick to the inside of your helmet to attach them to.  But just the Velcro on the speakers was enough to stick to the padding in my helmet, so I didn't need the sticky pad.  The fit is actually very nice... you can see that I routed the wiring behind the pads, so the speakers are microphone are in the right spot and are not intrusive.  The Bluetooth 2.1 receiver fits onto the outside shell of the helmet as shown, and you can remove it from its mount easily to charge or stow it.  The mount itself is just a clip which can be removed with a Phillips screwdriver as well.  The receiver has a knob that is simple to operate for both volume and changing modes from intercom to music player to FM radio.  I don't have a problem operating it with the helmet on.  If you can get your device to work hands-free to send/receive calls, play music or use the intercom, then this setup is ideal.Now, there are other well-known Bluetooth communicators out there, notably by Sena, Interphone, and U-Clear.  These generally are in the $150-$300 range.  Some have their own phone app to configure them, can intercom with multiple people daisy-chained up to 4 miles away, have auto-connect, and are waterproof.  This Chinese model has none of that (I don't see anything in the manual about being waterproof, just ""water resistant""); but with an 800m range, 300 hrs standby and 10 hrs talk time it is hard to beat in a $45 package.The only complaint I have is that the sound quality is just so-so.  For voice it's fine, but for music it is just OK... no better than the cheap earphones you might get free with your phone.  Be careful with the volume because it can get too loud if both your player and the Bluetooth receiver are at full volume.  And make sure it's not too loud while riding so that it drowns out noises that you need to hear on the road.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R319SJV5NA20SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01449MGXQ#wasThisHelpful","R319SJV5NA20SC","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already have and use the Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera Case (Black) for my Lumix FZ200 super zoom camera.  I tried this DSH-101 model because it mentioned ""High Zoom"" in the description.  So I took everything out of my DCB-304 case and tried to fit it into the DSH-101 case.  That includes the camera itself, a lens shade (detached and upside down on the bottom), a polarizing filter w/case, a cleaning cloth, and the Lumix battery wall-charger with extra battery.  Everything fit... except the wall charger!  I could not find a place in this case where I could comfortably fit the charger without cramming.  So if this case had just one more pocket it would be perfect.I like the DCB-304 because it has two zippered outside pockets where I store the battery and charger on one side and the polarizing filter on the other.

"I plugged in the power strip and all of the 6 outlets worked and the Surge and Ground lights came on as they should.  It's basically a power strip that has an added cable connector to help protect your TV or cable box from power surges.  A power surge is not the same as a lightning strike, which this will not have any protection from.  Surges are usually caused locally by your fridge or A/C switching on and off, and remotely if there is a power disruption like a transformer or power line down.  Power surges are common and frequent, but are almost always non-damaging.  A surge protector may protect your equipment from that rare time when conditions are right and the surge is excessive.This Woods power strip has several caveats in its instructions that are somewhat bothersome.  One is that its surge protection eventually wears out and it becomes just an unprotected power strip.  They say in the enclosed sheet to replace it every 2-3 years.  Really?  Who is going to do that?  Apparently the ""Surge"" LED will go out when this happens and that's when you are supposed to replace it.  I have not heard of that before-- is it just a way for them to sell you a new power strip every 2-3 years?The right-angle plug is OK for when you want to move something close to the wall, but it does cover up whatever is below it -- so if you plug it into the top socket, the bottom socket will be unusable.  The outlets on the strip are pretty close together, so a 'wall wart' transformer plug will block at least two outlets.  And there are no 'always on' outlets in the strip so when you switch the strip off, all 6 of the outlets are off.  There is a cover on each outlet that you can slide over to cover the two slots (no need to cover the ground hole).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSA43YNK4OKUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMR4S#wasThisHelpful","RSA43YNK4OKUH","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:The construction of this light is very solid.  The solid magnetic base is heavy enough to offset the 24"" gooseneck light so that it doesn't fall over.  The magnets are strong and will hold the light upright and even extended out fully from a flat surface and up to about a 45 degree angle.  The light is bright and a bit on the bluish side of the spectrum as you can see in the pictures.  The orange light in the background is actually a normal tungsten bulb, so the camera has reduced the blue in the picture to make the BBQ light look more ""white"".You can see the light attached both with the magnets on the right side and with the clamp on the left.  One problem I ran into was that with the long neck of the light, you have to bend the light away from the grill to be able to close and open the cover.  The best place on my grill to mount it was simply with the magnets on the right side.  I tried mounting to the grill cover handle, but it was just too awkward when opening and closing the cover with the 24"" light whipping around.The light color makes the items on the grill look pale, so it's not easy to see how ""done"" it is just by sight.  I would prefer a more tungsten, or at least closer to about 4500K, colored light when looking at food.That said, this light is probably more useful around the house than on the BBQ.  I agree with another reviewer that it makes a good work light in the garage or workshop.  It could also be clamped to a desk for direct lighting in your craft or other workspace.  I did review another BBQ light which is OK -- I like how it attaches though:  HOMEAN Super Bright 10 LED BBQ Grill Light","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23FWEPP5PBLV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UO1JNSK#wasThisHelpful","R23FWEPP5PBLV1","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BLU is not a household word in the phone industry, but they have been putting out some good offerings lately.  One problem they have had in the past is outdated software.  But this new (as of August 2015) Studio C Super Camera comes with the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop, which appears to be pretty close to stock.  There is very little bloatware, just a couple BLU apps for their manual and service information, which you can't delete, and a few Amazon apps.  The processor is still the MediaTek MT6582 Quad core, same as other Studio C models.The phone itself has a decent 5"" 720p screen that is 294ppi, which is a marked improvement over their Studio C models last year, and is viewable from almost any angle.  It will take up to 2 micro-SIM cards for two different networks and/or two different phone numbers, but you can still use only one if that's all you need.  If you already have a standard SIM, you can cut it down to fit.  There is a micro-SD slot for up to 64GB of memory you can add, which would help its internal 1GB ROM and 8GB RAM capacity.  It will work on 2G and 3G AT&T or T-Mobile networks -- but it does not allow 4G or LTE.  It also does not include NFC, but that's understandable with an inexpensive phone.  The Li-Ion 2800 mAh battery supposedly supplies up to 35 hours of talk time, which I find hard to believe given its smaller capacity from the 3000 mAh battery in other Studio C models.  I would plan on maybe 12-15 hrs.  You can use the phone as a WiFi hotspot.So this offering by BLU is the ""Super Camera"" model, which suggests that its camera is better than other Studio C models have had.  The rear camera is a 8MP with Sony IMX 179 sensor, 2448 x 3264 pixels.  The front selfie camera is an upgraded 5MP with Largan Lens.  Largan is a Taiwanese company that manufactures plastic aspherical lenses - I assume this is an upgraded lens from previous models, but the difference is likely minimal.  I compared pictures from the 8MP lens with my Lumix superzoom camera and the BLU was impressive in daylight shots.  There is some fisheye effect with the (assumed) 35mm focal length, but the photos are clear and crisp.  Video is 1080p at 30fps in daylight.  I took the phone to a Steve Miller Band concert and pushed limits of the the video by filming at night at the stage and trying to zoom in to the maximum 4.0x zoom.  It had a hard time focusing and the zoom is stepped and not smooth.  That's not surprising for a cell phone camera - I filmed the same scene with my Lumix and it handled the scene much better.  But otherwise, video and pictures are very good for a phone camera.One last note -- I got this phone to see if it was possible to go completely WiFi with the phone and bypass the monthly bill for voice and data plans.  Since I work from home and when I travel, there seems to always be WiFi available somewhere, I thought this might be a viable idea.  Of course, you would still need a plan to use 2G/3G network when WiFi is not available, but I have no Sim card in the phone yet and it's working great -- I got a Google Voice number for free, then got the Google Hangouts Dialer app.  I set up the app to use my Google Voice number and voila -- free phone and data when connected to WiFi.  As a backup or basic phone, this is a good option for me and saves a boatload of money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2QH2XJRWM8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013X0V4VM#wasThisHelpful","R3L2QH2XJRWM8Q","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item is basically a P2P video cam that has an added laser pointer that you can control remotely.  I had no trouble installing the PetCube app on Android 5.0, connecting the PetCube to my network via WiFi and connecting to the PetCube from the phone.  I am able to hear and speak through the cube and also control the pointer.  There is some delay in moving the pointer from when you swipe the screen to when the laser moves, but that's just normal network lag.I contacted PetCube about having streaming video running all the time even when you are not connected to the camera with their app and even if you don't share the video.  They assured me that the video is encrypted, and that they own the servers where the video is hosted.  I was just concerned about security and who can see the video, and especially if it can be hacked.  I would still just turn it off when not in use.You can of course use any remote video camera to watch your pets while away, but I think this one is the only one with a laser pointer on it.  The PetCube app allows you to ""Explore"" other live video that people have chosen to share.  It was fun to connect to a couple cat shelters and move the laser around the room -- too bad the cats are pretty bored with it.  I'm sure they get more laser play opportunities than they want.  :-)  All of the remote cameras had disabled sound, so you can't speak to or hear them, which is understandable considering what some people might say.There is also a still photo sharing page in the app, which it appears is not only for PetCube photos, as I saw many photos of pets outside, at the park, at the beach, etc.  But you can 'Like' and share others photos, as well as post and share your own.  I wonder if anyone is monitoring the photo sharing just to keep it on topic.  It's a fun idea and one that was funded by Kickstarter, so more power to the inventors and investors!  :-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R0C3674RUK81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGWN8O8#wasThisHelpful","R3R0C3674RUK81","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:First, the light color on this is very blue/purple.  It does not look ""white"" to me, even when compared with other LED lights.  We took it on a camping trip with us to see if it might come in handy for the camp site.  There is one mounting hole at the top, so I nailed it to a tree about 3 feet up from the ground.  There is a tiny hole and they provide a pin to push into the hole and turn it on.  Once on, it will only light up at night and when something triggers it.  Then it shuts off in about 30 seconds.It was somewhat useful while camping, to provide light if walking to the bathrooms or whatever.  The next day we camped it was cloudy and we were under some trees, so it didn't get a full charge and only worked for about 1/2 hour the next night.  It really needs to be in full sunlight to recharge fully.  Other than the awful color though, it worked well and I think will be useful in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R168XU8MMOVJ43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W135S4M#wasThisHelpful","R168XU8MMOVJ43","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:This solar LED light worked OK for me.  I took it camping with us, thinking it might be a nice night-light for the camp site.  The battery was charged when I received it, and it worked the first night for about 6 hours.  The next day was cloudy and we were under some trees, so it did not charge fully and only worked about a half hour after dark.There is an on/off switch that you have to use a pin or small wire to poke through a hole.  I would just leave it on so it just goes on at dark and off at dawn.  The mount for this is pretty flimsy though.  It's two aluminum rods that thread together and then thread into a small bracket that you can screw into a wall or post with the screws provided.  But if you grab or happen to hit the light somehow, I am sure the aluminum would bend or the plastic light housing would break off.  It really must be mounted in a place that is out of the way and unlikely to be handled or hit.  And of course it must be mounted somewhere that the sun can hit it for most of the day to charge the battery.  So I think its uses are limited mostly because of the mount.  You could figure out your own way to mount it, of course.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24VD1PKS53FH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MPJ27O#wasThisHelpful","R24VD1PKS53FH5","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:First, the images from this camera are good and sharp.  The pan/tilt works well with just a little delay as the commands are sent over the internet.  It will also do night-vision as well and is handy as a remote viewing device if you want to watch, say, your pets while away from home.  You can move the camera to see around the room if the animals are not in view.  The camera uses a 5v USB power cord with a DC cylindrical connector.  It comes with a USB AC plug for power, or you can connect it to a laptop or other 5V USB device.When power is connected, the camera is 'on', there is no power switch.  The instructions say it can be connected via wireless, and I was able to connect it using a Q code on my phone.  I also tested a connection it to my router with an ethernet cable and the network delay was just slightly less.  Using the free 2CU app recommended, I was able to then connect to the camera and use its features.  You can pan/tilt the camera by swiping the screen.  The camera has a limited viewing angle and there is no zoom.  You can also use a desktop application (from a cotapp web site) to access the camera, although you cannot pan/tilt the camera with it.I have some hesitation just leaving the camera 'on' all the time.  The reason is that it is constantly streaming video to a third party on the internet (presumably to the 2CU site) even when the app is not connected.  That opens up the possibility that your video stream could be hacked, although I am told by the manufacturer that this one is encrypted.  I would use this camera sparingly when needed and don't just leave it plugged in all the time unless you don't mind the possibility of the video stream becoming accidentally public.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R224RPWZ1NSPQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012N05T6Y#wasThisHelpful","R224RPWZ1NSPQW","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:We are tea drinkers, with both of my sons having worked at Teavana.  I have to admit I have never tried Chrysanthemum tea before though.  The tea arrives in a vacuum pack, and is whole dried flowers as the picture shows.  The flowers are have a light scent when the pack is opened and appear to be is good condition.  We brewed 8 flowers in 1 cup of boiling water for about 5 minutes and some honey was added for sweetness.  The tea has a very light, floral aroma and taste.  It was not bitter or sour at all -- very nice.Chrysanthemum tea has been used in Asia for over 2000 years and has several claimed medicinal properties.  Most of the properties focus around helping the eyes, cardiovascular system and liver.  It also is often used as a 'coolant' for when you have a fever, as it can reduce body temperature.

"I gave this 5 stars mostly because our cat gobbled it up with no hesitation.  He liked it even more than another brand we tried, The Nutro Company Adult Cat Chunky Loaf Chicken Dinner for Adult Cats, 3-Ounce.  It does have real chicken and fish in it, although the ingredient list (compared with the Nutro) seems to have extra 'fillers' as well:  Potato Starch, Carrots, Broccoli.  It also includes vitamins and minerals, which is good.The nutritional profile is: Protein 5.5%, Fat 5%, Fiber 0.5%, Moisture 85%, Ash 2.5%.  If your cat has hairballs or loose stool, you will certainly need to supplement with a higher fiber food.  The recommended amount for a typical 8 lb. cat is 3 containers, about 8.5 oz.  This works out to about $18 per day.  I would say that's a little pricey.  Use sparingly as a treat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PZHDXM17ED9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4GLVW4#wasThisHelpful","R2PZHDXM17ED9G","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion.I rate earphone and earbuds mainly based on how they sound to me.  Comfort and quality come next, then style.  So these over-the-ear earphones sound OK... the large speaker allows them to put out lower and louder bass than in-ear phones.  The higher end of the sound is somewhat muffled mostly because they fit over the ear.  Stereo separation is good.  They do block outside sounds somewhat, although not as well as in-ear phones or full-surround headphones.  So I think these sound OK for active use - I would not use them for critical listening.The ear pads are comfortable with a faux-leather feel.  The stiff cord does hold them pretty securely against your ears even while moving.  I did find the buttons a little finicky to use - it's easy to push the wrong button and rewind instead of fast forward.  The volume buttons are on the edge of the earphone, so it's a little tricky pushing the up/down volume without pushing it off your ear and without pushing any of the other buttons by mistake.Bluetooth pairing was easy - just hold the ""phone"" button down for about 6-8 seconds and when it flashes blue/red it's ready to pair.  I did not have a problem with the sound cutting in/out with these; although I did check and stopped any unneeded background programs that were running, which may be a cause of jittery sound.  Overall, it's nice to have a set of earphones without a cord dangling down to get in the way while you are moving around.  This set fits the bill and sounds OK for on-ear headphones as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA0BH51X6K8K1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDNTL8M#wasThisHelpful","RA0BH51X6K8K1","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:I am an audiophile and am pretty picky about how I want my music to sound.  With that in mind, I tried these earbuds with some jazz and rock music.  I was not impressed.  Think of listening to your music through your phone speaker and that is what they sounded like to me -- very little bass, tinny high end, indistinct sound with a muddled sound stage.  I compared them to my favorite (albeit more expensive) earbuds, the Brainwavz S1 In Ear Noise Isolating Headphones and there is just no comparison.  That said, these earbuds would be OK for voice-only applications, like as a phone headset or listening to talk radio or other voice applications.  The microphone works fine.Build quality is so-so, with very little strain-relief at the plug and earbud ends of the cord.  The flat cord is OK and long enough; its surface is smooth and does not tangle easily.  Cord noise is minimal.  The earbuds fit OK in the ear and their metal cases seem rugged enough.  It comes with three different sizes of silicon tips for proper fit.  The ""R"" and ""L"" designation on each earbud is almost invisible as a raised letter on the cord relief.  There is no storage case included.If you are shopping for style and you like the looks of these earbuds, then by all mean buy them.  If you are shopping for sound quality, even in this price range, I would look elsewhere.  You could take a look at the similar-priced Brainwavz Delta that I reviewed here:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J84AYLEG1CTQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY5ZF88STX5K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QHYNAC8#wasThisHelpful","RY5ZF88STX5K5","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:I own several pairs of Brainwavz earbuds and cans, so I have a pretty good idea of what Brainwavz is capable of.  I'd say that their first offering in the wireless earbud market is a winner.  These earbuds come with the usual Brainwavz complement of silicone and Comply foam tips, as well some small plastic attachments the hold the earbuds in your ear.  The cord is a typical earbud cord, which also has the Rew/Pause/FF buttons and microphone on it.  The quality of the buttons is good, with a positive click when pressed.  The micro USB charging port is in the right earbud and it fully charges in a max of about 1-2 hrs.  You get about 4-6 hours of play time from them.Overall, they are quite comfortable to wear, although I think the cord can get annoying if you are jogging or moving around, as it tends to bounce around.  The earbuds are straight and not angled, so they tend to stick out a bit and can be shaken loose if you don't use the tips that fit you best.  The sound is good, somewhat weak in the upper end, but plenty of bass.  As far as the spectrum balance, I still prefer their Brainwavz S1 In Ear Noise Isolating Headphones with just a little boost in the vocal range.  Noise isolation with the BLU-100 is similar to any other in-ear earphones, which depends on which tips you are using and how far they are in your ear canal.  The Comply foam tips provide the best sound isolation.If you are looking for wireless earbuds, at this price point I would not hesitate to recommend the BLU-100 from a company that knows how to make quality headphones and earbuds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UD2K3O6WT3HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDVY34Q#wasThisHelpful","R1UD2K3O6WT3HA","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:I have a collection of essential oils that I want to use, but have not found a way to use them that doesn't take some kind of maintenance every day or two.  I have put the oils into a potpourri mix, which does work for a week or so before the smell is mostly gone.  I have also tried putting the oils into a heating diffuser, which gives a strong scent at first that diminishes over about a week's time.  This humidifier is another method I am trying.  It actually works nicely, since you need humidity in the air anyway in order to smell things.  Filling the container with about 110 ml of water and a few drops of essential oils lasts for about 36 hours.The scent is very light in a larger room (I have it in the kitchen/living/sunroom), so it works much better in a smaller, enclosed room like a bathroom or bedroom.  The light is a soft glow and is OK, and the wood-like plastic looks pretty good as a decorative object.

"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:This microscope is basically a video/photo camera that is set up for only macro photography. I think this microscope would work OK as a teaching aid, for doing delicate work on small objects, for exploring nature, for realtime video demonstrations, for cataloging collections of small objects.  A few months ago, I reviewed another microscope from this company, the DBPOWER 3inches TFT Hd 5MP 500x Portable Digital Mobile Microscope which did not have a base and focus knob like this one, but did have a LCD screen.  This microscope does not have a screen attached; you must use it while connected to a computer via USB.The claim of 300X seems to be pretty accurate, although it's hard to tell.  You increase and decrease 'zoom' by moving the camera up and down on the stand, then focus with the knob on front.  The max 'zoom' is when you have it all the way down with the clear plastic against the base.  The 5MP max resolution is OK for casual photos and video you can take with it.  The only format it saves in is JPG, which is compressed and so you do lose some detail.  The iris in the camera auto-adjusts for brightness and white balance, so the ability to adjust the LED brightness is kind of moot, since the camera adjusts automatically to light changes.

"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:I already have a USB charging port that I can plug into my car's 12v receptacle.  But this one adds a couple features that I have not seen before.  It contains 3-LED white lights to use an a small flashlight (which works even when unplugged from the 12v socket), has a rapidly flashing 3-LED red lights for... who knows what,  a car window breaker, and a couple rare-earth magnets on top.  The magnets are a nice touch, since you can stick it to your fender while changing a tire, for example.The instructions don't mention anything about an internal battery for the lights or how it charges, but I assume it charges when plugged into the 12v socket.  The two USB ports are a 1A and a 2.1A port.

"I received this item for testing and review - this is my opinion:This is a 13,000 mAh backup battery and comes with a carry bag.  You charge it using the supplied micro USB connector and your laptop or USB wall charger outlet.  It has 4 blue lights that show the current charge -- 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. There's a small white LED light that you can turn on/off by pushing the power button twice.  Otherwise, it's a somewhat heavy and unremarkable backup power source with 2 USB ports to charge up to 2 devices at the same time.  I bring backup batteries with me when I use my phone as a GPS while playing golf or traveling.  The backup comes in handy when away from a power source while traveling, hiking, camping, etc.  At 13,000mAh, you should be able to fully charge your phone a couple times before the backup needs to be recharged.Note that the micro USB charging cable that comes with this has an extra long micro connector.  A standard micro USB cable will not work to charge this - or may work if you hold it tight in the socket.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18244XVXX00M0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KT4FEUS#wasThisHelpful","R18244XVXX00M0","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:I have several portable bluetooth speakers (which I have reviewed on Amazon).  I have to say that this is the best one I have tried yet.First, the sound is excellent for such small (30mm) speakers.  The bass port in the back really does work well as you can feel the unit vibrate with bass when playing music even at the lowest level.  There are no frequency specs in the manual, but I would guess it's about 120Hz - 20kHz.  The speaker is a bit 'directional', meaning that it must be pointing right at you for the best high frequency sound, but it still sounds good and clear when pointed in a different direction.  Volume is a bit on the loud side even at the lowest setting, and it get VERY loud at the highest setting - I would say even good enough for a party.Many bluetooth speakers have FM radio, which I like, but this one includes a display to tell you the station frequencies, which many do not.  You can also store up to 10 station presets as well.  Radio reception is excellent with no external antenna needed, although I am within 20 miles of radio towers, so your mileage may vary.Bluetooth reception is the standard up to 10 meters and works fine.  When paired with your phone, it will ring when the phone rings and has a microphone to allow you to keep your phone stashed away and take the call completely with the speaker.  You can even receive a second call and put the first on hold.  Caller ID is shown in the display.Finally, you can connect a wire from your player/computer right to the aux port on this for a direction connection, although you don't get the functionality of the play/pause/search buttons that way.  The 2500mAh battery is charged via a micro USB port with included USB cable and USB wall plug (or computer USB port).  Also included is a short lanyard with carabiner.All of the above, AND this unit is completely waterproof.  In fact, you can even submerge it up to 1m under water!  It's great for any outdoor activities and sounds fantastic.  Thumbs up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAXNHGKI5F842/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQ5TDLC#wasThisHelpful","RAXNHGKI5F842","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:Rosehip Oil is made from pressing the seeds of Rosa moschata or Rosa rubiginosa that grow in the southern Andes, and from Rosa canina.  It contains essential fatty acids and some provitamin A.  It does not contain vitamin C, which is water-soluble; nor does it contain retinol.  It has some astringent properties and absorbs quickly into the skin.  We tried it on our hands and it did not feel greasy and seemed to smooth the skin.  The oil has no scent. The pump on the bottle was handy to dispense the oil, although the astringent oil seems to make the pump a little sticky.

"I received this item to test and review.  This is my opinion.This BQ2 model is a step up from Nationite's other bluetooth model Nationite BQ1.  The BQ2 is a stereo speaker with the same functionality as the BQ1 - speaker with mic, bluetooth and wired connection, FM receiver, slot for memory card.  The BQ2 is heavier and larger and has better bass range (down to 28Hz, although realistically don't expect booming bass notes from 45mm speakers).  S/N ratio is good at >95dB with <0.5% distortion.A few minor issues I have with it are the function of the buttons (press for one function, hold for another), although the buttons are labeled much better than the BQ1.  The voice that says ""Enter to Bluetooth"" is badly transliterated from Chinese to Engrish.  I still don't understand what it says when switching to FM mode.  Oddly, the base of this unit is rounded, so it doesn't sit solid on a flat surface... it rocks on the rounded bottom.  I don't get it.  The only instructions are printed on the back of the box, so don't throw that out.  One last thing -- and this was the same on the BQ1 - this has an FM radio tuner, but there is no way to tell which station you are tuning to nor any way to store stations in memory.  It's functional, but not very practical.Otherwise, the sound is crisp and clear and the Bluetooth functions fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R165ESAF6QLGJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TO4KLIY#wasThisHelpful","R165ESAF6QLGJG","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The trickle charge of 200mAh that the battery gets while in the sun will only charge about 1/8 capacity for a one full day.

"I received this item in to test and review.  This is my opinion:This is a compact and very clear sounding stereo Bluetooth speaker.

"This 'air fryer' is basically an electric, counter-top convection oven.  There is a heating element that looks like the old coil burners from an electric stove.  This is placed above the basket that you slide into the unit.  There is a fan that circulates the air inside the unit while the heater is on.  The basket and the bowl it sits in are coated with a non-stick coating and so cleanup is easy.  The temperature and timer/power knobs are simple and easy to operate - you can reduce or cancel the timer by turning it counter-clockwise.  It functions like our toaster oven - you set the temperature and then turn the timer past 20 and then to whatever time you want it to stay on (up to 60 mins).  The temperature knob goes up to 400F.I made some french fries with fresh potatoes with it, following the instructions that came with it.  You cut up the potato into even stick, coat with 1/2 T. oil, add a pinch of salt and put them in the basket.  Note that the recipe calls for no more than 8 oz. of fries at a time, which is about 1 russet potato at a time.  After 10 mins at 400F, you pull the basket out and mix the fries by shaking, then put it back in for another 10 mins.  The fries came out actually quite crispy on the edges and cooked throughout.  For 4 of us, I cooked fries from 3 potatoes, which took about 1 hr. and 15 mins total.We commented on it afterward - how useful an appliance it is and whether it's something that should remain on the counter and be used often.  The answer was no for a few reasons:  1) For a family of four, the basket size is too small to make enough for everyone in one or two batches.  2) We have a deep fryer, and the difference in the amount of oil in/on the food is negligible.  3) Our oven can accommodate the full size of what we need to cook and does just as good a job.  One advantage of this appliance over a deep fryer however is the food is coated in clean oil and then baked, whereas deep fryer oil gets smelly and loaded with bits of coating after a few uses and needs to be changed.What I think this appliance might be best for is heating up small batches of pre-cooked foods like fish sticks, tater tots, frozen french fries, frozen onion rings, and making them crispy.  A toaster oven could do the same thing, although perhaps not as quickly.  For the amount of space this takes up and the cost to operate, if you already have a toaster oven or a full size oven or a deep fryer, I would pass on this.(By the way -- the photoshopped ad photo of this appliance with a basket loaded to the top with french fries is incorrect.  Loaded like this they would never cook through.  The recommended batch size is 8 oz, which barely covers the bottom of the basket.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIAE7V87IAOWO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYJW2A#wasThisHelpful","RIAE7V87IAOWO","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always run dehumidifiers in my basement in the summer to keep black mold from forming.  I like the humidity to be between 40-50%, so the dehumidifier runs from about May to October.  In the winter with the furnace running, the air is drier and I unplug the dehumidifier.I have had a GE dehumidifier for about 5 years and it seems to work OK, but GE got into an arrangement with a flaky Chinese company named Cree who let a lot of their dehumidifiers go to market with problems.  There is even a recall on some of them and if you have certain GE models made from 2008-2012, you should look it up and see if yours is included and get a refund.This Honeywell dehumidifier runs quietly and is working great so far.  The hose connection that I use to run a hose to my sump seems more sturdy than the GE one.  Also, the filter on this one is easier to get out to clean than the GE.  The only negative compared to my GE is if you use the water tank, the GE model has a red floating ball to show the water level and the Honeywell just has the plain window to see the water.

"I was given this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:I have several pairs of Brainwavz earphones and headphones.  I will compare this ProAlpha pair to another Brainwavz pair that is almost identical in price, specs and features, the Brainwavz M1 In-Ear Headphones.  I listened to some Eagles music and some classical 1812 Overture, so I could hear any differences in bass response and in clarity of the highs.  The only major difference I could pick out was that the ProAlphas were louder than the M1s at the same volume setting, and this is likely due to the difference in impedence - the ProAlphas are 20 ohms and the M1s are 32 ohms.  Other than that though, the differences were very minor -- the ProAlphas seem to have a slight edge in 500Hz to 1500Hz range, boosting this range just slightly over the M1.  The spectrum balance is what I like to listen to -- it's got a flat to slightly de-emphasized range from around 700-1200Hz, which you can boost with your equalizer if you like.  I prefer this ""dry"" sound though.Regarding accessories, they both come with the Comply foam tips, which are the most comfortable and best sealing tips around.  Both come with the same hard case and have the same no-tangle and somewhat stiffer cord, which has no cord noise.  The one thing I disliked about both models is that the earbuds tend to not stay in as well as some other models (like my favorite S1).  The earbud is small and light, and the stiffer cord tends to pull on them as you move a little more than more flexible cords.But in this price range, the Brainwaves earphones give good value for your money, and I would not hesitate to choose either of them for great, balanced sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HC659SB75S4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JHVJ5A#wasThisHelpful","R3HC659SB75S4B","ACL0T7X1THPAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACL0T7X1THPAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hate to be a non-raver - it's a nice enough water bottle, though not life changing, and who knows if it's worth the money. I know I drink more with a straw, so I got the classic stainless one with straw top, which comes with 2 straws.  The vendor, Heart Rate Monitors, got it to me in a single day, impressive. I have not yet put it up against serious temperatures, but my water stays cold all day around the house without ice.In all the current reviews of this product, only ONE mentions the dishwasher, and the writer says s/he loves that it can be thrown in the dishwasher.  Mine came with a band around that product with some information and one of the points was NOT to put it in the dishwasher, explaining roughly that the temp reached by many dishwashers is too much for the insulation layer. That's kind of a bummer, as I really didn't see myself getting a bottle brush to clean this daily.  (The plastic/rubber tops and straws are dishwasher safe though.)Further (and I may be spoiled by my old bottle's nice wide straw) the draw on the straw top is not particularly smooth.  I feel I really have to put some oomph into getting the liquid up, and I have visions of all this leading to old lady wrinkles around the mouth.I got this because I recently had a kidney stone and was advised to keep my water intake up.  My smaller insulated bottle held less and thus when it ran out I'd tend to stop drinking til it was time for a logical break from whatever I was doing and go get a refill.  I figured that with a larger bottle I'd be drinking more steadily, and that has been true.Time will tell more about the durability of this water bottle, and I will update if it shows any undue wear or problems. For now, I'm drinking more water and it stays cold, so mission accomplished.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GEEX6WHO771W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGUY7K2#wasThisHelpful","R2GEEX6WHO771W","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reasonably convincing faux leather with a nice matte finish and bumpy ossie texture, soft, not plasticky or vinylish. Essentially two-toned so it's bound to go with some of your brown boots or shoes.The only slight negative is that the short handles, because they are sewn on, are in a constant ""up"" position, which is kind of funky when you choose to use the extra shoulder strap (which attaches to small rings under where the short handles meet the body of the bag).  If you're looking to simulate a certain designer dome satchel, this won't play the part as it is larger, longer, not as high, the zipper pulls are different, and there's no padlock, but this bag is pretty and functional on its own.Because of the two browns in it, this goes with my dressy boots as well as my combats, so it will see a lot of action this fall and winter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R347Q2JHR14CNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMYF37Y#wasThisHelpful","R347Q2JHR14CNL","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for a bag similar to the LV Alma, this purse does have the profile... But the cheap-looking material ruins the effect on the brown, which appears to have a different finish than other colors. It has to be just that this color is differently made - it is not soft or good looking as others describe theirs.I got the brown because I could find no other vendor offering brown. The exterior is terrible and screams plastic. No effort was made to create a leather-like finish, or even the woodgrain finish used on the leather of the original. Instead, the vinylish, plasticky material has some random, stamped diagonal lines for texture. Bizarre. The trim on the bottom and at the base of the handles and the handles themselves is a very shiny faux patent. Mine did not come with a lock and key or fob.I sent it back. Really didn't think I could carry this around this winter without feeling sheepish. It just looks like ""Hi, I know I'm really not carrying an Alma, but I was so desperate I settled for this.""","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TT6LEQ8GP26E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLPYRWA#wasThisHelpful","R1TT6LEQ8GP26E","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Glad to be able to get affordable combat boots that look good, gold eyelets and all. The construction's cheap and there's not much padding in the footbed. Mine are the new shiny black, and they are not overly so.I'm glad I went up a size. I'm at the outer limits on fitting these, you may be too. Be aware... even going up a size isn't going to buy you more toe box room, it is low. I tend to buy wides even though I'm not a true wide-width person, and these are a tad tight. Plus, my arch is a bit high, and again, it's a close fit and can't be fixed with loosening the laces since your arch hits below them. I am ok with this, but if you have toes or toe knuckles that stick up, a very high arch or a truly wide foot, caution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12ELAZKM6CJU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008WMIF4G#wasThisHelpful","R12ELAZKM6CJU0","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Decent shoe, not sturdy but workable for everyday stuff. Rather thin sole, but you don't feel the pavement, zero arch support or padding. Nice basic design, the toe not too rounded or pointy. Thin heel carved out of the rubber bottom.I got three pairs, 2 ""suede"" (more like velvet or microfiber) and one PU. The suede ones seem a little more generous in size.Most of the reviews on here suggest the sizing on these runs a bit large and wide. Maybe mine are from a different batch, but mine were just a little shorter than expected. Plus, I am not a true wide, more likely slightly wide, but generally get wides for a little more room, a choice not available here so I had to get regular width. I found these just barely wearable, and am hoping they'll loosen with wear. A person with a real ""wide"" foot would not have luck with these.The blue suede is not a navy, its more like a royal blue, nice. The pale beige suede is very nice, close to nude.Pay attention when you get your shoes. Mine were jammed tightly into their boxes, and the heel of one left an impression mark on the top of the other, and I am hoping the suede will bounce back up now that it's unpacked.Overall these are not remarkable, just basic flats that won't last your lifetime but will go with a lot of your stuff.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REKMCXHF5WYMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPQIZXY#wasThisHelpful","REKMCXHF5WYMQ","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered these from a local department store that had them on sale, and I had a coupon too... and then I held my breath til they got here.My feet went ""ahhh"" as soon as I put them on.  I often sacrifice some comfort for style, so for me to notice a truly comfy shoe is not my norm.  Wore them all day, felt great. The padding is not thick or invasive, but it sure is soft and comfortable.I found the sizing to be pretty true. The length was exactly as expected. The width is a bit different - I have a somewhat wide foot and often buy wide just to be safe (if buying online) or for extra space.  In this shoe I am glad I got the wide, for sure. The only funny thing is that the ""wide"" was across the base of the toes, but did not seem to extend to the tip of the toes.  This resulted in a comfy fit for me, but the difference in width means the leather pulls slightly diagonally across the foot as I walk. Not a comfort issue, more of a momentary aesthetic thing.The toebox in these is not high, so if you have a big toe that curls upward or if you have high toe knuckles, I would steer clear. My one big toe is pressing up on the toebox and due to the softness of the leather it is slightly visible and likely going to wear on that spot.  Odds are good I'll be putting some sticky moleskin in there to try to prevent that wear. Again, not a comfort issue, but I like these shoes a lot and don't want to rub through or make a big dent in them over time.I got the off white and it's a great color because it is subtle, goes with a lot and isn't bright and loud. The color goes with the casual vibe of the shoe and the string trim. I can wear it with any color purse, including an off white one.There's a part of me shallowly wondering if these are a little dowdy, and thinking ""Hush Puppies? Do I wear Hush Puppies?"" To be honest, these feel so good, I'm kind of not caring.  And I hope Hush Puppies can keep the comfort going while coming up with even more contemporary shoes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NWUTVHUZX3FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RW70TM#wasThisHelpful","R2NWUTVHUZX3FT","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's scary to realize that not that long ago gay people in the US had few rights and suffered a lot of harassment, and had to live amazingly closeted lives. This documentary brings it home clearly by telling a cohesive narrative while weaving in firsthand accounts of living people and teaching us about one night when everyone had had enough.I wasn't alive then and you can bet the Stonewall wasn't mentioned in school. It should have been, as it is as important today as any civil rights event. Anyway, my point is that like me, you might not know a lot about that time period, and I was really glad to find this production that covered it in a very human way. Yes, it tells the Stonewall's story, but it excels at giving you the atmosphere of the times as well.It's funny too, to watch it in the context of today. There's one man, a purported expert on homosexuality, who claims to have tried it and realized it was not for him, but who advocated for gay acceptance anyway. At one point he talks about having enough mainstream acceptance of gays to allow them to have real relationships and not be driven underground.  He follows that up with a chuckle, saying something to the effect of ""After all, it's not like they want to get married, or adopt children."" What a time capsule! You begin to understand the circular logic of the times - how forcing relationships to occur ""in the dark"" brought about the very behavior that made outsiders despise many gay people, and how fear led to many misconceptions as well.A terrific story very well told. I appreciated it enough that when my first disc broke while popping it out of the box that I got another one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E27977JV3GPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q3SHWU#wasThisHelpful","R1E27977JV3GPD","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a bunch of these for friends overseas when my husband was making a trip and got one for myself too. These trim little bags boast beautiful colors and a nice finish.  No, not leather, but these are clearly fun bags, not high end bags, though they are well-made and nicely styled. The sizing is perfect so you can choose whether to make it work as a handbag or a tote.And one last heads up - the prices on these are all over the place varying at any given time, sometimes based on color. I happily paid about $18 for each of the six I got and thought it very fair but no way is it worth the $30 or more it sometimes goes for. It's a nice little well made vinyl bag and has no pretensions, and $20 is the top you should consider.

"I wanted to have one orange purse and was not willing to spend a lot since I'm not sure it'll see much use, so that's what's prompted this purchase. For $20, it didn't have to be love.It's not love, but it's okay. Overall, between the color and the studs, the bag has a little edge to it. The orange I got doesn't scream fake leather, and to the touch it's not bad, just maybe a tad rubbery. The things that give away the low-end craftsmanship are the lack of attention to detail... the studs are kind of big and not aligned perfectly.  And the trim around where the handles meet the bag?  It's not tiny metal beading like I thought. It actually looks like one half of a zipper encircling it as trim.  It's little zipper teeth. Maybe some would see that as a witty designer move, but to me it was kind of like ""What?""Anyhow, it's all right, it'll work for trips to the store and casual wear which is about what I expected, and I'm glad my expectations were no higher. It seems like a reasonably sturdy purse for everyday hauling, and the looks are passable.And Patzino?  You'd probably sell more items if you didn't plaster your name on most of your bags.

"This started as a 5 star review when I wrote it. After a month of using the second one I purchased, I need to revise my rating. Additional comments toward the end of this review.I like a structured purse, and this delivers, standing up even when empty. Yes, it's close to the LV Alma with Epi leather, so the leather is firm, sturdy and substantial.  It is close to the PM size, meaning in inches it's about 11 wide by 9 1/2 and 6 front to back.  That size of the designer-make with the shoulder strap would set you back about two grand.LV need not worry - they didn't lose a sale, as I'd never pay that for a purse, and people who really know the original won't be fooled.  There's no monogram on the exterior or the zipper handles, and this doesn't have the microfiber lining. Still, this purse stands on its own merits.If you have strong feelings about hardware color, look carefully at the pictures, as some come with silver, some with gold.  Mine came with gold which I normally don't like, but it is a soft gold, not blazing yellow, tasteful, and is also used on the zipper. The matching padlock (wrapped in clear plastic I'm going to leave on for scuff protection) comes on the handle loop but can be moved to the zipper if you plan to use it.  The key is inside the hanging leather key bell and mine worked fine. There was a bonus key fob that I'm going to throw away, as I don't need it, and it's got a fold mark on it, and it is only finished leather on one side, raw on the other, and my raw side has blotches on it. No biggie.  The bottom of the bag has two leather straps, each with two little feet on it to keep the bottom from wearing.The short handles are big enough to hand-carry or drape over your forearm, but won't go past your elbow. The extra shoulder strap comes inside the bag, and attaches to metal loops on the short handles.  The shoulder strap is about an inch wide, and has 6 holes and a buckle so you can choose your length.Because the leather has the wood grain embossing, it doesn't look like traditional leather with a natural grain, which is why some reviews question if it's real.  If you look closely, you can see some of the leather grain within the wood grain texturing. The strip at the bottom is patent leather. My purse had no strong smell, just a slight smell that did smell like leather to me.  I would have found it reassuring if the purse had come with an inner tag stating materials, country of origin and manufacturer, but mine had NO inner tag.  I choose the ""milky white"" color which is close to ivory, maybe a shade darker than the LV ivory, bordering on very light tan.The interior of my bag is a dark brown satiny fabric.  The one side has a small zipper pocket that would hold cards or small items.  The other side has two open pockets, one would hold a cell phone or a pack of smokes, the other is bigger.  The center portion is open, undivided.I wanted a purse that had class with an edge, and am very pleased. The color I got will be perfect for spring through summer and into early fall.  After that, yeah, I might be back for another bag in a different color.Added Dec. 5, 2014 - As planned, I again bought this bag in late August -this time in black- planning on using it for fall and winter.  After 1 month of light wear (I don't work outside the home, so this bag has only gone out maybe twice weekly for shopping) the handle has come off. It tore where the ring inserts for the shoulder strap. (The key bell had already ripped before the month was up.) As of today, my review is the second most helpful review on this item, probably because I spent a lot of time trying to describe it to assist others. I would hate to have to leave this review online as a much-seen warning to others. It's my intent to contact the seller and see if they will make this right.  If they do, I will add praise for their integrity and revise accordingly.Added January 13, 2014 - Amazing.  This is proof the system can work.With the Christmas buying rush over (most of my presents bought here on Amazon) I got back on dealing with the purse. This was sold directly by Amazon and not a third party seller, so I called Amazon and had the pleasure of dealing with an excellent Amazon rep named Thomas. He understood that it was frustrating to have a bag that was basically in new condition, though not recently bought, having sat on the shelf until it was the season to use black accessories. Because it was well past the 30 day return period, I couldn't get an exchange, but was given a small credit on future purchases. This was as much as the rep could do within his discretion. I appreciated the gesture, grudgingly understood the return policy. It was indeed past 30 days since purchase, but the purse was essentially new, so I was still a little rankled.When I received the credit, I was also sent a survey link. The first question asked is if you were satisfied. You are also asked to rate the rep (which I did highly because he was really good, not just because he made a concession, but his listening and phone skills and empathy were outstanding). The link asked how easy it was to deal with Amazon (I gave 5 stars), the rep's skills (5 stars) and the Amazon policy (3 stars).If you answer the question asking if you were satisfied with ""Yes"" you get a text box to add anything else. If you say ""No"" the screen says basically to please give Amazon another chance and contact them after completing the review.I hesitated because my rep Thomas had been very good and I did not want my lack of satisfaction to reflect badly on him... but on the other hand, I was still in possession of a new but broken purse, the sting slightly removed by a credit... so no, I wasn't really satisfied.The system then said ""May we call you?"" - I said yes, and my phone rang, and I had been sent to a department that essentially handles escalated issues.  Again, I had a fabulous rep, Robert, with excellent listening skills, empathy, ability to make judgement calls, but with a little more latitude. He heard me out, was totally understanding, and issued a full refund.I was very impressed.  I had had two excellent representatives with top notch skills AND because of the Amazon online system of asking about my satisfaction, I actually was finally completely satisfied.  At that point, I asked if I could give my positive feedback to a superior, and was passed along to one, with whom I shared my feedback about the reps, and the system working.  And she, Janet, was very good too. Said she would share my feedback with the direct superiors of Thomas and Robert. Happy to hear that everything worked, that the reps were good and I was happy. Who would've thought a purse breaking could show me how decent and professional Amazon can be?","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP5P25ZPRZOCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CN3EC1K#wasThisHelpful","RP5P25ZPRZOCS","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 stars. I got this shirt for my nephew at the suggestion of his mom. He was delighted with it as a big Phils fan, so that's to the good.  Also to the good is that the shirt seems true to size, though it feels very plasticky, artificial and potentially warm for the wearer.My biggest dislike of this item is the price. No way it's worth $45-50. Probably the cost is driven by licensing. It just seems stupid to spend this much on a shirt, particularly on a shirt meant for a youth who will likely outgrow it soon.

"Upfront, I should say we don't use this comb for fleas, but for daily grooming, so I can't comment on the flea-catching qualities of the comb.What I can say however, is that we have several cats and this comb is their favorite of many. It does an effective job of getting out loose, fine undercoat without making anybody squeal in pain, and leaves them all looking good.From a human standpoint, this comb is easier to use than many; it has an actual handle rather than teeth the whole length of the comb, so you have greater directional control. There's also a little divot to rest your thumb in, which surprisingly helps steer the comb well.We'd first hit on this comb at our vet's office, and she gave us hers.

"I need to stop trying BB creams and stick with one I already know works well. Instead I was at Walgreens feeling spendy and saw this.It was from L'Oreal, a decent brand, which has other products I have used and been satisfied with. How could I not try a tube of the light/medium? I snuck a little onto the back of my hand and it looked good, plus it was marked way down.While it wasn't a huge loss, I wish I hadn't bothered. If you want to know about L'Oreal BB creams, I'm your girl and this is your review.A true BB cream will give you ""glow"", minimize skin imperfections, and if good, can even take the place of your foundation. I had found all these assets in a different L'Oreal' product, their Skin Beautifier BB Cream, and thought perhaps their Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance version would be even better. Not even close.This stuff evolves on your skin. When I first put it on, it was alarming - very orangy and greasy-looking (though it was not greasy, just shiny). Maybe 15 minutes later it had settled down with less shine, but a few hours later (maybe 3) it was just gone. Zero tint, zero coverage. I know not to expect major coverage from a BB cream, but this was ridiculous. Nothing was left.As for the possibility of using it as a semi-foundation... nope. I tried applying a second coat in case more was required for results or staying power, but still nada. It is not buildable and a heavier coating doesn't last longer or look better.I have also tried the L'Oreal Paris Youth Code BB Cream Illuminator (Medium) and it was as useless as this Age Perfect one, except the Youth Code one did not disappear, it just never appeared, period. Nothing. A glorified colored sunscreen calling itself a BB cream because BB creams are hot right now.The other, superior Skin Beautifier BB Cream (now also being called ""Studio Secrets"") leaves my skin tone even with a subtle pearly finish, minimizes pores, and makes my face look flawless. This is the one that works for me and from which I should not stray. It's light, non-greasy, gives no greasy appearance, provides some light coverage and looks natural.If you are experimenting with BB Creams and not looking to fork out a wad of cash for a premium one, I'd suggest trying the L'Oreal Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream. You might even try the Maybelline (which was ok but too shiny for my taste). But don't let this Age Perfect Instant Radiance product be your only try of BB creams because there's better stuff out there, honest.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FMNANG8JFCH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXRBAEA#wasThisHelpful","R2FMNANG8JFCH4","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to make silver jewelry but still love buying it. I learned a bit about craftsmanship, though not about stones, so that's the way I look at this ring.This is a very pretty ring on a glance. My stone's a bit darker than it appears on the picture here, but deep and lovely. If you order this ring and know yourself to be between sizes, consider going down. I have a lot of rings all the same size, and this one is a tiny bit more generous.I'd been having difficulty finding an amethyst ring that had a larger stone that wasn't gaudy, and this one nailed it for me. The stone is not quite half an inch long, and a bit less wide than that. I have larger hands, wear a 9. It shows up, but doesn't scream. There's a ton of tiny clear cz's circling the stone and trailing down each y-shaped side. They're actually a little more than I was looking for but they are not too much.The center stone could have been set lower but I'm fine with the larger open bottom. The stone rises above the ring on a raised bezel, the rationale probably being to let in light to make the center stone sparkle more. The product picture does not give a sense of this, so please know the bezel lifts the top of the stone about 3/8 of an inch above the finger. It would not have stopped me from buying it in person. (If you'd like to get an idea, see the pictures I have uploaded.)My ring came with two flaws, and I am going to accept them because I don't want to mess around with sending it back for another. One flaw is a few tiny chips in the points of the cuts of the stone which was not very well cut. You would have to look for them. If you do, you will see that the edges of some cuts are a tad rough. The flat surface of the stone, which you would expect to have a perfect ovalled hexagon or octagon shape is irregular too. (See the second uploaded photo to see this irregular shape of the flat top. I was unable to get enough detail to show the tiny chips.)The other flaw is harder to describe, but here goes - probably to let in more light, on each side of the raised bezel holding the stone, there is a machine-made cutout in the shape of an inverted triangle. (It is not visible on the product picture, but is somewhat visible in my uploaded pictures.) On my ring, on one side there is indeed the inverted triangle, cleanly punched, and on the other side is a gloppy, mis-shapen hole. It is not observable to the casual viewer, but it's a bummer. Someone should have caught this while packaging it. Probably it's not on every ring, but just saying- inspect yours carefully.  The description says this ring is made of sterling and I do not doubt that, but I swear it looks like it was dipped in something or coated with something, so I have concern that due to the rough shape of the cutout this possible coating may not cling and hold up as well as the rest of the ring.I'd hoped to make this an everyday ring but don't think I will. I'm concerned for the tiny cz's potentially falling out, and the wear on the rough cutout. Since it arrived chipped, it seems the stone won't take much knocking around either. I'll probably play it safe and keep this ring for occasional wear. However, I have wanted an amethyst ring for some time to go with some earrings, so in that respect I'm satisfied. If you are looking for a fun ring that's pretty and are not picky on details, you may like this very much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32VF7TF24MF6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FO2EEQA#wasThisHelpful","R32VF7TF24MF6I","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Out of the box, I adore this ring. As it is gold vermeil, I don't know how it's going to wear over time, and I might come back to tell about that later, but for now, I could not be happier.My husband isn't from this country, and didn't know about the engagement ring custom, and frankly, I didn't care much about it myself because I was just delighted to know I'd have him the rest of my life. I also didn't want to make him wade through the whole diamond industry and the ethics questions. As time has gone on though, I (perhaps shallowly) felt the lack of an engagement ring when dressed up. There I am with bracelets, good earrings, something nice on my right hand, and then my plain left hand with just a band. It felt like the lack of balance was actually calling attention to rather unadorned left hand. I did not want to take off my wedding band just to put something dressy on, so the only answer I could come up with was to get myself an engagement style ring to wear with my wedding band.What can 2.75 carats look like? Carats is weight, not size. I don't know diamonds, and the product description didn't fully answer my concern, which basically was ""Is this going to be too blingy, or too small?"" I have larger hands and wear a size 9, so anything too conservative would look tiny, but I didn't want to look cheesy either. I wanted something not too large that it looked fake but enough to show up. So if you are wondering, as I was, ""How big is that CZ stone?"" the answer is ""About a 1/4 inch across."" That's about the diameter of a cigarette, a teensy bigger. On my size 9 finger, that means that of the part of my finger that is visible, the stone covers about 1/3.It's not a flat CZ either, it's about as high as it is across, so it stands up on your finger a bit. The setting is relatively open to let in the light, with just four simple prongs to hold the stone. It's like a Tiffany setting only four prongs instead of six, designed to put the diamond front and center. No frou-frou.  No busy bezel or added baguettes.  It's classic, clean, and timeless.Yes, it sparkles.  In natural light you get a very few light pinks and blues, not a cold white that screams ""glass"" but not quite the greyish reflective light you get off a real diamond.The nice coincidence: The gold vermeil is exactly the same shade of gold as my (real gold) wedding band (and not as yellow as it appears in the product photo). Also cool - it is the exact same band width. They couldn't look more like they were meant to be together.Gaudy? I don't think so, just enough to be noticed I think. If you want to compare it to ""celebrity"" stuff, don't bother, it's too small for that fight. But if you want to see what carat variations are out there among the wealthy go to the Hollywood Reporter site and look for Dec. 17th, 2011 - ""How Britney Spears' 3.5-Carat Engagement Ring Stacks Up To Beyonce, Katy Perry, Mariah Carey, and Christina Aguilera's"". Brit's 3.5 carats was considered very conservative. On Nov. 11, 2013, People magazine had an item in their ""Scoop"" section stating Lauren Conrad's engagement ring was 1.5 carats, Katie Couric's 2, Kaley Cuoco's 2.5, Hayden Panetiere's 6, Ciara's 15 and Kim Kardashian's 15.And this ring for sale here is 2.75 carats. Works for me.I ordered this ring from Eve's Addiction on November 20, and it got to me by the 23rd, so that was prompt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V25W5CH0FWOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009CJWY5O#wasThisHelpful","R3V25W5CH0FWOY","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deceptively generous - this bag looks relatively small due to its shape, but it is deep. I recently traveled with it and could get my iPad in there along with a lot of other goodies (makeup bag, 3 pairs of glasses, a paperback, etc) and still zip it nicely.Appearance-wise, I like a structured bag that can stand up on its own, but hate a boxy profile- this bag answered those issues by being semi-cylindrical and firm. The faux croc is decent with no shininess that screams fake. The grey I got has enough shading in color to go with various grey shoes and boots I own. Too often, Relic's bags have the brand name or a huge ""R"" plastered all over them, but this one has only tiny ""R"" marks on the rivets at the bottom of the handles where they attach to the bag, and the name itself is on the thin side of the buckles so you have to look for it. I was really glad, because so often I like Relic stuff but reject it for the over-branding.Functionally, there are two inner pockets, both on interior walls, one zips open/shut, the other might hold a small phone and is an open pouch. There is also one small exterior pocket between the handles. Only the inner zippered pocket has any size to it, but all will allow you to segregate small stuff that could get lost at the bottom of a bag. The liner in mine is a rich brown satin-finish fabric with a repeating ""R"" insignia that is not overwhelming.The handle drop from the top of the handles to the top of the bag is about 9 1/2 inches. I have a pretty big upper arm and had no issues with having to squeeze it on, even over a heavy coat.I had a department store coupon plus found this on sale and jumped on it, because I'd been admiring it from afar for a few weeks. Really glad to have gotten it for the looks, function and ability to match with a lot of stuff. Definitely recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1135QCHOZY5KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FHYN53I#wasThisHelpful","R1135QCHOZY5KR","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our family has been trying different sweeteners, and this was one in our trials.  We liked it and will repurchase.As much as we have liked Splenda powder, it comes along with dextrose and maltodextrin - the actual sweet stuff you want - sucralose - is the last ingredient, and we thought we could do without the filler, except for some baking.These tablets have a base of plant cellulose to carry the stevia, so unlike bulk stevia powders there's hardly any filler.  We make a lot of big pitchers of cold drinks for the fridge, and this stuff dissolves nicely with a little stirring, and even faster in hot drinks.  It does leave a tiny residue at the bottom but it's harmless and not distasteful.The tablets are about the diameter of a standard aspirin and maybe half as thick.  They are not scored, but break easily if you want to scale up or down.  Straight stevia is intense and can leave an aftertaste, but we had no issues like that and liked ""the sweet"" very much.  If you're looking to get out of the bulky Splenda or Nutrasweet rut, these are very worth a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A4CWLZGW8EV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004F7UQBM#wasThisHelpful","R3A4CWLZGW8EV1","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many years ago, I purchased cheap parsley tablets that did an amazing job of neutralizing body odors from your pits to your tush.  Working out, hot days, I always smelled great.  I'd been advised the effect was from the chlorophyll in the parsley, and is why parsley is offered with meals as well- to neutralize breath odor.With that in mind, I bought these, and while chlorophyll might do other great things, it did not do what I was looking for.  It also turned my, uh, by-products a scary green.  I'm finishing this bottle to not waste it, but have since gotten true parsley caplets... and those aren't working either, so the search continues.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KA2Q5TX4UD87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00014ECG8#wasThisHelpful","R1KA2Q5TX4UD87","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're like me, you've been around the block on conditioners for curly hair.  Frankly, every time I have found a good one, it disappears after a few years or switches the formula.  I'm hoping this one isn't on the way out too because I can't easily find it in stores now... don't know if that's a manufacturing issue or if it's just that so many people are wearing their hair straight right now that the demand isn't there so stores aren't stocking.Whatever, this conditioner smells nice without lingering, is silky so you can run your fingers through your hair to detangle in the shower, and it leaves my curls shiny and defined.  (The shampoo is good too, but I've found I can use almost any shampoo as long as I chase it with this conditioner.)  There's no ""weigh down"" effect either.A few years ago Pantene switched their curly conditioner formula and thus began my latest replacement search, and I was thrilled to find this product worked every bit as well for less money.  And speaking of money, I am quite sure this product retails for less than $3 for an 12.6 oz bottle, and I hope to see fairer pricing on this on Amazon soon - better than what I'm paying for my six pack today, about $4/bottle.

"There's a lot of mixed reviews on here, many from about 2010-11 bemoaning receipt of a ""fake"" curler.  That problem seems to be past now going by most recent reviews.My curler came from vendor ""effective shop japan"" and I'd say I got the real deal.  The curler itself was an insane $4 and change, while the shipping brought the total up to $21.  It arrived well packaged- the small inner box was packed in another heavier cardboard box with newspaper for padding.  The newspaper was in Japanese, and the mailing stickers on the box indicated shipment from Japan.The white inner box was stylish and looked authentic.  The bag inside held the curler, and another tiny ziplock bag with an extra replacement black silicone pad.  Directions for use were on the inner box, along with a few tips.  The silver curler had an authentic looking Shu Uemura engraving on it and seemed tight and well sprung.  The replacement pad was similarly stamped.Straight to the mirror I went.  I have very fine lashes on deep-set eyes.  In the past my problem with curlers was that they were hard to get in deep and close enough to grasp the lashes at the base, and even when maneuvering as best as possible, at least three attempts per eye were needed to get all the lashes (not just the majority at the center) by doing center, inner, and then outer lashes.This baby was a different story.  It must be how the product is angled away from the face, and the curve of the pad.  I could get the curler right in close to the base of my lashes, and I didn't need to make multiple attempts to get it lined up - before squeezing down, I could see ALL my lashes sticking through the curler.  One gentle, sustained squeeze later, ALL my lashes were curled from corner to corner.  Beautiful!  The other eye went as well.  I did not need to do as suggested, by pulling back and doing a second squeeze at the middle of the lashes, and another at the tips, because one good line up did enough, and very well.One funny bonus... I had stopped using curlers because they were such a hassle, and now that I have one that works simply, and I use it regularly, I can actually SEE better!  I had not realized how much my drooping lashes had been cutting into my field of view.I had really wondered if I was buying into a myth by paying $20 for an eyelash curler that might be got at a drugstore for far less, but I am wondering no more.  Very glad I took a chance and shelled out for this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D3FB8TT8DXT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VSG1PO#wasThisHelpful","R1D3FB8TT8DXT8","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are other reviews here that say it helped such kitties.Mine are healthy and normal and have decent appetites.  None of our four liked this stuff, which was a bummer because they all get intermittent hairball problems and could use the pumpkin.  I gave this food a 3 star rating because it could be a fine food in its own right, but it was not well received in our house.The chicken is finely stringy and the broth is very watery.  Aesthetics aside, nobody went for it, not even our gravy-lapping monster.  It seemed like they were not tempted to give it a try (after 6 introductions of it), and I wonder if this smells funny to them, because no one was even curious.We're moving on now to the BFF tuna and pumpkin, and will see if that works for our hairball-prone clan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4RXQ2Z1T1P2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HGM2M6#wasThisHelpful","R2F4RXQ2Z1T1P2","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ripped through this book very fast because it was compelling and well-written.  Harriet (nee Tendler) Bronson has written about her own life, as well as coming to grips with a failing marriage.  Having bought into the ""what's good for hubby is good for me"" mentality of her time, she puts her career on hold to help build his... only to find that ""her turn"", as had been agreed upon, never comes, due to her detection of Charlie's infidelity and the end of their marriage.The lady has spunk and spirit, and clearly she wasn't out for revenge.  She talks about her larger life, not dwelling on her hurt or anger.  You enjoy being with her as she gathers her strength to build a new life.  Harriet's a good storyteller, and shrewd observer of human behavior.You appreciate her perspective as well; she was a nice Jewish girl from Philadelphia who took a chance on an evil-looking, monosyllabic guy from the coal regions going to acting school on the GI bill, able to see through his bluntness to the charm and thoughtfulness within.  She alienates much of her family by her choice, moves with him to California, has two children with him, and focuses on helping him hit the big time... only to find out he's begun an affair with Jill Ireland, the then-wife of David McCallum.  Ireland and Bronson would later marry.  Still, Harriet's able to finally absorb and understand what happened, and move on brilliantly.As a sidenote, I feel compelled to mention that I've read and loved both books by Jill Ireland that focus on her battle with cancer and on her family.  Jill, like Harriet, learned to take negatives and make them into learning experiences.  The funny thing is, I have almost no interest in Bronson himself, and just find he had excellent taste in choosing wives who were smart, strong and reflective.  When you finish this book, you want to meet Harriet for coffee and tell her ""well done"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KE337BL9JPLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982884702#wasThisHelpful","R1KE337BL9JPLH","A3UHFQT4E3R2D3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UHFQT4E3R2D3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I absolutely love to cook. I have always wanted a Convection Oven and so a few weeks ago I started shopping around. When I came across this Homeleader K43-001 Convection Oven, I knew it was the one I wanted. I just really loved the look of it. I was so excited when it finally arrived. I finally have my own Convection Oven.I could not wait to try it out. I had it unpackaged and sat up to use in just a few minutes. Its much easier to get sat up than you would think. This Convection Oven comes with the large glass base and cook top. It also comes with 2 wire shelf racks that you can cook on. As well as a pair of metal tongs that you can use to lift the racks out when they are hot. The power cord is detachable for safe cleaning. This Convection Oven is also quite easy to clean too.Over the past week or so I have used my new Convection Oven several times. I have cooked everything from breakfast to desserts in it. Its just so much for convenient to use than a regular oven or microwave. Not only that but I swear food just tastes better cooked in my new Convection Oven. One thing I love about it most is that it has a timer. You can just switch the timer over to the time you need to cook. It will automatically turn off once the timer runs out.I absolutely love my new Homeleader Convection Oven. It is exactly what I wanted and more. Its easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store.

"Halloween is such a fun holiday and I just love decorating. I came across these adorable Halloween Bat Paper Lanterns and just had to have one. The only issue that I had was making up my mind which one I wanted to order. I was so excited waiting for it to arrive. I knew it was going to be the perfect addition to the decorations we already had. These lanterns do light up. They take (2) AAA batteries.When my lantern arrived, I was instantly pleased. It was just so much cuter in person than it is in photos. It actually was a bit bigger than I had anticipated as well. Which by no means was a bad thing.

"Keeping my furbaby Dahlia's water bowl full is a task. I decided I wanted to try one of these neat little Automatic Dog Feeder Bottles out with her. I couldn't wait for it to get here so she could try it out. It comes with the feeder bottle and the dispenser bowl. I was a little nervous that it may leak, but it doesn't it all.To fill up the Automatic Feeder Dispenser is pretty simple. You just lift out the bottle, fill it with water or food. I personally use mine for water because for some reason we just struggled with a plain bowl. She would either knock it over, or my kids would. This dispenser is just perfect for why I wanted it. I fill it up for her once in the morning and once in the evening.  By doing it that way, she has water all day and night.I am really happy that I was introduced to this Automatic Feeder/Dispenser. Its a good quality little feeder for a great price. It isn't big or bulky so it doesn't take up very much space. It sits perfectly by her food bowl. The first few times that my dog used it, it would surprise her when the water would bubble and dispense. Now that she has been using it for about a week, it doesn't phase her.

"These Halloween Goofy Droopy Eyeball Glasses have been so fun for my daughter. She is only 7 years old and has absolutely had a blast with them. For no more than they cost, they really are fun little glasses. What I like most about them is that they are safe for smaller kids. There are any small parts or anything that could be a choking hazard.These glasses are not only fun for children,  but can also be worn by adults. My husband owns a Flooring Business and just had to wear them to work one day to aggrivate his employees. These little glasses aren't anything fancy but they are a lot of fun.

"My daughter loves popsicles. I came across these awesome Nutrawin Popsicle Molds with a bonus Lego Mold and I instantly wanted them for her. My mind just filled up with ideas for different popsicles and snacks that can be made with them. Especially for the Lego Mold, the fun ideas are almost endless. I was so excited once they finally arrived.Of course as soon as my 7-year old spotted them, she was ready for us to test them out. We decided we wanted to try to make our own smoothie popsicles. So I took some yogurt, blackberries, strawberries, bananas,  & orange juice. We blended it up and we poured it into the popsicle molds. We took an empty shoe box and cut holes in it as a popsicle stand. Let them freeze for a few hours and voila. We had yummy smoothie pops. These popsicle molds have the lids attached so there is no worry with losing the lids. They are also easy for my little girl to squeeze out.The bonus Lego Mold is really neat too. It can be used for all kinds of recipes and ideas also. My daughter and I have been saving her broken crayons for a while now. We are going to use our new Lego Mold to make her some new crayons. Other ideas for it could be jello, gummies, chocolate, etc.These popsicle molds are BPA Free which I really love. I try to protect my daughter from things containing harmful chemicals like that. They are also FDA Approved. As a Mommy those things are important to me. These Nutrawin Popsicle Molds are good quality popsicle molds that are made to last.

The Stretch Guide has lots of different stretches for joint pain, muscle aches, and headaches all. It really has a lot of helpful stretches and information to help.I was so excited to try out the Back To Normal Arnica Cream. It comes in a very cute little box that folds into a cute flower.

You place it onto the skin (make sure you have cleaned the area with rubbing alcohol), place a moistened paper towel over the tattoo for about a minute. Then very carefully peel the paper away and voila! There you go. My daughter and I both put one on a week ago. I just took mine off today. It could have really stayed on for a few more days.

"BPA free can - yay!  I really like these oysters.  They are good with cheese and crackers to serve before dinner or for a snack.  I am always trying to put more muscle on my body and keeping adequate protein in my diet is essential.  These help me with that as they have 11g of protein per can..  They are smoked oysters after all so they are quite smelly.  Otherwise I'd put them in my gym bag for a snack.  I'd probably drive everybody out of the gym.  Same problem for sardines.

"Physician's Formula is the only mascara product I've used that doesn't cause my eyes to burn.  It also doesn't flake, and as a contact lens wearer I really appreciate that.  The brush also works for me as I like to use the tip to do each bottom lash individually.  It usually doesn't come out all clumpy and on the few occasions where it does I just dab it on a tissue.  I get a nice clean application every time.  Another thing I like is that is lasts all day until I take it off.  Then it comes off easily without breaking my lashes.

"12 shorts for $24.99 is a great buy.  The product is made in Bangladesh.  I found they fit very snug and if I had the shape of a young girl versus a woman, they would have been a keeper.  I will order the XL to wear as pajama bottoms, but I won't be going out in them.  Other reviewers noted the crotch was just a cross seam.  When I tried them on the crotch seam didn't bother me.  The waist elastic is nice as it isn't too wide to roll, isn't too thin to be cutting or uncomfortable, it's just right.  The colors are bright.  I don't know how colorfast they are in washing or if they shrink even on a low dryer setting.  When I get my next set, if they fade or shrink I'll edit this review.Update:Size: I received my XL order and they are just a little bit larger than the L.  Enough for comfort.  Here are some comparison sizes to give you an idea of what size I wear and that this product required me to buy an XL.  I wear a women's medium, can on occasion wear a juniors size 10 if cut generously, and usually wear a medium in Nike shorts, size 10 Lucky brand jeans, and Levis.Color/Shrinkage:  Anyway, I washed them and the brilliant colors stayed bright with no signs of fading.  I washed the dark colors separately from the light so was able to match the finished size against the unwashed for shrinkage.  I matched 6 and found they were all a bit different in size regardless of having been washed or not.  So I'm uncertain if I had shrinkage.  At least there isn't a dramatic difference.  I washed them on cold wash/cold rinse and dried them in an electric dryer set on the ""low/less dry"" setting selected.  So when finished they were just slightly damp.

The clear plastic remains quite clear with no unsightly scratches.  Very happy with this cover!I have this same case in black on my Note 3.

"Gift Wrapped started with such a bang out of the gate… Brinn has no holiday plans after she caught her boyfriend cheating on her. She just doesn’t feel like driving back home to be with her family this year after working late on Christmas Eve. Then in walks Davis our Christmas hating hero looking for a last minute gift and maybe a hot night with the woman behind the counter.What starts out as a one night fling slowly turned into more of a F buddy system with both having growing feelings for each other. The story was hot from the start with likeable characters of both the hero and heroine…  too bad that didn’t stick around for the hero. The heroine is a very easy character to connect with and even easier to love. She is feisty, funny, up for some hot sexy times, and extremely relatable. All and all the author really made you love her which is a giant part of the problem. Give me a heroine I love, but please don’t give me a hero I think is undeserving.Davis wasn’t as quick to fall for Brinn as I was. Did he fall balls deep into her snatch? Of course he did and that was the only falling he wanted to do with her which he did make clear.. but it still hurt. His quick reminders of what he wanted from her really started nicking at my like for him. The author even gave us a moment where we thought he did something great, but it was just an accident. There was time and time again where the hero could have made a great play and really won me back, but again he falls short of my liking.The good, the bad, and the ugly …. The good, the sex was outstanding and I found the heroine made me laugh out loud quite a few times. Plus she did have a backbone and chose herself when I really felt like she should. The bad, missable moments when the author could have made this sucker an outstanding Christmas book! The ugly, by the time the hero got his head out of his butt I was gone. Was his turn around sweet with a sweeter happily ever after? Yes, it really was, but as a reader the author lost me a few chapters before the end so I just didn’t care that much. I was happy Brinn got what she wanted I just still had a bitter taste in my mouth. Plus I REALLY wanted to know if he was banging that neighbor when these two were apart for those few months. Oh well…. Sometimes the little things just really matter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WM64C3G6DJPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PNSX10U#wasThisHelpful","R1WM64C3G6DJPW","A36WJCEZEJMA0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36WJCEZEJMA0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deadly Fallout is the tenth book in the Red Stone Security series. While I have read them all and really enjoy them on audio (audio is great for romance suspense) you don’t have to read the whole series and I promise you won’t be lost. While the heroine is in the previous books it’s nothing that will leave you feeling out of the loop. The author does a great job on refreshing readers without being redundant so the newbies aren’t lost.I was excited that this was Dr. Zoe Hansen’s book. We have gotten little tastes of her in the past being one of the security firms agent’s sister and she has spunk plus she’s a hot little doc to top it off. Nothing like a strong female lead to kick off a story, but there is always one thing that can even shake the strongest of strong… a deadly good stalker who has already made one really good attempt at getting his hands on you.Zoe made changes in her life to protect herself but tries to keep it low profile. She knows her brother would lose his s*** if he found out about the attack and may even try to kill the man who came at her. Everything seems fine until Zoe’s stalker shows back up in her life and all hell breaks loss.""He was going to slide into her soon, but first he desperately wanted to taste her release on his tongue. The need was damn near primal. He wanted to see her completely undone because of him, to see her lose control.""This Red Stone Security addition is a lot like the rest. While it’s not my favorite in the series (Breaking Her Rules) it gave me what I wanted: suspense that actually might be the best in the series so far, an alpha hero who falls hard and fast for my heroine, and a heroine who isn’t too stupid to live. Hey! That last one is extremely important in a suspense romance. It has a great mix of everything you could really want in a fast paced suspense and kept me wanting more from the Red Stone Security series…. As always I can’t wait for the next in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33O8V1RQH2BU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZ47LQS#wasThisHelpful","R33O8V1RQH2BU6","A36WJCEZEJMA0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36WJCEZEJMA0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one was a total random buy on Amazon... what can I say? With a cover like that and the word obsession in the title I was sold. Plus, it looks to be a new author (unless this is a pen name) so I jumped right in!Alex Hanas was not happy when he found out his father was marrying. He had been widowed for years and he never thought his father would want to walk down the aisle again. On top of that, he's sure his step-mother-to-be is probably just after their money. He wants nothing to do with her or her chubby little daughter, Elynn. Like most arrogant billionaires Alex is completely wrong about his new mother and maybe her daughter Elynn isn't so chubby after all... but under the age of eighteen she is.Alex starts to notice Elynn more and more at forced family events and his feelings for the smart, nerdy, baggy wearing clothing girl start to change. She starts to catch his eye and he even starts to like coming to family functions to get time with her. The problem? She's not really legal with their 10 year age gap plus Elynn has some problems. She once had a boy who was obsessed with her and beat her when she didn't return the feeling. While she wasn't raped her trust in men was gone causing her to be skittish and Alex knew that.After Elynn's eighteenth birthday and Alex's mad dash to make the event, he knew he was in love, but had to wait for her. He needed to give her time to grow, maybe even have a few relationships and get some of her trust back with the opposite sex. Alex even bought a ring knowing one day he would marry her. All this is really sweet and I ate a lot of this up... my problem was Alex went on with life even still banging starlets and models knowing he was in love with Elynn. What did help some of this blow for me was Elynn wasn't pinning for Alex having to see his sexcapades in the paper. I will also give Alex SOME credit that once Elynn turned eighteen he really toned it down only having maybe one partner a year and for only a few weeks at best.Even with that knowledge it didn't sit well for me. I was still angry that he was in love with her... bought her a ring and was nailing other women. It really bugged me and I'm sad to say it messed with the sweet little love story that was going on here. A lot of the story was boring, but a sweet boring. Not a lot happened but one could enjoy the sex and the liteness to it all but because of Alex's past it really kind of shot the softness to with his past.I just felt like this could have been so much better if that wasn't hanging over the love story. Boys will be boys doesn't work for me.... She went through something hard and needed time to grow and him not be able to keep it locked up showed some of his character to me.If you wouldn't have this hang up like me then this is an ok read. You have a heroine with some depth and a hero who is pretty smitten. I think there were some key things the author could have done to make me love the hero more such as putting us in his point of view more (I became bored when in Elynn's) Maybe if I had a better understanding and he had been more obsessed I could have loved him. I will say the sex scenes were sweet and realistic and I even giggled during the de-virgining. While they were sweet they were by no means hot or matched the cover and the author tried to bring in a smidge of bdsm which just sat there kind of oddly. With that all said I would try another book by the author but only if the hero doesn't know the heroine before so I don't have to risk him not keeping it locked up... but I will say that once he did know he was making his move on Elynn he was never with anyone else nor do I believe he would be.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KNZ0PNLBZV69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSH22ZA#wasThisHelpful","R2KNZ0PNLBZV69","A36WJCEZEJMA0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36WJCEZEJMA0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Cynthia Eden book kind of snuck up on me and just popped up one day. I track most of her books because I’m a pretty big fan. Watch Me is a start to a new series, Dark Obsession, which I think hit the spot oh so nicely and set up for a great new series.Chance Valentine’s (god I love that name) new job is the one woman he has been trying to stay away from, Gwen Hawthorne. While he has been hired to keep an eye on her, watching her will be an easy task because keeping his eyes off her is the last thing he wants to do. Chance has worked for Gwen’s father for years, but after a night of getting too close with Gwen, Chance decided it was best he leave and start his own bodyguard firm. When Gwen’s life is put on the line her father reaches out to Chance knowing he is the one man Gwen will let close enough to keep her safe.Second chance romance? ... kind of ...kind of not. See, while they have known each other for years their attraction didn’t really start to  blossom until the end as Gwen got older. They were spending a lot of time together and things just seemed to grow. They felt comfortable around each other and both wanted more. But Chance of course, like most alpha war heroes, thought he wasn’t good enough and hooking up with the boss’s daughter wasn’t a great idea for his career. But once she was gone from his life and he didn’t even get to catch a glimpse of her at work it really hit him hard how much he missed her.I think what really made me love this one was that Gwen was the one who tried to move on. She went out and started dating and even got a boyfriend. It’s so typical that normally it’s the man who goes out and bangs all these chicks while out heroine is sitting at home crying into her ice cream with her girlfriends. I loved watching our alpha hero having to get a good look at what he let go and work at making her his own for good. It was sweet, sexy and filled with lots of alpha male goodness.As most Eden books, this one packed a good punch of suspense that kept me guessing the whole time. I was never quite sure who Gwen’s stalker was even when she put us into the villain’s point of view. We also got to meet Chance’s teammates and I believe the heroine of the next book and I already love her. I can’t wait to see where the series goes, but I’ll have my one-click finger ready for the next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9PIBD69YANLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKVX37U#wasThisHelpful","R9PIBD69YANLG","A36WJCEZEJMA0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36WJCEZEJMA0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve always had a sweet little crush on author Aurora Rose Reynolds and it started with her debut novel ‘Until November.’ Her books are always lite, sexy, and leave me with a giant smile pasted on my face. When I heard she had a new one coming out that was the dirtiest thing she has published so far I was so excited I downloaded it the same day and well…. it gave ‘Until November’ one hell of a run for its money.""I wanted to consume her. I wanted to brand her. The need to own her, possess her, was almost crippling.""Nolan knows the minute he lays his eyes on Chloe through a bakery window that she will be his no matter what. There is no stopping this alpha male from getting what he wants and having it in all ways. When I say no stopping him I’m not joking… this is insta-love with “I’m going to plant my baby inside you so that you are branded by me and can’t get away.” Guys, it’s a little over the top in author Jordan Silver fashion, but I loved EVERY single second of this book. While like I said the book hero has a Jordan Silver feel, it’s done with a better writing style and a more developed story.There are two things that really kept the story going… one of course is the smutty sex. Hands down the best the author has written to date. I highlighted so much of my Kindle I could give you quotes for days that made me cream myself… and two was the little bit of suspense. With an alpha like Nolan it can be hard to keep a story up to pace because he’s so balls deep you know he will have the heroine so there is no fall to love over time. We’re there BAM page one. A little bit of suspense can really give this story flow and it did. I just think the final build to the suspense could have landed a little harder, but it really didn’t matter.I love these kinds of stories if they can be done right and not bore me and the author did it well and I never felt like we dragged. We got to meet the key players who I think will be head lining the future books and I can’t wait to get my hands on them. If you’re looking for an extra smutty quickie and an over the top alpha trying to breed your virgin heroine…. look no further. This perfectly dirty book lands a nice little spot on my re-read shelf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P0XG9VSCMI18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QW6JBME#wasThisHelpful","R3P0XG9VSCMI18","A36WJCEZEJMA0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36WJCEZEJMA0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only picked this one up because I thought the series had potential after I read 'His'.  With a little more effort I felt like the author could really do something with it, so I had pre-ordered this one. I’m sad to say not much has changed, and I was still left feeling that the author didn't flush this couple out just like with the first. When you are dealing with something so dark and messed up you really need to pull it back around and leave the reader in a better, more okay place. I won’t be reading anymore in the series. I think I need more obsession from my heroes when they are this messed up in the head, so I know they would never truly hurt my heroine. I mean she even thought he was going to kill her like 87% into the book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EFA6YHRRBNGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYUN3QA#wasThisHelpful","R3EFA6YHRRBNGF","A36WJCEZEJMA0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36WJCEZEJMA0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was hesitant to read this one because, well I tend to find tattoo artist fall in with the motorcycle and rockstar themed books… you know, manwhores who sleep with everything. These types of books tend to make me mad. While our hero, Payne, is a manwhore that title goes straight out the door when Becks Delgado comes storming into his office. Little does Becks know, she just fell right into Payne’s trap.Becks is an up and coming artist and Payne not only wants her for himself, but he also wants all of her future work to be his. One of my favorite things about Payne is his obsession for Becks. It’s endearing to watch him try to hide it… yes I said hide. It’s refreshing to have someone try and hide it instead of run from it. He wants her so he will have her and nothing will stand in the way.“You’re beautiful. My eyes can’t get enough of you. My hands can’t feel enough of you. I can’t bury myself inside of you deeply enough. But none of that will stop me from trying. And trying. And trying.”What Becks doesn’t know is Payne has met her before on the night that changed her life forever. Over the years Payne had kept tabs on her and got closer and closer like a moth to the flame until his need is so great he takes steps to pull her into his world. What Payne doesn’t know is that Becks lived in hell and self-misery after that fateful night four years ago.Becks was an easy heroine to love. In fact, both the hero and heroine are but Becks just takes your heart. She’s been through a lot and truly believes no one could ever want her, well at least for an extended period of time. While she is confident in some parts of her life and even smug about it there are other parts she isn’t. Her struggles with her self-importance are real, heartbreaking, and completely understandable. I tend to shy away from heroines who can beat themselves down, but the author did a wonderful job of making me get her and understand why she does and thinks some of the things she does. I never once got frustrated with her when she would push Payne away because I got it… the author made me love her.Very early on I caught on to where the plot was going and what I thought would be the climax of the story; Becks finding out Payne was there on the night of her accident, but while I could see where the story was going (and I’m sure you will think the same) it didn’t go along like I thought it would, which was great. It was more adult and the author once again showed me how incredible Becks really was.I know I gushed a lot about the book so you’re probably wondering why the 4 stars…. While I loved it and can’t wait for the next in the series, I still felt like there was a little something missing. I could tell Payne was pretty done in early on, but I think I wanted that obsession to burst through more. A lot of it did during the sex scenes, which were nice and smutty, but I wanted it in words. He does give us some great lines. No denying that but I just needed a little extra… I wanted her to know how much he was obsessed because well, like I said the author made me love her and I wanted her to have everything. I’m really looking forward to the next in the series about Payne’s assistant and the author now has my attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R21NZ2KW0Z74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OD939XE#wasThisHelpful","R2R21NZ2KW0Z74","A36WJCEZEJMA0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36WJCEZEJMA0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‘Rule’s Addiction’ is the third book in the House of Rule series and by far my favorite in the series so far. While I read the first ‘Rule’s Obsession’ and really enjoyed it (4 stars) I ended up skipping the second ‘Rule’s Property’ because the reviews didn’t fair too well. Each book can be read as a standalone so feel free to jump right into this one… get ready because this review is about to be a gush-fest.Garrett Rule has wanted Maria Alvarez since the moment he heard her voice on a telephone call. Want isn’t even a strong enough word for the feelings Garrett has for Maria. It’s all-consuming from page one of the book and I ate up Every. Single. Word. I don’t even think I can explain his obsession to make you understand how intense it was. He’s been jacking off to her voice for weeks. He couldn’t even think of other women because she owned his every thought. So he of course does what every billionaire does in this situation… he makes plays to get her in his reach.While Garrett can’t wait to come face to face with Maria, she isn’t so inclined. See Garrett bought the hotel Maria works at and she knows he’s coming in to flip it and/or just push her out of a job that she has worked hard for. This is what most of the book is about; Maria trying to fight to prove she can run this hotel and she should have the job. To be honest there isn’t a lot going on or a real build up to some climax that might rip them apart. It’s just about two people fighting their feelings for each other when they are so clearly done in.Their build to the relationship really took center stage to owning the book. It never felt like come on let’s do this already… it was perfectly timed and I loved when they fought their attraction. It was the best part of the book. Garrett would be a giant a-hole and oddly I loved it. He was just so grumpy because he wanted her so badly and she was pushing him away. He would get so jealous off of nothing and start stomping around… I’m shocked he just didn’t pee a circle around her. I do want to say that it was refreshing that the author didn’t have the hero try and make the heroine jealous. That seems to be such a thing lately and I find it to be childish for a grown man to do such a thing. Another woman was never even a thought to Garrett… in fact the idea of one just made him mad.This book gave me everything I wanted from a Lynda Chance story. An alpha male who literally made me gasp out loud (good gasp), a feisty heroine who gives as good as she gets, smutty scenes that are probably the best I’ve ever read from her, and a love story that ended with me in a pile of goo. This book is pure junk food that you will just consume. It’s been a while since I really got to gush over the author, but it seems Chance is back to giving me the alpha males I crave from her. No one does an alpha like Chance and I’m glad I am getting some of the old Chance’s passion in this one and I hope it stays around because I’ve really missed it. I am already dying to get my hand on her next in the series and I wish her most luck topping this one because this one has landed on my top ten of 2014 and most definitely on my re-read shelf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PESTTBJFS62F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5IJ55C#wasThisHelpful","R2PESTTBJFS62F","A36WJCEZEJMA0P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36WJCEZEJMA0P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Really sweet historical with both the best friend's-little-sister and marriage-of-convenience trope. I knew Rathburne and Emma from The Rakes of Fallow Hall series, so it was nice to revisit this world and characters.I did think issues between Rathburne and Emma were somewhat contrived - as in, Emma hasn't a clue, even when Oliver spells everything out in plain English, and her ""big""secret (spoiler alert: not big at all)Daring Miss Danvers was a sweet story, and a fast one, at that.

"“I know you fear that a single action or alteration on your part will put everything you have with Penelope at risk. What you don’t see is that by doing nothing, you risk even more,” she said simply, then lifted her palms, weighing her words with one, then the other. “All you have to do is decide if what you have now is worth risking for the chance at greater happiness.” “I could lose her,” he said before he could stop the words from tumbling out. His mother blinked up at him, surprised by his admission, but pleased. She gave him a watery smile. “Or you could gain so much more.”I enjoy Vivienne Lorret's work, so had good expectations for this novella. My expectations were met, and exceeded.

"The Turncoat was BRILLIANT.The prose was clean, clever, and enchanting. The plot was, again, clever, and fascinating. I'm a hardcore history junkie, particularly for the American Revolution. The author seamlessly wove fiction with fact, leaving me stunned, thrilled, and, honestly, sad that so much of this time and people will always be unknown.The Turncoat isn't exactly a romance, though it does have a strong romantic story within. There is even -GASP- a bit of a love triangle, though it's more of a romantic entanglement of necessity. If you let the thought of a triangle scare you away, you're missing the point of the story, and going to miss out on a hell of a book.What The Turncoat is, in addition to being a love story in the time of war and deception, is a testament to the women who fought the Revolution behind the scenes. They are the unsung heroes, and I believe the war would not have been won without them. The Turncoat is an epic page-turner, a spy thriller that will leave you breathless until the very last page.Donna Thorland has won herself a new devotee.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ES0UJVWRUP4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008U4BOW6#wasThisHelpful","R2ES0UJVWRUP4W","A19UT0OPQCDR8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UT0OPQCDR8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I liked the Hakan and Helena, and their story.

"""Tonight she’d altered the bounds of her marriage forever, and there was no going back. They’d made a crease that could never be ironed out, and more were likely to come. Folds, turning pretty paper into origami, shapes emerging, seam by seam, his instructions, her hands, two dimensions becoming three. They might end up with a perfect swan or a torn and crumpled wad, but either way, they’d find out together.""Whew! Crosstown Crush was something! My first thought is ""DAMN"". My send is: longtime McKenna fans are going to like this one. I personally love when McKenna's books get kinky, and when she digs in deep, delving into the body, heart, and especially, the mind, no one writes it  better.The kink in Crosstown Crush is cuckolding, a first for me. So yes, there is cheating, but, is it really cheating if all parties concerned are on board and involved? If cheating in books is a concern for you, you may have issues with CC. I'd say, let it go. Enjoy the story, and trust in the author, because I promise, she will explore the dynamics and examine the issues and aftermath. If you've read McKenna, you'll also know that she doesn't do tidy endings. What you will get is a believable Happy For Now.AND! Emotional book issues aside. If you are simply looking for a filthy book with lotsa sexing? Look. No. Further. CC was maybe 75% sexing. Yasssssss.If you love the trademark CM erotic romances like Willing Victim, Shivaree, Unbound, etc; you're probably going to really dig Crosstown Crush.

"Only a Kiss was an okay book for me, and I'm not sure why. On paper, it seems to be right up my alley, but you know, I can't even remember the main characters' names, so either I'm awful and distracted, or it just wasn't memorable to me.Here's the thing: despite my not remembering the lead characters' names, Only a Kiss was a nice story. The H/h were likable characters, with the heroine having a particularly good, yet tragic backstory. My very favorite part of the book was the Survivors Club. When they come into play, and the heroine really confronts her husband's death in the Napoleonic wars, it was good stuff, and left me curious to read more about the rest of the Survivors.I don't know why Only a Kiss didn't resonate heavily with me. It may be that I've come off a high of reading a book that's a new favorite, or that I'm in a mood. There's nothing about this book that struck me wrong, irritated me, or left me cold. It was fine, and what may be my ""fine"" might be someone else's ""amazing"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A8I9QSYRWZ3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75OKGK#wasThisHelpful","R3A8I9QSYRWZ3S","A19UT0OPQCDR8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UT0OPQCDR8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sisters of Versailles is a fascinating book. I love when an author can bring obscure historical characters and/or events to life, and Sally Christie did that so well. This book is both a compelling historical and scandalous page turner. If you're familiar with The Other Bolelyn Sister, then you have a good idea of what you'll get with The Sisters of Versailles.Told in alternating chapters between Louise, Pauline, Diane, Hortense, and Marie-Anne, along with letters between the sisters, Sisters recounts the years between 1730 and 1745 Versailles. From the time the sisters were simply young, sheltered daughters whose lives consisted of only their nursery, to daring to dream, reach, grasp, claw and betray their ways to the King's bed and heart. Some of the sisters were nearly harmless and naive, others led easily astray, and others were vicious, awful, power-hungry vipers.""Goodness, but sisters are a thing to fear. ""I was horrified by these sisters (and almost grateful I don't have any!)I have no idea how much of this book is fiction and how much is fact. No one knows that, I think. The author took on a very ambitious piece of French history, and really pulled it off. The Sisters of Versailles is an interesting and compelling story. I doubt I'll ever forget the tragic Mailly-Nesle sisters.""But through it all, through the good, the bad, the sin and the scandal, the heartbreak and the joy, the exiles and the deaths, through it all, they were my sisters. And now I am all that is left. I sit in my darkened rooms, an old woman, passing my days rustling through their letters and my memories. If I am careful, and still, I can hear their voices once again.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXHSVL5R3I3GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI430#wasThisHelpful","RXHSVL5R3I3GG","A19UT0OPQCDR8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UT0OPQCDR8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't read a lot of historical romance anymore, but books like A Wedding in Springtime make me question that. I'll admit, I fell in love with this cover, and that played a huge part in my decision to take it for review. I'm so happy I did read A Wedding in Springtime, because I truly enjoyed this story.A Wedding in Springtime is essentially the story of ""ruined"" Genie Talbot and the man who made her laugh in front of the Queen, William Grant. The chemistry between them is apparent from the beginning, and I loved that they were continually drawn to each other, despite their best efforts. Genie needs a husband to save her from the scandal, and quickly. Grant is an avowed bachelor, and the most coveted single man in England. Of course, this means that the two are truly meant to be together, but the road them seeing this does not run smoothly, though it is humorous.Though A Wedding in Springtime is about Genie and Grant, there are quite a few secondary characters that make up the story. There's Genie's family, including her distant uncle, bossy aunt, and meek cousin. We also have the Marchfords, made up of the Duchess, who may be the only woman powerful enough to find Genie a suitable husband, the Duke who is Grant's best friend and engaged to Genie's husband. And I can't forget Miss Penelope Rose, who may soon enter spinsterhood, but is an accomplished matchmaker. I think she just may have a story coming her way, as does Marchford.I like a humorous historical romance, and A Wedding in Springtime delivered. The dialogue between the characters, particularly Genie, Grant, and Marchford. The easy and teasing comraderie between the friends made for a lot of fun moments, as did the teasing and flirting between Genie and Grant.I was a little worried that too many characters and secondary plotlines were being brought into the story. There was a plotline about spies and the war between England and France, as well as a bit about Genie's gambling brother. I did find myself losing a bit of interest during the middle of the story. However, when these secondary stories began pulling together and incorporating into the main plot, everything began to fill in nicely and the overall story became much more exciting.I truly enjoyed A Wedding in Springtime. I found the story to be sweet, engaging, romantic, and fun! I will definitely be reading book two in the Marriage Mart series, A Midsummer Bride.Favorite Quote:  Marchford studied him for a moment, as if noticing him for the first time. ""I fear, dear chap, you are in love.""  ""Do you really think so?""  ""I cannot find any other reasonable explanation. You have bought a special license, sworn off drinking, lost control of your emotions on a public street, and most disturbing of all -- done all this before noon. I would say the evidence leads me to no other conclusion.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M8T3TDRIN6VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2AO71K#wasThisHelpful","R3M8T3TDRIN6VP","A19UT0OPQCDR8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UT0OPQCDR8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** 2.5 stars **I have a question: Why is the title of this book Scotsman of My Dreams when the man in question is not a Scotsman? Sure, his last name is Scots, as is his ancestry, but this man was a Brit through-and-through. In fact, the only Scot in this book was a distant cousin who had one scene. You're just setting readers up for false expectations.Speaking of unrealistic expectations, there was this:""She reached down between them and grabbed his erection with both hands, stroking it, measuring it with her fingers. It was at least nine fingers long and so wide around that her thumb and forefinger didn’t meet when she extended them around it.""A nine-fingers long penis! Good lord that thing should be registered as a deadly weapon. But seriously, I'm totally fine with giving book hero unrealistic proportions, but even I know you must draw a line somewhere.Scotsman of My Dreams was okay. I thought the plot moved terribly slow, but was interesting enough. The leading characters were fairly likable, even endearing at times.I just can't get past the monster peen, really.

"“Logan, you are my dream. You always were. You have to know that. The deepest desire of my heart. And as wild a fantasy as I spun .. .” She laced her arms about his neck. “ . . . the reality of us is so much better.""This review is a Hot Mess. Spoiler alert: I loved it.Oh. My. Heart. When a Scot Ties the Knot far exceeded my expectations, and trust me, those expectations were high. The plot was unique and and endearing. It is a love story, obviously. But it is also a story of dreams, chasing and finding your dreams. Choices. Daring to dream of love and family of your own making. A dream of a home and love to fill it.Maddie Gracechurch didn't dream of ballgowns and society parties. Shyness and a paralyzingly fear of crowds had her seeking quiet solitude and her art. A fake,dead fiancé and the inheritance of a castle in the Scottish highlands gives her the opportunity to have a life of her own choosing, in peace. I adored Maddie. Her deceit was born of a need to protect herself, and was never meant to go beyond the letters she sent to herself from a make believe Captain, off fighting the Napoleonic war. When her dreamt up, supposedly dead suitor (and his band of soldiers) comes calling to her castle, Maddie's reaction was quite cute. She is torn between shock, disbelief, and attraction to her supposed intended.But most of all, I loved that Maddie cared. She cares for this rag-tag group of men; some scarred either mentally or physically, others forgotten, lost from their homes and families forever. To see Maddie quickly moving from shock and irritation over this invasion of Scottish warriors, to gentleness and willingness to give them back home and sense of purpose, it would be impossible not to love Miss Madeleine Gracechurch, soon to be Mrs. MacKenzie, if her trumped-up suitor has any say in it.Logan MacKenzie is a Scottish warrior come to claim the woman who claimed him first. Yes, Logan is braw, sexy...but, I have to say Logan's physical attributes are the least sexy thing about him. It's in his actions, his devotion, in his heart. He loves to read, for chrissakes. Now, I would love to proclaim every single reason I loved this character, but I'm not. And that is not because I'm a lazy reviewer (even though that is sometimes the case), but because a large part of this book's appeal is uncovering Logan for yourself. What causes this man to lead his band of broken brothers to this castle after so many years at war, why does he brush off the slightest affections, and, why does he not dream? I swear, if you come out of this book not loving Logan MacKenzie, you should probably see a physician about your heart.As with the entire Castles Ever After series, this installment is witty and so very fun. Maddie's spinster Aunt Thea is devilishly charming, with a few secrets of her own. Logan's men always brought bawdy charm to the story, along with tenderness and more than a few tears. I loved When a Scot Ties the Knot. I loved every.single.word.Maddie and Logan might have been each other's dream come true, but Tessa Dare, you are a reader's dream come true. Thank you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14S94JZXNK1JE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQROPBC#wasThisHelpful","R14S94JZXNK1JE","A19UT0OPQCDR8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UT0OPQCDR8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm so, so glad I stuck with this series because Taken is a good example of why I'm a fan of Charlotte Stein. It was deliciously odd and sexy and completely endearing. I can safely say I, nor you, have ever read a story quite like this. Despite the potentially dark plot, Taken was quite funny. The dialogue between the free-spirited Rosie and pent-up-tighter-than-a-drum Johan was so cute. And very sexy.I will say that Rosie's incessant inner monologues drove me a bit nuts at times. It did tend to overtake the story and potentially more excellent dialogue between herself and Johan. I was also a little bothered that Rosie's and Johan's ""voices"" were exactly alike.I've been a little (okay, a lot) snarky about some of the bad lines in the first two books. So to be fair, I want to point out some lines that I really liked in Taken:“What, so you think I’m some thrill seeker?” I ask, half laughing. Until he answers, that is. Then I stop. “No, I think you have no idea what your own worth is.”“I think that might be the most amazing thing anyone has ever said to me.” “Honestly, that is pretty much the bare minimum of what you deserve.” “Or maybe that is the most amazing thing anyone has ever said to me.” “People should be saying this to you all the time. I just said it despite really not wanting to. It’s simply a fact like water is wet and Nicholas Sparks writes derivative stilted nonsense.” “I can assure you no one has told me any of that before.” “Not even the stuff about the way you talk?” “Most people call it annoying.” “It is annoying,” he says..“But you do have a nice ass,” I say, and when he sighs in response I think okay, now you went too far. Only to be surprised with the greatest answer to anything ever, in a voice as weary as worn stone. “It’s the Pilates.” Honestly, I think I might be in love with him. “That why you have those arms too?” “I can do handstand push-ups.” “Probably should not have said that.” “I know. As soon as it popped out, I thought: man that was a mistake.”So yeah, I I thought the writing in Taken was so much better.I'm glad I gave this one a try. It is my favorite of the series, by miles. If you're a fan of Stein's, or if fun, weird and endearing romance, give Taken a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCTT9SZEC0MCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVIBW80#wasThisHelpful","RCTT9SZEC0MCD","A19UT0OPQCDR8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UT0OPQCDR8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** 2.5 stars **Forbidden definitely delivered another interesting story from Charlotte Stein. I'm always interested in books that examine the impact of religion on sexuality, so in that respect, I liked Forbidden.There were a few issues that held me up, though. First, I'm not sure that Dot could be so thoroughly changed in the time allotted in a novella. There was just too much baggage and I'm not sure someone with her background could go from thinking she would go to hell for even thinking a mildly dirty thought to extreme dirty talk in a matter of weeks. I mean, the girl didn't even know what the name for a radio was.Another issue is Dot's dialect.""[...]and he don’t care nothing about it. I reckon he likes it.""I am from the South and yes, I know there are many people in the South who do not use good grammar. They also drive me crazy and I just prefer not to read it.And then....there were lines like these:""I swear to God he’s wearing jeans like he just did some fancy thing that jeans-wearing people do.""""His cheekbones are so big and manly I could bludgeon the counter guy with them, and I’m liable to do it.""""--and his tongue is so awesome at licking. <--- I'm pretty sure all tongues are good at licking. THAT IS WHAT THEY DO.""They sound rubbed raw and sort of rude, like his thoughts aren’t full of chicken soup or soothing hugs.""I guess the author is trying to make Dot sound as naive as possible. I feel like I need Google Translate for the ridiculous.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CTDYZSQDZ5IM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K53D446#wasThisHelpful","R2CTDYZSQDZ5IM","A19UT0OPQCDR8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UT0OPQCDR8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Charlotte Stein is one of my favorite erotic romance writers. Telling Tales and Control are two particular favorites. She writes awkward characters awkwardly exploring love and sex and I love it. I typically find her books interesting, unique and very sexy.I'm not quite sure how I feel about Intrusion. I did think the sexy bits were smoking, and yes, it was quirky and compelling. It's the added suspense that didn't really work for me. It's like Intrusion was suddenly a psychological thriller in the last chapter, and that threw me.And then there were lines like this:<I>The guy in front of me looks like a [expletive]  painting of himself.All I can think of is my hand, as though my hand has suddenly grown a [female genitalia].His curls are clinging to his forehead; his T- shirt has dark circles the size of the Pacific Ocean all over it.</I>Not trying to be overly picky, but yeah. I just didn't expect lines like that from Stein.I will be the first to say that I am overly picky these days. But I won't apologize for my feelings. I am going to give this series another shot, and if they don't work out? I'll still have my old favorites.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8G08OIFPEGFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JDKBUWU#wasThisHelpful","R8G08OIFPEGFY","A19UT0OPQCDR8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UT0OPQCDR8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read many of Jane Green's books over the years, and am always amazed by the how thoroughly she taps into her books' themes. Saving Grace is no exception. It is, in fact, exceptional.A dysfunctional childhood with a mentally ill mother, a successful but largely dysfunctional marriage with a volatile man, fears of her own mental health and impending menopause, are the issues that swirl through Grace Chapman's life. Those issues become the perfect storm when Beth, the family's new assistant comes on board. Confusion, betrayal and a health crisis follows, orchestrated by Beth, who must be a sociopath.Mental health is an issue that has affected so many families, my own included. I have shared Grace's fears about following in those footprints. Now, thanks to Saving Grace, I don't feel alone in my thoughts. I feel more educated and empowered about my own health and what sort of help I would like to seek if needed in the future. (to be clear-this is not, nor claims to be, a self-help or educational book)Saving Grace is a powerful story about a woman, a marriage, friendships. About finding oneself, and ending up exactly where you were meant to be. It is not a romance, but there is a wonderfully endearing romance within the story. I loved this touch and I absolutely loved how Grace's story concluded.There is a reason Jane Green has been a go-to author for more than a decade: every single book more than satisfies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K6T0O1MPUX1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KUY7GCQ#wasThisHelpful","R1K6T0O1MPUX1X","A19UT0OPQCDR8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UT0OPQCDR8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll admit that the Poldark series only came to my attention due to the upcoming television series. A fellow Outlander lover mentioned Ross Poldark as something fellow fans may enjoy. (I should mention that I believe if you're looking for something similar to Outlander, you're barking up the wrong tree.) I am always in the market for new book/television obsessions, so count me in.Ross Poldark was very good, but I can't tell you exactly why. Unhelpful, I know. It wasn't dramatic and it wasn't especially passionate; there were even parts that were quite tedious (mining business, the town business, etc.). And yet, the book had me almost totally compelled. I didn't feel the full-on immersion I feel in my favorite books, but I never wanted to put it down and was quick to pick back up.Ross Poldark was often morose, always upstanding and a really good man. His servants Jud and Prudie were ridiculous but faithful. I loved seeing Ross's interactions with people under his care. And then there was Demelza. Major admiration to an author who can make me fully love and support a relationship I would side-eye many other author's hands.Even after finishing, I cannot stop thinking about it. I feel very satisfied, yet unsettled in a way. That's probably because I was an idiot and read series spoilers.So maybe I do know why I so enjoyed Ross Poldark? Whatever the reasons, I'm anxious to begin Demelza (Poldark #2).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R163C5L67I4BTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492622079#wasThisHelpful","R163C5L67I4BTV","A19UT0OPQCDR8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UT0OPQCDR8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was slow to come around, but Between the Devil and Ian Eversea was very,very good. Ian and Tansy were both a bit hard to crack, which initially slowed my all-out love fest. She seemed unfeeling to the havoc she wreaked around her, and he seemed simply unfeeling. Fortunately Ian and Tansy were both  revealed as their story unfolded, and both came to realize the many painful and beautiful truths about the other.I'm being so vague, I know.Some of my favorite moments in Between the Devil were the funny ones, especially between Colin and Ian. And I loved how Ian and Alex's awkward/tense storyline unfolded and concluded here. As always, Julie Anne Long is a wonder with her storytelling.""But .. . Tansy . . . you are the world to me. You are my home, and, quite ironically, my peace, though I haven’t truly known a moment’s peace since I’ve met you. Which I quite like.

"** 4.5 stars,  because that ending totally won me over **I am so in love with the Pennyroyal Green Series. I feel as if it has taken over my reading life, and am happy for it. The Eversea and Redmond families are enigmatic and passionate and always surprising, and given that, I wasn't sure how How the Marquess Was Won would work without either family playing a leading part.Maybe I overthink these things...How the Marquess Was Won was terrific. It was thoughtful and funny, and very sweet. Despite some very large bumps in the road to Happy Ever After (I'm looking at you, Jules), it very much had a fairy tale feel to it.It is a story of Phoebe, who has never truly belonged to any one or any place, and Julian, who carries a lifetime of burdens on his shoulders, who is feared and imitated, but has never been truly known. From the moment the two meet, there's a...feeling of rightness. That moment when you just know you've found your person. (best feeling in the world)This knowing does not mean smooth sailing for Phoebe and Jules. Nope. He's determined to marry the right girl in order to get what he wants, and Phoebe, sadly, isn't it. She's just a schoolmistress, good enough to teach the girls but not good enough to be one of them. Theirs is a relationship that is just not done in society, but you know how that goes....Looking at what I've said here, I realize I'm not painting the romance between Phoebe and Jules in the best of light. Honestly, it wasn't always winsome. He had his eyes on the prize (a Redmond cousin who comes with everything he's always wanted), and sometimes his thoughtelessness broke Phoebe's heart. Believe me when I say he earned his redemption. Jules gives good grovel.And OH. How the Marquess Was Won also gives delicious little morsels in the ongoing Lyon-Olivia saga. I have to admit one revelation felt like a smart little slap in the face, and my excitement for their book continues to build by the day. And Jonathan Redmond. That boy is the best.How the Marquess Was Won is not my favorite in the Pennyroyal Green Series. A Notorious Countess Confesses still holds my heart. But once again, any book in this series is always the best of historical romance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VHQDUMMNUMHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005AJU36C#wasThisHelpful","R3VHQDUMMNUMHP","A19UT0OPQCDR8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19UT0OPQCDR8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Hamidbar Medaber"" makes for a great listen. While influenced by Jazz, Zebrina plays Klezmer with a Rock emphasis. The result is easy to listen to yet sonically satisfying. As would be expected, Ben Goldberg is the front man. His solos are articulate and fiery on this clarinet-centric album. Jonathan Feldman plays various keyboards, but his work on the Fender Rhodes is remarkable. This listener has a weak spot for a great Rhodes piano. When listening to the sound samples for this album, it was the Rhodes that sealed the deal on the purchase. Feldman plays strong solos on songs like 'Chant of Ages' and 'The Spirit Within.'  Thanks to the Rhodes, there are times when ""Hamidbar Medaber"" echoes Miles Davis'  ""[...] Brew."" Joel Schwartz also plays a mean guitar. In particular, he rips things up on 'The Spirit Within.' Playing a Middle Eastern jam, 'The Desert Speaks' is moody and introspective. 'Higher Power' combines avant-garde and psychedelia. 'Breath of Life' is infused with Surf Rock. Highlights include 'The Spirit Within' and the funky 'Freedom Groove.' Featuring all instrumental songs, the melodies are delicious, the arrangements are clever and the improvisation is fantastic. Beyond this, the band has a great chemistry. While the appeal to listeners of Jewish music is obvious, ""Hamidbar Medaber"" is also likely to appeal to the adventurous that enjoy instrumental Rock and Jazz.  In the end, what can you say, John Zorn knows how to pick 'em. ""Hamidbar Medaber"" is a most welcome addition to the Tzadik catalog.

As with the last couple of releases, Bill Frisell is the standout. Indeed, on ""The Testament of Solomon,"" Frisell's notes gracefully dance about the ether. Carol Emanuel plays a supportive role on the harp and Kenny Wollesen creates a mystical ambiance with the vibes and bells. Given the meditative quality, this is wonderful music to play first thing in the morning. The only drawback to ""The Testament of Solomon"" is that it's a rehash of the group's recent work. It's stronger than the first album, ""Gnostic Preludes,"" but there's little differentiation between this effort and the previous two albums, ""In Lambeth"" and ""the Mysteries."" Given a blindfolded test, most listeners would be unable to tell the difference between ""The Testament of Solomon"" and the previous couple of albums. So it's a beautiful recording but only completists will need the entire quartet. In the end, ""The Testament of Solomon"" may be redundant but it's still as lovely as a lotus blossom.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7QBVFS0KTVKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCKJRU0#wasThisHelpful","R7QBVFS0KTVKN","A1A3485UTN4SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A3485UTN4SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Shop of Wild Dreams"" is a beautifully eclectic jazz recording. The first wild dream in the shop is 'Number Six.' It's a fantastic introduction to the album for a few reasons. First, the song orients the listener to the beautiful tone and range of Lurie's sax. Second, it makes it clear that while this is real jazz, it's also not the jazz that your father listened to. Along these lines, the song features a banjo riff and psychedelic background effects that project a vibe of modernity. Indeed, this music finds a curious balance between being fresh and familiar. Next up, 'I Don't Care If I Don't Care' features vocals. When great instrumentalists sing, they tend to spoil what otherwise would have been quality instrumental music. In contrast, this song works. Not only do Lurie's atypical vocals work but her song writing is good. The next wild dream is 'The Unusual Things' which features standout piano work by Erik Deutsch who is known for his work with Charlie Hunter. The vocal infused 'Grey Ocean' is a bit dull, but the mood is saved by the following track, 'Grinch.' Featuring congas, the wonderful song is enhanced by hallucinogenic electronics and a killer post-production. In this song, Lurie's flute solo is remarkable. The title track features hauntingly beautiful vocals. John Zorn would approve of 'Pinjur,' a Jewish themed jazz tune. It fits right in with the wonderful downtown scene that's populated by artists like Anthony Coleman, Erik Friedlander and Jon Madof. 'Circus Rain' is a quirky song with an Eastern European feel. This song embodies Jessica Lurie's curious way of singing that gives her words a foreign aesthetic. It's a great tune given the catchy melody, psychedelic atmospherics and post-modern feel. 'Flying Man' is straight jazz bliss. The last wild dream in the shop is the lovely 'Anthem.' As with Lurie's other albums, ""Shop of Wild Dreams"" finds a beautiful balance between music that is enjoyable to listen to yet thoughtful. It is a travesty that after five years, this is the first Amazon review. At the time of review, the new CD could be had through Amazon for only $7.32.  For such a paltry investment, ""Shop of Wild Dreams"" offers a satisfying experience of just how wonderful modern Jazz can be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LJ0C95KOCPPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UL7FL0#wasThisHelpful","R1LJ0C95KOCPPB","A1A3485UTN4SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A3485UTN4SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Compared to groups like Rebirth and the Dirty Dozen, the Stooges are newcomers to the wonderful world of New Orleans brass bands. What the group lacks with experience is made up with passion. Known for both their stage performance and second line parades, ""It's About Time"" shows what the group can do in the studio. To start things off on the good foot, 'Stooges Party' is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's easy to listen to this music and imagine dancing in a second line party. 'Deal With This' is a great instrumental with jazz style solos. ""Where Ya From' celebrates the NOLA wards. 'Can't Be Faded' features a sweet brass melody with whistling and vocalizations that give the feel of a live performance. A salute to former Saints football player Michael Buck, 'Wind It Up' is the album's highlight. It's a blast to experience live because the Stooges have worked out an accompanying dance. Moreover, this is one of the songs that the group plays in the HBO show ""Treme."" In season three, Antoine Batiste plays trumpet with the Stooges in a second line parade. No gangsta rap here, 'This Is The Time' is a life affirming song about working for progress. With moving lyrical content, it stands as another sparkler. 'New Funk' is a jazz party.  Tunes like 'Bin Laden' and 'Mo 1' are filled with scintillating brass solos. 'Paul Barbarin' honors the hometown drummer that played with King Oliver and Lois Armstrong. In the ultimate New Orleans death, Barbarin died in 1969 while playing a Mardi Gras parade! 'Weed Drought' is a fun tune about the quest for herb. In the studio, it can difficult to capture a musical experience that's usually woven into a rollicking street party. Despite such challenges, ""It's About Time"" perfectly captures the energy of the band's live performance. Featuring a mix of instrumentals and songs with vocals, ""It's About Time"" is very danceable. In fact, it's hard to listen to and remain still. At 70 minutes, ""It's About Time"" is packed with Crescent City brass bliss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B0J2V5TNB4Y5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QZPEX2#wasThisHelpful","R1B0J2V5TNB4Y5","A1A3485UTN4SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A3485UTN4SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""On Leaves of Grass"" is the third release by John Zorn's Nova Express Quartet. When it comes to musical vision, the first two albums were similar in that the focus was avant-garde jazz. In contrast, this Walt Whitman inspired project is classified by Tzadik as a mystical work. To begin, 'Whispers of Heavenly Death' and 'Song at Sunset' are both cheerful and light. Such material is the embodiment of Zorn's mystical works, at least as expressed by this group. In a similar vein, the theme for 'Halcyon Days' is a delicious Jewish melody that inspires awe in the mysteries of the universe. Every now and then, this soundtrack to transcendent glory makes a surprise transition into a brief avant-garde breakdown. The juxtaposition is very well done. With a roller coaster of tempos, 'Portals' is straight-up avant-garde. After a jarring ride, 'Sea Drift' and 'Song of the Open Road' are a return to relaxing jazz. 'The Body Electric' is another avant-garde offering. Infused with Ikue Mori's electronics, 'Mystic Cyphers' is a lightning rod for darkness. The song is reminiscent of Zorn's Dracula inspired ""Nosferatu."" Before arriving in 'America,' each of the album's songs are only a few minutes. Almost fifteen minutes in length, 'America' is the album's epic offering. This is another sunny jazz song. ""On Leaves of Grass"" offers a curious foil between peaceful jazz and cacophonous avant-garde.By itself, ""On Leaves of Grass"" is enjoyable but for anybody listening to the last few years of John Zorn's mystical and avant-garde works, ""On Leaves of Grass"" is a rehash. The avant-garde here is outmatched by offerings on the previous two albums, ""Nova Express"" and ""Dreamachines."" Beyond this, the sunny jazz may seem like a paradigm change for the group, but it seems to have gone unnoticed that the Nova Express Quartet (Joey Baron, Trevor Dunn, John Medeski and Kenny Wollesen) has recorded outside of their current moniker. Indeed, ""At the Gates of Paradise"" is one of the jewels in John Zorn's mystic series. While possessing merit, none of the songs on this 2014 release are as good as those on ""At the Gates of Paradise"" with regards to the melodies, compositions and performances. Unfortunately, ""On Leaves of Grass"" doesn't exceed or even match the group's previous work. In the end, this is a good album by a great group.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBO1I12U5FC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGYPXPM#wasThisHelpful","R2UBO1I12U5FC0","A1A3485UTN4SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A3485UTN4SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Adramelech"" is a glorious celebration of Afrobeat, John Zorn style. The twenty-second Book of Angels was handed to longtime Tzadik artist Jon Madof. For this project, Madof leads Zion80, an eleven piece band. The name of the group is surely a nod to Fela Kuti's beloved Egypt '80. Stylistically, the band plays Afrobeat with a Jewish twist. This is in contrast to the band's debut which expresses a more straight ahead vision of Afrobeat. Alas, this isn't an original idea, but it exceeds previous efforts of those like the Fourth Ward Afro-Klezmer Orchestra. A heavy Afrobeat groove is the foundation of the project's musical formula. On top of this, the brass section plays Afrobeat phrases that are often infused with a Klezmer sensibility. Instrumental Jazz and Rock are also woven into this musical tapestry. The eclectic instrumentation includes multiple brass and woodwind instruments, bass, percussion and drums. 'Araziel' is a good opener in that it introduces the listener to the ""Adramelech"" experience. The album features fantastic keyboard work courtesy of Brian Marsella who also plays on ""Caym,"" Cyro Baptista's Book of Angels. As on 'Sheviel,' Marsella's retro organ sound brings much to the table. Considering that the bandleader is also the guitarist, Madof practices restraint with regards to the modest amount of time that the electric guitar is heard. That said, he rocks hard on a few songs like 'Metatron.' 'Lelahiah' brings to mind the fantastic work that he's done in projects like Rashanim. Moving along, 'Shamdan' has a strong Jewish sensibility. Many of the offerings have a psychedelic, trance vibe. Along these lines, 'Kenunit' is a ten minute jam featuring Jazz style solos. In many of the Book of Angels releases, the last song is one of the strongest. Featuring beautiful flute work by Jessica Lurie, 'Nehinah' doesn't disappoint. The groove is to die for. For fans of Afrobeat, ""Adramelech"" offers instant gratification. That said, this is no rehash. While an Afrobeat revival has been going on for around a decade, most members of the movement have been reluctant to step out of Fela's long shadow. In contrast, ""Adramelech"" is fresh on the ears as it successfully integrates Jewish aesthetics. With its twenty-second eclectic installment, the Book of Angels now features an Afrobeat offering. It begs the question, when will John Zorn run out of ideas? How many more sonic frontiers can he and his compatriots incorporate, break, and create? If the past is any predictor of the future, let's hope that John Zorn is only getting started.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YCLAQAICWXLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGYPXSY#wasThisHelpful","R1YCLAQAICWXLO","A1A3485UTN4SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A3485UTN4SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd like to start out with an excerpt from M. Richards' Amazon review, ""I avoided this cd despite it's great reviews because I always like Frisell's later works from the early '90's. I was wrong. This is as strong as some of his best recordings today."" I appreciate this sentiment. Frisell has always been a guitar visionary. That written, his music didn't really bloom or mature into consistent greatness until the late 1990s. Thus it's easy to be skeptical about Frisell's second album. That written, ""Rambler"" has turned out to be one of the most rewarding efforts that I've come across from Frisell's early period. Up there with ""Where in the World?,"" ""Rambler"" is surprisingly strong. As with much of his early music, it is orchestrally driven. That written, it is loose enough to feel like a proto-Quartet project. Those accustomed to his later discography get immediate gratification with familiar songs. The title track and 'When We Go' are played on the Ginger Baker Trio's ""Going Back Home."" 'Strange Meeting' is one of the highlights off ""Bill Frisell with Dave Holland and Elvin Jones."" Despite the album's strengths, it is not a place to begin with Bill Frisell -unless the listener is an ECM junkie. At the end of the day, ""Rambler"" sounds dated. This is due to the production and performance. That written, this dated quality sometimes plays as a strength. For example, Frisell occasionally employs a synthesizer used by Robert Fripp during the same time period. This wonderfully retro sound is immediately recognizable by anyone familiar with King Crimson's music from the same epoch -think of albums like ""Discipline"" and ""Beat."" While not a place to begin, ""Rambler"" is a great listen for the Frisellian that has played out Bill Frisell's first tier recordings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R392B14LV2YQ5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CSQINW#wasThisHelpful","R392B14LV2YQ5J","A1A3485UTN4SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A3485UTN4SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Jazz Shots from the East Coast"" is a collection of jazz videos. On volume 1, the selections are uneven given the balance of legends, obscure gems and unknowns. Mostly coming out of public domain vaults, the video quality is poor. No attempt was made remaster these selections. Fortunately the audio quality is on average, good. The first two songs feature the Bill Evans Trio. The second song is his great, 'Waltz for Debby.' Next up is the Ahmad Jamal Trio on grainy black and white. The third act features a forgettable performance by the Phil Woods Quartet. Thelonious Monk is the first heavy hitter on ""Jazz Shots from the East Coast."" While it's rough footage, it's still a treat to see Monk play live. The band plays a good version of 'Blue Monk,' complete with Monk's signature foot floppin'. Keeping the theme, Johnny Griffin next plays 'Monk's Dream.' Despite what seems to be a lousy VHS transfer, it's actually a good retelling. Oscar Peterson's performance is one of the video's gems. On the keys, Peterson is spellbinding! This is vintage footage from the glory days. Fortunately, the editors included three Duke Ellington songs. Most likely from '40s, the cinematography on the first two songs is precious. Through audio hiss, the orchestra plays 'Mood Indigo' and 'Sophisticated Lady.' In contrast, 'Take the A Train' is played by a trio. Ellington's amazing phrasing as a pianist comes through on all three selections. The strangest material here is by Keith Jarrett's group. Beginning with 'Tagore,' Jarrett plays the piano's interior strings. Packed with flower power free jazz, 'Passin' Thu' shows what experimental jazz in the '60s was all about. There is very little remaining footage of this fleeting moment in jazz history. Jimmy Smith follows the freak out. Live footage of Smith is rare and often lacking in quality. Unfortunately, this material is no exception. Aside from the organ having that roller skating rink sound, every scene is a close-up making it a bit difficult to watch. Oscar Peterson returns for another swingin' tune at what is surely the Newport Jazz Festival. The last tune is by the great Rahsaan Roland Kirk. While the video quality is poor, Kirk is seen doing his amazing multi-instrumentalist thing. The track only shows a single solo but the incredibly rare footage is remarkable! Volume 1 of ""Jazz Shots from the East Coast"" is an eclectic look at several decades of jazz history. The inclusion of dates and venues would have been appreciated. As is, this video program mostly shows uneven and rough footage. There are a few gems but most of the stronger footage is available elsewhere. Get ""Jazz Shots from the East Coast"" if you can't live without the rare footage, but avoid it if you can.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NFGVISIHNYII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003C8RF8M#wasThisHelpful","R2NFGVISIHNYII","A1A3485UTN4SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A3485UTN4SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Glen David Andrews is the real deal. The music here is distinctively NOLA but the Big Easy is a sound, not a genre, so Glen David Andrews mixes things up with an eclectic variety of styles that include Funk, Gospel, Jazz, Soul, Rock and Christian Contemporary. For starters, let's talk about the voice; if you've never heard Glen David Andrews, his vocals are amazing. It's like Willie Dixon meets James Brown. The album kicks off with 'NY To Nola.' It's a great autobiographical song that plays New Orleans Rock. Many of the Rock songs on ""Redemption"" sound remarkably similar to the Crescent City's best Rock band, Galactic. As it turns out, this is no coincidence as the project features Galactic's Ben Ellman, who also produced an album for Glen David Andrews' cousin, Trombone Shorty. Featuring Ivan Neville, 'Chariot' is a sweet gospel number. The funk gets turned on high for 'Bad By Myself.' In this song, the horns cook! For 'Didn't It Rain,' Andrews is assisted by the The Queen of Gospel, Mahalia Jackson. They sing a moving gospel song about the flood that will get anybody clapping or toe tapping. Accompanied by Jamison Ross, 'Surrender' is Contemporary Christian: ""What is a woman who gains the world and all these material things / I'd rather have Jesus in my life."" 'Kool Breeze (Glen's Season)' is a great Jazz instrumental. It will inspire anybody to get up and shake their bones. Never afraid to combine the sacred with the secular, 'Movin' Up' is another Christian Contemporary offering. Playing Rock, 'Lower Power' features Anders Osborne, who previously worked with Galactic, Toots and the Maytals, and Karl Denson. 'You Don't Know' is the highlight on the album. It's an anthemic Jazz/Rock/Funk tune. 'Something to Believe In' makes for a chill closer. ""Redemption"" stands as a good Glen David Andrews studio album. It features good song writing. While NOLA permeates every tune, Andrews works in broad musical styles to keep things interesting. Additional assets include special guests and a strong production. In the end, this effort does not surpass Glen David Andrews' previous release, ""Live At Three Muses."" The live release captures the magic of a phenomenal club performance. It also features fewer sacred selections. Moreover, in that environment, the listener is able to appreciate Andrews' enormous stage presence. When it comes to this 2014 release, the man has captured the real sound of New Orleans by telling his story. Join Glen David Andrews on his musical journey to find redemption.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NUHF5NI57HDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IS6EC7A#wasThisHelpful","R3NUHF5NI57HDR","A1A3485UTN4SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A3485UTN4SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anybody in-the-know appreciates that while Bourbon Street hosts New Orleans' most famous nightly party, it's not the seat of the town's best music. For the best live music, many would argue that you need to travel a few minutes north-east to Frenchman Street. There one will find clubs like Snug Harbor, Blue Nile and the great Spotted Cat.  To celebrate this magical street, Mystery Street Records presents ""Frenchman Street."" It's a fantastic compilation of artists that you've probably never heard of. So while it doesn't feature anybody like the Jazz Vipers, Kermit or Meshiya Lake, the musical quality of this sampler makes the case that you should know these musicans. New Orleans artists often sing about their hometown, both celebrating its unique merits and venting about the city's struggles. In that vein, Shamarr Allen offers the perfect introduction to the compilation with 'Meet Me on Frenchmen Street.' Through 'You've Got to be Crazy to Live in This Town,' Alex McMurray laments the challenges of living in what many consider the most northern Caribbean city. Jesse Moore makes a Bluesy contribution with 'When the Hoodoo Come Down.' 'Dumaine Street Blues' is in the New Orleans Jazz style that the Vipers typically encapsulate. Here, Glen David Andrews shines! The Nightcrawlers represent the New Orleans Brass Band tradition. One of the highlights comes from Margie Perez & the King Cake Babies. Perez's 'Mardi Gras Carnival' is a fantastic celebration of the Crescent City's most celebrated annual event. Another sparkler is Craig Klein's 'Shake Your Rugalator,' which is a New Orleans Jazz inspired reworking of the Blues standard 'Got My Mojo Workin.' 'Stew Called New Orleans' features the compilation's most well-known artist, John Boutté who is best known across the country for doing the theme song to the HBO show ""Treme."" Matt Perrine's 'Sougouya' is the album's one instrumental. The final John Boutté song was pulled from the 2006 Jazz Fest. In this amazing retelling, Boutté reworks the lyrics of 'Louisiana 1927' to describe what the city went through after Hurricane Katrina. Released in 2011, ""Frenchman Street"" is a strong compilation of underappreciated New Orleans artists. The songs are fantastic and the production is tops. It offers an eclectic sampling of the roots music we most associate with the Big Easy. If you can't get down to Nawleans and meander in and out of the clubs, ""Frenchman Street"" offers the next best thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X9Z2P4BKR2N6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LOL7Z8#wasThisHelpful","R1X9Z2P4BKR2N6","A1A3485UTN4SS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A3485UTN4SS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm having a hard time with this series. On the one hand JA Sutherland is a good writer and the character Alexis is fantastic; on the other hand the universe is getting harder and harder for me to swallow. The whole idea of this series is sailing ships in space. You get that from the first book, but in this second novel you realize that its not just sailing ships in space, its basically the British Empire in the height of its sea fairing navies in Space. All of it.From Lords, to Colonies, to Gentlemens Clubs, to Captains being powers unto themselves. And for me this is starting to come apart in this novel. He does I think, as good a job as can be done relocating the 17th century into the distant future, and it is very interesting to read a future very unlike the others, but thinks just don't quite add up. Technology is advanced enough for us to spread amongst the stars, but somehow communications got left in the 22nd century? Captains are more or less unaccountable, because somehow our current trend of 24 hour news cycles and organizations being slaves to public opinion is no longer the case. That part is an excellent example of the premise starting to show some holes. Were not sailing ships anymore... people can all read. There are no slaves. And yet the Navy is still conscripting people with no recourse and captains are beating and killing the crew. Gender equality took a huge step back... and their are still swords and sails and cannons and my frustration.This is a great story: good writing, fun adventure, a heroine you can root for, but its starting to seem like it should have been set 300 years ago. Not 300+ years in the future. I hope the author can work away from some of these silly conceits and start to move into the future. I think as the story progresses these ""universe holes"" will only become more prevalent and harder to surmount. But Mr Sutherland if 1000 years from now this is what the universe looks like, I will gladly eat my hat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J9PIB49NDM4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00POAHOXC#wasThisHelpful","R2J9PIB49NDM4X","A1H6SBO7R007I8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H6SBO7R007I8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just Fantastic. Instant winner. The shade is perfect for a sunday brunch or just to add a little fun mid week. It last a week without chipping with just two coats and is still going strong. It looks good on just about any skin tone, but really shines for someone with a more coppery/brown complexion, as the color really pops and seems to have more orange then pink. But not a neon... no idea how people got that. The consensus was that this formula was in fact thinner then previous years, but no one had a hard time putting it on, and once it dried it stayed.

This was an enjoyable story in its own right, and if you've read Bob Mayers other books from the beginning, what he did with this one I thought was masterful--the way he tied it all in and had interesting call backs and just all around is a superb and tight writer.That being said I didn't like it as much as the Nightstalkers books... not enough to take a star off, but it wasn't one beginning to end story about the team. Instead they all had separate adventures in separate times that picked up and left off simultaneously. If that makes sense. So you'd read the first 4 hours of one adventure in viking times, then the next 4 hours in victorian England, then 4 hours somewhere else, etc etc. None of them completing it until the end of the book. And like lots of others in his very intelligent series you're left with a lot of questions. In addition to the team members, you also follow the Cellar and catch a glimpse of a few other players. It was nice to see everyone, but at the expense of not sticking with anyone as long as I would have wanted. Even though this book reads more like an Anthology the stories were still fun and full of twists, and Mr. Mayer still brought his trademark excellent writing. Getting historical and technical details as correct as possible, which I love. I'm so sick of reading books where the author just completely makes up how the Army works or puts external hammers and safeties on Glocks, etc etc.So this was a good read, and you'll enjoy it, so long as you're prepared for something different from, yet at the same time touching on, his previous offerings. You don't necessarily need to have read them to understand this book, but I would recommend starting with the Nightstalkers as its just a great series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EMKBHDWA0F53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UK001LS#wasThisHelpful","R1EMKBHDWA0F53","A1H6SBO7R007I8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H6SBO7R007I8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is where its at. When you have too much stuff for your pockets, but not enough to warrant a full size backpack this fills the gap nicely. Perfect if you're toting along a camera or a scope. It looks stylish and holds a wide variety of stuff. I've used it hiking, traveling, and on extended road trips. Its comfortable, well made and built tough, as almost all Max products are. It has a CC pocket if thats your thing, which I found works almost as well for books or kindles or anything else you want fast access too. The Khaki/foilage color is legit. It has plenty of admin/organization pockets too. You can easily and smartly manage and fit everything you need into this bad boy.

"My only real complaint about these is the ""feel."" My friend had an old pair that I swear had a slightly rubbery feel to them but were definitely Holbrooks. I have other oakley glasses that have the rubbery feel and it just makes them feel more quality. At any rate if you want a slightly sportier/tougher pair of wayfarer type sunglasses (both rayban and oakley are owned by same company luxottica) these are great. They are very light and wear extremely comfortably. They have no screws so the arms will just pop out. (They could break too I suppose, but mine have just popped.) You can also change out the lenses when you get bored. I get lots of complements, and while my face is a little more narrow, I think they look good on a variety of face types. the commenter who said they look feminine... well I just don't know how anyone would think that. These are probably some of the most masculine glasses I own.

"Ive taken my USMC Gen II ILBE Digital MARPAT Assault Pack on many adventures and is has performed amazingly. Its not perfect but it has served me very very well. When my environment is 100% urban I've gotten by with an older briggs messenger bag that has also performed fantastically. As circumstances changed, and I found myself needing to carry more stuff, traveling a lot more and finding myself in multiple climates in short periods of time the messenger just wasn't cutting it space wise and I often had a a ruck and my messenger which was unwieldy at best. I wanted something that would blend into urban and travel environments better than the Marpat pack and hoped also to find some worthwhile improvements. In furtherance of that goal I picked up the Hazard 4 Patrol Pack, the Maxpedition Falcon 2, the 5.11 Rush 24, and the Spec Ops UAP.4.5 starsI realized upon receiving the packs that this was going to be an uphill battle for the maxpedition to win me over. I thought I was getting a pack of a similar class, but realized how small it is compared to the others upon receiving it and comparing the specs. Its 1500 compared to 2000-2500 for the other packs. It was  a lot more narrow then I realized from the pictures. Partly my fault I know. I have a lot of Max stuff, and I feel like its all of the best quality, well made, and well thought out. I love my versa pack, my cooler bags, and various pouches I have from them. This pack didn't seem to quite have the same well thought out design features as my ""man bag."" The ergos were wrong for me, it did seem weirdly stiff, and the straps, while serving a definite purpose, made access difficult. I also wish their black was black. I don't especially enjoy the contrast stitching highlighting each and every molle strap, and I don't think it serves much of a purpose other then highlighting my tacticool pack.If you're looking for something lightweight and high speed this is a great choice if you won't be carrying a ton of gear. I expect the stiffness would go away after some time, and I trust Maxpedition and their fantastic/high quality products. I can see this pack really shining on a motorcycle or bike, or any place (back) space is at a premium. The design will really be hit or miss for some people, and pay attention to how narrow it is. If you want something a little more traditional, but still with great urban/thoughtful features, I recommend the Hazard 4 day pack. It has contrast lining, a padded pocket for organization, and great padding. Its the ideal urban/travel bag for medium duty. If you want the best value in more traditional shaped rucks, I recommend the 5.11. It doesnt have any earth shattering features, but its good quality, has good ergo's, has good organization, its tough, and can be found for a great price on amazon. I ended up going with UAP, its pretty much bomb proof, its made in america and is infinitely customizable. Sadly like everything customizable that costs extra. It already is the most expensive of the bunch, but figure in another hundred or so for back panel if you want one, admin pouch if you want organization, hydration hook if you want it hanging, etc etc. Still I think my grandkids will probably be passing it down to their grand kids.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRH0XK84DLQMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H0TQN6#wasThisHelpful","RRH0XK84DLQMK","A1H6SBO7R007I8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H6SBO7R007I8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But if I was on a budget this would have been my choice. You can sometimes score them around double digits. This doesnt have a ll the bells and whistles of some of the other packs, but for this price you can see why its the top seller in tactical backpacks. You get a lot for your money. Lots of organization, fleece lined front pockets, admin pocket, zippers and mesh inside. If you want a pack thats going to get you through your adventures with minimal fuss and minimal wallet impact this is the one. If I knew without a doubt that my pack would be done by the end of my trip, either left behind or beat to death I'd get this one, because Id feel like I got my money's worth out of it. All of the features have been well thought out and work well. It had the most organization of any of the packs. I wish the padding was a little more robust on the shoulder strap but thats made up for a by both a padded back and removable back panel. Also its missing a belt.It also was the mose inconspicuous of the tactical/rugged/molle packs I looked at. It just didn't have the same bulges or eye catching weirdness that all the other ones have. The Max is weird shaped and has contrast stitching, the uap has huge velcro swathes that demand to be studied, and the Hacard 4 has an eye couching padded pouch. The Maxpedition was a little smaller and more stream lined then the others so if you're looking for light and fast wait I'd get that one, its very different then other packs. The Spec Ops UAP is by far the most bullet proof and is extremely heavy duty (and most expensive--in addition to price you have to add pieces a la cart to it) and the one I ultimately decided on. The Hazard 4 is a great backpack if your more urban/office centric. It just feels a little more civilized and has little details like a padded pouch and contrast lining, but didn't feel quite as touch as any of the other backpacks (opinion only since I didn't put it through the grinder.) And this 5.11 brings the value. It doesnt offer the same situationally specific advantages as the other packs, except in the price department which makes it my choice for best value. You get good features, very good quality, and an unbeatable price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8MKFRKTJW9ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019VWSQ8#wasThisHelpful","R8MKFRKTJW9ZH","A1H6SBO7R007I8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H6SBO7R007I8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very very relaxed fit jean. For the price its pretty good quality. The material is a little on the thin side, and the fit is very much on the loose side, making for a very comfortable, light weight, almost flow jean. Oddly I'm a 32 in some jeans, a 33 in others, but this 34 was the right size for me. (in the interest of full disclosure, I have gained a little weight since an injure and am now about 175 and 6') My fit looks similar to the picture, except with more material and more bunching which you should expect unless you have them hemmed. These are longer than my other 32 length jeans. If I got another pair (and i probably will) Id stick with 34 and try non relaxed boot cut. I really wish for review purposes they'd send us the same thing in a couple different sizes so I could tell you the differences. Its been my experience that at this price point for clothes and other textile goods its very common for items to be made in a (relatively) wide range of measurements for any given size.The fly is button, the stitching is of ok quality with some missing and loose threads here and there. Again it all comes back to the price for me. I've owned some $200 selvedge diesel jeans that lasted years, and the next pair lasted months. I've had levis at higher and lower price points that were all over the place quality wise. I don't expect these to wear in and last a lifetime, and they are thinner then other wrangler jeans I have, but for the price I'm ok with getting just a year or two out of them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG3AVRDT3UG58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKY4MG6#wasThisHelpful","RG3AVRDT3UG58","A1H6SBO7R007I8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1H6SBO7R007I8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Each time I watch and listen to this disc, it brings me renewed pleasure. One Mo'  Time is also in my collection, another disc to watch when you want or need a bit of joy in your life. As were some of the other reviewers, I was surprised to find that I had not bought another variation on the three operatic tenors which was such a bit hit. A pleasant surprise, it turned out, since these three are equally at home in both the operatic and the popular realms. In addition, the staging adds to the vitality of the performance, as they tread lightly about  in various formations, always in direct communication with the audience and with each other.One need not ask which of the singing trios now on disc is preferable to the others.

"An entertaining more or less tough guy P.I. with a soft sentimental side. Some of the violence of the classic tough guys of the thirties and forties, but with a kind of 'not to be taken too seriously air' about it. Hero of the tale is a dog left in his care by a girl friend, one of a passing parade, who does not win any dog-show metals but has the mettle to take on the bad guys. Hero is unexpectedly embarrassed by the invitations to have sex of some of the passing parade of women...not in keeping with the classic tough guys. There are nasty thugs and nasty police with a pretty good plot involving a dog show, drugs, dogs in love and an assortment of typical situations. All-in-all, author does not let cutesy dog stuff entirely control the show, which is what saves the book from dying in saccharine sentiment.

"I write only as a viewer who watches dance only as an 'amateur'. My only live experience with it, aside from various forms  of  tap dancing and chorus lines, was a couple of years with season tickets to watch Balanchine. I was interested and entertained by the three dances performed for this disc. As one reviewer has  pointed out, one with the ""senior"" group whom he supervises is more a somewhat active skit than anything else, although the meaning is rather more clouded than were those we use to see on television's Bob Hope, Jack Benny, &etc. shows. The heart of the disc are the two others. The setting is pretty much like your average High School or College Gym in which a group of young men and women in their tightly fitted work suits (although some of the men and women have occasion to put on skirts) are going through series of intricate body movements at various speeds, from excruciatingly slow to lightning fast, both  alone and in intimate contact with another. There is none of the flowing grace of the traditional ballet, nor the costumes and scenery. What one does get to see are how almost inhumanly slim both sexes are and, for the bare chested men, how the skeletal structure of their chests and back are  part of the show. Kylian does try to enlighten the viewer as to his intentions in a brief interview accompanying each of the three pieces...one may, or likely, may not, see much relationship between his  words and the action on stage. I say these things so that viewers who still expect the customary context for ballet, the wonderful scenery and costume, the graceful flow of bodies, the interweaving of the dominant female with the subordinate male, save when he is given leave to turn incredible leaps about the stage, will know that they will not find them here. On the other hand, those who take a neutral stance toward variations in style, may well get the same pleasure as I did from observing the patterns of physical interaction and individual....contortion? Oh, yes, those interested, will find some confirmation of what I saw once on a film about an American ballet school associated with a major company....a very ambitious and apparently skilled dancer was shown being rejected from further study because she would never be successful with her  curvaceous body and clearly defined breasts. In the first ballet on the disc one can see for oneself some verification of the statement....although I have no idea whether the intervening years between then and now (and between the date of these performances and today) have altered the situation perceptibly. In brief then, these are not in the style that once dominated formal dance, if you want to stick with the wonderful work done in that manner, this is not for you. On the other hand, if you are open, even as a stranger (as am I) to some of the contemporary variations, these might well provide an enjoyable evening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GE9AQ7KFVOR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VKW6OW#wasThisHelpful","R2GE9AQ7KFVOR5","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Working in NYC for a couple of years in the mid-60's, with season tickets available at a price my limited salary would bear, and with the new Lincoln Center location (at the then new Lincoln Center), I was able to see the numerous Balanchine productions of the era (as well as the brilliant opera productions with the likes of Beverly Sills performing). Knowing nothing of ballet and only what I learned from watching Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, The Nicholas Brother on film (and many others live, benefit of growing up in Brooklyn. leaving permanently only with the onset of the Korean War (does anyone remember that UN Police action these days?).For various reasons that period ended my experience of live formal dance save for the occasional television production I managed to catch. Only with retirement did I amass a collection of DVD's with assorted choreographers represented as they came to my attention. Withal, I write as a  pure amateur in dance and commend Teachout's introduction to Balanchine from that perspective only. At the prices shown today on Amazon for used copies (or new for that matter), it is easy to commend it wholeheartedly to the viewer who wants to learn a valuable bit about dance and one of its modern masters. Teachout is a self-identified enthusiast of the choreographers work and should be read with that perspective but he also makes quite clear, if only with great brevity, the behavioral patterns which many of us would find quite distasteful. Whether or not one accepts these as the privilege of genius, whether or not one believes these to be inevitable flaws when this genius involves working groups of people in intimate and extended circumstances, bringing them forward to public view, even with brevity does create stimulating contemplation of just how to take the man. As to the choreographer, though quite unable to make an  informed comparison with others of his period, Teachout makes a fair case for Balanchine being a man whose work all who enjoy watching dance would want to see. In fact, as is true in my case, you might be sufficiently interested as to collect a number of other biographical works both on the Master and some of his students.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYBYR31E1XEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151010889#wasThisHelpful","RYBYR31E1XEF","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charlotte MacLeod's Peter Shandy leads the reader on an amusing chase for the villain who 'did in' a quite boring and entirely irritating retired Professor. More than likely he and most of his colleagues, including the redoubtable College President, would likely have let the incident pass unnoticed if it did not seem likely to cast a shadow upon their beloved university. For there was an election of importance to the University in  process and nefarious forces somehow associated with the event seemed bent upon damaging public  opinion with regard to its students and policies. A further murder reinforces the President's determination that Professor Shandy provide aid and comfort to the seemingly bumbling sheriff who proves to be capable of rising to the occasion under the tutelage and with the support of the academic who has, through chance, become something of a crime fighting legend on campus.Readers of the series will have some advantage in appreciating this visit to New England but others should be able to find almost equal pleasure in the book. There is nothing here to awaken deeper sources of personal anxiety or raise momentous issues of crime and punishment. The author seeks only to entertain without recourse to often ugly and disturbing reality nor the sexuality which adorns many current mysteries. In this book she succeeds pretty well in achieving that objective.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C5OY6L6JVE5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009S33L7E#wasThisHelpful","R2C5OY6L6JVE5Y","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book just after viewing my disc of The Hard Nut for the second time, appreciating much more than the first time, the distinctiveness of so much of the dancing. It is well worth reading but be aware before buying that it is really just Mark Morris Part I since it was written when he was just about 35 years of age and had a lifetime of mature work ahead of him. It does, however, do a very good job within that limited scope, ably covering his youthful experiences as well the early stages of his career, the nature of his approach and the difficulties he faced in the now somewhat famous  Danish period when he played to often hostile houses and critics. I should be clear that the lack of a five star rating is due only to the limitations for the reader interested in a single book covering his entire career to date rather than for any failings on the part of the author. It is excellent for the period it does cover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S359RHHRIW12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374202958#wasThisHelpful","R2S359RHHRIW12","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In fact, aside from the brief excerpt from the year 2000 at the very end, it is quite nicely designed to provide quite an entertaining mixture of voices and content.Americans might be particularly interesting in the sometimes thrilling arias from Neil Shicoff  in this period wherein he is seeking to overcome the emotional and vocal problems which torpedoed his rapid movement into the higher circles of American opera. (Brooklyn born, Julliard educated he had made great strides, including performances at the Met in NY, when various forces came together to earn him a reputation as an unreliable and uncertain cast member. In the years since, beginning about the years covered in this disc, he rebuilt his reputation in Europe which allowed him then to be once more accepted in the best of the American companies.)There is sparkling work by other singers, male and female, as well, of course, as a number of good but run of the mill turns. Included, inevitably to the bemusement of those old enough to have been  around when the Older Germany still existed, was a number from Fiddler on the Roof, sung stylishly by Kurt Rydl.So, given the wide range of concerts available at a rather high prices, you might think twice about this one (no price given here), but if the price is a reasonable one, I think the average viewer will find they have purchased the ingredients for a most  entertaining evening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0HWW3DHNLXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP9D5Z2#wasThisHelpful","R2I0HWW3DHNLXB","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a quarter century of David Suchet portraying Hercule Poirot with such perfection, it is a bit difficult to return to the original from which his character emerges. Nonetheless, Agatha Christies, late in her career. still was able to take me in hand, so to speak, and make the text speak to me with her voice not that of the fine British actor who made her character live on television. This is a rather simple story, overall, beginning with the murder of a pre-teen age girl at a party. Was the precipitating event her saying earlier at the  party that she had once seen a murder done? Was this congenital liar, in fact, telling the truth this time? Visiting his friend, Ariadne, Poirot takes up the case, which leads him into the past as well the present of the small, peaceful village. This is not the last murder accomplished or attempted that enters into his purview,  but, baffling as they are, he pursues his investigations with the ruthless calm for which he is known.This is a book written late in the day by the Mistress of British Crime Writing but it still has vigor, character and the gift for clarity which marks her style. Not a classic, it should be good reading for those who have a taste for mysteries that lack cuteness, sexiness, or the grime of the city streets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332QDWWO7TXKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC122I#wasThisHelpful","R332QDWWO7TXKS","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm  only a few books from having read all the Chalmers series that Kindle offers. While not among the best series in the genre, I always find them a good read when I am not ready for intricate plotting and full blown character development. Chalmers is a decent sort of guy, college professor in a third rate British university, esteemed by his colleagues and available when  the authorities above him are in need of a steady hand at the tiller with the intelligence to handle difficult situations. This book tackles a rather bizarre set of events in which the stealing of the magna carta is threatened by the head of a criminal organization which masks itself as the exponent of a political cause. Our hero is drawn into the affair because of his connection with  MI5, a British security agency, and his academic standing. Readers of previous works will be familiar with his Dean and his girlfriend who play some role in this book as well. Questions of forgery and theft arise. Some may find these a bit incredible...but it if you can go along with the premise, it is good fun.All in all, not among the best in the series---but pleasant reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UIS78F3N56I9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VC146EC#wasThisHelpful","R2UIS78F3N56I9","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Julie Smith is a reliable author of mysteries and the first three Rebecca Schwartz entries were well done light stories. This, too, is worth reading if you like any of the earlier books or some of her other numerous works. The large role played by children somewhat diminished my pleasure in the same way as too much emphasis on dogs, cats or spirits does. That's a personal quirk. Actually, in her characterization of one of the mothers who plays a central  role in the story, she has created one of her more complex and interesting figures. Less stress is placed on the heroines religious affiliations than in previous works but that is neither a positive nor negative factor. Naturally, the heroines love life or absence of same is important to the story as one expects it will be throughout the series.This is understandable since the majority of readers for the genre are female.Without treading on ground which should be untouched, it does no harm, I think, to let you know that the ending is rather more intense than one might have expected from the earlier sections.This work is not as generally favored by reviewers as are some of her others. As one who read the previous three in the series, I liked it. As is not unusual, you will have to be guided by your own judgment of the reviews.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5ALYB8A2DMX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OVDMJM#wasThisHelpful","R5ALYB8A2DMX9","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The mystery here is why this should be called a mystery. By none of the normal standards which apply to the categorization of contemporary books does this qualify for the label. That is why I assigned the lowest rating I have ever given  (or felt is justifiable) for this author who is one of my  favorites. It is an interesting book if you have a penchant for historic New Englanders and/or New England churches. The story of how and why a new church was built in a Massachusetts community in 1868 has its merits. The search of the Kelly's for churches previously unknown and/or with a unique, distinctive or appealing feature for his new book on churches seems more a justification for the book than an intrinsic part of it.In sum, the reader who has purchased the book  expecting to find a crime of some sort and its solution by the redoubtable Homer Kelly will spend the entire book looking ....and never finding it. They might find the book interesting, none the less.  I can offer no hypothesis as to why the estimable Langton chose to end the series of eighteen volumes in this mysterious manner.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B1WXP2E0AMYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078XH5T6#wasThisHelpful","R1B1WXP2E0AMYC","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given that this is the catalog for the first traveling exhibition of any part of the Barnes collection, the emphasis on Renoir, Cezanne and Matisse is understandable. As I recall, under the very strict terms of Dr. Barnes' Will, color reproductions, external exhibitions, admission prices, and a host of other matters were detailed and binding upon the trustees. By 1990, the roof was leaking badly and building maintenance, generally, as well as the maintenance of the collection, threatened the very existence of paintings and other artifacts which comprised one of the jewels of Art in America. While modestly wealthy in his day, Barnes did not leave sufficient funds to insure the quality of collection forever. At this point, the Trustees went to the Orphan's Court, which governs such matters in the legal jurisdiction within which the Building exists, and received permission to undertake an traveling exhibition. It, in turn, netted them about ten million dollars, which apparently paid for meeting immediate needs. It was considered a great success. (As most know,  ultimately the Trustees sought and received permission from the same Court to move the entire collection to a building to be located in Philadelphia where it would be far more accessible (under further altered terms of the Will accepted by the Court) and thus capable of earning sufficient funds for present and future needs.One consequence of decision in the 1990's we have this excellent volume, giving a distorted picture of the collection, with its emphasis on the most 'salable' Masters, but still one most lay readers will enjoy. The reproductions are good, each major one being accompanied by a brief explanatory essay, no more difficult to grasp than would be a guided tour in the average museum. Those who know of how Dr. Barnes made Soutine's career and almost single handedly saved him the impoverished state in which he lives, would like to have seen more work by him. However, for the general art public, certainly the emphasis alluded to previously, on Renoir, Cezanne and Matisse, is justifiable and well worth the price of admission.I can't speak for or to specialists in art history, but for the layman, the book is a worthwhile reading experience and one with reproductions which will repay the occasional further leafing through its pages over the years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLSQY5S15T8DD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679762213#wasThisHelpful","RLSQY5S15T8DD","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second time I've watched the disc but the first time I noticed that men were dancing traditional female parts costumed as were the women dancing these same parts. Morris gives his version of why this occurs. I did not watch the interview first time out. Whether or not one can accept his explanation as the ""real"" truth of it, the fact is that it makes not the remotest difference in watching the disc or, I imagine, for any member of the audience beyond the first few rows. No doubt it was, and still is,  an issue for those who make an issue of such matters, but should have no impact on the average viewers enjoyment of a quite novel approach to the Nutcracker.I leave to the expert reviewers discussion of technical matters, I speak only to those like me, someone who watches for the same reason I watched The Nicholas Brothers, Fred Astaire and other stars of stage and screen, it is entertaining, touching or exhilarating, exciting or romantic. I was lucky enough to be working in NYC when Balanchine was still viewable for the attainable price of a City sponsoredcompany, but, over the years, have learned more about dancers but not enough about dancing than is required of a naive member of the audience. Limited to discs these days, I still watch because it is fun, entertaining, exciting and romantic.From this naive viewpoint, I speak only to the similarly endowed (or, I suppose, unendowed). This is fun, there is excitement, there is a touch of romance,  the costumes are vivid, the performances seem to be top notch for what is required, and the sets are eminently appropriate.  After all, it is not an either-or situation: one can watch Morris' interpretation and a classical one and enjoy both (or neither). Those who  have not given this a chance may be missing a couple of hours of pleasure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIMB1MTDOAEC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VWX6TY#wasThisHelpful","RIMB1MTDOAEC6","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suppose I cannot give new younger readers advice on these books by Phoebe Taylor which I  read and enjoyed many decades ago and am now re-reading. Her works are not classics of the mystery genre. They are light, mildly amusing tales built around a central ""character"" which have no objective other than to entertain without  inducing sober reflections. I enjoy the characters, in this case, the redoubtable engineer and man of a all work for the Porter Motorcar Company and  its founders Family, the New Englander to the core, Asey Mayo. In this book, Asey's good friend, the  Village doctor has found a body....which has disappeared by the time he has been able to call for help...Asey responds to the call and encounters a group of  young College students doing a site visit in town. There are complications galore and a tricky ending all of which add to the fun.All in all, a good one for reading when not in the mood for contemplation or the seamy side of life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1097GZ53YKDPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008C1T03C#wasThisHelpful","R1097GZ53YKDPA","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice contemporary British Mansion mystery. Time is early fifties. Wounded British agent and his 13 year old  daughter are billeted in said mansion....or is it a castle, which hasn't long to survive, for at the end of the seven year waiting period before its owner, who disappeared four years previous, will be declared dead, and his heir will sell it. Nearby is a barely masked secret government facility in which data is processed which is used, among other things, to uncover secret agents for the Soviet. It is to this agency that the agent is assigned. First thing to confront him upon arrival is a newly discovered corpse buried on the premises. Not only is it a who dun it but a why was it done as well.Aside from well designed portraits of the agent and his  precocious daughter, there are a number of other interesting characters in the mix as well as a small ex-urban British community. The author pretty well conveys the flavor  of the classic British mystery school, including the political powerful with exalted pride in Self and the connivance of government with  law enforcement agencies to keep official secrets and the misbehavior of elites under  the covers.Should be a good read for those who have a taste for the traditional of the mystery genre as well as those with a taste for the non-saccharin  'cozy'.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25WAXQYKPXWQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUGL1AG#wasThisHelpful","R25WAXQYKPXWQO","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third of the Kelling and Bittersohn books in her series about the now impoverished widow of one of Boston's Blue Bloods and a Jewish art theft investigator. Previously we have learned about the former's marriage to a man old enough to be her father and then her establishment of a Boarding House in the mansion in which they had lived. Somewhere along the way, he has come to live in the house but their romance has progressed slowly because of her views on how soon a bereaved spouse can undertake a full-blooded new romance. Of course, in both previous books murder has somehow been visited to someone who has been in interaction with her. The same, of course, is true of this book which  opens with the fall from the upper balcony of one of Boston's landmark museums. The almost couple are attending an event there and, inevitably find themselves, even though somewhat remotely, caught up in the event. That is not the end of their involvement, however, for other events follow which tie them into the life....and death...of the museum.Readers of other works in the series will know the author to be a skilled story teller and adept writer. While there is plenty of action, the book is not for those looking for tough guy antics, teasing sexuality or suspenseful adventure. There is a leavening of humor, some colorful characters, an interesting plot and an appealing heroine. It is a series in which there is a progressive development in the lives of the characters involved rather than the Rex Stout Nero Wolfe books in which there is some progression from one book to another but where each of the central characters remain essentially the same over the decades.I enjoyed these book on first reading and find them equally appealing some decades later. New readers can jump right in with this book without missing much since necessary background is sketched in. If you afford it, and find your first taste acceptable, you are likely to develop a desire to go  back to book one  and continue from there. On the other hand, as I pointed out, those seeking taut action, high suspense or descriptive sexuality, should look elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I9OLV4U17H1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0099IHEC6#wasThisHelpful","R3I9OLV4U17H1L","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This second volume of the Sarah Kelling-Max Bittersohn mystery series carries forward the life of now widowed Sarah as working proprietor of a rooming house in what was once the mansion in which she lived with her now deceased husband and mother-in-law. Once again, murder strikes her household and, once again, Max is there for her to rely upon to carry the investigative burden.It all begins when her most offensive renters falls from a subway platform to his death. Was one among her other paying guests in some way responsible. What did she really know about them? Would the publicity kill her little venture before it has a chance to build roots? There are surprises, indeed, as both she and Max pursue the truth.As always MacLeod provides a well-written text with characters into whom she instills distinctive characteristics which are revealed as her  interesting story unfolds. This is good reading for those who have not read the first volume of the series, better for those who have.  I have read all twelve of the books,  with pleasure, and many in the three other series she authored, as well as the occasional independent work she produced. Of course, they vary in quality but all are quite readable. They are not  for the reader who seeks adventure, ardent sexuality, tough, gun-toting heroes, or the gritty streets of blighted urban areas, In today's lexicon, her works fall into the category of ""cozy""...but I would prefer to identify them with the British tradition of Christie and her like (or their American counterparts of the teens and twenties of the last century).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O8E0BBEWEW4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A39GHT6#wasThisHelpful","R2O8E0BBEWEW4X","A2VJ80PM1G00QV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VJ80PM1G00QV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Carp in the Bathtub is a great tale by Barbara Cohen and wonderfully illustrated by Joan Halpern.  It harkens back to the late 19th and early 20th century when Jews lived in tenements in New York.  Leah, the little girl who tells the story, and her brother Harry decide one year that the carp who is living in their bathtub for the week before Passover is their pet.  At the time, it was common practice to buy a live fish in advance of the holiday and keep it alive until cooked into gefilte fish.This story teaches about Jewish life at the time, but it also centers on a brother and sister who become aware of other animals and concerns for their welfare.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R365UC12W0OU7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0930494679#wasThisHelpful","R365UC12W0OU7U","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With taller ceilings, lights, fixtures and smoke alarms, often I have needed to use my step ladder to access, clean or fix.  2-step stools just don't give me enough height extension.  This Rubbermaid 3-step stool is fantastic.  It is surprisingly light, less than 9 lbs!  Each time I go to pick it up, I am expecting something much heavier, and it flies into the air.  It is even lighter than my shorter 2-step stools.  The secret is it the aluminum that is very strong, but does not weigh much.  That being said, when you climb up, it feels very stable.  The top step is 34 inches off the ground, which gives a 5 foot 6 inch person (like this reviewer), over a 9 foot reach.

"Skillful cartoonist Gavin Aung Than adapts inspirational writings of a wide variety of people into cartoon vignettes in this collection of his comics.  The writings come from Isaac Asimov to Sir Ken Robinson, from The Dalai Lama to William Shakespeare.  For each of the stories, Than subtly shifts his drawing style to match the theme as well as the setting.His poignant depiction of Albert Camus's love story in 'The Middle of Winter' contrasts with persistent effort of George Mallory in 'Because It's There'.  Percy Shelley's famous poem 'Ozymandias' leaps out of the page as does Kahlil Gibran's 'Work is Love Made Visible'.  With each story, Than rapidly draws us into each world, and breathes life into the text with his original drawings.  Than is able to entertain while at the same time reinforcing the messages from the authors.The themes of many of these episodes overlap and blend with Than's autobiographical stories.  They call upon us to be true to our own nature, to set out on our own and to make a difference in the world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EMHAH6ITCFCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449471927#wasThisHelpful","R1EMHAH6ITCFCG","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Photographer Eilon Paz captures the world of obsessive vinyl record collectors. He photographed them with their collections. Often they are displaying specific records that have emotional or musical importance to the collector.We see the mundane mixed in with the weird and the wonderful. Saw blade edged records and obscure Turkish psychedelia. The collectors live around the world and come from all walks of life. In addition to Paz's engrossing photographs, many of which, take up a 2 page spread, we get a variety of short essays and interviews (which are also well-illustrated) with 13 of these obsessive collectors.  These give us insight into this fascinating world.The unique and varied LP album cover art often plays a critical role in these images and in the collections.This beautiful book is fun to leaf through. It is an immersive experience.

"This Bissell Multi-Cyclonic Vacuum is fantastic.  It is compact, quiet (relatively), and has great suction power.  I use it primarily on a hard wood floor.  Granted we don't have a challenging environment, but the Multi-Cyclonic easily removes the every day detritus that we encounter.  It is much quieter than any of the other equivalently sized vacuums that I have used.The regular vacuum extension wand, telescopes from 18 to 31 inches.  The large wheels on the vacuum unit make it easy to maneuver around.  And of course, who doesn't like the spring-powered plug rewinder (why more appliances, besides vacuums, don't have these I often wonder).  In addition to the efficient Turbine Hard Floor tool, the vacuum comes with a Multi-Surface Floor Nozzle, Crevice Tool (of course), Dusting Brush, and Upholstery toolThe vacuum unit is quite compact, which makes it easy to carry as well as to store.  Being a bag less vacuum has positive and negative aspects.  It is a little more involved to clean than a bagged vacuum, but the dirt cup easily comes apart into to hits components when you need to clean a little more than when you routinely dump the dirt cup.  However, on the plus side, you never have to worry about buying bags, finding the rest size bags, because like ink jet printers, it seems that each vacuum uses a different sized bag.  You just vacuum away.This is a versatile vacuum, that will help keep your house or apartment shiny and clean.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RXI6UVR8PIYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OORUCW#wasThisHelpful","R1RXI6UVR8PIYQ","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was looking for a simple, yet stylish CD player (yes, some of us still play CDs) for the bedroom.  The Panasonic SC-HC38 is a winner on a number of fronts.  It's slim design (although 20 inches long) does not take up a huge foot print.  The sound is actually pretty good for a compact system. Much better than the Sony model it replaced.  Loading CDs is simple, as the central panel slides to the side to allow you to vertically mount the CD.  You can control this system with a simple remote, so you do not need to get out of a chair or bed.  There is an FM (no AM) tuner built in.  You can also charge/play our iPod, but for most flexibility, it can play music using Bluetooth connectivity.This is a great, versatile compact music system.

"I have used a variety of travel and vacuum mugs previously, and Aladdin has them all beat.  First and foremost function is most important, but then other factors of aesthetics play in.  I drink coffee and tea, and want it to stay hot.  Because Aladdin has a vacuum layer, hot stays hot for at least 4 hours (and continues to stay warm for even longer).  It can keep beverages cold for 24 hours, much longer than I would ever need.  So this mug is great for temperature control.Equally important is the drinking experience.  I have used Thermos travel mugs that have a 2 partial slits at 180 degrees from each other. If drink for the opening drinks flow well.  If you are not looking when you pick up the Thermos mug and drink from a different place a mess can ensue.  With Aladdin there is but one way to drink from the top of the mug.  The opening is the right size and fits my mouth.  There is a tab for sealing close the drinking opening, and it serves as a protective covering to keep it clean.  Once closed, no drinks will leak out during transport.The sides of the mug are tapered to the middle where you would naturally pick it up.  This makes it easy to lift, hold, and drink.  The stainless steel has a nice feel to it.  The Marina (blue/green) color is more interesting than most, but also understated. Finally, with it being dishwasher safe, clean up is a cinch.This is a fantastic insulated mug.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRX36REUKMDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142JR5YI#wasThisHelpful","RRX36REUKMDR","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We all have a classmate who was voted ""Most Likely to be Weaponized"" in our high school yearbook, because of his ""emanations.""Alas, the same odoriferous expulsions can happen to any of us.The day after a particularly large steak dinner, our feces may smell so bad that a lion would be ashamed to release this into the environment.  This can be particularly embarrassing, if you have just passed your judgment on the porcelain throne generating a caustic cloud in the restroom at work and your boss comes in just as you (the only one there) leave the stall.

You go to their bathroom, and find the fan to be a feeble excuse for pushing a couple molecules of air around.  Your dung smells like a dead rat has been rotting for a month.  You notice that the glade is empty and the potpourri is completely overwhelmed.  As you exit the bathroom as quickly as possible, you encounter you host and several friends.  Their faces turn, involuntarily, to horror as the get a whiff of something so vile they cannot imagine a human produced it.  For some reason, invitations to other parties stop coming.To prevent destroying the nasal cavities of your co-workers, friends and family, you need Poo-pourri.  This cleverly formulated toilet scent works wonders.  Simply spritz 3-5 times the Poo-Pourri into the bowl before you go about your business.  Poo-pourri does double duty by forming a layer of oil that creates a chemical block to trap the nasty smells and prevent their release into the air.  It also contains pleasant vanilla and mint scents that perfume the air.Poo-pourri works wonders.

"If you want an in-depth, detailed guide to your Apple Watch, look no further than Marc Saltzman's Apple Watch for Dummies (I do dislike the ""Dummies"" title though).  For the reader who has newly acquired an Apple Watch, Saltzman methodically takes you through set-up, its features, and all the Apple apps.  Then, it serves, as well, as a useful guide to go back to since there is only so much you can soak up in one, or even several sessions.  What helps this book to excel, is that it is also useful for those of us who have had our watches for a few months.  Saltzman includes loads of insights, small tricks, embedded features, and even exercises to help you discover and remember these features, for example using Siri on your watch to read incoming texts, or having Siri calculate your tip.Saltzman is not content to just give you a set of instructions.  He explains why the watch apps work they do and what is happening behind the scenes.  This gives you a better understanding and more control of your watch.  There are many illustrations and screen shots to help you see what is happening and what you need to do. There are a few 3rd party app recommendations, but of course, since the Apple Store is so dynamic, there are always new 3rd party apps appearing.This is a great manual for the Apple Watch. Wisely, Saltzman focuses on the native Apple apps, and his book will give you mastery over these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EWQD226M7LH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111905205X#wasThisHelpful","R2EWQD226M7LH7","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ET-2500 is a great start-up printer.  It is a bit pricier than a regular inkjet printer, but with a new type of liquid ink that is designed to last 2 years, instead of an inkjet's 2 months.  It seems a bit of a turn around from the inkjet business model of cheap printers as a way to sell expensive ink cartridges. The ink in the Expression series is liquid, and requires you to fill the tanks during initial set-up.  The instructions advise you to use disposable gloves. This is wise.Set-up of this printer was extremely easy.  You need to add the ink, which takes a little care.  Then, you need to have the printer prime the system.  You price a few buttons, and walk away for 20 minutes.  Then, the set-up is quick and easy.  You download and install the driver software.  I am using mine on the wi-fi network.  The driver looks for the printer, grabs your network information from your computer and you are ready to go.Like with many printers, you can opt for a fast mode. It takes only a few seconds per page (depending on what you are printing), and this is the most common mode that I use.  If you are printing photographs, you can use a higher quality mode.  This takes much longer, but results in excellent resolution.There are buttons for color or black and white copying.  Once again, it is really easy to copy single pages.  The scanner runs off Epson's software. It is not flashy, but does all the standard functions I need in a scanner.The ET-2500 has a reasonable footprint.  It is roughly 12 inches deep, by 19.5 inches long by 6 inches high.  However, it is not a rectangular box.  The paper is fed from a vertical tray in the rear.  My other printers have all been much bigger, but they are large paper-capacity all-in-ones or dedicated high quality printers.The ET-2500 is the lowest model in the Expression series.  It does not have have a bottom tray feeder, double-sided printing or AirPrint support (it does support Epson's proprietary mobile system).  If these features are important, you may wish to consider a different model. Otherwise, you will save money on ink jet cartridges with no quality compromise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVHDKYLA99G0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JHMG#wasThisHelpful","RXVHDKYLA99G0","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One might think the smartphone and tablet age would make pencils obsolete.  Of course, anyone with school age children know that it is anything but that.  So, it is great to have not only functional, but aesthetically interesting pencil sharpeners.  With its blend of pear and cylindrical, the Westcott iPoint almost looks like an LED light bulb at first glance.  The see-through type allows children (and adults) to watch the shavings flying off your pencil as it gets quickly sharpened.  Powered by 4 AA batteries, the iPoint has an auto-shutoff so you don't waste energy and overly grind down your pencils. And also being battery powered, you can carry it wherever you need it.The iPoint delivers a sharp pencil point quickly.  The shape of the grinding face gives you a bit shorter shaved area than many others, but that is more a subjective preference than a functional one.

"Karen Bergreen gives an absurdist mystery in her debut novel Following Polly.  After losing her job working at a casting agency run by the quirky Mona Hawkins, Alice Teakle runs into a Harvard classmate, the incredibly popular Polly Dawson.  For reasons rooted in her dysfunctional childhood (her father and brother had died in a plane crash, her mother suffered a nervous breakdown, and Alice had to raise herself until her mother met and married Barnes when Alice was an adolescent), Alice starts to follow Polly around New York for obsessive reasons.  After Polly is murdered and discovered by Alice, she becomes a prime suspect.  Fleeing from police interrogation, Alice, after stalking (there is a theme here), teams up with another classmate, Charlie, with whom she has been infatuated since freshman year. As Charlie and Alice try to discover the identity of the murderer with help of Alice's best friend Jean, they lurch from one absurd situation to another.  One marvel's at Bergreen's clever twists and turns of plot.  No normal people would behave this way, which is exactly why we love this story.  It is like watching a train wreck of crazy people.  You can't pull your eyes away, nor can you believe what they will do next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T34UY9JBCTB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JTHYCQ#wasThisHelpful","R2T34UY9JBCTB1","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Geraldine Brooks breaths life into the story of the King David.  Using the Bible as a jumping off point, Brooks starts with David's youth and brings us through his life.  We get a complex character full of contradictions who is can be both noble and self-serving.  The story is told through voice of Natan, the prophet.  This gives us the advantage of an intimate view, and at the same time external that can present the good with the bad.From his early life as a cruel bandit, through his fighting years to kingship.  David often perpetrates and is surrounded by violence.  At the same time, there is affection and love.  Indeed, the most controversial part of this book is David's relationship with Yonatan, only hinted at in the Bible. But this is Brooks's gift - her ability to develop a historical novel that is firmly set in the Biblical era, yet written with a modern sensibility that will appeal to a broad swath of readers.  Moreover, she is able to shed greater light on internal motivations that drive these characters to commit many of the acts that are only flatly told in the Bible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK4Z47NJ1LPCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025771#wasThisHelpful","RK4Z47NJ1LPCS","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

To make up for this and boost the sweetness, they have added monk fruit extract, a source of natural non-caloric sweetener.  And to give this drink the mouth feel you would get from fat, Skinny Cow has added a variety of gels (cellulose and carrageenan) and gums (gellan and cellulose).The coffee flavor is mild in this drink.If you are looking for an easy way to satisfy a quick latte craving, keep a couple of these in your refrigerator.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RALQLJ1IEUF2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S79RN7Y#wasThisHelpful","RALQLJ1IEUF2N","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Journalist David Eimer gives us a fascinating book that covers ground rarely discussed in the usual Westerner-Goes-to-China genre, that of the far-flung regions of China and the minorities who live there.  The title comes from one of the famous Chinese chengyu (short sayings) that translates as ""The mountains are high and the emperor is far away"". It is used to describe remote, lawless regions.  And for some places the Eimer journeys to, the description is still apt. Eimer travels to the far Northwest - Xinjiang, the Southeast - Yunnan, the Northeast - collectively known as Dongbei.  These are not regions that are particularly easy for tourists.  For the most part, Eimer is traveling to small towns where even the basic amenities of a hotel room, of sorts, and restaurant can be few and far between, not to mention his often inventive means at obtaining transport.Eimer is a keen observationalist, and his humor-inflected writing flows naturally.  One observation about certain dire pit toilets and how they could induce constipation in one suffering from dysentery; well, you don't get an image much more vivid then that.Eimer mixes his travelogue's tales with the history and anthropology of the region he is visiting.  Thus, when in Yunnan, not only do learn about the various ethnic groups, but also, the history of Han migration to the region, the Golden Triangle drug trade, fluidity of cross border traffic (indeed the borders have been redrawn numerous times in history ignoring that various ethnic groups are not defined by political borders),  human trafficking, relationship between the ethnic groups and the Han, and more.  Always, in each place, Eimer also highlights the life stories of people he meets along the way, some intentional, some happenstance encounters.  These personal stories enliven and inform the historical information.Although Eimer brings fresh and honest eyes to Tibet and Xinjiang, I was more intrigued by his visits to the less written about Northeast provinces where ethnic Koreans and ethnic Russians live alongside other ethnic groups and Han Chinese.  The harsh climate has not prevented a robust trade with neighboring countries (Russia and North Korea) to create a strong economic engine for Chinese growth.  In tropical Yunnan, which has half of China's 55 recognized ethnic groups, one, the Dai, had their own kingdom for hundreds of years until it was folded into China in the 1950s. Then there is the Wa state in Myanmar (where they have achieved a country-like independence),  and the Wa people have thrived, moving freely across the border to the benefit of people in both countries.In each of the regions, we see the struggle for the local ethnic groups to maintain their identity. Through intermarriage, national educational policies, and internal migration, many of these groups are losing their languages and unique customs.  In the more remote regions, not being exploited for natural resources, it is easier because of less government oversight, or import of Han Chinese to maintain some of the traditional practices.  However, these regions also tend to be areas of extreme rural poverty.In addition to being pulled into and entertained by Eimer's meanderings, I learned a lot about China that is often not discussed in other books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRI3K0KT3MILX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLNSNSY#wasThisHelpful","RRI3K0KT3MILX","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aimed at late elementary school/early middle school kids, Upside Down Magic uses 5th graders at a magical school to tell the allegory of how differences should be celebrated and not suppressed  The writing triumvirate of Susan Mlynowski, Lauren Myracle and Emily Jenkins brings us the story of Nory Horace, the youngest of child of 3.  Her older samplings Hawthorn and Dalia attend the elite magic school Sage Academy, where their father is the headmaster.  The magic world is divided into 5 classes of abilities - Fluxers, who can change their form into animals or other objects; Flickers, who make things disappear, Flares, who can set things on fire; Flyers, who can levitate and fly; and Fuzzies, who can attract and control animals.Nory is a Fluxer, but has trouble controlling her shape-shifting, often appearing as hybrid animals like the bitten, a beaver-kitten hybrid.  Then, she often loses control of the animal part and destroys things.  After failing the Sage Academy admissions test, Nory is rather cruelly packed up and sent to live with her Aunt Margo to the attend the public school, Dunwiddle School. In the Upside Down Magic class, Nory meets other kids who have similar issues with their magic.  They have a teacher who uses unorthodox approaches to deal with their unorthodox magical abilities.The authors use this story as a jumping off point to deal with common middle school issues of belonging, being normal, friendship and more. The morality story comes through that not only is it okay to be different, but it can be a great advantage in life.  Whereas with conformity you lose a bit of yourself.  If there is one complaint, it is the excessive use of the term wonky, meant to mean things that are unsteady and askew.This is a fun story for late elementary readers.  The story moves along quickly so they will not be bored.  The lesson is not heavy-handed, so kids will learn while being entertained.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33E57I6MIEUGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545800455#wasThisHelpful","R33E57I6MIEUGO","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Always looking for something to make carrying my camera easier, I bought this for my Sony RX100.  Phone cameras may be handy, but they lack many of the features of higher end point and shoot camera.  So, I want my RX100 to be as easy to grab and at hand as my iPhone. The Spider Holster performed just as promised.  The main section, is a sturdy plastic holder that you loop your belt through.  You can use either on the right or left.  Then you attach the metal pin into the tripod mounting socket at the bottom of your camera.  The pin is tightened with the included wrench (you do not want the pin to come loose while walking).  The pin slips easily into the holster, and your camera dangles on the side.  To get your camera, you merely, push down on the red release switch with one hand, while picking up the camera with your other.This holster is very comfortable with a point and shoot.  Much better than carrying on your shoulder or around your neck.  Yet, it is just as handy as these more conventional carrying styles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F3SW3DWVOC8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TGR7VG#wasThisHelpful","R1F3SW3DWVOC8T","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For awhile, I had been searching around for a scale that in the spirit of what measures gets improved, would sink with your i-device.  The Vitasigns VS-3200 measures your weight and % body fat, and then syncs the information to your iPhone or iPad, via blue tooth.  It does a great job on the scale, and is very consistent.  For the % body fat, because it runs a weak electric current through you, your feet need to be slightly moist.As much as I like the scale, the app is very so-so.  It is an iPhone app, and does not have a native iPad version. Because I use my iPad, I am usually viewing at a 2x size.  You need to have the app on your phone on, when the scale is sending a bluetooth signal (at the end of weighing, for only a few seconds).  It would be nice if there were a button to tap, to download stored data to your iPhone/iPad.  Otherwise you need to be poised to receive the data immediately.  The Vitasigns app has a few nice features, but the interface is a little clumsy at times, and is sorely in need of an upgrade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3746TU3CKGSWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8QBB1E#wasThisHelpful","R3746TU3CKGSWG","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"British singer/songwriter, multi-instrumentalist Eliza Carthy shines on this album.  She is often called a British folk singer, but this recording has a much more contemporary feel to both the harmonies and the lyrics.  Some of the songs deal with the darker side of love 'Train Song' and 'In the Company of Love'.  Others are introspective 'Poor Little Me'.  The narrative lyrics wrap us in the emotional tales of the songs.  Carthy's superb alto voice is complemented by her band's virtuosic performances. Their use of British folk sounds updated for the 21st century give a sonic landscape that sounds comfortingly familiar while being simultaneously innovative and modern.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHJ9BFPQLTQAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004YL12#wasThisHelpful","RHJ9BFPQLTQAL","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you think of instrumental duos, the violin and guitar do not immediately leap to mind.  Yet, after listening to the Lyrical Strings Duo, composed of Czech violinist Lucia Conrad and guitarist Stephen Osserman, they seem like a completely natural combination.  Perhaps it is the bowed soprano voice of the violin that when combined with the strummed tenor of the guitar offers the right amount of contrast and complementation to result in a beautiful sound.Conrad and Osserman have cleverly solved the problem of the limited violin-guitar repertoire by creating their own arrangements on this Kickstarter-funded debut album.  The focus of this album is Romantic piano music, whose complex harmonies and sophisticated rhythms gain a new footing on the violin and guitar.  If you were not familiar with the originals, you might not realize that these pieces are transcriptions. The works range from Chopin 'Nocturnes' to Mendelssohn's 'Songs Without Words' to Kreisler's 'La Gitana' to Satie's 'Gymnopedie'.Conrad and Osserman's performance stirs the soul.  Their heartfelt playing brings out the deep emotional content in these works.  Although titled ""Evening Songs"" for some of the darker elements embodied in these works, this is a great album to listen to any part of the day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZD5J6B63ESY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XICGS0#wasThisHelpful","R1ZD5J6B63ESY4","A3H8PA7AG48K33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3H8PA7AG48K33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is of the pocket mug.I wasn't quite sure how I would use this mug but it has become a new favorite. I like using it for tea. I can fill it with hot water and use the pocket for a lemon slice. I don't get to use it much as the kids think it's the best way to have milk and cookies. The pocket holds one homemade chocolate chip cookie or three biscoff biscuits. I have a feeling that although it's a piece that coordinates with our Christmas china we will be leaving it out all year. The quality is excellent, on par with our other Lenox pieces. It's a fun piece to add to a larger collection but is a stand alone piece and would work just as well as a Christmastime addition to a group of everyday mugs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSCI23R852UQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TV5HIMS#wasThisHelpful","RSCI23R852UQW","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The winter greetings pieces and the holiday pieces coordinate with each other to create a more interesting table. The bowl itself is good quality, on par with our other Lenox pieces. It went through the dishwasher no problem and didn't scratch when I used a metal serving spoon. The size is good for all around use. It's a nice bowl for side dishes at larger dinner parties but is shaped so as it can be use for smaller quantities as well. The only thing I wish I had was a lid.

It come through the dishwasher no problem and while we're using it more as a serving plate I ate a meal off it, cutting food with a knife and fork, and it works fine for that purpose.

"Overall I'm very impressed with this sweater. The quality and workmanship is top notch. I'd say it fits a bit large but I've been wearing it over fitted t shirts. If you're wearing it as a coat over a heavier top it should be just right. While there's some give to it I wouldn't size down unless you're sure you'll only wear it over fitted shirts.The fit is a bit boxy but has a feminine look with the side buttons and neck. There is a lot of room in the waist and hips as the buttons are all up towards the top, including the hidden button to help keep it closed. It would be a great piece for a woman to wear while pregnant if she'd like a sweater jacket that can carry her through the pregnancy while still being a functional piece of clothing after the baby comes. I've found it to be nice for nursing too. I can unbutton the top and use the extra material around the neck for privacy.The one thing I don't like is the feel of the wool. It's scratchy, no two ways about it. It would be perfect if it was knitted from softer wool. I can't stand to wear it with short sleeves underneath and my little one refuses to lay on my shoulder when I have it on. I had expected a softer feel as it's labeled as being merino wool. I lanolized it when I washed it which seemed to help soften it somewhat. I'm still happy with it but every time I put it on I wish it was a bit softer.I just wanted to add my wash routine for this sweater:I handwash it in water that is neither cold nor warm with a soap called eucalan. It says it doesn't have to be rinsed but I like to rinse it anyway. I then take a walnut sized dollop of lanolin and put it in a jar with a very hot water and a drop or two of the soap (some people melt the lanolin in the microwave). I then shake it until it becomes a cloudy liquid. This liquid is then poured into the sink which has the sweater and fresh water. I let it sit for 20 minutes or so although some people go up to overnight soaks. I gently squeeze it dry then put in in the washer for a spin cycle. Then I dry it flat after reshaping it. The lanolin is a product that comes off the wool of sheep. It not only softens the fibers but makes them water and stain resistant as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N32WE4YSSDPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WEDCDJ2#wasThisHelpful","R2N32WE4YSSDPI","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second bed rail we've owned and I'm very pleased with it. It's very, very well made. With our old one we were constantly having to adjust it as it would come loose but this one stays put even when using the folding feature when making the bed. I wasn't sure how the curved sides would work out, I thought they would leave an unsafe gap when the rail was used far up the bed against the headboard but it has turned out to be a non issue. The curve leaves almost no gap once attached to the bed and feels both safe and secure.The rail itself expands to cover about half of the length of a twin bed. It is held up by the mattress itself but, thankfully, doesn't use big thick posts under the mattress that leave noticeable bumps on the sleeping surface. The fold down function works well although it's fine staying up all the time if you're like me and don't often take the time to make each child's bed each day. My little one just climbs in bed from the foot so the rail can stay in place.The one thing I don't care for with this rail is the mesh. I feel it could stand to a sturdier fabric. Although I certainly wouldn't call it flimsy it's just not as strong or as thick of a material as I would like. A rambunctious toddler could tear it if they decided to try and climb over it, especially if they're wearing shoes.All in all this is a great bed rail despite the fabric. It's good quality and should last through several children, possibly with a few sewing repairs along the way. The gray color looks clean and modern and the size is just right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37EI6BRVJSG8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XR1LSMI#wasThisHelpful","R37EI6BRVJSG8S","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just got done playing this game. I'd like to say, right off the bat, that I did not have trouble with the cards dropping too soon as many have mentioned. It functioned as it should throughout about an hour of play. We had a group of neighborhood kids playing it. They're age 7-12 and everyone was able to play together. We allowed the youngest few kids to do only easy cards and the adults in the group played with only hard cards to level the playing field. The sweet spot for the game turned out to be the 11 and 12 year olds. They kept playing after everyone else was done.The one problem I have with the game is that a couple of the cards have adult words. Nothing kids don't hear at recess anyway but we could have done without seeing our middle schooler try to act one of these cards out. This isn't a complaint but I'm not sure how long we will hang onto this game as once you work your way through all the cards it's not as fun since everyone has an idea of what the words will be. An expansion pack might be a good addition.All in all this is a fun game that works for a wide range of ages. Even our younger kids had fun watching the goofy 'acting'. While the quality of the card holder could stand to be improved it worked as it should and turned out to be a great game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O1MQKOKQU7QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQQU0O6#wasThisHelpful","R2O1MQKOKQU7QM","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading so many negative reviews regarding the quality of this diaper pail I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I like it. The size and height are just right for me as a woman of average height. It works well with standard size kitchen glad bags which is so much less expensive than buying specialty liners. It's high quality and the open and close mechanism (what concerned me after reading other reviews) works well and seems sturdy. It really doesn't hold odors. Stainless steel is a big step forward for diaper pails in my opinion. We didn't own one for years (we have a large family and have had at least one child in diapers for 11 years) because I had smelled the plastic ones in friends houses and knew I didn't want to deal with deodorizing plastic.My favorite thing about it is the two stage open and close. It keeps it from smelling up the room and allows me to open it before I start the diaper change which means I can set the diaper right in it and come back to close it up once I've washed my hands. With my other diaper pail I'm always having to use the handle with dirty hands then go back and wipe it down.All in all this is a great diaper pail. I'd say it's best suited for families who plan to use a diaper pail for several years or as a garbage can later on simply because of the high price tag. It works well for our family with two currently in diapers. The size is such that I only have to empty it twice a week. I tried putting cloth diapers in it with a fabric liner and while it works I would say it's definitely more suited for disposable diapers. Just an all around solid, well built diaper pail that looks nice next to the changing table.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R310NDNMNN7AIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0UJ5SS#wasThisHelpful","R310NDNMNN7AIR","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is of the stackable mugs set.These have become a wonderful addition to our Lenox Christmas collection. We have a set of teacups that came with our place settings but they're very formal so we really only use them after our big dinner each year. These are different. They're casual and can be left out throughout the season for coffee or hot chocolate. They're not huge but for hot chocolate for the kids they're perfect. They stack securely. I've had all four stacked up at once without feeling like they'll tip over.

"I have mixed feelings on this music box. As part of our Lenox Christmas collection it's a unique addition that allows me to tie together my decorations in the kitchen with an item on my dresser. As a stand alone music box, however, I'm less impressed. While it is perfectly functional there are a couple things about it I wish were different. The size is the first thing. The area where you put things is very small. I use it for jewelry and it's filled with just a necklace, a couple rings, a bracelet, and a pair of earrings set inside. This works well for daily use for a short time but I have to keep swapping out the item I'd like to wear. I'm not sure I'll keep this up throughout the season so the box will likely just be for decoration. The other thing is the music. It's a pretty tune when it's playing but it's far from a full song and seems like it was put there just to be able to call it a music box while it's really more of a basic trinket box. The music turning key is set into a paperboard inset in the bottom of the box. At this price point it really should be made entirely of the porcelain or have a wooden inset. All that said, I still like it for being a lovely piece that brings my kitchen Christmas decor into another room.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E7U7CAP4KDOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFNIS76#wasThisHelpful","R2E7U7CAP4KDOI","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I selected this item primarily for my six and nine year old boys but most of our kids and their friends have been enjoying it. Like all our playmobil items the quality is top notch. I was expecting the players to be well made with a not so great rink but the rink itself is nice too. The plastic is sturdy and smooth, allowing the puck to be sent across the rink.The box boldly states '76 pieces'. Yes, it's 76 pieces but those pieces are parts of larger items. For example, one of the side pieces of one net or one goalie shin pad counts as a piece. It's really just the rink, which comes as two halves that snap together, two goalies with sticks, two players with sticks and movement/shooter grips, and two nets. The rink has score keeper sliders much like air hockey tables. There are decals from every nhl team to use to customize the rink.The set is not open and play. There are several pages of directions for assembly. It's not quite like assembling a Lego kit but it's significantly more involved than any of the other playmobil sets we have. Our nine year old was able to do it mostly independently. If you're buying for younger or particularly impatient kids pre assembling everything might work out well.The whole set works well but both I as well as the kids wish there was more to it. Two more players and some extra pucks (it comes with four) at a minimum. The kids are having fun with it but the rink is plenty big enough for several kids to play with at once. We plan to get several more players and the zamboni, just for fun.All in all this is a great set for elementary school age hockey fans. It's a new favorite toy around here. The quality is fantastic especially when compared to most toys on the market today. I expect it will last as long as kids are interested in playing with it and stil be in good enough shape to pass along to another family.--------------------------------------I wanted to add that since writing this review we have added two more players (playmobil, please make players from more teams please!), the referee and Stanley cup set, and the zamboni. It gets a lot more playtime now and the kids like creating hockey games complete with national anthems and the zamboni making the rounds. We're still going to add a few more players but I'm waiting too see if players from our favorite team become available before buying more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M5QZNPA02OUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRWF512#wasThisHelpful","R2M5QZNPA02OUL","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is of the glass bowl.I was surprised at the size of this bowl. I pictured it as more of a serving bowl size but it's actually more along the lines of a cereal bowl. While it would make a nice candy dish if you don't mind not having a lid on your candy bowl I'm using it as a serving piece alongside my other Lenox Christmas china. It matches well but I have to say the painted decoration looks very different on clear glass compared to china or porcelain. Not better or worse, just different. The painted design is slightly raised and the rim has gold trim so I'll be hand washing it. It's a nice change from the regular ivory colored Lenox and makes a nice addition to a collection. My one complaint is the thickness of the glass on the sides, it could stand to be a bit thicker. Although I wouldn't call it fragile sturdier glass would be a welcome improvement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R109PPLZWU7KCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TV5HF6C#wasThisHelpful","R109PPLZWU7KCG","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our third and biggest aerogarden. Our first one was one of the early models with tubular bulb lights. These led models are so much better. They use less power, don't give off as much heat, emit a light that is more pleasant to be around, and don't need replacing. Setup was super easy. Just click the top on, plug it in and let it walk you through a handful of steps and then you're up and running. Ten minutes, tops, and that includes filling it with water and choosing which plants you'd like where.What sets this model apart is the touch screen and the trellis pieces that, along with the extra high light adjustment, allow tomatoes to be grown more easily. The touch screen is color and surprisingly high resolution. It walks you through setup starting right when you plug it in. It also saves your info should you need to unplug it or if your power goes out, you just have to reset the clock. The best part is being able to program the timing of the lights. With our other aerogarden I have to be sure to set it right when I want it to turn on each day.The 'home screen' tells you:- how long until the next time you need to add nutrients- your light schedule- the mode (such as germination mode)- the current time- if your water level is ok- your plant program, such as lettuce gardenThere is a secondary screen which offers buttons for:- clock setup- light schedule- nutrient cycle setup- pump test and minutes run- quick plant, a QuickStart guide when you get a new pod set- audio alert settings- contact info- help and tips- restore defaults- order supplies (just a phone number and pump part number)- garden status, basically home screen infoMy one complaint regards the touch screen. It sticks out rather far. This makes the whole unit take up more space than it should. It could be moved back a full inch. I'm not sure if there was a reason for designing it this way, if it needed to be out of the way of the pump perhaps, but moving the screen back would be a welcome improvement in my opinion.All in all this is a great aerogarden for those with larger families or who like growing a wide variety of herbs. It doesn't take up more space than the seven spot models. I'm somewhat concerned the plants will be crowded but time will tell if this really does turn out to be a problem. The best use is, arguably, growing tomatoes but it's a good garden for any type of herbs or small plants.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2THUTDUJAAYLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NBJZLK#wasThisHelpful","R2THUTDUJAAYLL","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our first piece of bakeware to go along with our collection of Lenox Christmas China and it's a new favorite. The quality is on par with our other Lenox pieces. It's heavy weight, made well, and the decoration is sized appropriately for the piece. I wasn't sure the handles would turn out to be functional or just decorative but they work fine, allowing me to grip the dish securely when taking it out of the oven. Although we have a big family so our meal sized portions are larger than other families I'd say this is a good size for a family of 3-4 to have a dinner size casserole, a family of 5-7 to have a side dish like baked macaroni and cheese, or for a side dish that is eaten in small portions or not by everyone in attendance when served to a larger gathering. For us this will be a piece used for green been casserole at our big Christmas dinner but it would also work great for stuffing or yams.I'd like to point out that the description states 'made of bone china' and while this may be true for some of the pieces in this listing it is not true of the square baker. I've double checked with Lenox and it's made of porcelain. That said, it matched our bone china plates and serving pieces well. I mix and match the bone china and porcelain, I can hardly tell the difference side by side and no one has ever mentioned it. The advantage of the Lenox porcelain pieces is their ability to withstand oven temperatures and cleaning in the dishwasher. I find myself reaching for my porcelain serving pieces throughout December for this reason and only bringing out the china ones for special dinners.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6WUF59O4N8KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2SKYII#wasThisHelpful","R6WUF59O4N8KR","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With seven kids we've owned our share of strollers, everything from graco to uppababy. This stroller would be a middle of the road option if it wasn't for the wonderfully small fold and reversible seat which both serve to elevate it to the level of a higher end stroller. Everything else is good but not anything that stands out. The seat is comfortable and a good size for my small for age two year old and is usable for my three year old but is big for my infant (although the car seat works) and too small for my five year old. The basket is reasonably big and is accessible enough to be usable while out and about although it's not big enough for a larger diaper bag.The fold is, admittedly, rather awkward. You have to first press two buttons, which don't press all that easily on mine but I'm hoping will loosen up. Then you use your foot to press another button while folding up the foot area of the seat and folding down the handles. While the fold is not the easiest it is very stable while folded with the attached security clip fastened. It's also stable when unfolded although since it's lightweight I haven't felt comfortable hanging more than a small purse off the handles.The included car seat, the mico ap, is nice and light. Our current seat is an aton q which is a heavy seat, this mico seat feels so much lighter. My youngest is still well under a year but is a chunky 18lbs already. This seat, while usable, is just about outgrown from a comfort standpoint. The belts are well placed and the chest clip is easy to use. The chest clip is small enough where I would feel comfortable with a tiny newborn in the seat. The base installs easily and securely with latch but I had a bit of trouble getting a sufficiently tight install with just the belt. This may be because I drive a large passenger van and few seats like to install easily with the belts. The seat clicks on and off the stroller frame easily, a welcome change from the adapters needed for our daily use uppababy stroller. Other maxi cosi compatable seats, like our aton q, also clicks on easily.The height of this stroller is just right for me as an average height woman. My husband is able to push it easily as well. Our older kids, who are middle school age, can push it with some difficulty. I'm not sure how comfortable it would be for a tall person to push as far as handle height but the wheels are configured so they're all towards the center, leaving plenty of kick space between the back wheels. These closely set wheels allow the stroller to maneuver through tight spots like clothing racks in stores.Despite all it's good points there are a few things about it I'm not crazy about. The biggest one is the looseness of the handles. They are able to move about an inch in all directions. It's not a big deal when pushing it in a straight line but it's annoying when turning it or trying to steer one handed. I have yet to investigate the bolts and screws to see if I can tighten it up. The other thing I don't care is the wheels. They're a firm, smooth plastic and don't like to take tight turns easily. This is not a stroller I would select if I was currently living in a cold climate where use on ice and packed snow in parking lots was a possibility. The wheels just don't have any grip and provide a bumpy ride for the baby in the seat even on relatively smooth ground. The wide, fixed back wheels make turns less than graceful. I often find myself having to almost stop to pick up the front wheels and pivot the stroller to avoid the need to strong arm the back wheels into making a tight turn. It's a small complaint but padded handle grips would be a welcome addition.Comparatively, it's most on par with our maclaren triumph though it also has the reversible seat of our super pricy uppababy vista and the combination of comfortable seat and small fold that I liked about our peg perego p3. The small fold is really what makes it. It's a little over half the length of a folded pack and play and about the same size around. One of our cars is a hybrid and this stroller fits on the little shelf in the trunk over where the batteries are, leaving plenty of space for shopping bags or luggage.Overall, this is a nice stroller in spite of it's faults. There isn't much else on the market that compares with the way it folds. This is a great option for those who want a full featured stroller and travel system but need the ability to put it in a coat closet or small trunk when not in use or two car families looking for a stroller to keep in their second car that won't take up too much trunk space.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SYXJL7TS5V4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKPV2GW#wasThisHelpful","R2SYXJL7TS5V4Z","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are wonderful headphones. I wore them while watching the second episode of The Man in the High Castle and the sound was absolutely flawless. The faint sounds came through perfectly and the base and depth of sound was unbelievable for being essentially earbuds with a bit more oomph. I'm used to the higher end apple earbuds with the different size covers and these are noticeably better for all of $20 more. The sound is not quite comparable to my bose headphones but these come close and are wireless all for a third the price.The setup was simple even without the instructions. They synced to my iPad quickly and stayed on across our living room and when I walked behind a partial wall into another room. They'd be great to wear while doing housework. The quality is excellent with rugged, matte finish plastic and several sizes of tips to fit to your ear size. They're weighty compared to regular earbuds but are lighter than over the head styles. The cord, and this is my one real complaint, is a bit short and somewhat stiff. I'm hoping the cord will soften up and straighten out with use because right out of the package the stiffness and bent angles caused it to press against my neck uncomfortably. There is a small plastic piece on the cord to shorten it but I can't imagine anyone ever needing to use it.All that said, I personally have mixed feelings about these headphones but just because they don't happen to fit me well. I have very small ears and have trouble finding earbuds or anything else that fits in the ear to be comfortable and stay put. These are no exception. Both the hook and the earpiece are too big for my ears. They do, however, comfortably fit my husband who has average size ears for a man. Since they fit him well I'm rating them based on performance and quality rather than fit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37I39RICSO28X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161D1CQ0#wasThisHelpful","R37I39RICSO28X","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just finished reading Coal River. It was unexpectedly enjoyable. The plot has layer after layer which are unraveled at just the right moments. Without giving too much away the story is that of an older teen girl who loses her parents and must live with her less than kind aunt and uncle. She moves to the Pennsylvania mining town of Coal River, where she once stayed for a few months as a child. She eventually becomes involved in the cause of improving conditions for miners and their families, particularly for children working there. The focus is really this crusade with her personal family life and small town politics taking on supporting roles in the storyEach of the main characters is incredibly well developed. The more minor characters are also brought to life in a vivid way. Many characters developed in unexpected ways. I often found myself realizing someone wasn't what I had imagined them to be without really being able to pinpoint when the change occurred. This depth of writing made for emotional reading. I was physically tense during the more intense parts of the book, felt warm and happy during the few sweet/romantic parts, and cried during the particularly sad parts. Start to finish, this book was an emotional experience.While I can't say for sure how much of the history presented is accurate everything I've fact checked checks out although at different times and places. There is an attention to historical authenticity not often found in non fiction literature. Everything from the clothes to the mining process to the way miners families lived is, often sadly, correct from a historical standpoint. Wiseman takes license to tell the story as it could have happened. She does this believably, the mark of an accomplished author of historical fiction. Although this is a minor detail the one glaring error was a funeral prayer. A priest at that time would have said the prayers in Latin rather than English. Not a big deal and this in no way detracts from the plot but it stuck out to me in an otherwise very well researched book.If I had to come up with something I don't like about the book it would be that while the descriptive writing paints an incredible picture it gets to be somewhat tedious after the first hundred pages or so. Still good reading but could be made better by omitting some of the redundant and recurrent adjectives. That said, throughout the book I was able to picture the people and locations in detail. I was never left wondering how a place or a character looked.This is a book where I would pick it up, intending to read for a little while, and find myself saying 'one more chapter' over and over until I look up and hours had gone by. It's a wonderful book for those who like to lose themselves in what they're reading. While I began a bit haltingly I couldn't put it down after the first few chapters. Although I'm more of a non fiction reader this novel has earned a long term spot on my shelf, I'm looking forward to rediscovering it in a few years and getting to read it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HDYZXNIXKLJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617734470#wasThisHelpful","R1HDYZXNIXKLJD","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried quite a few self tanning lotions over the years but I've never been really thrilled with the results from any of them. This one is much better. It goes on nicely with the xen-tan mitt (the mitt really is a nice add on if you're wanting the most even application possible). The color develops fairly quickly, I made sure to wear gloves under the mitt. The color is just right, a natural darkening of my own pale skin tone. No orange, none! The color lasted a couple days before starting to fade but it faded just like a real tan does with a gradual lightening, no brassy or orange tone. I'm not sure it's a true 'weekly' tan but it's a solid 4-5 day tan which is long lasting compared to other tanners I've tried. Just an all around nice tanner that goes on evenly and give a great color.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZFZZ2OD2PTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OSADQE#wasThisHelpful","R2MZFZZ2OD2PTO","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I finally had the chance to use this cough syrup this week when most of our kids came down with a nasty cold. Our older kids are able to take regular cough syrup but for the little ones there are very few options available and most are just honey or agave nectar sold at an inflated price in the medicine aisle. I was skeptical as to how well this would work when I gave it to my two year old. It didn't seem to be doing much of anything for the first half hour or so but now it's working well. I have to say, it's not quite the relief the older kids are getting from the adult cough syrup they're able to take but it's pretty close and is safe for the younger kids to take.My only complaints are the taste, not great but I expected that, and the dosing instructions. The dosing really needs to be by weight. My two year old is very small, more like the weight of a 10-12 month old so I was left wondering if the dose for two year olds would be too high. I ended up giving a bit less than the recommended dose for age but it would have been nice to have this choice affirmed by weight based dosing instructions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROTXJXOQ8AB10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005VUKSX8#wasThisHelpful","ROTXJXOQ8AB10","A1CC3G24842BG6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CC3G24842BG6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is of the spoon rest.We have a large collection of Lenox Christmas China but this was the first time I've seen a spoon rest. The quality is on par with our other Lenox pieces and the size is just right. I have it on the stove and it's plenty big enough for larger ladles while still fitting between the burners. The design on this price is well done. Some have the holly placed a bit oddly or sized too small for the item but this one looks just right to me.

"Unpacking this scale, I was immediately impressed by the build of the scale.  It is really rock solid and doesn't feel flimsy at all.  Stepping on it is also a comfortable experience; you won't get any stability rocking if you don't step on it ""just so"" and it doesn't slip on our linoleum floor.On to the features....The scale is set to allow up to 4 people to program their height, age, and gender.  The first parameter, of course, is to allow the scale to easily compute your BMI.  The next 2 are used to compute to calculate your calorie intake to MAINTAIN your current weight.  This should go without saying, but (and even the instruction manual states this) you should only seek to go on a diet with the aid of a professional.  I'm a heavy fellow and the scale indicated that I needed 2,581 calorie intake to maintain my weight which I know is completely false.  Why, you ask?  Because I actually went through metabolic testing which indicated that I need only 1,400 calories per day; I have an extremely low metabolic rate (aka I don't need much to function) which also happens to be why I gain weight so easily.While it's an interesting feature, I don't place much credence or value on the calorie feedback so I have docked it one star for that.Apart from that, it's a great scale and the BMI feedback is good too.  Selecting the individual person's feedback is as simple as a couple of toe presses on the scale to find the correct ""P#"" (i.e. P1, P2, P3 or P4) and then stepping on.  The capacity of the scale is 440 pounds and the accuracy is within 0.1 lbs.  I had myself weighed at the doctor's office and then immediately weighed myself upon my return to home.  While not scientific, I found that the result was within 0.1 lbs of the doctor's office which could easily be attributable to calibration or slight weight variations (water, etc.) during that time.This is a solid, good scale and I recommend it...just don't take the calorie feedback at face value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VBK3JA2WGIB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK7FEYU#wasThisHelpful","R1VBK3JA2WGIB8","A17NVM7IAPF2NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17NVM7IAPF2NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had my fair share of protein shakes from powders that I have bought at Costco (some aren't half bad) to pre-prepared shakes like Muscle Milk, etc.I thought that a chocolate raspberry protein shake sounded intriguingly delicious.It was decidedly NOT for me.  Is it horrific?  No, but I can definitely say that it would be more of an acquired taste for me.  At first taste, it definitely came across more as a protein shake than as something that was chocolate.  The raspberry was there, but almost as a slightly nauseating aftertaste that I got used to as it went down.After making my way down, I definitely had the impression that this had to be artificially sweetened and was floored when I read 28 grams of sugar on the label.  For something that tasted like this, it sure didn't taste like 28 grams of sugar (that's 7 tablespoons of sugar, folks)...certainly made me wonder at what point did the development team keep adding sugar before they held up their hand and shouted, ""No, stop!  Perfect!""  It didn't seem that way.I let my daughter have a sip and she reported that she liked it (hence the added star), but there is no chance that I'd be handing over a 28g sugar drink for her to consume on a regular basis.

"Digital downloads are all the rage these days, and McAfee has followed that proud tradition of going disc-less with their software and opting through digital account management instead.  This virus package allows you to download and install to 3 PCs through what seems to be an endless string of numbers.My first attempt was unsuccessful, but that was only because one of the letters--a ""J""--almost looked like a ""1"" to me.  After fixing that, it went through without a problem and I was up and running in about 5 minutes (40 Mbps connection speed).McAfee is one of several recognized names in the business regarding internet security, so I won't delve into that here.  Of higher concern, however, is impact to my day-to-day operation.  I installed it on my Asus laptop, which certainly has minimal power considering its near $500 price point.  I'm happy to report, however, that the software is minimally intrusive and didn't appear to exhibit any performance degradation on my operation of the laptop.The software does come with a suite of parental protections that you can enable/disable on a whim.  One feature that was lacking for me, however, was a secure storage for my logins.  One thing that I do like about Norton Internet Security on my Alienware Desktop is my ""Vault""...a place where my logins are stored for bank/billing accounts so that it saves me the time of having to log in to pay my bills.  It's a time saver for me and convenience for my wife who has trouble remembering all that stuff.  I wished that McAfee would have that feature because it would be a perfect 5 star rating for me.Apart from that, rest assured that you'll receive decent residential-level security protection that won't reduce your computer to a crawl in its protective efforts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TK24URTX4XE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUTAY2S#wasThisHelpful","R35TK24URTX4XE","A17NVM7IAPF2NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17NVM7IAPF2NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is actually a pretty good grip.  With no frills, the vent attachment has a 4-tooth prong system that would work with just about any vent system that I could think in a vehicle.  The grip system itself utilizing a very powerful spring-loaded system that will clamp hard and whatever you put in it.  I tried it on my iPod Classic and I wasn't worried about that little bugger slipping out on me.Where it failed, however, was on my Samsung Galaxy S5.  While I'm sure that it would have gripped the phone itself just fine, it BARELY misses being able to accommodate the Galaxy S5 in an Otterbox Defender case.

"Out of the box, I have to say...without a doubt....this is probably one of the easiest printers that I have had the pleasure to install.  The Quick Setup Guide is well-written and is easy to follow.It also features some fairly well laid out menus on a very responsive touchscreen and the software will find the printer readily and enable it for use as a printer, scanner, and fax machine.It does all this in pretty good stride and the prints look great.  Speed is pretty good too, but I think that you'd be hard pressed to find a slow printer these days so it hardly amounts as a differentiator.  Scans are also fairly decent without exhibiting much in the way of chromatic aberrations or ghosting of text outlines; it looks really crisp and the PDF capability is a nice added feature.  I didn't use the fax since we no longer use a landline and most companies that I deal with would rather receive a PDF anyway, but it is an additional feature and I would find it doubtful that it is incapable of producing a decent fax based on its scanning capability.However, there are some cons:1.  One of my gripes is that NO CABLES ARE INCLUDED.  For a $149 printer, it's sad that a $2-$3 USB-A to USB-B cable could not be included.  While many households have gone towards a WiFi setup, some have not and having to purchase an additional cable just to hook it up to a PC is disappointing.2.  Build is a little flimsy.  While the top opens and closes with ease, there is a little side-to-side play on this thing.  It is definitely recommended that you grab both edges when you open and close the lid...I'm not saying that it'll break, per se, but the sidesway doesn't lend a lot to comfort.3.  Ink usage.  While not as bad as the venerable Epson 777 (which is what turned me off from Epson in the first place - felt like every 3rd print job needed a suspicious amount of ink cartridge cleaning), the ink usage can still be high.  I would recommend leaving the printer on to minimize unnecessary ink cartridge cleanings.4.  Paper tray.  It feels hard to use compared to my HP and the slide bar for varying paper sizes didn't feel as smooth to operate at first until I realized it needed more of a firm hand to get it motivated...be prepared to get a ""feel"" for moving it.  If you primarily printer on 8.5 x 11, this may not be a concern.  However, the lack of paper size options may make this printer seem like a chore for some.That said, the cons aren't too bad in my opinion and for the price, you're getting a pretty solid 3-feature printer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RKAV19HTX282/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV8QC2K#wasThisHelpful","R2RKAV19HTX282","A17NVM7IAPF2NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17NVM7IAPF2NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always love a great mill-and-brew coffeemaker and have owned a Cuisinart a long time ago.First and foremost, I'll say that this coffeemaker does brew a good cup of coffee, especially for its price point.  Also, I find the programmable feature of the coffee maker quite easy to use and adjusting the time on the clock doesn't involve some convoluted process of hitting menu or setup buttons; you merely hit ""MIN"" or ""HR"" and you're good to go on adjusting the clock and programming it is simply an extra step of hitting the program button.Filling water on the coffeemaker is also quite easy and has a relatively low profile, so it can accommodate about 5-6 inches of clearance below your cabinet if this is a concern.That said, there were some design features that I was NOT enamored with...but you may have no qualms about them, so please read and decide accordingly:1.  The mill/filter.  At first, I was intrigued by the design decision to incorporate the mill WITH the filter.  This minimizes the amount of upkeep on the coffee maker since coffee makers with a separate mill chamber often require maintenance in terms of cleaning out the chute where the coffee grounds exit because they tend to ""gum up"" over time.  However, I found several problems with this:  a.  Cleaning the filter is...challenging.  The rotating blade the bottom of the filter makes it a little difficult to scrub and I was apprehensive about getting my fingers close to it...definitely recommend a slender brush to get those hard to reach areas.  b.  This filter requires you to fill it with beans (or grounds) EVERY MORNING.  You won't have the luxury of storing your beans and refilling occasionally.  This adds an extra step to the ritual of prepping your coffee maker for coffee the next morning.2.  Grind adjustment.  This one still has me scratching my head.  Considering that you have to measure your beans each morning, why on earth would you incorporate a feature that adjusts the grind according to how many beans you have in there?  I know that sounds like a silly argument, but my first 2 runs resulted in beans that were not ground up (but I wanted them to be) and I'm not keen on seeing if I can ""regrind them"" after they've been flushed with hot water.  On my 3rd attempt, I just set the grind setting for something much higher to avoid having beans wasted in my brew.3.  Carafe.  My biggest pet peeve with any coffee maker is having an integral lid.  I like to be able to remove mine to clean it properly since integral lids tend to make cleaning a little more problematic.  I'll be the first to admit it...I'm a clumsy ox and this might not bother you.  However, it makes me nervous as I like to clean everything properly.Beyond those issues (and if they don't bother you), this is a fairly decent coffeemaker...just not my cup of tea.  ;)Please let me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R144MB5PNGSJGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I46E#wasThisHelpful","R144MB5PNGSJGT","A17NVM7IAPF2NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17NVM7IAPF2NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've set up several routers in the past and this has probably the easiest by far.  The quick setup guide is well illustrated and easily points you in the right direction.  What's even better is that the setup routine includes an auto-detect feature to ease in transitioning your internet setup for the router's subsequent use.Speedwise, I don't have anything that utilizes the AC bandwidth, but my n- and g-enabled devices find it quite readily and transmitting data around our home network seems quite responsive without any perceptible degradation of what would normally be wired responsiveness.The router itself is quite large and takes up a little more real estate than my older Netgear N900, but the built-in stand (not adjustable, sadly) holds it up quite well and the white aesthetic of the router makes it quite easy to make out the status of your internet connection, broadcast, etc., at a glance with fairly intuitive green LED icons.Enabling security through the router is also fairly simple through a web interface (local-based web control) that allows you to set up both home and guest networks.  Guest networks can also be configured to separately screen other devices of your network from view, which is a nice feature if you want to secure your home network a little further.One demerit, however, is range.  My N900 was able to boost the signal quite well.  I was hoping that the Archer C8, with 3 external antennae, would at least equal or surpass it.  My current experience is that it has not.  We have an 1,800 square foot home and sometimes our bedroom is a little bit of a ""dead zone.""  Much older routers had trouble with it, but the N900 took care of our issue.  While the Archer C8 is weaker, it still provides a reliable enough signal that I'm not worried in having our signal dropped.  The WiFi Analyzer app showed anywhere from a 5-10 dB loss in strength in the same placement as the N900.  While that seems like a bit, it was still strong enough to work.  However, with the real estate of 3 external antennae, I was hoping for better; I was disappointed.Is that a reason not to get it?  I would say no...individual routers may perform differently and I suspect--given the quality found in the router's construction and setup--that this router may find a good home in yours; I have a feeling that this router may perform better in our household away from monitors or other EM interference that may be impacting its performance differently than our venerable N900.  At $150, however, you may wish to consider other options and also ask if you really need an AC router to get the most bang for your buck.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAUTIQ8REW8VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2ROH0C#wasThisHelpful","RAUTIQ8REW8VA","A17NVM7IAPF2NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17NVM7IAPF2NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This unit is great for someone who has a new license for operating a ham radio and who is not sure exactly how far he or she wants to take the hobby. It is a small investment, yet lets you get started with talking on local repeaters.I am a licensed ham radio operator and found the radio to be easy to program. I was up and running within 30 minutes of opening the package. For newbies, you will probably want to use the software, CHIRP. As for the quality of the radio - it is what the old axiom says, ""You get what you pay for."" It's a starter radio. The sound quality is good, not great. The short antennae reaches the 8.5 miles from my house to the local repeater, but you will want a longer one to reach further. I had no problem using the keypad, but those unfamiliar with the lingo of ham radio will have difficulty with programming it. You will need help from someone who is familiar with the terms. It will only allow you to use the 2 meter band between 138 and 174 MHz and the 70cm band between 400 and 480 MHz. You can program it so that you can listen to two bands at once. You can also listen to FM radio.NOTE: While it is possible to program the radio to transmit on the General Mobile Radio Service and Family Radio Service bands, the radio is not FCC type accepted for use on these channels. Doing so may be illegal and should be done only in a dire emergency with no other radio communications options possible. You MUST have a ham radio license to use frequencies to get on local repeaters. If you use frequencies that require a license, you are subject to fines ranging from $7,500 to $10,000, and there are ham operators who go around looking for signals coming from unlicensed operators. You will get caught! But the other side is that is is easy to get your license. You can study for your license using books, local classes, or online (example: Ham Test Online; www.hamradiolicenseexam.com), and you can take the test through local ham radio clubs listed on ARRL (www.arrl.org). There are three licenses, each one allowing you to use more frequencies on the radio band: Technician, General, and Extra. I took and passed all three in one year, so if I can do it, you can do it! There are children in our club as young as eight years old who have taken the test as well. The test only costs $15 (currently). It's a small investment to get into ham radio and a fun hobby, as well as a great communication system during emergencies. And this radio is an inexpensive way to get started.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WBO93Y8IGE9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSBZ1IA#wasThisHelpful","R2WBO93Y8IGE9W","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The pieces are colorful and fun to work with.There is a clear plastic cover that you can place over the board when not in use, and there is a rope handle for carrying or hanging. Although this is not inexpensive, it definitely illustrates the saying, ""You get what you pay for."" This is a quality product that will last for years.The only suggestion I have for the publisher is to include a worksheet that students could use to practice the states without the state name clues.Great product - highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T71QG4XINDCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMT1PHC#wasThisHelpful","R2T71QG4XINDCB","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am really happy with this product. I have been working out at the gym and was used to professional equipment. At home, I had some really cheesy resistance bands; so, I began searching for some that were comparable to what I was using at the gym. I read reviews on the Black Mountain products and decided to give them a try. I'm glad I did. This is exactly what I was looking for. Quality product - flexible - a variety of resistance weights - and easy to change the handles. I am buying a 2nd set of handles so I can quickly change weights as needed. But it's not necessary. It's very easy and quick to change them if you want to save money. Highly recommend this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZGTYBGCV9WEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=7245456313#wasThisHelpful","R1ZGTYBGCV9WEP","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking forward to these little bars because they appeared to be a healthier version of fig newtons. They are, but not that much better, and there is not near as much fruit. The photo is deceiving. There is the finest line of fruit sandwiched between the crust. You can barely taste it. The crust is good and the ingredients appear to be good for you.Comparison with strawberry fig newton:1 bar Plum organics (19g): 70 calories, 1.5 grams of fat, 0 cholesterol, 50 mg sodium, 12 g of carbs, 5 g of sugar, 1 g. of fiber.1 strawberry Fig newton (15g):  50 calories, .75 g. fat, 0 cholesterol, 55 mg. sodium, 10.5 carbs, 6.5 g. sugar, 0g fiber.Bottom line: If you really want to eat healthy and don't mind losing out on some flavor, this will satisfy you. If you're more concerned with taste, stick to the fig newton!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL3SY52MX7GLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3I6CXO#wasThisHelpful","RL3SY52MX7GLV","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little unit is awesome! If you are looking for an extremely portable speaker unit, you can't lose with this one. It's only about 2"" by 5"" in size, but the sound quality is pretty awesome. No, you won't get big, booming bases, but if you want to amplify Spotify on your smart phone, this will do the trick. In fact, I demonstrated this little speaker to my teacher daughter, and she immediately talked me into giving it to her to take to her classroom!Slip this one in your pocket or purse, and you'll be ready to amplify your phone anytime you want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13CPV7Y56RQR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCDKRAO#wasThisHelpful","R13CPV7Y56RQR2","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the Brainwave M2 Headphones! I'm pretty picky about my headphones. I like to listen to all types of music from classical to rock to country western. In addition, I have some hearing loss in my ears, and I want to be able to hear all the tones. With Brainwavz M2, I was able to sit back and enjoy all my music, every note of it!Another thing I liked about this product is that there are several sets of ear tips for every size of ear! Not a one-size fits all. I found the perfect size for my small ears with no trouble at all. The only complaint I have is that the clip for attaching the cords to your shirt was not satisfactory. I could not get it connected satisfactorily. Maybe I just don't know how, but I wish they would have put it on for me!  Oh, another thing I did like is the case! Perfect for my purse!For me, the price was reasonable for the quality of the headphones. I'm a fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X68IJIXPKACZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004I5FL1G#wasThisHelpful","R2X68IJIXPKACZ","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You will like or not like this fitness band depending on your size and fitness level. I took it with me to my trainer at the gym to get him to help me figure out how to use it. Unfortunately, I don't have the arm stretch to use it for my arms alone; however, I can use it if I wrap it around something. The problem with that is that it is too hard for me to use. I was able to use it when I step on it, but I didn't feel like I was accomplishing much. The loops were comfortable to grip. That is one thing I liked. My trainer was disappointed that it didn't have any resistance levels on the band or on the packaging.The bottom line for me: I think it has potential with those who are more fit than I am! For a beginner or someone who not as fit as they should be, it's just not the right band.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2311TSMCDAS55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBEW05Q#wasThisHelpful","R2311TSMCDAS55","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After using this product a few times, I've decided that I like it for a once in a while use. I like the fact that you can peel open the door seal and spray in that area, which is hard to clean. However, for daily use, I prefer to use tablets, specifically Whirlpool - Affresh High Efficiency Washer Cleaner, 3-Tablets, 4.2 Ounce. The biggest reason is that it's easier to use the tablets. This is just one more thing I have to do. Whereas, the tablets, I throw in and forget it. As far as deodorizing, I guess this product does a good job. I don't have a lot of problems with my front loader, so there is not much to deodorize. But, I like the idea of cleaning it on a regular basis even if I don't smell anything. So, this works fine. I just like the ease of use with a tablet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BWJYCRHUIQCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM5MHK8#wasThisHelpful","R3BWJYCRHUIQCF","A2Q1046M09398P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Q1046M09398P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
