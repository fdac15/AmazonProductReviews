"At the end of the twenty-first century, half a million people have gone to live in orbit around the earth.  They live in forty-one satellites (each called a World), some to get away from religion persecution, and others trying to create the perfect ‚ÄòWorld‚Äô.  The largest of the Worlds is New New York.  New New (as the inhabitants call it) is a captured asteroid that has been hollowed out.Each year, a few candidates are chosen to be sent to Earth for a year.  In that year they learn about the economics that exist between the Worlds and the major earth countries.  Marianne O‚ÄôHara has been chosen because she plans on being an Earth liaison specialist.  During her stay on Earth, she gets involved in two movements.  One group is contemplating declaring the Worlds a Republic; the second is planning a third American Revolution.The power in America is concentrated among a few privileged families.  Because of this oligarchy the average citizen has little or no control over their own life.  There are many groups who want to overthrow the government but their plans for a new America are at different ends of the political spectrum.  Should this third revolution take America‚Äôs eye off the SSU (the successor to the Soviet Union), there is a chance that the SSU will strike against their age old enemy.Thinking that Worlds have gotten to independent, there is also a group who want to ‚Äòteach the Worlds a lesson‚Äô, and put them in their ‚Äòplace‚Äô.  Marianne having grown up in a closed World, is a naÔve waif on this planet of radical politics.  She is unwittingly brought into a conspiracy that could be destructive to both America and the Worlds.Much of this book, the first in a trilogy, is spent explaining to the reader the relationship of Earth to the Worlds (both economically and politically) and between the Worlds.  It‚Äôs well thought out and explained, and is reasonable to a point.  I‚Äôll have a better opinion after I‚Äôve started the second book.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IIO1Q0B7GWZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PI184NQ#wasThisHelpful","R1IIO1Q0B7GWZL","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bertolt Brecht (poet and lyricist) and Kurt Weill (composer) collaborative (B&W) relationship; the three women in their lives ‚Äì Helene Weigl (Brecht's actor-wife),; Elisabeth Hauptmann (Brecht's mistress and collaborator) and Lotta Lenya, Weill's actor-wife. Pamela Katz tells the story of these five people, their friends and other collaborators that produced an amazing body of work during the interwar (Weirmar Republic) years in Germany.Probably their two most famous (and remembered) operas were ‚ÄúOff to Mahagonny‚Äù and the ‚ÄúThree Penny Opera‚Äù.  ‚ÄúMahagonny‚Äù was written first and was ready for the stage in 1927 as a ‚ÄúSongspiel‚Äù (or concert work) that included the songs ‚ÄúAlabama Song‚Äù and ‚ÄúBenares Song‚Äù.  The full opera was first presented in 1929, with Lotte Lenya the main soprano part of ‚ÄúJenny-the whore‚Äù; it was banned by the Nazis in 1933 .Unlike traditional operas of the eighteenth and nineteenth century, love doesn‚Äôt conquer all nor does divine intervention enter to save the day.  Corruption and vice prosper as do the criminal elements.  Brecht presented it as a satire on the ‚ÄúWeimar Republic‚Äù where behind the fa√ßade of normalcy, Germany was degenerating into a cesspool of corruption.  As a tip of the hat to Marx, B&W see prostitution as a result of society and lawlessness, not of poverty.B&W‚Äôs masterpiece, ‚ÄúThe Threepenny Opera‚Äù is based on the 1728 opera (‚ÄúThe Beggar‚Äôs Opera‚Äù) by the Englishman, John Gay.  Gay wrote the play in opposition to the current French and Italian romantic style.  It was the first ‚Äúsatirical ballad‚Äù opera, using popular music, folk tunes and church chants as its‚Äô musical basis.  B&W decided to write a modern version in honor of its‚Äô 200th anniversary.Set in Victorian London, the play focuses on Macheath (Mackie Messer or Mack the Knife), an amoral, anti-hero.  He marries Polly Peachum, whose father controls the beggars of London.  Her father isn‚Äôt happy about the marriage and tries to get rid of Mack.  But Mack‚Äôs old Army buddy (Tiger Brown) is now the Chief of Police.  But Peachum manages to get Mack arrested and sentenced to hang.  But at the last minute (in a deus ex machia moment) is given a pardon by the Queen.  The score was one of the first operas to use jazz as an influence on the music.Katz does a marvelous job in explaining how the details of the opera mimic much of what goes on between B&W and their own lives.  All of the women are given a thorough and honest biography including their involvements with both men, each other and the rest of the Weimar ‚ÄúCabaret‚Äù crowd.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16U8PDXP6YYP3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385534914#wasThisHelpful","R16U8PDXP6YYP3","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bishop who is one of Britain‚Äôs best known military historians wrote this book with the additional title of a ‚Äòtrue detective story‚Äô.  In pre-independence Israel, there were three main liberation armies: the Palmach, the Haganah and the Irgun.  The Irgun was the most militant of the three.  Stern was originally part of Irgun, but left to form a more radical retaliatory group.  Stern believed that the only way to win independence was to make it too difficult for the British to stay.As part of this strategy, Stern‚Äôs Group planted bombs, robbed banks and murdered Arabs and British Officers. The detective story relates to the controversial death of Avraham (Avi) Stern, former member of the Irgun and head of the ‚ÄòStern Group‚Äô (later known as Lehi) in Tel Aviv before and during WWII.  Avi Stern believed he was destined to be the Jewish liberator of British Palestine.  He was known by most Jews for his poetry written in Hebrew.As the leader of the Stern Group, later known as Lehi, he masterminded a series of high-profile terrorist attacks in this pursuit, becoming more militant as Britain shut down immigration to Palestine in the 1930s.  Having been in post-WW 1 Poland, and with the rise of the Nazis in Germany, he knew of the danger to the Jewish people of Eastern Europe.  Hunted by the Palestine Police Force (PPF), he had a bounty on his head.  Stern was living in an attic apartment, in Tel Aviv when he was killed by Assistant Superintendent Geoffrey Morton, a British colonial policeman assigned to capture him.Morton claimed Stern was shot trying to escape (sounds familiar). But witnesses insisted he was executed in cold blood. He was unarmed, the building was surrounded, there were four cops in the room and there was no way out.  His death/murder radicalized many in Israel and inspired a cult of martyrdom.  It was the straw that helped to destroy any hopes the British had of working out a compromise between, the Arabs, and the Jews.This is the story of Bishop‚Äôs quest to discover the truth about Stern‚Äôs death. Intensely researched, including access to Morton‚Äôs private archive and eyewitness interviews, it reconstructs the event.  It is an even-handed account, placed within the context of the times. Using a timeline type structure, Bishop documents the events that lead-up to the meeting on the building roof, and described the impact of Stern‚Äôs legacy on modern Israel.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E3WB539P4K7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HU5J13A#wasThisHelpful","R1E3WB539P4K7L","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was the first novel ever written by the Nobel Prize Winner, but it was rejected by every publisher he sent it to.  It then sat in a drawer for thirty years, until after his death when his wife found it and decided it should be published.  It doesn‚Äôt read like one of his famous novels but is worthwhile to read to see how his writing progressed from his first try to his later world appreciated style.This is a very standard type of novel for the 1950s and one of the styles that was popular at the time.  The situation is a six apartment complex in a working area of Lisbon during the post-WW2 Salazar dictatorship.  Salazar ruled a ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù state from 1932 to 1968 and upon his death the First Portuguese Republic was established.  His rule is known for its‚Äô invasiveness into all part of society and the unswerving loyalty of the military and bureaucracy to Salazar‚Äôs rule.The apartment building is full of working class people trying to survive to the next month.  On the ground floor is a cobbler and his shop where he and his wife rent out a room to a ‚Äòtraveler‚Äô.  Across the hall is a husband and wife who recently lost their only child.  Upstairs, on the first floor, is a ‚Äòkept woman‚Äô and another family where the husband and wife vie for the love of their son.  Above the single woman are a salesman, his wife and their single daughter.  Lastly are four woman, two sisters and one of the sister‚Äôs two daughters.The book follows these people as they interact with each other, other tenants and the people of Lisbon.  We watch as their lives weave from the mundane workday of a housewife, the busy times of the cobbler, the quiet days of the ‚Äòwoman‚Äô and the interactions of the four woman.  Most of these stories are banal and wouldn‚Äôt make a ‚Äòbad‚Äô telenova, but keeping in mind when the book was written, parts of it were very progressive and dangerous in a dictatorship.For those readers who know Saramago, it would be a way to compare his later works to his original start.  For the rest of us it‚Äôs just not that interesting or exciting.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24CJP428FJIND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK3F5QY#wasThisHelpful","R24CJP428FJIND","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a story that could pass for the preliminary draft of a comic cross between ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy‚Äù and the ‚ÄúDirty Dozen‚Äù.  It‚Äôs written so tongue -in-cheek that the person next to you will need to duck so they don‚Äôt get poked.  It all very light hearted, and you know that they are going to get done what they need to get done even though they only have a three percent chance.This happens in the galaxy of the ‚ÄúBirthright‚Äù timeline that Resnick uses in most of his books and series.  The Universe is divided into the Democracy (the good guys, us) and the Coalition (the bad guys), with a small no-man‚Äôs land in between.  The job they are to do is to replace the despot who runs the Coalition with a clone that‚Äôs working for the Democracy.It‚Äôs the same set-up as the A-Team or Mission Impossible (the TV show), with the wise-cracking leader whose got more scars than brains (Colonel Nathan Pretorius).

They then have to land on the most secure planet in the Coalition, kidnap the Despot and replace him with the clone and get away.

"Israel was not the only land that was proposed by Jewish groups during the years before it became a reality.  Nineteenth century Jews also looks at places such as Grand Isle, NY; Uganda, Angola, Madagascar, Australia and Suriname among others to relocate the mass of Jews in the Pale of Russia.The first attempt was to settle Jews on Grand Isle just down the river from Niagara Falls.  This was at the time when the Erie Canal was just being finished.  But many of the people in the area were afraid that the Jews would try to become a separate country and the possibility fell through.Prior to the Great War, it was suggested that there should be some ‚Äúempty‚Äù place in the British Empire that could be set aside for Jewish emigration.  Not all the people who were behind this were Judeo-philes, Poles and Russians felt it was the perfect way to get rid of the Jews.  The plateau in central Uganda was thought to be perfect place for the immigrants.  It had a fertile soil, mild climate, and a newly built railroad.  Of course no one asked the indigenous people how they felt.  But it didn‚Äôt work out.In the early twentieth century, the Zionist movement split over whether they should only concentrate on emigration to Israel/Palestine or for a ‚ÄòFreeland‚Äô for the Jews.  The second group became known as ‚Äòterritorialists‚Äô because they were willing to accept any land as a ‚Äòhomeland‚Äô for the Jews.  These groups were to be at odds during the rest of the first half of the century until Israel was founded.With the ‚Äòpogroms‚Äô, life in Russia for those in the Pale of Russia became more and more dangerous as the century went on.  After 1929, the depression caused more and more economic pressure being put on Eastern Europe‚Äôs Jews to emigrate.  The Polish government was willing to help their Jews to emigrate, if a place could be found for them.  Unfortunately, areas in Angola, Australia and Suriname (Dutch Guiana) would not satisfy the Zionists, who did everything they could to dissuade the colonial countries not to approve emigration.Except for Palestine, no other ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù state ever became more than an idea whose time never came.

"DS Mark ‚ÄòHeck‚Äô Heckenburg has been reassigned from the SCU (Serial Crimes Unit) of Scotland Yard to the Lake District.  Think of being a New York Homicide Detective and being transferred to western Maine or eastern Montana.  Not only is this an area with few town, separated from each other by country roads, but except for the summer hikers and vacationers, you can lie down in the middle of Main Street without inconveniencing anyone.  To say that Heck is bored is to like saying a hermit is lonely.The years before, this district had been terrorized by ‚ÄúThe Stranger‚Äù, a serial killer who killed ‚Äòcouples‚Äô in lover‚Äôs lanes.  He would kill the males, then torture the females, and kill them by stabbing them in the eyes.  When a young girl is found by one of the locals, wandering around in a daze, she is covered with cuts.  All she remembers is being stalked by someone and hearing them whistle ‚ÄúStrangers in the Night‚Äù.  The whistling by the killer was never let out to the media.  Could the Stranger be back?Hecks onetime girlfriend and boss at Scotland Yard, Gemma Piper, was the one who ‚Äòcaught‚Äô the Stranger.  On a decoy assignment, she fought with him and shot him in the shoulder, but lost him in the area swamps.  His body was never found.  But everyone considered that he either died from his wound or drown in one of the bogs.  Since then Piper has had a meteoric rise and is now a Detective Superintendent.When Heck hears the girl‚Äôs story, including the clubbing to death with a stone of her girlfriend who was with her, he knows he has to alert Piper.  The only help that Heck has is the local constabulary made up of a ‚Äòshiny new female constable‚Äô and a ‚Äòloser‚Äô (Read drunker) who has been posted to this backwater where he can‚Äôt get into any trouble.Just as Piper makes it up to the District, the town is hit by a blizzard and a frozen mist settles on the valley.  Nothing can move in or out of the valley as members of the community are found murdered in their isolated houses.  While Heck and Piper begin to concentrate all of the townspeople in the local tavern, the Stranger blows-up the local police station and now has the town under siege.Can Heck and Piper keep these people safe while they wait for reinforcements and the fog to lift, and can they catch the Stranger in time?Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U2ECAP65DLKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFEBK2S#wasThisHelpful","R2U2ECAP65DLKG","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On December 15, 1944, over 300k soldiers, 1200+ tanks, and thousands of other armored vehicles and weapons,  backed  up by over 1000 planes, attacked the US First Army through the Ardennes Forest.  The German Offensive was in the exact area where the Germans had attacked in WW One and at the beginning of WW Two.  But even knowing this history, the Allies were totally unprepared for this onslaught.  The Offensive had been delayed multiple times, while the Germans waited for a time when there would be heavy cloud cover to keep the Allied Air Forces on the ground.If the Germans could make it over the River Meuse in two weeks, the would break out into flat country and attack through to Antwerp, thereby taking the largest port north of Cherbourg and cut off the English Army in the southern Netherlands from the other Allies.  With that victory, the Germans felt they would be able to force the Allies to sue for peace and split them away from the Soviet Union. With the war in the West over, the Nazis could then turn the full Armed Forces against Stalin, and hopefully (for them) stop the Red Army in its‚Äô tracks.Because this was considered a ‚Äúquiet sector‚Äù many of the troops at the Front were new divisions that had just finished their training and been fed into the front lines for their first taste of battle.  Many of the German front line troops were veterans of the War on the Eastern Front and their experience of fighting in cold weather was another issue in their favor.  In addition to their experience, these German soldiers were motivated to end this battle quickly so they could go East and saved Germany proper from the approaching Soviet Army.Another major point in the Germans favor, was their material.  The Allies had nothing to compare to the German heavy tanks, Panzer IV, Panthers, Tigers and King Tigers.  They were superior in weaponry and armor.  Shells from American Shermans and Stuarts were seen to bounce off the German tanks who would then blast the medium and light tanks to pieces.  (During the battle the Germans had a ratio of over four to one in tank kills.)  Coming from the Eastern battlefront, the German troops were dressed in white winter clothing.Many of the Allies were in ‚Äòlight‚Äô cotton olive green uniforms without winter boots or white camouflage clothing.  (Some Allied troops took to wrapping themselves in bed sheets to better hide in the snow.)  Without Allied Air Forces to provide close air support to take out the larger tanks, the Allies were at a major disadvantage.  With the Allies split in half this made coordination of counter-attack difficult to work out.Almost half of the tank brigades (Panzer Korps) were Waffen SS, and though they were not as good as the Wehrmacht at strategy, they were fanatical at fighting.  Where other troops would have withdrawn from a fight, the SS would cause casualties way out of proportion to what would normally been expected.  They would be almost suicidal in holding conquered  land that had little or no strategic value.Except for the Paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne, few units were able to stop the attacking Germans.  The hold-out at Bastogne proved to be a thorn in the side of the German attack, and blocked the bringing up of replacements and supplies to the troops that had by-passed the city.  This more than anything, else slowed down the offensive and allowed the Allies to recover and begin to counter attack with the Third Army under Patton and the Seventh under the control of Montgomery.  With the clearing of the skies, the German Panzer armies were decimated from the air sealing their fortunes.Christer Bergstrom has gone into the archives of all the participating Armies and in his narrative, inserts after action reports, news reports and personal interviews with soldiers from both sides describing the conditions they fought under.  Bergstrom‚Äôs reporting is so detailed that at some battles we have the names of the tank commanders and the officers (and enlisted) men who fought there.  Most impressive is the number of maps showing battles for two or three towns at a time and the movements by units in support of these attacks.Though some will take umbrage to Bergstrom‚Äôs description of some famous Generals and their competency during battle, in most cases this is a well balanced view of the battles and their outcomes.Zeb Kantrowitz  zworstblog.blogspot.com","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HZ62GNFU1VBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612002773#wasThisHelpful","R1HZ62GNFU1VBH","AKB2PYODH0TKS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKB2PYODH0TKS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted a digital scale that was easy to read.  I had never heard of tempered glass scales and thought about which scale to try.  I am glad I bought this one.  It is very easy to use--just step on it and it identifies which user you are out of up to 8 users and then gives your weight in pounds and tenth of pounds, i.e. 139.4.  You can adjust to give your weight in other measuring systems also.  You can also program it to not give your weight but to simply tell how much weight you have lost, or gained, since the last time you used it i.e. -1.7  or +0.6. And you can download an app to track your weight with your Smart phone--if you choose. The blue back-lighting is pretty and looks just as bright as the photo.  The scale is simple and sleek.  My ONLY negative is standing on the glass feels cool to my bare feet.  The company who sells this has great communication and stands behind their product.  They even include the batteries so it is shipped ready to use.

"I have fair, dry skin. I woud never wash my face with soap.  For years I used a good cold cream, tissued it off, then rinsed with warm water.  This rose face wash is very rich and gentle.  I am on my second bottle --the first lasted ten months--you just need a little of this cleanser.  It leaves my skin very clean but not dry.

"Have had this jacket for about three years and have loved it.  It can be dressed up a little with career pants and a good bag.  I can not stand coats, or anything, with collars around my face and with the hoodie and zipper this is quite flattering if you are the type who lives in v-neck tops.  I had this in size 3X and it always was generously sized except a bit snug around the bottom hem.  I have lost 45 pounds and was so happy to find this in smaller sizes.  I was guessing I would need an XL until I read the reviews about the jacket running small.  Then I couldn't decide between the 1X and the 2X.  A few reviewers said there was a big difference between the 1X and the 2X and that the arms of this jacket run small.  Thank you Amazon reviewers, you were right!  I just tried on the 2X and even with the 3X being way too large and the 45 pound weight loss, I needed the 2X in the upper arms and hips.  The rest of the jacket is roomy.This is a nicely styled jacket with the zipper and the velcro closure over the zipper for extra protection against rain, and the attached hoodie was the deal-maker.However, many of the quality details of the older version of this coat have been eliminated.  The style is the same on the outside where it counts, but in a side by side comparison the fine details I loved are gone.  This is more a reflection on quality control than whether you should still buy this coat.  Yes!  You should still buy it, just see if any of these smaller details will bother you:  where the older jacket was detailed with a snap closure at the top and the bottom and three easy velcro closures, the newer jacket has no snaps, but 5 velcro closure points on the flap over the zipper.  The jackets though purchased 3years apart are mostly the same with other small differences.  Sadly, the roomy zippered security inside pocket is gone.  I miss it because that was a safe place to keep items if you were out for a walk and didn't want to carry your purse.  The entire lining is not as well made as before:  the older jacket's mesh lining is much finer and softer, the inside of the hood had the same lining, and at the outer pocket level, for the bottom 8 inches or so, the mesh ended and the interior of the coat had the same, more durable fabric as outside.  That supported what was carried in the 2 outer pockets and gave the coat more substance.  Now the hood has no mesh lining.  The body of the newer coat has a more open, coarser mesh from the shoulders to the bottom of the coat.  My coat is black and the mesh lining is black over a white, or gray, lining that is labelled ""OMNI-TECH"".  Both exterior ""hand pockets"" are still zippered and lined with mesh, but once again, you are putting your items into double mesh pockets without the fabric reinforcement the old pockets had.  The old hoodie had an odd flap with velcro at the back--?? must have served some purpose--but I do not know what.  The coat does have an inner hanging loop that is nice in restaurants and places to hang it on a hook to dry.  Booth coats have sleeves with a little elastic at the cuffs and a great velcro storm strip at the cuffs to pull the coat very tight around your wrists.  The Columbia embroidery and the Omnitech stamp on the left cuff are identical.  The hood drawstrings are similar but the old hood had a metal grommet at the opening and a longer, more secure tunnel that the cord pulled through at the end, as well as other minor features being finer on the previous hoodie. The drawstring around the hips is also inferior. All told, you have to wear the jacket for your size.  I am grateful they are still making the coat.  You would never see much difference in the outer appearance, but it is sad the way producers eliminate the quality details and think the consumer won't notice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8H4QUHC3LCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQYS1ZI#wasThisHelpful","R8H4QUHC3LCV","A3K4SHKV5H9OSU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4SHKV5H9OSU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Have ordered Maja soaps many many times over the years.  I use them for scenting the linen closet and drawers.  I put them in ""winter'  or ""summer"" handbags when I store them out of season.  I put them in the bag with blankets or quilts I am storing.This is the second time I ordered these Maja round soaps from Amazon, recently, and both times they smell very fresh.  I had ordered Maja rectangular soaps from a different page/ vendor on Amazon and they had little scent.  Amazon Customer Service was great and directed me to these.  The box does say made in Mexico, not Spain, but I am pleased with them.  I suppose Maja has different companies distributing and producing their soaps and scent quality may vary, or some vendors may ship old packages.  Don't accept ""stale"" soap.

"Ahhh, National Geographic.  You know there will be crystal-clear amazing photos.  And reliable text.  To a fault.  The photo stock paper is of such high quality the book is rather hefty for its compact size, but contains nearly 400 pages.  Many nice features in this guide, including: easy access inside front cover fold-out map of France and inside back cover, fold-out graphic of the Paris Metro. Nice introductory pages on charting your trip, and brief summary of French history and culture.The book is organized and color coded by geographic regions of France, making it visually easy to jump from region to region.  Each region starts with a greater than half-page map of that region and small inset map of France highlighting that region within the context of the entire country.  Each region has a brief overview and  sections on the major cities in the region.  There is a list of ""off-the-beaten-path excursions"" and ""not-to-be-missed"" lists.  Suggested driving routes are given on pages with a light chartreuse background; ""A drive along the Indre River""(Loire Valley); ""Drive down the Cote-d'Or"" (Central France + Alps);""Drive the Cathar Trail""(South of France) etc.Some regional restaurants and hotels are recommended.  Regarding Paris, this Traveler offers over 50 pages just on Paris and the Ile de France, with coverage on major museums, Notre Dame Cathedral, shopping etc.  There are ""insider tips"" throughout the guide.If you are new to France this is a beautiful, well-organized, good introduction to current day France and you will feel as if you are in the hands of a very competent guide.  If you are looking for more in-depth coverage of a specific city or region you will need additional resources.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I6MASO8DJ3MS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426214006#wasThisHelpful","R3I6MASO8DJ3MS","A3K4SHKV5H9OSU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4SHKV5H9OSU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fits true to size and also comes in W and WW (wide and extra wide). My elderly mother has trouble with her foot swelling and could barely get her older pair of these on.  She loved them so I bought the next size up.  They were too big on her foot.  When I got her the same size, just wider, she could get them on easier and the fit was perfect.  It is hard to find this style in WW so I bought an extra pair for her, which will be her 3rd pair.  She loves them because they are warm and easy to slip on and off.  At first she was concerned that the back of the shoe would not be secure when she walks.  They may look low cut in the back, but inside the heel cup dips low, and this is a most comfortable style. Even in Illinois-Wisconsin, this style will get you through most winter days if you are mostly just out in your car and in the parking lots.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MX4ESV8NY00V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094WGSSS#wasThisHelpful","R2MX4ESV8NY00V","A3K4SHKV5H9OSU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4SHKV5H9OSU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Maja soap.  I use it all over my home in place of potpourri, or air fresheners.  I often find when I buy it online, although it is less expensive, it also doesn't have much scent to it.  I figured Sellers are sending out their older stock to online customers...One Amazon reviewer said not all Maja is made in Spain.  She recommended buying the round 4.9 ounce versions, saying those are made in Spain and have the most long-lasting scent.  I took her advice and bought these, but was very disappointed upon opening them.  Yes, they do smell like Maja, but very weakly.  When I looked at the labels it said made in Spain AND it also said Hecho en Mexico/made in Mexico.  These will go back to Amazon as a return.

"This was a wonderful tour of the art and architecture of Florence. For a greater introduction and history of the city and the art of Florence during the renaissance watch the four parts of Empires - The Medici, Godfathers of the Renaissance The DVD on the Medici is fascinating and explain how the Medici were great Patrons of the arts in Florence. It is a well-done drama interspersed with PBS experts explaining and putting all in context. This video enhances what has been learned and adds to it. If you are a renaissance history buff there is a wonderful complex board game about to release its second edition thanks to Kick-starter crowd sourcing support. It is called Florenza Florenza Board Game There is also a card game which is quite similar Florenza: The Card GameAnother fascinating DVD is Monty Don's Italian Garden [Import anglais] This one also includes a lot of history in the narration; a note of caution-check if the copies available are suitable for U.S. DVD players--may be hard to find for Region 1 (US). The gardens are breath-taking. May I also recommend two books?

"Recently developed an interest in Florence, Italy.  People and places and artworks I had heard of all my life, suddenly fit together in the context of this city.  I had heard of places such as the Duomo and the Ponte Vecchio; their images are emblematic, I had seen photos many times, but did not know their names or location. I had not understood that Dante, Galileo, Machiavelli, Botticelli, Michaelanglo and the Medici,etc, were all from Florence and lived there around the same time, and many of them interacted.  For years I had a copy of the 1883 oil of ""Dante Meets Beatrice at Ponte Santa Trinita"", but I did not realize they both lived in renaissance Florence.  I recently learned one of the largest hospitals in modern day Florence was founded by Beatrice's father. Little by little, as I read works such as ""The Stones of Florence""  The Stones of Florence, and ""Brunelleschi's Dome"" Brunelleschi's Dome: How a Renaissance Genius Reinvented Architecture history began coming to life to me.  And Florence has so much interesting history, architecture, sculpture and art. And so many museums even beyond the Uffizi.  For an overview I recommend the PBS DVD from the Empires series, called ""The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance.Empires - The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance This DVD is actually a very good introduction to this game, as the game's players are five elite Florentine families including the Medici.I came across this board game on Kick-starter online.  The producers of Florenza posted a project so they could release a second edition of this game.  The project was funded and a second edition will be out around December 2014.  It will be basically the same with some improvements in game pieces and card stock.  There was an event I was involved in and needed the game sooner, so I purchased one of the few new first editions of the game still available.  I like the game, but it is very complex.  Our group went very slowly through three rounds of the eight rounds in a full game.  It took a long time because none of us were familiar with it.  One person in our group did not play; he just kept checking the instruction booklet step by step helping us figure out what to do and which pieces to use.  The group was composed of all adults, but none of us are frequent ""gamers"".  I think this is the type of game I will enjoy more and more as I become familiar with it.  If you have a good imagination and a love of Florence and history I think you may appreciate this also.  I could imagine it being a wonderful game if you have a lot of time to play it--say during a cold Midwestern winter.  Or if you have a houseguest  staying with you for a few days or longer. The game is designed for two to five players. Each player represents one of the patron families of Florence, such as the Medici family.  You will assign and pay workers to build workshops to develop your income and resources.  When you have acquired resources, such as textiles, spices, gold, marble, you will assign workers and actual historic artists of the time to build or create actual artworks, statues and buildings in your palazzo, District, or city, earning more income, resources and prestige points. Being Florence, human jealousy and intrigue come into play by one of the families serving as District Captain and Bishop in each round. These two offices give them political powers to detain you, or your artists, so there are  strategy twists and turns in the progress of the game.  Be aware, if you plan to start the game and continue it in the evenings after work as time allows, all the wonderfully detailed pieces do take up a lot of table space.  There are the city game board, the ""Life in Florence"" 8 vertical rows of character pieces, representing historical figures (with a description of each one in the rulebook), the Prestige Tracking board,each Family's District card containing workshops and art commissions and the Building information cards for each family.  This afternoon's game took up much of a rectangular work table that normally seats eight-ten on folding chairs.  There are many small tiles and cubes and playing cards and board pieces to set up and look after.  I love the complexity and depth of it.  Just be aware it is no Candyland game, it is for 14 year olds and up.

"Wow.  This toy is a certain hit. Matchbox did themselves proud.  The concept of Rescue Ship really gets the imagination going in a good way.  This ship is colorful, well-made and nicely detailed.  Even the two matchbox cars that come with this are waterproof.  I love that the ship rolls on the ground and also floats in water.  It has a floating raft, a squirting helicopter (with landing pad) and squirting water canon.  There's a crane and front and back ramps for the cars.  And there's also the shark and shark cage.  The shark's mouth opens--how cool is that?

"Rolling suitcases have changed since the 1990s. The most important change recently has been the weight of the suitcase. My c.1990's 29 inch roll-aboard weighed twenty (20) pounds when empty! It was too big and too heavy to lift into the trunk of the car taking me to the airport. I got a lot of strange side glances from struggling airport taxi drivers thinking they didn't get paid enough to lift bags like that. Both the Travelpro Marquis Expandable 25 inch and the Travelpro Maxlite 3 Expandable 25 inch weigh only eight (8) pounds when empty. Much better on the back.The other major change is how it rolls and stands when packed. These are both spinners, which means there are 4 wheels vs roll-aboard (tilt and roll on 2 back wheels). Roll-aboards often tip over when fully packed and rested on the front feet. The newer spinners are designed to distribute the weight better, even when expanded, so there shouldn't be as much tipping. Spinners can be pushed, glide at your side, or pulled. This is easier on your shoulder, arm and wrist. The 360-degree spinners are more maneuverable in entering elevators or trains and rotate on their wheel base in tight areas. The Travelpro has two locking extensions to accommodate different user's heights. Because you no longer tilt the suitcase the telescopic handle needn't extend as far. Please note that this can effect how you stack another bag on top of your case; if you are short and use the first locking position the telescoping handle's extension is considerably shorter than on a roll-aboard.Also, the spinner wheels in the Marquis have not only the unique bottom tray to stablilize the wheels like the Maxlite 3, but the Marquis also has Magnatrac, which uses magnets to keep the wheels aligned. Although this listing says the Marquis's wheels can be removed and replaced with a simple screwdriver, I believe that may only apply to the roll-aboard Marquis models, not the spinners. The Travelpro Maxlite 3 being very similar to the Marquis, does has the bottom wheel tray, but does not have Magnatrac. The lining in the black Maxlite 3 is black with blue trim, while the lining of the black Marquis is all blue. There is a little stylish black trim on the Marquis.However, the important features such as 2"" tapered extension and corner guards and wheel crashguards are the same. Also they both have wonderful top, side and bottom cushioned handles for lifting, and carrying up stairs. The bottom handle is important in lifting the suitcase into the trunk of your car, or onto a packing / unpacking surface. They are made of the same, or similar, water- and puncture -resistant fabric, both inside and outside.The zippers on my Maxlite 3 worked very smoothly. The pulls on the zipper to the inner suitcase do cross-meet and have holes that line up for a safety lock to be threaded through. I prefer the outer pocket on the Marquis. The Maxlite 3 outer pocket is very big, almost as long as the lid, but shallow. Travelpro describes the outer pocket of the Maxlite 3 for stashing a coat when traveling from warm to cold locales, or newspaper/magazines, or a few files. It unzips on both sides and there is only an inner safety gusset along the very lowest part--again for weight distribution so it doesn't tip forward. One could open the Maxlite 3's outer pocket carefully by only unzipping one side at a time so smaller items do not fall out. The Marquis's outer zip pocket has a smaller top zip pocket. Both cases came out in late 2013, or 2014 and I am so grateful for the user-friendly improvements.

"Looks even nicer than in the photo. The laser lace is gorgeous.  This bag is classic, feminine and versatile.  It can take you from a day luncheon to a dressy evening out on the town. Larger than an evening bag, this clutch also has two clip on straps.  The shorter one is shown and can be held in the hand or over the arm. It is both modern and slightly retro- reminding me of the fifties and early sixties, when ladies carried their bag over their arm, elbow bent. The other strap is very practical.  It's adjustable and can be either shoulder or crossbody length.  My only issue with the longer strap is that it is only secured at one point and it tends to separate and not look neat.  I am working at straightening my long strap by hanging it with a heavier purse on it until it straightens out.  Then I may ask the shoemaker if they can add something to secure the adjustable part where the strap is doubled.  Also, I recommend keeping the cardboard insert that comes with the bag to store in it and help keep it's shape. There is a removeable sueded liner bag inside the purse that protects the laser lace from tearing and helps the bag hold its shape.  This one I will love for years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R315HFE8BZYMXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM5QRC2#wasThisHelpful","R315HFE8BZYMXX","A3K4SHKV5H9OSU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4SHKV5H9OSU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years my friend has been trying to convince me to buy a Garmin.  I would rather read maps and know where I am.  I did notice that whenever service people came to my house, they never asked for directions, not even the cross-streets, anymore.  When asked if they need directions, they all say no, they will just tap my address into their Garmin.  I thought if all these repairmen and delivery men rely on the Garmin and because I am going on a multi-state road trip I finally took his advice.  And I love this Garmin!!  When I took it out to the areas around here that I am familiar with (basically a 90 mile x 100 mile area of rural and suburban and city roads) I found lots of new roads and ways I had never tried before.  I just set it to my 90 mile destination, but would purposely turn off the road I was being directed to.  The Garmin just keeps naming other roads to get back to the main highway.  It was fun to try these new backroads and I loved how the GPS lists the name of these backroads.  Out here most of the backroads are rarely posted with signs--you have to pre-map them out to know.  Besides showing the names of the roads, I am impressed how Garmin labels exactly what the speed limit is and exactly when you have entered a new speed zone.  Also, very impressed by how it times entering road ramps and tells you just at the right time to enter the ramp, after having given a little warning first. Only thing I did not like, when I was in the state capital, Garmin told me the incorrect name of streets 2-3 times.  The directions were always correct, but the names of the street the Voice said and what was printed on the Garmin was different than the street signs I was seeing in town (2 or 3 times).  It also was not a matter of saying it was Highway 30, but in town would be called 'Washington Street""---no these were short streets ( a few blocks long) in incorporated areas of the state capital.....Otherwise --this is easy to use and I am very glad I have it.  Also, my friend told me not to buy the extra stand.  He said it takes up too much room for stashing in your glove compartment, and potential sticky fingers looking for cars with GPS, don't really notice the empty Velcro strip.  Instead he told me to order a few pieces of Velcro tape and place the Garmin right near me on the dashboard.  It is ok if you need to cover a part of your vent, or CD slot, etc because you just pull the Garmin off the Velcro to access what you need.  I used about a 2 inch piece of Industrial strength Velcro, that I bought on Amazon.  I put the smooth backing on my Garmin and the fuzzier backing on the dashboard.  Caution: be sure you have the Garmin plugged in before you position your Velcro, because the cigarette lighter plug-in goes on one side of the back of the Garmin and effects how you position it for the Velcro. So now, around home I not only know where I am, I know more and more of the back roads and alternate routes to learn even more of my home area.  And this will be super on the road trip to new areas. It makes driving more fun to find these new ways to go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ALIKGXVMMWPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXZWG8Q#wasThisHelpful","R3ALIKGXVMMWPZ","A3K4SHKV5H9OSU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4SHKV5H9OSU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are wonderful.  They stack and store well, due to the magnets.  I love the 2 differently shaped ends for measuring, depending on if you have to measure from a narrow bottle...or one end for liquid ingredients and the other for dry herbs and ingredients.

"Something is wrong with this product.  I used to use Revlon emery boards always and forever.  Now, one side of these files is too damaging to nails.  It is like coarse sandpaper.  I can only use the finer side, not the darker colored main side.  The finer side used to be for refining and smoothing the finish after you had used the other side to shape your nails.  It is the shaping side that is just too coarse and damaging to fingernails.

"This design is called the Eneko.  It is the first of five Buff headbands I purchased.  The colors in this are beautiful.  Vibrant shades of orange to golden-yellow to deep olive-green.  This will be awesome July through Midwest Indian summer and Thanksgiving, as the fields and harvest golden, and the leaves change colors. And, of course, anytime it blends... or clashes !! ...with what you are wearing.I have never been able to wear headbands-they never fit the shape of my head.  Until I found Buff.  The flexibility of the fabric and the width of it somehow does work for me, although I still need two bobby-pins crossed on the back of the band, behind each ear.  Just me I guess--most people won't need this.Since I have been wearing by hair pulled back in a twist for years, the Buff gave me a style lift.  It fits close to the head, so do not look for volume, but that no volume sleekness is the style now.  This keeps my fly away layers under control.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27NZG2522O20O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EMBX5L4#wasThisHelpful","R27NZG2522O20O","A3K4SHKV5H9OSU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4SHKV5H9OSU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a while you know what works for you.  Here's what I like about this crossbody / shoulder bag--The strap is wide, soft, cotton webbing (not nylon webbing which is slippery) and the strap won't slide right off your shoulder.  The strap is adjustable; you decide. The bag is waxed canvas and holds it's shape.  Zipper top with quality zipper, so you can get right in without unbuckling / unfastening.  Yes, there is a black leather flap in the front that gives this a lot of style.  The flap does not get in the way of the top zipper access.  Because it is magnetic, the flap just lifts up, and you simply release it and the magnet automatically closes the flap.Lots of pockets:  Under the FRONT flap is an open pocket for your smartphone: it easily holds my Samsung Galaxy 3.  Under the phone slot is a pocket as wide as the bag, with organizer holders for 3 pens/ markers/laser pointer and one more small pocket that looks like it could hold a Passport, or hotel room key, etc.  This section under the flap is top-gusseted so it expands on top, but the floor of the pocket doesn't expand.  Also, if one tried to over fill this the magnets on the flap wouldn't close.  But it does make for easy access and gives you a bit of emergency room.On the BACK of the Tumi is a large pocket that starts two inches down from the top and runs the depth and full width of the bag.About 9"" deep and 10"" wide.  This BACK pocket is magnetic closure also (one center magnet). The top edge of the BACK outer pocket is nicely trimmed in leather.  Inside this BACK pocket is another smaller pocket which also could be used for phone, possibly Garmin, or camera, etc.  Again, my Samsung Galaxy fits width wise into this pocket, but since it is not as deep as the FRONT organizer pocket, part of my Samsung sits above the pocket, but still totally within the overall large BACK pocket.The CENTER of the bag, once again is the top zip access. Inside the CENTER is another very large zippered pocket on the back wall.  On the front inner wall of the CENTER of the bag there is a loose piece of fabric that serves as a space divider.  You could probably put something like a Kindle or notepad either there, or possibly in the large zippered inner pocket--I am not sure because I don't own a Kindle or notepad.  On one side of that fabric divider are three more sewn pockets for pen-marker-laser pointer, etc and a final small open pocket about the size of a pack of Kleenex tissues.I like the vintage look of the weathered pewter hardware.  Tumi tracker is included inside the bag, so if it's ever lost and called in, Tumi will contact you to get it back. Currently Tumi is even offering monograming.  I keep calling this a bag, not a purse, because I may have found it listed under men's travel bags.  Don't let that fool you.  It makes a sturdy elegant handbag for women too.  Being a decades long vegetarian, I like that this mostly a waxed canvas bag.  I will admit the leather trim gives it an expensive sophisticated look.  I like the size of this bag, it's just right if you don't want to carry a ton of stuff around.  The only thing I didn't like is because this is waxed canvas, the bag has some slight markings.  They seem to be going away as I handle the bag.  I might order another one of these-- I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QQ8TZL1T1RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064JMHZW#wasThisHelpful","R20QQ8TZL1T1RF","A3K4SHKV5H9OSU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4SHKV5H9OSU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My much-loved Sony DVD / VHS combo recorder has stopped working. I came across the Magnavox HDD/DVD Recorder  (Black) and the Magnavox MDR533H/F7 HDD/DVD Recorder. The sad part is I gave up on the VHS tape recordings at this time. Sad because I still have a few unique VHS tapes from Conferences which I won't be able to replace to DVD. The good part is the MAGNAVOX will record from the TV to DVD, and play DVDs, and NOT need an external tuner, also called a cable box. I ordered the MAGNAVOX HDD/DVD Recorder, Model MDR535 or MDR535H/F7, because it has both analog and digital internal tuners. Internal tuners mean I do not need the cable box from my cable company. I have no room for the cable box, and there is monthly fee I won't have to pay. The Magnavox HDD/DVD Recorder, has a hard drive disc with 500GB of HDD so you can record to the hard drive OR record to a DVD-R OR record to your hard drive + then to a DVD-R or DVD+R. Amazon also sells the Magnavox MDR533H/F7 HDD/DVD Recorder with 320GB of HDD for $50 less. Except for losing the ability to play my old VHS tapes, this seems like a great update. What you also gain from these units is they are like a DVR or TiVo (except the TiVo I looked at only has 75 HD compared to the 500 HD on the Magnavox) :you can pause live TV etc. And you do not pay the monthly cable fee for a DVR.Don't want to get in over my head trying to explain TiVo, because I am such a novice!! I am just trying to make sense of all the electronics out there and what would work for me. I thank all the Amazoners who write reviews--they sure do help in trying to figure all this out. Also, Amazon has a guide that came up while I was researching this. I think it is called 'How to cut the cord' or something similar and it lists exactly what products you need to get away from cable and stream (ex. Netflix, etc) I was surprised at how few products they listed... You may need WiFi I have forgotten, but it is an interesting Amazon guide to search for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSPG4XAJPDICF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WROL6G#wasThisHelpful","RSPG4XAJPDICF","A3K4SHKV5H9OSU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4SHKV5H9OSU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The Magnavox HDD/DVD Recorder, has a hard drive disc with 500GB of HDD so you can record to the hard drive OR record to a DVD-R OR record to your hard drive + then to a DVD-R or DVD+R.  Amazon also sells the Magnavox MDR533H/F7 HDD/DVD Recorder with 320GB of HDD for $50 less.  Except for losing the ability to play my old VHS tapes, this seems like a great update. What you also gain from these units is they are like a DVR or TiVo (except the TiVo I looked at only has 75 HD compared to the 500 HD on the Magnavox) :you can pause live TV etc. And you do not pay the monthly cable fee for a DVR.Don't want to get in over my head trying to explain TiVo, because I am such a novice!!  I am just trying to make sense of all the electronics out there and what would work for me.  I thank all the Amazoners who write reviews--they sure do help in trying to figure all this out.  Also, Amazon has a guide that came up while I was researching this.  I think it is called 'How to cut the cord' or something similar and it lists exactly what products you need to get away from cable and stream (ex. Netflix, etc)  I was surprised at how few products they listed...

"My much-loved Sony DVD / VHS combo recorder has stopped working.  I ALMOST bought this Toshiba to replace it.  It sounds like it would have been perfect except my recorder and TV fit exactly into the space I have.  IF I bought this Toshiba it seems  I would also need a cable box because this Toshiba does not have an internal tuner to capture the stations' signals.  I have read about half of the reviews and I think this is correct from what Amazoners are saying here. I hope I am not misinformed...So, I kept looking and came across the Magnavox HDD/DVD Recorder  (Black) and the Magnavox MDR533H/F7 HDD/DVD Recorder.  The sad part is I gave up on the VHS tape recordings at this time.  Sad because I still have a few unique VHS tapes from Conferences I won't be able to replace to DVD.  The good part is the MAGNAVOX will record from the TV to DVD, and play DVDs, and NOT need an external tuner, also called a cable box.

"I have sensitive skin and can not tolerate anti-bacterial ointments.  My dermatologist told me to use this in place of Bacitryn or medicated ointments.  It reminds me of petroleum jelly, although the Aquaphor will eventually soak into your skin and not be greasy.  My doctor said it forms a protective layer over skin injuries and it has always worked for me for over seven years.  Sometimes, in the winter, my skin gets so dry it actually cracks on the side of my index finger.  Aquaphor is the only thing I have found that will allow the cracked skin to heal.  Does not have any funny scent.

"What a find!! I have a friend who has read every book  he can find on astral projection.  He's studied it for over twenty years.  He said Von Braschler's book breaks much new ground and has many helpful secrets.  He said to check out p. 62.  Here Von Braschler describes a visualization exercise.  What's different is he tells you to first create a detailed picture of what you want in your mind's eye; then he has you visualize what you've created as having already taken place.  Giving your visualization life, the second part, is the subtle difference leading to the real magic of creation.The book also stretches the idea of astral travel, or astral projection, into the larger concept of time travel.  This concept is not only broader than that of astral projection, but also serves more of a purpose in clarifying the kind of experience you are about to undertake.  Friends, there is nothing like a good book written by one who has gone through the process of learning a new skill and explaining how to do it to the rest of us.  Von Braschler shares many of his early experiences in his writings.  The book is quite interesting to read and I thank the author for sharing his many insights. May I also recommend another very good author on astral travel:[[ASIN:B00GA420FS The Multidimensional Human: Practices for Psychic Development and Astral Projection [Paperback] [2010] (Author) Kurt Leland]Von Braschler and Kurt Leland, two newer authors worth checking out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TVRHCY1QHKHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594774471#wasThisHelpful","R2TVRHCY1QHKHY","A3K4SHKV5H9OSU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4SHKV5H9OSU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Another new product to get to know.  First I couldn't find the directions.  Haven't you noticed a lot of new products come without any manuals?  Like printers, even all-in-one printers, copy, fax, and scan only have an online manual.  So I spent at least 20 minutes trying to visualize how the light fits into the dock and outlet plug.  Then I read and highlighted the Important Safety Information which comes in multi-languages.  Still didn't see any directions, but the lawyers who wrote the Safety Information scared me some more about the unit exploding and starting fires....Finally, since I couldn't really figure it out, I opened to the other side, where the French Safety Info was and found Using the Chargelight.  There actually are directions and they aren't too bad.  I still don't get how to attach the wrist strap, and if I am supposed to charge this now or wait until the red LED light shows up.  I am not bonding with this.  Feel like I have gotten along without it and feel leery about carrying it around in my purse (is explosions, fire, thunderstorms...oh, my)  Well, I get the feeling for most people that want to be around their Smart phones when out and about, this is a nice battery backup, so they can stay in touch.  Also, it is nice to have extra charging cables and all.  And the flashlight/ strobe light is good to have handy.  I think once I bond and get used to it, or if you are comfortable with all the new technology, you will like, or love this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R44C1PAINZVKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EIN1C4I#wasThisHelpful","R44C1PAINZVKD","A3K4SHKV5H9OSU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4SHKV5H9OSU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The music is solid, surprisingly good.If you like the collection of classical music pieces featured you most likely will like this.  The pieces are well performed.  Some lesser known pieces in the collection.  Personally, I am not feeling the romance upon listening, a bit much melancholy....A few seem more mad than romantic, like the Bach Toccata BWV.

"I knew they were there, but they seemed so distant, they were easy for a teenage music fan to ignore.  I didn't sing, they were black and extremely exotic to white bread, twinkie suburbanites in the sixties and seventies.  Before the internet, before American Idol, all we had was our transistor radios under the pillow after bedtime and maybe a shot at seeing a group perform on American Bandstand, or Shindig.  ""20 Feet from Stardom"" makes me feel I either missed, or ignored something happening in music back then.  These female vocalists were amazing singers.  They  could sing and they weren't ""readers""--they felt the music.They brought the song to life.  At one point in the film, we're shown how flat a song can come across without the response of the back up singers. Think of Ray Charles' ""What'd I Say"" calling out...""Hey!"" and Ray not being answered back with a confirming, (Hey) ...""Ho""....""Say it one more time right now (just one more time)"".Back-ups also shift the music, and bring a new dimension to the lead's opening.  Near the beginning of the film we hear the great Lou Reed singing a restrained solo ""Walk on the Wild Side""-  ""...and the colored girls go 'do -  do - , do-  do-tah-do- do - do'....."" The refrain opens up with the gorgeous backup voices singing with him.These voices were behind the greatest rock songs. They embellished the song and gave it layered interest.  Think of Phil Spector's ""wall of sound"". Think of Merry Clayton who did the soaring, and emotional female vocal behind Mick Jagger in ""Gimme Shelter.""  ""Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away.""  Imagine Jagger at the height of his popularity, during a late night jam at a recoding studio, being told by the producer they need a female voice.  Merry Clayton tells about getting the late night call and going down to the studio in her curlers, silk pajamas and a mink coat to do back-up for the Stones.  We're still thrilled by what she added to that classic, and many, many others.  All along the way these talented young singers sadly were taken advantage of as were many in the music biz: not only the back-up singers, many lead singers, as well as producers, and other behind the scenes musicians.  This film entertains, answers a lot of unasked questions and opened my eyes.  I hope to keep them open to what is really happening around me. I loved this documentary and give it 5 stars, but feel the production could have been a little better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OGH2Z4ORG3TP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1LR2B4#wasThisHelpful","R3OGH2Z4ORG3TP","A3K4SHKV5H9OSU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4SHKV5H9OSU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Takes crime dramas into 21st Century and looks at our workplace issues.  Not in chronological order, but in staging, we have had, among many others, many renditions on police work:  ............The Andy Griffith Show (Mayberry)......Colombo .......Rockford Files ......Cagney and Lacey... ...Monk......Foyle's War......Inspector Lynley .....The Mentalist.........Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries.... The Closer.........Law and Order......The Fall ......CSI .......Nashville.........Detroit ......Criminal Minds ......Prime Suspect.......Inspector Morse.........NYPD BLUE ......and my two favorites:...  Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (TV)......and ......The Wire .......in other words, we've watched crime as entertainment from Sherlock Holmes to Elementary.Line of Duty is a compelling show, but not so much an entertainment.  This series is centered on an internal investigation of an exemplary Officer. I loved how this series looked at the complexities and gray areas of what has gone wrong with the system.  The award winning Detective Chief Tony Gates has been lauded as the top cop of the year, even as internal affairs is questioning his unrealistically high rate of case closures. They are sure he is laddering-cherry picking the cases that he can solve and also add additional charge and case-solutions to at the same time. Gates is not the only one who sees how the system really works and uses it to advantage--a female officer hears of a job opening and refers to her high chance of being hired due to ""gender balance"" quotas.  Another states, ""I'm next in line...I'm a quarter Romany.""The senior officers lament with all the initiatives they have forgotten what the job used to be.  With all the audits, paperwork, etc another comments, ""I want to work for a unit that actually fights crime.""The mood is serious, the acting tremendous, the story quite current, and  I do recommend this thriller for adult audiences.  Also, enjoyed the music that ends each episode.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X3OKSMTE39FF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7AM2YW#wasThisHelpful","R1X3OKSMTE39FF","A3K4SHKV5H9OSU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K4SHKV5H9OSU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Best sized swaddling blankets we bought!  If you're a Happiest Baby reader, you know that swaddling is like the baby cheat code.  A good swaddle gets you to level 5 sleeping in minutes.  You can use swaddles made just for this purpose with velcro/zippers, or swaddling blankets, or a combo of the two.  We opted for the last option.  Our little girl is like a swaddle escape ninja, and make quick work of the smaller Aden and Anais blankets, wriggling her little arms out and looking right at us from her bassinet as if to say, ""haha.""  These Yoga Sprout blankets, though, are big enough that we can really wrap her up tight and get an awesome swaddle on her.  Joke's on you, baby!  Really, though, she looks at us like, ""thank you, finally,"" and then goes right to sleep when she's swaddled properly in these.  They've also held up extremely well upon repeated washings, leading these to be our favorite swaddling blankets by far.  If we don't have these two in the rotation (due to volcanic spit ups), then I prefer the Swaddle Me velcro swaddles, or the Nuroo.  Only as a last resort will I use the smaller Aden and Anais blankets on my ninja.  Oh, and the colors are pretty cute for these Yoga Sprout blankets too.

Luckily, Amazon has replaced it for me each time (yay), but I wish they'd fix that!

"This has to be one of the cutest books I have ever read for babies and parents.  I read it in the bookstore and instantly teared up.  I particularly like that it references all of the ""annoying"" and jarring things babies do (rooting, crying, etc), as animal behaviors, and offers things that the mommy did to help solve the baby's problems.  I think this book would be especially great to read to older children when they are about to become big brothers or sisters.  It can remind them that they did these ""annoying"" behaviors too and place the baby's actions in context for them, as something all animals do, and as actions that mommies and families need to help soothe.  The illustrations are exceptionally cute, too.  I've ended up purchasing three more copies to give as presents to my new parent friends, all of whom had the same teary reaction I had.

"Bought these to label breast milk bottles for pumping, storing, and feeding.  I am SO GLAD I did.  These are really clean, easy to use, and way better than the paper wrapped grease pencils!  I can jot down the time on the outside of a bottle if she didn't finish it too, so no more ""I wonder how long this bottle has been sitting out.""  And I love that there is a little clip.  I clip it onto the side of my Medela Advanced Pump in Style so that I can label each bottle with a quick date and time, and it doesn't get messy or all over the place.  I decided to use white instead of black so that if it rubbed off on clothing or other surfaces, it would make less of a stain.

"I tried Medela, Avent, and Lansinoh's bags for storing my liquid gold riches.  Lansinoh's bags are clearly the best.- Only one with accurate measurements.  Medela is off by about 1.5 to 2 oz, Avent is off by about an ounce.  Since I'm EP, I like to be sure how much my daughter is eating each day so I can keep up.- Easiest to seal, open, and pour.  Medela is designed as though someone wanted to torture pumping mothers.  Who puts a gd hole at the top??  I know, I know, it's for attaching to the pumps, but come on.  Watching that milk spill makes me want to cry, literally.  And the seal on Medela's bags is laughably bad.  Avent's seal is great but it doesn't stand up on the counter as well as Lansinoh's.- Easiest to store in the freezer.  Here's where Medela's bags are actually pretty nice (they are quite compact in the freezer standing up), but Avent's are a real pain because of the long flap on top.  Lansinoh's are like a nice medium between the two, and fit more than Medela bags.- Economical.  Because babies are expensive enough.

"Got the 200 pack of size 1 diapers and it's not only a really great deal but also good diapers. I like that you're not getting individually wrapped small packages of diapers - you're getting large ""tubes"" of diapers instead. These little things absorb a lot and are MUCH softer on my baby's skin than pampers swaddlers. Pampers swaddlers have a mesh covering on the inside absorbant area that keeps sticking to my daughter's skin. So badly, in fact, that it left marks before.

I also like that this is a manageable size, so I can store it somewhere easily accessible instead of stashing a giant foam cylinder away somewhere. My only complaint is that this arrived partially deflated, which meant I had to take out the (included) inflation needle and hook it onto my (not included) bike pump to add air before even using it.

Keep them out of the dishwasher and don't put them away wet, of course!  The block is lovely and fits a full set in a small area - good for smaller kitchens like ours. I'd love to be able to take half a star off, though, for a lack of a full size serrated knife. It includes a small serrated knife but that won't do the trick if you're cutting something like a watermelon or squash.

"Wonderful fabric, excellent attention to details (love that the Velcro tabs all have counterparts to tuck into just for washing), and I like the new package design. My only complaint is that there really should be more Velcro on the bottom section and a bit larger fastening area for the shoulders, as my squirmy 2 month old can still get out of this one a bit at these locations. My favorite is the nuroo, but I prefer the fabric on this one as its cotton.

"This thing is like the magical baby straightjacket.  It's also the only swaddler I found that fit our petite premie (but EXTREMELY active) baby and still held her tight in the early weeks.  The Summer Infant Swaddle Pod also fit her, but it was so loose that it didn't do much to soothe her crying.  Once we put her in the Nuroo smallest pocket and closed the velcro, a look of peace went over her face and she went right to sleep - for reals.  She's now 2 months and around 9 lbs, and we just transitioned to the second pocket in the swaddle.  I love love love that it has several different size options.  It also comes in extra cute colors, although I'd put my baby in a poop-colored paper bag designed swaddle if it made her happy and kept her safe.  The elephant design is darling and unisex.  I would take off maybe 1/2 a star because this swaddle is polyester.  We just went through a heat wave and I had to use the less effective but more breathable Summer Infant Swaddle Me because it's 100% cotton.  Other than that, this is a miracle for us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OICV38EJKTS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFXYHE0#wasThisHelpful","R2OICV38EJKTS4","A1EHDVLCSOU57Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EHDVLCSOU57Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to like this swaddle - it has a lot of details that are thoughtful, such as a two way zipper, cover for the zipper, and those cute and functional hand pockets.  Unfortunately, it's no where NEAR tight enough to make my little one calm down, which I could see immediately upon using it for 20 minutes.I've tried lots of swaddles out (we have an active one!).  My favorites are the Nuroo grow-with-me and the Swaddle Me.  The Nuroo would be perfect if it weren't for the fact that it's polyester (so a little bit hot).  The Swaddle Me is pretty good although it does occasionally require me to tug the shoulders down for proper fit.  For reference, our baby is 2 months old and around 9 lbs.

"I prefer the kind of extension unit in which the plugs are more staggered in their positions. With many devices today having large ""boxes"" at the plug position (no idea what those are called), it's getting harder and harder to fit everything into one power strip.

"Very comfy and perfect for our out of town guests. When folded up, this takes up about the same space as an old fashioned steam radiator. Doesn't look too bad either. I particularly like that this supports a range of body sizes - many of the other folding beds here have a top weight limit around 250-300. This was also EXTREMELY simple to get set up and to fold up and down every day, particularly because the legs automatically come down when you start to unfold it.

"Our baby was born early and was given pumped milk exclusively by bottle for the first two weeks of her life.  Because of that and her relatively underdeveloped sucking reflex, breast feeding was a bit harder to get the hang of than we expected.  For that reason, we really focused on making sure the bottles we used imitated that wide open mouth suckle that is needed for good breastfeeding latching.  Both the MAM and the Avent Natural bottles are designed to make this transition between bottle and breast easier, and both claim to help ""colic,"" a catch-all term that here refers specifically to stomach distress on the part of the newborn.  Having used both, I am much happier with the Avent Natural for a few reasons:- Avent nipples are less likely to fold back in on themselves when the baby is suckling on them. Avent claims their ""petals"" imitate live nipples, so maybe this is part of it.- No difference in stomach distress between the two of them, but I'm able to get the last of the milk out of the Avent bottle more easily than the MAM without tipping the baby's head all the way back.  Since the pediatrician strongly recommended feeding her while she is a bit upright to reduce stomach gas and spit up, this is an important distinction.- Most importantly for me, the mouth of the baby when suckling on an Avent Natural nipple looks much more like the mouth that should be seen on a good breastfeeding latch - wide, with a very open bottom lip.- Just two preference things - the markings are much easier to read on the Avent bottles (both Classic and Natural), so I'm able to see more quickly how much milk the baby has consumed.  Also, I don't see the point of the separate screw-on bottom for the MAM bottles.  Seems like one more thing to lose for me, and my pediatrician stated she doesn't think those bottoms actually have any affect on stomach distress.All in all, I tried out both Avent types (classic and natural), the MAM, and Born Free.  I am sticking with the Avent Natural and bought another 6 bottles in that line because I strongly prefer their nipples and the latch they promote.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T2THDRE6YVOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYOQLNO#wasThisHelpful","R3T2THDRE6YVOZ","A1EHDVLCSOU57Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EHDVLCSOU57Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This has been a GREAT help postpartum - I set it up next to my bed and the baby's bassinet, and put a cheap placemat on top.

"I've always been intrigued by the promise of Bluetooth headphones, but never liked any pair enough to plunk down the big bucks.  What you get in convenience you usually lose in looks, cool factor, and sound.  However I feel like after a week of using this little set, I'm a convert to Bluetooth headphones.  It's so incredibly convenient to throw these around my neck and work all day in my open office environment with them on.  I love that I can switch between my iPhone 6 and my macbook pro quickly and efficiently, due to the dual pairing function.  I don't know of any other Bluetooth speakers I have that pair from one device to another as seamlessly as these do - other manufacturers should take note.  Other things I love:PROS- Sound is great.  Almost as good as my V-Moda over ear headphones and just as good at blocking out noise.- Size and fit.  Perfectly fits around my neck and just rests there comfortably.  It's easy to forget I have these on, actually.- Functionality.  Others have complained about the relative simplicity and lack of ""clickiness"" of the controls, but I actually REALLY like these two factors.  It's so simple to use all of the controls and I find myself reaching for them intuitively already, a week into using these.- Earphone covers for life.  Puts them in the realm of V-Moda for great customer support and standing behind their products (V-Moda already replaced my headphone cord twice).  I found the variety of sizes really nice, too, as I usually can't fit the bigger in-ears properly and so was pleasantly happy to find the small fit perfectly.- GREAT for phone calls.  Clients can hear me loud and clear and these look WAY less lame than those one-ear Bluetooth monstrosities from the early 00s.CONS:- Sometimes I have considerable feedback when using dual device pairing and answering a phone call.  Seems like this happens if my laptop and iPhone are right next to each other - I fixed it by turning off bluetooth on whatever one I'm not talking on at that moment.  Easy peasy.- Battery life could be a little longer (currently listed as 8 hrs, about what I get).  Sound and connection degrades quickly at the end of the battery life, and I would love to be able to listen to my headphones in bed at night to sleep without worrying about how they will charge in the morning in time for my train commute.- Indicator light is SUPER annoying when the headphones are charging if you don't turn them off ahead of time.  That's the only one that almost made me dislike these.  I figured out that you have to turn them off BEFORE you plug them in to charge, though, and then then light no longer blinks on and off all night.In all, the pros considerably outweigh the cons for me.  As with another reviewer, I don't think I would have purchased bluetooth headphones at all prior to testing these out, but now I would be quick to buy another pair if anything ever happened to these.  They are great and so portable.  Now off I go to listen to more music...","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J84LOD1OZZDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY6WCV2#wasThisHelpful","R1J84LOD1OZZDT","A1EHDVLCSOU57Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1EHDVLCSOU57Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This vacuum is a nice option when we don't want to get our large Dyson out (okay, ""large"" is a stretch, but the Dyson is kind of a bit much to pull out EVERY time the dog decides to shred something on the carpeting).  I like how lightweight and easy to use this Bissell is, while still having the economy of a cyclonic (no more bags!).  However, as others have noted, there is no rotating brush on the ""head.""  That kind of renders this thing weaker than it needs to be, particularly because the vacuum seems to have enough suction to be able to pick up debris when it's off carpeting.  On our relatively newish shag carpeting, though, using this is a bit like dragging a large Dirt Devil handvac over the carpet, over and over.  It takes a while to get fuzzier items off the floor.  I would definitely recommend this thing for power, weight, and ease of use if you mainly have hardwood/laminate and some rugs.  It does an awesome job on those surfaces like in our kitchen and bathrooms, and is easy peasy to use.

"I have the ""ultimate set of tools"" and have been working with electronics for 45 years, so I was not afraid of the tools required.  These use a 1.5mm hex key.  Not that popular, but I have them.What is a total fail is, while the center conductor screw clamps onto the conductor, the ground/shield is a totally bass-akward design that could only possibly work for coax and only partially.  The set screw for the other conductors screws against the first wire.  This will never work with a speaker cord which is what I was using it for (longer wires for some computer speakers).  In the case of a coax conductor it will also just split the shield and cause a flaky connection and pierce the insulation into the center connection if you would go any further (as in enough to get the housing over the set screw).I short, I have no idea what they were thinking when they designed this.

"Dell needs another generation on this IMO.  It works fine if you are using this only at its native resolution/refresh.  I am a geek with many, many PCs, laptops, servers, you name it.  This one was to replace a 24"" Dell U2410.  The primary PC would be running 4K 60Hz, but, via the wide array of inputs, it would also be used occasionally for a 2nd PC, a docked laptop, and a phone.I am not a gamer, and I have zero issues at 3840x2160 at 60Hz via DP 1.2.  No noticeable lag, and good color, especially after calibration.  Unfortunately, at any other resolutions/frequencies, it is worthless.  At 30Hz, the lag is terrible -- like 1/4 second to 1/2 second.  Note that, again, I am not a gamer, and I find 3840x2160 at 30Hz on a 4K TV to be very usable.  This is not.  It is awful.  I've never seen anything this bad.  Also, it is unusable at HD 1920x1080.  Rather than just multiplying 2x2 like you would expect (or that Windows can do if equipped with a suitable graphics card), it does some major upsampling, then downsampling again.  The result is so ugly.  10X worse than a regular HD monitor or TV.  I have not seen anything this bad since a really BAD CRT.  And, yes, I did fiddle for hours with every conceivable setting.In short, if you are using this at 3840x2160 and 60Hz via DP 1.2, you will be OK.  If you intend to use it via MHL, HDMI, or with any other PC/game console/whatever that doesn't, it's useless.  The manual is wrong, and the VESA modes that it lists are unusable. I am much happier with my Samsung 4K TV or my other Dell HD monitors.

"This is a fantastic drive.  I am a major hardware geek, especially when it comes to drives (desktop, mobile, SSD, whatever).  Your life and work (or school) are stored on drives, so I keep many around, usually in pairs -- one of which I keep in a fire safe at all times.I also have this drive in the larger (thicker) dual-platter size, and I don't like it nearly as much.  Although the price difference is small between the 500GB and 1TB drives, I like the 500GB better.  It is plenty big for OS and files -- about anything other than video.  The 500GB drive is just super slim and SUPER quiet.  It is about 9mm versus the 12mm listed on this page.I am burned-out on loud drives, and this sleek, thin drive is not only quiet but well-built and handsome.  I got this as part of the VINE program, but I subsequently purchased a twin silver one in 500GB.  I then purchased the 1TB (thicker), but I don't like the 1TB drive nearly as much.  It is thicker and louder.The tops of these are real metal with a nice machined logo on them.  The sides are shiny plastic which I don't like as much because it scratches easy and shows fingerprints.  The bottom is a nice, matte, textured black plastic.  The LEDs are white and in a slit which has a nice effect.  The slimmer 500GB also minimizes the black sides while emphasizing the nice top.I have not had any problems with any of these.  I was tempted to buy some of the 2TB drives, which are a fantastic price, but they are even louder, and you basically destroy the nice case if you try to extract them.  In fact, the 2TB drives are louder than my WD Green desktop drives.So, despite the price, the 500GB is really my pick of the litter.

"I have two older versions of this fanless PSU, namely the 80 plus Gold versions and quite a few fan-powered SeaSonic PSUs.  No pun intended, but I was a SeaSonic fan boi!  I would have thought the new Platinum fanless would be an improvement.  Not at all.Note that the quality of the PSU itself is excellent.  No noise, high quality -- just like the previous ""older"" versions.However, SeaSonic has redesigned all their power supplies compared to a couple years ago, so the modular plugs are no longer compatible.  But, the deal breaker is that the new modular cables use cheap flat ribbon cables, and, for me, they are TOO SHORT!  The older cables were vastly better.  They were fully sleeved as well as longer.  I build my PCs with large cases for big circulation and ventilation as well as large, slow fans.  These fanless PSUs are perfect for this.  However, the newer cables get all scratched and cut up by my heat sinks.  The cables are stiff and cheap and too short.  Also, for my cases (SilverStone FT02), the SATA ""backplane"" connectors go the wrong way, so the cable has to be further mercilessly twisted and contorted to reach.  The old cables were not directional (not 90 degree), so you could easily use them in either direction.  I had to use many extensions and Y-connectors, and it was a mess.  I finally decided to replace as many of the cables as I could.  Luckily, the older SeaSonic PSU cables for the Molex and SATA can be found on eBay.  Those are compatible.  In all, I had to spend another $20 to get just SOME of the cable back to like they were in the older version designs and to fit my cases.NOT worth the cost or the hassle.  I will look for another fanless PSU brand in the future.  I have enjoyed SeaSonic PSUs for over a decade, but no longer.  Their cheap cables are not worth spending 50% of the cost of the power supply to replace.  I will probably go with SilverStone fanless in the future.UPDATE:  I'm going to knock this down another star.  This comes with 3x PCIe sockets (technically a 4th is a shared MB CPU/PCIe modular socket), but there are NO commercially-available PCIe cables that fit this -- not even from SeaSonic.  I tried one from SilverStone which physically fits, but SeaSonic is too cheap to pin-out these 8-pin sockets.  They are only 6-pin and thus the PCIe only works with 6-pin -- NOT 8-pin.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QNGHSTQ6BYSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZWQXUQ#wasThisHelpful","R3QNGHSTQ6BYSI","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow!  What a fantastic cable!  Not only is this a super-rare, left-angle power cord, but it is available in a variety of lengths (as well as right-angle).I actually needed the two prong version of this which, I believe, is a C17, however this is compatible.  C17 cables are next to impossible to find, especially in an angle plug.  This is exceptionally compact and has the added benefit of a gripper to pull the cord out.I have many C13 power cords, and most of them are stiff, cheap junk, so I was worried that this 3-wire C13 would be way too thick/stiff for my 2-wire C17 application.  To my surprise, this is much more flexible than most of my C13 cords and about as flexible as my 2-wire C13 cables.In sum, I am just completely satisfied with this on all levels.  I would highly recommend this compact plug for any 2-wire/3-wire application where you have limited space behind your equipment.  This gave me my needed clearance, and I am thankful for this product.  I rarely say thankful because often there are many products to choose from, and it is often a matter of choosing the least bad solution, but not here.  It delivers with no sacrifices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RGHZGADTI6GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B29HM4K#wasThisHelpful","R1RGHZGADTI6GX","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I regret believing the positive reviews on this ""enterprise"" product.  For three hundred bucks, I could buy ten or more garbage consumer products which actually work better.  The web interface is crude and is a joke.  I wasted time on forums trying to figure out how to do pretty much anything more advanced than setting the SSID which, that and pretty building pictures, are about all you get through the UI.  There is no MAC filtering which is a basic feature even on junk products from ten years ago.The real killer on this joke of a product is it's range.  It falsely advertises 28dBm and 28dBm on 2.4GHz and 5GHz respectively with 3x 5dBi antennas.  Well, first, it won't let you set 28dBm.  Well, they could argue this is a country limitation.  So, I changed it in the SSH command line, but the UI will still not let you change it.  At a maximum of 22dBm on a 5dBi antenna, it consistently provides a signal 5 to 10 dBm LOWER than a garbage WiFi 20 dBm router with a 2dBi antenna.  On 5GHz, I can barely get a signal in the room directly above the AP.I thought this would solve my problems of poor reach/range and competing with neighboring WiFi signals, but this is a joke, and there is basically no feature set.  I will have to go back to having multiple APs, but I will go with the ones that cost twenty bucks.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ILPH1ZQQ1B30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D80J2XU#wasThisHelpful","R2ILPH1ZQQ1B30","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Decent and good value, these are of the split ring construction (male end) which is the only kind I will use.  I've had various of the machined (and more expensive) brass ends, and they get jammed on the female jacks, sometimes breaking them or ripping them clean off the circuit board.  These are the safe kind, and, in fact, I would say that the male end is too loose -- not gripping enough and spinning around too freely.I would give these 3 stars for this, but they are also very inexpensive, and I needed 8 of these, so this worked out fine in a home environment.  I would be hesitant to use these in a mobile/car environment, however, because of the too-loose fit.  Overall, these work without spending 5 or ten bucks a piece on ones that can potentially damage equipment -- which is pretty much all the other available products out there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WJCSIWZOXIBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWHT2P8#wasThisHelpful","R1WJCSIWZOXIBH","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fantastic!  This is of the PE dielectric coaxial construction and is surprisingly flexible.  The little dongle/connector in the middle is a bit large, but it performs fine.  I noticed no pickup of hum or noise which suggests this is a quality, shielded product.Despite the other negative review and conflicting Amazon information, I took a chance on this.  Unlike the detailed description, this matches the title and picture.  It has one male RCA plug adapting to two female RCA jacks.  Each female jack gets fed the same signal from the male end.  This is useful to sending an audio path to two amps, etc.  In my case, this was to two subwoofers.Also, note that the male end is of the split ring construction.  This is the only type I will buy.  I have had many of the machined brass kind, and they are terrible, despite appearing more fancy and certainly, usually much more expensive.  The reason is this.  Male/female RCA jacks vary in tolerances all over the place.  I've had machined brass RCA male plugs go into the jacks, but like one of those Chinese finger-pull toys, they don't pull off.  I've had them jam and literally rip the jacks right off expensive amplifier circuit boards.  This is a very common construction, and I avoid them period.Anyway, these are the ""ticket"" and work excellent.  I highly recommend this product along with the KabelDirekt coaxial RCA cables for connecting low-level signal paths.  Finally, run away from those twisted-pair construction wires.  They are garbage, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT38VHDTB4OO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M8S06M#wasThisHelpful","RT38VHDTB4OO7","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these little subwoofers and would give them 5 stars except for their quality control problems.  I've had to return about 50% of them.They deliver a good amount of tight, controlled bass for a bedroom or office or small living room.  I actually prefer the bass quality of two of these over a larger subwoofer, including some pricey brands.  This is something I prefer in the 5.2 or 7.2 setups where two subs perform better with less standing waves and more even bass distribution, despite the sheer lack of ultra-low frequencies.  These do exceptionally well for music, but not as good as the bigger 12"" and 15"" units in a home theater where you just need to move a lot of volume of air for explosions, sound effects, and so on.The quality control is terrible on these with several units having crooked drivers (yes, the actual drivers) and sloppy manufacturing.  Sometimes, the manuals are all torn up, like they got dragged under a forklift or something.  Weird things like dirty, broken Styrofoam and holes punched in the boxes.  Seems to be all over the place.  Most of these cosmetic defects, however, can be cleaned up with the exception of the crooked drivers/assembly.There are also a few bugs.  The LFE (according to the manual) is supposed to bypass the active filter, but it doesn't.  Also, it is labeled such that the right channel is LFE only.  This doesn't fix it either.  In any mode (line-level or RCA), both left and right inputs are summed and go through the active filter.  With only 1 channel, you will get half the bass.  You may be able to correct this with level settings, depending on your overall setup.  This is fine with me, but not the way it is labeled/described in the manual -- just so you know.  Also, the auto standby doesn't do anything.  The power draw is the same no matter what.  This is also OK with me as a fancy-pants Velodyne would auto-cutout at low volumes despite not having an advertised auto-standby feature.  I'd rather have it not work, but it doesn't work like in the manual -- just so you know.  Finally, across different systems, these seem to work best with the phase 180 degrees.  In all, these electrical bugs are OK with me and perfectly OK compared to the problems I've encountered in other components.  Sad that in this day and age, something as simple as a subwoofer can be filled with bugs.Anyway, the electrical problems are inconsequential to me.  The quality defects may or may not be a deal breaker.  I hope they bring these back soon, as I would like to buy some more.  The price is great, and the looks are fantastic.  They do not scream audiophile dork.  Very clean and elegant-looking.  Compact and unobtrusive.  For the price, these are a winner, assuming you get a good one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGR9I4WLNKMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LRPXAU#wasThisHelpful","R2GGR9I4WLNKMT","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are garbage.  I can't believe all the positive reviews here.On the plus side, they are quite flexible, and the connectors are excellent and compact.HOWEVER, these are just twisted pair wiring.  There is no shielding whatsoever.  These pick up more noise and hum than I have ever experienced.  Truly loud and obnoxious background noise.  I've never had to worry about noise/hum with even dollar drugstore RCA cables or the cheap Chinese-made cables included for free with almost any product.  These are for low-level, high-impedance signals, and they are just a big fail.  I threw them out.  Too bad I bought them somewhere else where the shipping from and back would cost me too much.Nice-looking cable, but that's about it.  Terrible performance.

"I am a huge fan of Noctua, and these are no exception.  They are 50Œ©.  The reality is that every motherboard/configuration/fan is slightly different with a different load.  You can hook fans up directly to the power supply with 12V or through a motherboard header.  Since this is a 4-pin adapter, it makes no sense to use this with anything other than a 4-pin motherboard header and a PWM-controlled fan.  Different motherboard manufacturers implement different speed logic (or none at all) on their motherboards for different fan outputs.  There is also a dependency on the temperature sensor location (chassis or CPU).  The net is there is a huge range of variables.  Any claims that a fan reducer drops a fan by 300 RPM or whatever is a gross simplification and, generally, wrong IMO.What I like is that these are about the right resistance for most of my applications.  I have about 6 computers at any given moment, and most of them are overclocked monsters in huge cases.  My fans range from 60mm to 180mm -- presenting different loads, requirements, etc.  Most of the existing fan speed reducers I have are in the 100Œ© to 150Œ© range which is too high since I'm using slower, quieter fans to begin with.  I no longer use Zalman adapters with Noctua as they lead to a buzzing noise.  With these I can use 1 or stick a couple in series to get 50, 100, or 150 ohms and then pick one of my others if I do, in fact, need more, but I find 50Œ© is pretty good for a chassis fan off a PWM-controlled chassis 4-pin motherboard connector.  Again, it all depends on your particular fans and motherboard.  I generally run SSDs, and I want everything silent.  My monitors typically make more noise than my PCs.Emails with Noctua confirms these are nominal 50Œ©.  Noctua quality, sleeved, etc., but I wish the box wasn't so fancy since I just throw that away.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37M6FNAANY2K9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KG3KP1U#wasThisHelpful","R37M6FNAANY2K9","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Most of my devices that are plugged into it are USB drives or mouse dongles, etc., but I have a few cabled devices such as a SATA dock and a wired keyboard.  Instead of having the cable angle towards me and then have to flop it back over in a mess, this just does the trick in sending the cable rearwards.  A bit expensive to be tidy, but I'm sure it'll come in handy for a long time.  Note to check your port orientation.  This is a right angle.  They also make a left angle.

"I bought this to re-purpose an older, socket 1156 motherboard/CPU -- last one to have a floppy port.  ;)  Embarrassed to say this cost probably more than the motherboard/CPU was worth, but my older EnzoTech HSF beast would not fit in the desktop case this was destined.To get to the point: This is well-made, but uses an incredibly complex/funky mounting system with proprietary screws/etc. so there is no chance to modify/adapt this.  The translation from Japanese was never reviewed, and the instructions are just awful.  I read through them completely 3 or 4 times.  Luckily, the pictures speak a thousand English words.Well, I can tell you that this does not fit my Gigabyte socket 1156 motherboard.  I also checked with a Gigabyte socket 1155 motherboard I had nearby.  The problem is the backing plate for CPU retention mechanism is too thick for this thing's intended design.  This is the scenario with almost every retention mechanism I can recall.  The special stepped screws are just not plain long enough to reach the heat sink arms to even get a thread or two on.  This is something where the holes were designed to line up, but there was no consideration for thickness.I have been building systems since the PC AT days, and all the recent HSFs I have used all accommodate the CPU retention mechanisms that I have encountered.

"This is a good USB 3.0 front panel.  It is sad, however, that people who design these don't have ANY knowledge of the electrical/mechanical aspects to make a great front panel.First, electrically, it works fine with my Intel motherboard's USB ports (both internal header and external), but it won't work at USB 3.0 with my motherboard's ASMedia chip.  The devices are just not recognized AT ALL -- only USB 2.0 devices.  I have found this with other USB hubs, so I suspect it is a problem with the ASMedia chip.Anyway, this uses a USB 3.0 motherboard header.  Strangely, it uses one USB 3.0 port for the 4-port USB 3.0 hub, but then wastes the second USB 3.0 connection for a 2-port USB 2.0 hub.  I wonder why on earth they would do this since USB 3.0 ports are backwards-compatible with 2.0, so this just wastes a precious USB 3.0 motherboard port to give you a lame 2-port USB 2.0 hub.  (I also need an internal header for my case's front 2-panel USB 3.0 connection).I hooked this up to an internal header to external Type A adapter, and confirmed that I can actually just plug one ""half"" into a USB 2.0 port and the other into a USB 3.0 port, and everything works as you would expect.  The speeds I got tested out at around 250MB/s on a Samsung 840 Pro SSD, however, I suspect the limitation is actually my SATA-to-USB 3.0 bridge.  It is clearly working at well-above USB 2.0 speeds and plenty fast for my usage (card readers, conventional HDD, etc.).Another minor fail is the use of an antiquated 4-pin MOLEX power connector.  Almost any modern computer with USB 3.0 headers is using SATA drives and SATA power connectors, so you will have to source an adapter on your own.  They are only about $1, but will interrupt your build and you will have to pay for the shipping/inconvenience.Next, on to the mechanical.  It is made of metal which is nice!  No cheap plastic which I dislike.  However, during the machining, they didn't even bother to remove the plastic wrap on the metal, so you will have to pick that off yourself.  Since it extends under the faceplate, it's easiest to remove the 3 screws which hold it into place rather than trying to pick it out of the cracks.  While it was off, I also painted mine silver since I have a silver case.More on the mechanical:  The USB 3.0 ports are freaking tight, while the USB 2.0 are fine.  I found it best that, while you have the face plate off, take a tiny screwdriver and bend all the friction/grip tabs on the USB 3.0 ports away from the connector.  They are the problem, and when they are bent out of the way, insertion/removal is still snug, but you won't worry about breaking anything off.Meanwhile, the circuit board is held in by 2 screws.  Mine was not like in the picture with 2 screws at the rear of the board.  Mine had two screws in the middle of the board, and the circuit board flops up and down in the panel, especially when struggling with tight connectors.  In the end, I found 2 standoffs and added the rear mounts.  There were screw holes drilled, but mine had no standoffs or rear screws installed.  It does not use typical motherboard-height standoffs.  They are like 3/8"" of an inch.In sum, this could be a really good panel with even the tiniest forethought and care in design/manufacturing.  But, as it stands, it is just a basic, good cheap Chines-made panel.  Nothing to brag about and could be better for the money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16P27FKCQV1KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GN7N32Q#wasThisHelpful","R16P27FKCQV1KT","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a first-rate maca root extract.  I have been comparing different brands of maca to assist with BPH.  I have found that maca is a key component of my treatment program, but even at equivalent doses, this works better than some brands (Now, for example) which don't work at all -- or at least not that I can tell.  Although, per equivalent gram, this is more expensive than cheaper brands, it works.This is a 10:1 extract at 750mg.  I am taking two AM and two PM for an equivalent of 15gm twice a day.  Thus, it lasts less than a month for me, but it is still more economical than the prescription drugs I am on which treat the cause and not the symptom -- which I believe is the more healthy approach.  This is considerably more quantity than the typical 1-3g  or even 5g per day recommendations, but I like the higher dosage.  There does not appear to be any harm in much higher dosages.I do not notice any change in libido, but this herb works not to boost any particular hormone such as testosterone, but bring various hormones more to healthy/normal levels.

"I'm not even going to comment on size.  It's like if you buy an extra large shirt, then complain it doesn't fit right because you are a medium.  This is MY size!  Love the size!OK.  Nice watch, but it doesn't feel as quality as some other watches that may be more expensive but also more discounted.  I would give it 4 stars on the quality.  The watch band is wide, and the holes are cool.  The leather is soft, comfortable, and flexible.As far as style, it is simple and clean and stylish which I prefer or the mega-mechanical look of some watches with endless dials and numbers all over them and are just a busy mess.  Does anyone ever really use lap timers and stopwatches and so forth? I have a smart phone if I ever need that.  I just want something stylish which I can tell I've got 5 more minutes before a meeting by just tilting my wrist which is something I can't do with my smartphone.What I don't like however are a couple of things.First, the bezel is shiny chrome while the body is brushed.  This is too blingy and out-of-place compared to the rest of the watch -- much more so in real life compared to the pictures.  Some of the other colors of this watch don't have shiny bezels.Additionally, I just don't like the overall proportions.  The watch band is thin and seems to vanish away in your arm.  Meanwhile, the very large case (and thick) sticks out.  It just doesn't look overall balanced -- like you have a large protruding metal lump on your wrist rather than a watch/bracelet.  I much, much prefer the Invicta Corduba watches which are a mm or two thinner, but also don't look as thick because the thickness includes the glass (some models).  Also, the Invictas have VERY fat, thick bands which just balance the size of the metal case and look so nice on my wrist.Overall, a good watch, but I think there are some nicer/better watches, too.

"I have purchased this product from Real Herbs several times and am pleased with the quality and customer service.  I am taking this in combination with other supplements for the treatment of BPH which is also being treated with prescription medication.There are various forms of Stinging Nettle including leaf and root and extracts, and even the extracts are not always standardized or standardized across brands the same.  Thus, it is very difficult to know what you are getting, and different parts of the plant can be used to treat different symptoms.  This Real Herbs product is the root and an extract, and, although it is a bit pricey, at least I trust I am getting the portions I am seeking.Regarding the results, let's be honest.  The results are all over the map with in vitro, in vivo, studies on rats, various preparations/dosages, and so forth.  Some done on humans do show improved BPH.  Stinging Nettle contains a variety of components including beta sitosterol and other plant sterols, but the beta sitosterol is comparatively weak, especially when compare to beta sitosteral supplements.  Some research shows no increases in testosterone levels in humans.  Yet, others show that the lignans do block the binding of DHT to SHBG, but this should increase circulating DHT.  Yet, others show it is a mild 5a-reductase inhibitor, maybe 1/10 that of Finasteride (lowers conversion of testosterone to DHT).  It also contains substances which are mild aromatase inhibitors (prevents conversion to estrogen).  So, what am I getting at?  It is a complex herb, and if the scientific community can't really figure out this stuff, then I doubt Amazon reviewers are much better or at all statistically significant.For me, in combination with other supplements (including beta sitosterol), I believe there is a noticeable difference with BPH, even when used with prescription Finasteride/Dutasteride.  I seem to have a slightly less receding hairline, but this could be due to the combination of other products, diet, stress, etc.  Note that these results are improved over just using the prescription products alone, so I believe there is merit in this regimen.So, I will conclude that I will continue experimenting with this product.  For now, though, I give Real Herbs good credit for providing a quality supplement as stated on the label.  There are certainly a lot of lesser, nebulous products that don't even say whether they are root or leaf.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REBNNSJZGWQVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G9MC25O#wasThisHelpful","REBNNSJZGWQVZ","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The biggest problem I have with this is Axe's own Cooling Face Gel http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A0J089E/This foaming face wash comes in your basic foaming soap pump, but the wash is very mild.  It is free of ALS, ALES, SLS, and SLES detergents, so it is very mild if you have dry/sensitive skin.  If, however, you have combination skin like I do, you will be reaching for another wash like the Axe Cooling Face Wash because some parts will still be oily/dirty.The smell of this is also bordering on aweful.  It is sort of plastic meets dead skin.  Again, the Cooling Face Gel has a nice, refreshing cucumber scent.  This foaming face wash delivers a big handful of light foam which just doesn't feel rich and luxurious.  Again, the Cooling Face Gel is very thick and luxurious.  Compared to this, the gel feels like a substantial product.  Also, the gel is cheaper and the bottle lasts a lot longer.All-in-all, it is not a terrible product, and in fact, it is probably the mildest I have ever used.  But, for me, the Axe Chilled Cooling Face Wash is also mild, and is just so much better in every way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDBKP6BBZBGEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A0J09HK#wasThisHelpful","RDBKP6BBZBGEY","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used a bunch of ""accessory"" trimmers/shavers including the Philips Norelco BodyGroom (junk) and Multigroom Pro (awesome) and All-in-1 (good) and various Wahl's and others...I really like this little trimmer/shaver despite a few complaints.  First, it has a very fine tooth trimmer blade.  In fact, it has the same small trimmer blade and foil as the Multigroom Pro.  This fine pitch is important because some are too coarse which lead to more nicks and cuts.  Yikes!  Also, this is impossibly small compared to the other tools mentioned above which makes it very convenient and easy to maneuver.  It is listed for use on facial hair, but since it uses the same cutter and foil as the Multigroom Pro (similar but better than the Bodygroom), I found it works as well on other parts of the body as well or better because it is so compact, thin, and well balanced.  Overall, operation/function-wise, I would give it 5 stars.  It uses a single AA battery which is very powerful and seems to last plenty long for the detail work for which it is intended.The body is sleek and shiny plastic on half, but there is an orange slightly rubberized grip.  I did not find that it was too slippery to hold or grip at any time.There are a few things which I don't like about it, though.  One is that the on/off requires a twist motion.  That requires two hands and which also means if the other hand is wet or dirty with razor stubble, now both pieces are wet, dirty, etc.  Also, the on/off action is the same which opens the bottom to replace the battery and which is the same which twists off the top pieces. So, it is all to easy to accidentally turn the thing more than one stop and/or inadvertently disassemble the thing.  I would much prefer a separate on/off switch.  The beard combs are also a little tight to remove and require the same twisting action.The other thing I don't like about it is that it is vague about using it around water.  It says not for use while bathing/showering/etc. and not water-proof, but to wash it after use.  In fact, INSIDE the battery compartment is a water faucet symbol.  There is a rubber O-ring sealing the battery compartment.  I am not so interested in submersing it, but I do like to rinse things under water or with a little hand soap to clean it out, and so far, that doesn't seem to affect it.A final nit is that I didn't find a whole lot of difference in the 3 beard combs, which are listed as 4mm, 5mm, and 6mm.  I would have preferred a larger range such as 2mm, 4mm, and 8mm, or something like that.In all, my complaints are relatively minor, though.  It is a great companion to my other shavers, especially my Braun foil shaver.  Braun shavers for the last umpteen years have just the junkiest trimmers on them, and I can pull this out and do the trimming that I need.  The Philips Norelco styler is quite inexpensive and very useful.  Not perfect, but definitely recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK2NCU0CP2Z8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARF450E#wasThisHelpful","RK2NCU0CP2Z8C","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly, I was actually hoping I wouldn't like this.  I already have too many Axe products -- various scents of anti-antiperspirants, shampoos, conditioner, 2-in-1 shampoo+conditioners, body washes, body scrubs, hair goos, you name it.  I am beginning to have more stuff in the bathroom than my wife ;-) I don't find the body washes and shampoos all that different, and I figured this might just be some ploy to repackage a similar formulation into a face wash.But, it's not.  Actually, I really do like it.  It is super concentrated.  A pea or bean sized amount is plenty to wash my face.  It is very gentle on my skin YET cleans it as well as the harsher body washes.  I even found it works well on ""delicate"" parts which can be irritated by harsher soaps.As for the packaging, I was a bit disappointed that 1/3 is filled with air.  Yes, just above the clear window of the bottle is where the contents stop.  But, no big. 5 oz is 5 oz.Regarding the scent, with a name like Chilled and menthol on the ingredients list, I was expecting a cheap overly minty/menthol smell.  Instead, it is definitely more herbal.  It contains a lot of plant extracts/botanicals.  The minty chill is barely noticeable to me.  I would almost describe it more of a salon kind of cucumber kind of smell.  It, therefore, feels and smells very luxurious.I have the dreaded ""combination"" skin with some oily, some dry, and some normal.  I felt this did a much better job at not making my face feel tight and dry (Winter cold air mind you) than the regular Axe body washes.So, looks like I will have another Axe product on the shelf...","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V3YR65IDX4SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A0J089E#wasThisHelpful","R2V3YR65IDX4SR","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a car and car care nut.  I have shelves of products.  No, make that a whole closet full.  The best features of this kit are the excellent packaging.  The products, themselves, are just OK.  My overall rating is 3 stars.First, I'll say something about the packaging.  That is one of the best features of Griot's products. For example, the Speed Shine comes in a nice wide-base round bottle with a quality sprayer. When you are detailing a car, I can't stand cheap bottles with junky sprayers that are thin and fall over easily. Often, you are carrying multiple things in your hands and need to rest the bottle down on something and having it fall over all the time and dribble out or pick up dirt is just irritating!  The bottle is very high quality and clear so you can see how much is left and where the end of the pickup tube is.  Similarly, the clay come in a nice, screw top jar with ample space.  Every other clay I've used comes in some cheap cellophane wrapper or some tiny box and getting it back into, well, anything to protect it is nearly impossible.  Hats off to Griot's on the packaging/containers.First up, this contains a generous lump of paint clay.  You can read about claying a car elsewhere but the basic idea is it's a very good part of the prep process for polishing/waxing a car.  The clay in this kit is of a fairly mild type.  It's kind of hard to explain, but there are aggressive clays that are for really poor condition paint that will also start to remove sealants and such, and there are mild clays which remove less contaminants but are more gentle on the paint.  And, there are some in between.  This follows the tradition of most Griot's products that I have used in that it is mild and relatively fool-proof for the beginner but better suited towards well-maintained cars.  The generous lump can be kneaded and used on many cars depending on the level of dirt/contamination.  High rating for a mild clay that can be used frequently and comes in a best-in-class jar.This kit also contains 35oz of Speed Shine which can be used as a clay lubricant.  Speed Shine is technically a quick detailer for used on a slightly dusty car with microfiber towels, but in this kit, it is used as a clay lube.  There are a lot of products that can be used as a clay lube.  In this case, this product works fine.  I also used Speed Shine as a quick detailer (its original use).  For that, I was less impressed.  It seemed to leave a lot more streaks and the lubricity was not as good as competing products that I've used.  The bottle and sprayer are excellent, though.In sum, this is a good, but not impressive kit.  I would be tempted to just buy the clay separately.  There are other better quick detailers out there (Finish Kare #425 is one of my favorites), but if you are new to detailing, this kit will serve you well, and you will appreciate the quality containers which you can reuse.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UCECGKRMVXKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V3PZOY#wasThisHelpful","R2UCECGKRMVXKD","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a car fanatic, and I have used practically every leather care product on the market as well as a host of Griot's products.  I will review each of the components individually.  Overall, my score is 4 stars.First, I'll say that one of the best features of Griot's products, in general, is the packaging.  For example, the Interior Cleaner comes in a nice wide-base round bottle with a good sprayer (more later).  When you are detailing a car, I can't stand cheap bottles with junky sprayers that are thin and fall over easily.  Often, you are carrying multiple things in your hands and need to rest the bottle down on something and having it fall over all the time and dribble out is annoying.  All the bottles are very high quality and clear so you can see how much is left and where the end of the pickup tube is.This kit contains 8oz of the Leather Care Spray and a separate pump spray nozzle. I was quite surprised by the Leather Care Spray.  It is an excellent regular-use cleaner and conditioner.  It leaves a very nice leather smell as well.  I would recommend it for leather that has been well maintained and in good condition.  What I REALLY like about this is that it does NOT leave a greasy, sticky mess behind like most other leather products.  A little goes a long way.  If your leather is in bad condition, look for something more like Leatherique.  The pump spray delivers a well-controlled fine mist, although sometimes it felt like it got stuck and I had to press extra firm.This kit contains 35oz of the Interior Cleaner and separate trigger spray nozzle.  Like the Leather Care Spray, both bottle and spray are packaged separately and sealed so that there are no leaks.  The sprayer is a very high quality and delivers a large volume per pump, but I found the spray pattern to be a bit large and often this led to overspray which I had to wipe over previous areas.  Like the Leather Care Spray, the Interior Cleaner is a mild, regular use product.  I used it on everything from leather, vinyl, to plastics, to even touch screens.  It was fairly all purpose and cleaned mild dirt well.  It did not remove heavy duty stains like some sunscreen on black leather, but that was to be expected.  This is not a miracle product, but an everyday maintenance product.  I felt this cleaner is a bit on the expensive side, but you can also buy a gallon refill bottle.  If you are really cheap, you can make your own refill and just use the excellent bottle.  It has a good amount of surfactants and did not leave streaking.Lastly, this kit contains four 16"" x 16"" green microfiber towels.  I would rate these towels as a ""basic grade"".  I have a LOT of much higher quality ones that I use for paint waxing, etc., but a good basic towel like this is better suited to the task at hand.  Can't fault them for that as it would just make the kit more expensive.  I also have much cheaper MF towels.In sum, this is a good kit for routine maintenance on well-cared-for interiors, and the bottles are nice and Griot's makes larger refills for the leather and cleaner sprays.  If you are expecting some super heavy duty miracle worker products, then I think you will be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNCMDZ09A5505/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V3TQEE#wasThisHelpful","RNCMDZ09A5505","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the greatest utensil I own.  As others have mentioned, it gets into the squarish corners of a pot (for example, All-Clad) as well as it makes a great stirring spoon with more area than a regular spoon for mixing a huge pot of sauce or even a stockpot of soup.  This is even my favorite stir fry spoon.  It has a slight angle to it which is also great for mixing things.  About the only possible nits are that All-Clad handles, in general, are not that comfortable and, if you are left-handed, the angle is going the wrong way.  On the plus side, it is brutish sturdy and will mix the heaviest/thickest stuff I have put it in without bending.  I certainly can't say that about other brands I own that will bend.I wish All-Clad didn't discontinue this.  It is just so awesome.  I will never use the regular spoon if this is around.  Hopefully, someone at All-Clad will smarten up and offer this again.  If I could only have one All-Clad product, this would be it.  It is that good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39IY2GPD4QM4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005AL7M#wasThisHelpful","R39IY2GPD4QM4B","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, this product exudes quality and high-tech.  It should, of course, considering it costs as much as some tablet computers.  The packaging is over the top, and it even includes a tiny toolset, although I found too tiny to actually be useful.  Installation was an absolute piece-of-cake.  Easy push buttons for the wires and very clear instructions.  It is also a very nice-looking product.  The configuration was to my expectation considering its technical complexity.But... after the novelty wore off, my liking of this thermostat fell flat.My first major annoyance is that the thermostat temperatures is just off.  Significantly off.  Like 3 degrees.  Sometimes, even 5.  Yes, that is a big deal to me because I have several thermostats and thermometers and heat rises, so I expect certain temperature differences in my house.  The reason is not that the sensor is off.  Using a very accurate and precise thermometer, the Nest is correct.  It's just that the Nest, being an electrical device, IS actually warmer than the surrounding room/walls.My next complaint, which has become a major irritation, is that the unit's automatic display turn-on is terrible.  The Nest display turns off to conserve energy (like I could actually care).  It has a sensor that detects when you approach it, and it ""wakes"" up.  The problem is that maybe 1/2 the time, it doesn't.  I stand there waving my arms, hands, moving in and out waiting for it to wake up, but I shouldn't have to.  It should just display the temperature and settings all the time.  It does have an auto-dimming sensor which works like a champ but which is defeated by the time-out display turning it completely off.There are other irritations such as it doesn't show the humidity even though it has a humidity sensor in it.  You can only read the humidity through the phone app, which IMO is one of the lamest apps I have run in a long time.  It takes an entire screen just to show one number: your setting.  There was a ""quick info"" mode in the last version, but it wasn't really quick and took far too many clicks and sub-menus and only worked in landscape mode.  That would give you the ability to view the humidity and turn on/off the fan.  That feature seems to have been removed from the app recently.  This reminds me that it is so cumbersome to use the wall thermostat to turn on the fan that I just don't bother.  Now that it seems removed from the app, I really don't bother.  Technical support, while friendly, took almost a week to respond.  No bonus points there.So, in the end, it is cool to show your friends that you can check your home's temperature (which is actually several degrees off) on your phone and you can even change the temperature on your phone, but do I really need that?  The answer is no.  I am a total computer geek, but I value simplicity and ease of use.  In many ways, I miss my old thermostat that tells me (accurately) the current temperature and the set temperature without having to wave my arms to activate it.  Turning on the fan with the old thermostat is just 1 button click away.  It's ability to improve my life (or save energy) is just not there.  I do think all these things can be fixed in firmware and a better app, but it is not there for me today.  Hopefully, Nest is listening to customers and will update the software, but based on the recent app update, they are not.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32B43LO82ACZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GDHYPQ#wasThisHelpful","R32B43LO82ACZ9","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this capacitive touch stylus works very well, but not perfect.  The sensitivity is clearly is not as good as my finger, but generally acceptable.  Some others I've used are better.  On my Samsung Android phone, it seems to have a particularly difficult time with the soft keys at the bottom whereas the rest of the screen is very good.On the plus side, with a this or any stylus, it is so much easier and more accurate to click buttons and type keys.  On the negative side, it is something else to carry/lose.  Also, you have to fumble occasionally and switch hands to do multi-touch gestures such as pinch to zoom and rotate.  I found swiping worked perfect.In general, it doesn't seem up to the quality of others that I've used, but not that far behind either.

"Wow, I'm appalled at the misinformation in some of the reviews.First, this is a 2-lane PCI Express card which can run at 2.0 speeds.  The 640L uses the Marvell 88SE9230 which is a 2-lane PCIe to SATA controller.  Did I mention that this uses 2 lanes?  You must have 2 lanes (or more) to utilize the bandwidth of the latest SATA SSDs which are capable of 500+ MB/s.  Any 1 lane card or controller will not cut it.  Also, don't be fooled by SATA6 controllers on the motherboard if they are not the native Intel ones.  The vast majority of them are connected by only 1 lane, and you will not get the full bandwidth necessary to use one of the latest SSDs.Next, this uses a PCIex4 (4-lane) connector.  Why?  Because there are no x2 connectors.  There are x1, x4, x16 physical connectors only.  This card works like a champ in a x16 slot BTW (for me anyway).  It also works in a x16 running at x8 or even x2.  The physical slot does not = the number of PCIe lanes being used.  That is because the vast majority of mainstream/enthusiast motherboard chipsets do not have enough lanes.Highpoint has been around a long time, and I have used their controllers off-and-on over the years.  Most cards like this, however, are based on a reference design by the chip manufacturer, so I made the mistake of first buying a nearly-identical (and cheaper) card by Syba.  It was a nightmare.  Endless stuttering, drop-outs and compatibility problems over a wide range of SSDs.  Using the same drivers, this HighPoint card works with everything I have thrown at it and using the Microsoft AHCI drivers or the Marvell SCSI drivers (prefer the latter).Another positive about this card is that it has real locking SATA connectors.  I cannot believe other manufacturers save, what 2 cents, on cheap connectors which your cables fall off (which is a basic weakness of the SATA connector without locking tabs).In short, I am extremely picky about hardware working right, and this card works.  I run many development machines and cannot have them flaking out.  Although this card is arguably a rip-off (costing as much as some motherboards), if you have the need for more than 2 SATA6 interfaces (native Intel ones), then this is about the only card I've found without getting a full co-processed RAID card.P.S.  Shame on Highpoint for the included SATA non-locking cables.  Those are garbage.  Throw them away.  Card is not affected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ERWBDQYRJM3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EM7N70#wasThisHelpful","R2ERWBDQYRJM3Z","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used probably 30 or more protein powders.  This ranks near the bottom.First, about whey protein:  The cheapest proteins are just whey protein.  Better than that are whey protein isolates (with fat/carbs more removed).  This seems to be somewhere in between, labeled as a whey protein, I would guess it's just a better quality whey protein.  The best is hydrolyzed (partially broken-down) whey isolates which give you the maximum absorption/utilization and minimal/no fat/carbs.The good points are the taste is just OK (nothing to brag about) and it is relatively cheap.  There are definitely much better-tasting proteins out there, but also some worse.  It is somewhat on the mild/bland/artificial-tasting side IMO.Regarding cheap:  It's not really that cheap when you consider that you're only getting 17g of relatively poor-quality protein per serving.  That'll cost you 105 calories.  In comparison, I think the best protein on the market is Dymatize ISO-100 which, for almost an identical sized serving and 1 more calorie, gives me 25g of the best quality hydrolyzed protein isolate.  That's 50% more and a better-quality protein.  That product, in a 5lb jar, costs me more than 50% more, but there are plenty of other top-rated protein powders like ON's Gold Standard which are cheaper if cost is your main reason for buying (but also somewhat false economy since the quality of the protein is important).So, with the Jarrow product, you're just being fed 7g of fat and carbs (almost 1/3 of it on a calorie-basis!) whereas the ISO-100 has 0g of those.  And, it tastes ""whey"" better.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWE2TCFK2TKIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OSK8Q#wasThisHelpful","RWE2TCFK2TKIQ","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I did not bother to test this with conventional HDDs so bear with me.  IMO, there is only one reason to pay the premium for this PCIe x4 (2 lane) card, and that is to use with SATA6 SSDs.  As stated, this card uses the latest Marvell 92xx generation controller (a 88SE9230).  Architecturally, it appears identical to the HighPoint Rocket/RAID 640L card which costs fifteen bucks more and has no eSATA ports.  So, go for the cheaper one, right?No.  This one, although using an identical chip and drivers as the HighPoint controller card, has issues.  See my customer images.  This card stutters and stops.  I have not seen this behavior (and not this bad) since the earliest SSDs on the market.  It will freeze I/O for 5 seconds or more (maybe even 15 seconds) randomly.  I don't know what's going on.  Spent many hours shaking my head.  This occurs with both the Microsoft AHCI and the Marvel SATA-as-SCSI drivers (much worse with the latter).Don't waste your time and just get the HighPoint controller.  It has zero stuttering.  A final ding is that although it has eSATA and a cute little heatsink on the controller chip, it has those cheap SATA connectors out the back that don't have a locking tab.  Also, if you need angled cables for your drives, good luck because the two top SATA connectors (which do have lock tabs) require angled connectors, and double-angled SATA cables are next to impossible to find.  BTW, the top connectors are also the ones that are shared with the rear eSATA ports.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HU6N5Z4QEF35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009LIPHNC#wasThisHelpful","R3HU6N5Z4QEF35","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product BOASTS smart chip-controlled USB ports (plural).  LOL.  What a joke.  I like Leviton a lot, but this foray into the consumer electronics market is a flop IMO.  First, throughout the instructions, it says it features ""two 5VDC - 2.1A DC powered USB ports"" (plural, again).  I understand that there is a lame limitation of a combined 2.1 amps, which is inexcusable in today's modern age.  With the ""smart"" technology, I figured I would, at least, be able to charge two 1A phones at the same time.We have a household of gadgets from iPods and iPads to Android phones and tablets and even a Kindle.  I was really looking forward to simplifying all the dongles and fighting wires.  Not so.  First, the only thing that would charge above the basic 500mA (1/2A) is our iPad 2.  Sure, it's ""compatible"" with most of the other stuff (except not Asus Transformer BTW).  That is no better than the slow charging I can get from any port on a computer, laptop, netbook, or nowadays cheap alarm clock, car charger, etc., or even the Asus Transformer itself.  (Currently, we have a cheap 4-port USB dongle for low-power/low-priority devices.)Furthermore, the iPad 2 would only charge while using the right port.  Sure, the instructions say that the right port is optimized for ""larger battery devices"" (not that I found that to be the case) but then why claim this has two 2.1A ports?  There is nothing smart that I could find about this product.  Only the right port seems hard-wired to support some iPads -- and it's not even labeled as such.Considering the cost and effort to rewire your outlet(s) and that manufacturers are constantly changing their products, I cannot honestly say this product is worth the money and effort, especially that Leviton grossly overstated this product's capabilities.  I might be willing to give it 2 stars if they clearly stated that this was just a 1/2A charger x2 ports with the limitation that the right port is clearly marked somehow as also compatible with the iPad 2 at 2.1A and there is nothing smart about it and that by using the right port with an iPad, you cannot use the left port to charge an iPhone just like they have in the picture.  But, they didn't.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FM4L6ICPJQI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008O11IEY#wasThisHelpful","R1FM4L6ICPJQI1","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, this drive is wholly incompatible with Marvell SE9130 controllers.  After hours of reading/surfing, this appears to be a problem with any of the first generation Marvell controllers 91xx and most SSDs.  Those controllers, however, work perfectly fine with my old SATA2 Intel and OCZ SSDs.  I have been using SSDs for many, many years.  So, on with my review.  I used this on a Windows 7 64-bit machine Core i7 using the motherboard's Intel SATA6 ports in AHCI, all usual SSD optimizations done.Out-of-the-box, this drive did not even meet the manufacturer's specs.  It is rated for 540 MB/s read and 340 MB/s write (sequential).  I smiled when I saw 550 MB/s reads, but then frowned once I saw it could barely muster 255 MB/s write.  That's down almost 100 MB/s from spec.  OK, for all you that are new to SSDs, with all the current crop of SSDs, the manufacturer's performance specs are a 1-time deal when the drive is brand new and NOTHING has ever been written to the drive.  Once it has, the drive will drop down to a significantly slower performance level.  In essence, it is truly ""up to"" the published specs.So, I proceeded to put about 60GB of files onto this drive.  128 GB is not very big, but my typical OS, applications, and some pics, music, and what-not is about that big, leaving about 1/2 left.  SSDs really do not like to be run full due to wear leveling algorithms and the drive itself needing free space to rewrite and combine small files into its internally large blocks.Well, I was shocked to see the speeds plummet to only 142 MB/s read and 136 MB/s write.  Actually, I was impressed with what seemed like good write speeds as I looked for and grabbed some directories of files to copy.  But, seriously, this is only after maybe 10 or 20 minutes of use!  You can look at the ATTO and HDTune results in the customer photos.  I then deleted all the files, quick formatted it, and let it sit for 1/2 day to allow any TRIM/garbage collection to take place and restore the drive's performance.  This is the ""TrueSpeed"" Plextor talks about.  Well, after 1/2 day of sitting powered-up, essentially no difference, and in fact, maybe a hair worse.So, I give it 2 stars for performance.  I have older G2 Intel drives and Intel 320 drives that have been literally beat on for years (Vista without TRIM, TrueCrypt encrypted, RAIDed, etc.) that have better performance without ever needing to run Intel's SSD Toolbox to restore or secure erase/reset them.  Yes, the garbage collection in Intel's early SSDs is really that good (before they went to 3rd-party controllers).  So, next I began looking for the equivalent of Intel's SSD Toolbox or Samsung's SSD Magician.  This retail product is supposed to come with a CD with utilities, etc.  It's also supposed to come with an Installation Manual.  Maybe that information was on the CD?  I will never know because mine did not come with either.  Minus another star.  Down to 1 star.Hours of surfing later, I finally found the Plextor SSD tool.  But, alas, it is in their forums.  So, I have to create an account in order to access it.  But, WTH?  The link to the file gives a 404 Not Found.  This is despite it being posted by one of the moderators/admins only 5 months ago.  I eventually found some discussion (on a different forum) that the Plextor tool doesn't support the M5/Pro drives anyway, and that they are working on it.  I'd take off another star for terrible support, but there aren't any stars left.Well, it seems nothing is going to clean up this drive which was rendered useless after about 20 minutes of use.  Compared to this drive, honestly, I will stick with my older Intel G2 drives which give comparable write performance (years later) and 2X the read performance, despite being SATA2.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q4Q63Y2N7SW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092D6CSK#wasThisHelpful","R3Q4Q63Y2N7SW7","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used many, many quad sets of Corsair Vengeance memory in recent builds.  This is the first set that wouldn't even POST or boot when using the XMP profile/manufacturer settings.  I suspect this is just a defective set, but it in unnerving and time-wasting to have to troubleshoot this.  I give it two stars because it is likely bad and not just poor memory which would deserve zero stars.I wasn't expecting to overclock these, but I did expect them to run a their rated speed/settings.  The best I could muster was 1600MHz CAS10.  I liked the blingy red heatsinks, but for the same performance, I went with the cheaper Corsair Vengeance 1600MHz sticks which were thirty bucks cheaper and actually run at their rated speed (like other 1600MHz and 1866MHz Corsair Vengeance quad sets that I've run).  I suspect they are identical chips, just binned slightly differently, and these shouldn't have made the cut.  And, yes, I've had these motherboards up to 2133MHz, but with other O.C. memory.Update: Before returning, I tried individual banks of 1/2 (two sticks) in different banks and in different motherboards.

"I'm not going to cover the merits of using a Sonicare electric toothbrush.  Just use them.  Plain and simple.  You will save more in dental costs than you will spend on them.  I have been using them for probably over 15 years, and they are must-haves.  Everyone in my family uses them.  I have also used every major generation of Sonicare toothbrush and several models within each.This Essence 5600 is styled like the original first generation.  Unlike the first generation which used NiCad batteries, this uses NiMH batteries which was used in the second generation.  The original first generation toothbrushes used an open sort of toothbrush head with a plate behind the brush.  This was actually a good head, although it rattled/buzzed if you made the little plastic guard/plate touch the moving brush head.  No big deal.  With these you occasionally had to unscrew the head and clean them out (with an old-style toothbrush).However, Philips/Sonicare has discontinued the original style head and gone with a ""universal"" head that fits both the first and second generation toothbrushes.  That is what you get with this model.  Unfortunately, despite the more effective and more comfortable head, these are plagued with the problem of mold, bacteria, and just general funk under the rubber seal.  The rubber seal just doesn't seal at all.  Moisture gets in the heads, and shortly, there will be massive black and pink hairy things growing inside.  Just truly disgusting which is why you see some aftermarket (non-Philips) seals being sold.  Further, it is just next to impossible to clean these second generation heads.  See my remedy at the end.The third generation (current) is truly the best.  They went with Li-Ion batteries.  The handles are smaller.  The heads no longer have a ""compartment"" in which to grow mold and bacteria.Unfortunately, with the progression of each model, Sonicare keeps adding more features which I don't like.  I find quad pacer useless and annoying.  All of the additional massage and pulsing modes and what-not are just irritating because it makes such a simple device much harder to use.  For example, instead of a simple on/off, you now have to push the button twice or cycle through these modes.  This is important because if you push a button twice to cycle it and turn it off while it is in the middle of changing modes, instead of it turning off, it turns on, and your spit and toothpaste go flying, so now you have to clean your glasses, the mirror, and pretty much everything within 3 feet.Anyway, sorry to digress, but I have UNIVERSALLY found that the best model with in each generation is the most simple one without all the feature-laden whistles and bells, ridiculous UV cleaners, etc., which just drive up your cost both initial and in consumables.So, in sum, this has good battery technology, but you will have to be careful not to leave it in the charger and make sure you run it down.  In other words, you will have to run it like a usual Ni-MH battery product to get the maximum life of maybe 3-5 years.  If you don't, then you can kill it is 1-2 years.  I like that this is a simple version and easy to operate.  It has a nice grip and travel pouch.  It it also is relatively inexpensive if you are new to Sonicare, but your next one will want to be the Li-Ion versions.  What I really don't like about this is the terrible toothbrush heads which get funky.  My best recommendation for dealing with this is as follows.  (Disclaimer: this is not recommended or supported by the manufacturer.  Use at your own risk, yada, yada.)  Get some small, sharp scissors or a box cutter or utility knife and cut off that rubber seal -- which doesn't seal anyway.  Then, after you brush your teeth just run some water down in there to rinse it out.  Without the seal, it will dry, and not get so funky.  At least 10X better, although it looks kinda MacGyver'ed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVQMLTVSCGP6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081MQ47C#wasThisHelpful","RVQMLTVSCGP6J","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big Post-it fan.  While I like the general concept of this, the dispenser kind of wrecks it.First, a minor pet peeve is that the tape roll is taped down with Magic tape.  To get that tape off which is recessed down in the dispenser is a lesson in frustrationful packaging and ultimately wastes about 8-10"" of the roll.Next, the ""cutter"" just doesn't cut clean.  It cuts ratty, or not all the way, or crooked.  Assuming you are more of a neat-freak to begin with and that is why you are organizing and labeling things in the first place, this doesn't ""cut it"".Next, there is no way to measure out equal strips.  Not a deal-breaker though.Finally, you can't write on it while it is in the dispenser through a small slot/opening -- maybe an inch and a half worth.  So, you must first ""apply"" it to something like a clean table, then remove it and place it on your item.  Because the sticky goo is just so-so, you lose stick applying and reapplying your label.On the plus side, however, it is a thin tape strip which conforms better to things like bottles, jars, canisters, etc.  Another product to consider is the full-adhesive Post-it notes (which are full adhesive and not just a strip at the top), but I found those only really work on flat things.  On any sort of curve, ultimately, the flatness of the Post-it note wins and it lifts off/falls off.This Post-it tape works better in that regard on curved surfaces and therefore warrants a 3 star rating from me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UBAKJPE9OEJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DF54OG#wasThisHelpful","R3UBAKJPE9OEJM","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an ounce-of-prevention is worth a pound-of-cure guy.  My current favorite is Crest 3D White mouthwash, so I was excited to try this new Crest Pro-Health Clinical mouthwash.I did not have any of the burning experienced by others, but this stuff is just weird.  After about 20-30 seconds, you feel blobs of gunk floating around in your mouth.  I don't know if it's itself coagulating or dissolved parts of my mouth or both, but a mouthful of white, stringy blobs is gross.  It takes quite a bit of rinsing to get all of the yuck out of my mouth.  Performance-wise, it does seem to be effective, and hence the 3 stars.I have tried other mouthwashes in the past that also dissolved my mouth, but with those, there was a slough-off later after using it -- not while using it.  The Crest Clinical is somewhat of a turn-off in a nauseating sort of way because of this.  Definitely try a very small bottle first as I was tempted to throw it out many times.  I will stay with the Crest 3D White for now.I have also recently tried the Colgate Optic White mouthwash, and while I love the Optic White toothpaste, the mouthwash (which performs well) borderlines on burning and tastes like bleach.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OUOYOUKQH3UQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JUIBMI#wasThisHelpful","R2OUOYOUKQH3UQ","A2EHYCA29NSQLU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2EHYCA29NSQLU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cable worked excellent with no issues.  It has a male SATA power connector to connect to newer power supplies.  On the other end it has a female Molex connector to connect to older drives and some internal components as well, for example, I had a brand new USB 3.0 PCIe plug-in card, but it needed power to its older-style Molex connector.What I also like about this cable is that the ends are just straight.  Many are Y-connectors or SATA connectors where the wires come out the side.  The problem when the wires come out the side is you have a 50/50 chance of them pointing the wrong direction.

"I really like Quest protein bars.  They are among the healthiest protein bars out there.  Most other bars just pretend to be healthy, but are actually loaded with fat and carbs, especially sugar.The texture of all of them are just stiff PlayDoh.  This has the advantage of no chocolate coatings, etc., to melt all over and make a mess.  In fact, these taste better when they are warmer/softer.  IMO, the taste is not great, but good enough.  Also, the flavors only somewhat resemble their names.With that said, the taste of the Peanut Butter & Jelly version is just OK.  Considering it is one of the highest calorie (210) and highest fat (10g) of the Quest bars, I don't think the variety of taste justifies it.  There are others such as Chocolate Brownie and Cinnamon Roll and Coconut Cashew or even Chocolate Peanut Butter which taste better and are more healthy.

"I really, really wanted to be able to write a glowing review for the Roomba 980, but after a month of use I just can‚Äôt bring myself to do so.  First, by way of background, I have been using the Roomba on the first floor of our house, which is roughly 800 square feet less a bathroom, and furniture the Roomba can‚Äôt fit under; it says it vacuums about 650 square feet and that feels accurate to me.  Three quarters of the floor space is hardwood with the remainder carpeted, and we have four kids and a 25 pound beagle, so regular vacuuming is definitely required.  Finally, I received this (very expensive) vacuum for free through the Amazon Vine program.Set up is a breeze, although, as other reviewers have pointed out, the Roomba‚Äôs inability to connect to a 5Ghz wireless band is a glaring oversight.  Likewise, the app is intuitive and makes scheduling cleanings, or kicking off an ad hoc cleaning, a breeze.  Also, the help function is outstanding, offering clear instructions, as well as contact and part information.As for cleaning, when the Roomba completes a job, the quality is excellent, it gets very close to baseboards and furniture, and pulls up far more dirt and debris than I would have ever thought possible.  However, that ‚Äúwhen‚Äù is the problem.  Frankly, an almost $900 vacuum should be functioning perfectly 99% of the time, yet 50% of the time I find it wedged in an opening that is just a bit too small, or backed into a corner it can‚Äôt get out of, or most infuriating, just sitting in the middle of the floor with its battery dead.  Moreover, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be learning as it goes along, it cleaned perfectly the first two days, then got stuck or ran out of battery the next three, then cleaned for two days, failed for one and on and on.Ultimately, this is a product, that if it ran seamlessly, would be of great benefit to my family, both in time savings and mitigating seasonal allergies.  But for me to recommend a $900 vacuum, it is has to be operating flawlessly essentially all of the time and in my experience, it has nowhere near that kind of up time.  It is possible, perhaps likely, that future firmware updates will improve the Roomba 980s efficiency, and if that‚Äôs the case I will update my review accordingly, but as I sit here writing this, my recommendation would be that if you really want to spend a lot of money on a top of the line vacuum cleaner, buy a Dyson.  Yes you lose the time savings, but you‚Äôll save a few hundred dollars (at least) and you won‚Äôt have to deal with the aggravation of expecting a clean floor and getting a half or quarter clean floor.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33TNQTZ0V337N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013E9L4ZS#wasThisHelpful","R33TNQTZ0V337N","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Braven 805 produces great sound in an attractive package and offers tremendous battery life and the ability to charge other devices via USB, which is a smart and genuinely useful function.  My only real complaint is that in endeavoring to make as clean an interface as possible, the designers actually made it more difficult that necessary to pair devices.  Instead of providing a dedicated Bluetooth button, you need to long press the play button and wait for a tone, which to be fair is hardly rocket science, but I nonetheless found it difficult to get my phone and other devices to pair with the Braven.  Absent and deep technical understanding of Bluetooth technology, I can‚Äôt say definitively if this is a problem with the speaker, but given that I had the problem with multiple devices, I feel confident that a dedicated Bluetooth button would have at least removed one variable from the equation.To be clear though, once I got those devices paired, the sound quality is fantastic and the battery lasts far longer than I would ever need it to (the specs say 18 hours, which I believe but didn‚Äôt independently validate).

"This is my first air purifier, so I have no basis for comparison, but I can say that it has significantly reduced my son‚Äôs seasonal allergies, even the central air conditioning is on.  Set up is barely more than plugging it in, and on the lower fan settings it is so quiet you forget that it is running.  My son has gone from waking up sneezing with itchy eyes, to a wake up routine that is more like January than August, including no more racing for his daily dose of Zyrtec.  Ultimately, that‚Äôs all the evidence I need that the AeraMax is doing its job, and doing it well.

"What is perhaps most impressive about this set is the sheer volume of stuff that you get, including 610 cards and six dice total, along with well written instructions.  I picked up this set because my 12 and 9 year olds have played Pokemon for years and have recently made a foray into Magic, and I thought this would be another fun option for them, and something that I could participate in on a level playing field.  The 12 year old and I picked up the game pretty quickly, but the learning curve was a little steeper for the 9 year old, although she eventually caught up.  Of course every kid is different, but the recommended age of 8 and up may be a little aggressive.  Overall, gameplay offers a lot of variety and moves along at a nice pace.

"I tend to be a very aggressive brusher, which can be murder on my gums, so my dentist has often recommended an electric toothbrush.  I‚Äôve tried a few and always been somewhat ambivalent about them after the initial novelty.  However, I strongly believe the Philips Sonicare 5 will be a different story.  Put simply, your mouth and teeth feel exceptionally clean after you use it; honestly, it‚Äôs akin to the slick feeling your teeth have after a trip to the dentist, and it achieves that clean while still being gentle on your gums.  As a further benefit, it holds its charge for a long time.  I haven‚Äôt put the three week battery claim to the test, but I‚Äôve used it for a week without bothering to plug it in with no ill effects.  Finally, because there are three speed settings, you can customize your brushing for what is most comfortable for you, rather than the one size fits all approach of most electronic toothbrushes.All in all a great product, I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUP1N0Z51A6N0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR86BY#wasThisHelpful","RUP1N0Z51A6N0","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"‚ÄúTin Men‚Äù is based on a fairly intriguing premise, namely that the U.S. military creates robot drones controlled by soldier who upload their consciousness into the machines for the duration of their patrol.  This allows the U.S. to conduct bloodless (for them anyway) interdictions across the globe with the only risk being the relatively nominal expense of the occasional destroyed drone.  However, when someone figures out how to trap the operators in the drones, the equation changes in an eyeblink.This is territory that has been mined before, no least by Joe Haldeman in ‚ÄúForever Peace‚Äù, however, the separation of mind and body in a definitive way is a new and interesting wrinkle.  Unfortunately, author Christopher Golden never convinced me that the operators were experiencing the profound existential dread that would come from having your consciousness cut off from your physical body.  Moreover, they both recognize the situation and accept it far more quickly than seems reasonable.  As such, I found myself far more interested in the (significant) action involving flesh and blood humans.  There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this, but it is clearly not intended to be the core focus of the book.  Moreover, since the hook here is a really cool an innovative technology, one would think the author would really spend some time fleshing out what the drones look like, how they are armed, what their specs are, etc., but overall I found their description rather cursory, and as such I never felt all that invested in the concept.Golden does deserve credit for tackling some serious question about the scope and price of America‚Äôs global footprint, which is often glossed over with the unabashed jingoism that makes most military fiction unreadable in my opinion.  Moreover, he comes up with a genuinely unique hook on a subject that is at the front and center of America‚Äôs current military policy.  However, at the end of the day, the story just wasn‚Äôt developed enough to truly draw me in.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJHPOZZFIXNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=034554885X#wasThisHelpful","R3AJHPOZZFIXNF","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent filet knife for two reasons.  First is sharpness.  Filet knives are used for making (often) long precise cuts and if the blade isn‚Äôt sharp and/or doesn‚Äôt hold an edge at best you will end up with a ragged cut and at worst you‚Äôll slice the palm of your hand wide open.  With this KitchenAid knife that hasn‚Äôt been a concern as it has thus far shown a razor sharp and durable edge.  I‚Äôve been able to slice up chicken cutlets both cleanly and quickly.  Second is flexibility.  This knife has a high degree of flexibility which allows an easier grip and a flatter cut, creating filets with even thickness which is critical for even cooking.All in all this a high quality, and good looking knife I expect to use for years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RT5FRI2RPQOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFEDEUA#wasThisHelpful","R3RT5FRI2RPQOH","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This toy is a great and in my experience unique, combination of building and action toys.  Essentially it is a Nerf dart gun, but by including K‚ÄôNex kids can change the look and feel of the toy at their whim.  Moreover, they are fairly complicated modifications; this isn‚Äôt a cheap toy where you can move four pieces and get a different look.  It takes thought and planning to put together the multi-step, multi-piece designs,  Also, somewhat surprisingly, the K‚ÄôNex portion of the toy holds up surprisingly well.  I was concerned that it would fall to pieces at the slightest tap, but it actually holds up pretty well during rough and tumble play.  My only complaint is that while the box clearly advertises four different configurations, there are only instructions for one build included.

"Brother Printer MFCJ6925DW Wireless Color Printer with Scanner, Copier and FaxThe Brother MFCJ6925DW is very much at the high end of personal printers, and is frankly more than adequate for a small business setting.  So while I highly recommend it for what it is, if you only need to print your Christmas card labels and taxes once a year and the occasional coupon, this is way more printer than you need.However, if you find yourself doing a lot of scanning, faxing or are a heavy printer, this is a great machine.  Generally speaking I find setting up a new printer aggravating because there are so many moving plastic parts, and there was no exception in this case, but that‚Äôs really to be expected.  Wireless set-up was a snap and I was able to get the drivers on my machines with no issues.  Printing is fast and of excellent quality.  One of the selling points of this model is it‚Äôs use of high efficiency inks, and while I haven‚Äôt had the printer long enough to put that claim fully to the test, I have printed ~75 color PowerPoint slides with no signs of fading or inconsistent color.To my mind the best feature on this printer that you won‚Äôt find on many smaller models is the top load feeder.  If you are dealing with legal or financial documents, either scanning or printing, the ability to drop them in the feeder and let the machine cycle through them is vastly easier than scanning one page at a time.In summation, this is at the very top of the personal market, and would work just fine in a small business setting, but you definitely get what you pay for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Y4CM34YD7IS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUU7KNY#wasThisHelpful","R22Y4CM34YD7IS","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were already using a memory foam mattress (Tempurpedic), so I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would notice any difference with the Serta Killner, but I have to say that thus far I have been quite pleased with it.  For starters, while all (as far as I can tell) memory foam products have a chemical odor out of the box, the Killner‚Äôs was relatively mild and dissipated more quickly than I have experienced with other mattresses.As for comfort, there are three key elements that I have appreciated.  First is the cool action memory foam; while our old mattress had a similar feature, it wasn‚Äôt anywhere near as efficient.  I hate waking up hot, but with this mattress I consistently feel comfortably cool; I would like the feeling (in regards to temperature) to old pre pillow-top mattresses.  In short you don‚Äôt wake up feeling like you are in a sauna.Secondly, the way the foam is engineered (and I don‚Äôt claim to understand the technical details) the edges hold up much better than our old mattress.  With other memory foam mattresses, I have found that the bed effectively collapses under you if you sit too close the edge or move towards it over the course of the night.  With this mattress I can lean against or sit on the edge of the bed and it holds up quite well.Finally, this mattress gets the mix of soft and firm just right.  The reason all memory foam mattresses work (in theory) is that they conform to your body, thus reducing or eliminating pressure points.  That‚Äôs in theory, however, and often they can get the balance wrong and you end up feeling like you are falling through the floor or lying on a slab.  For my taste the Killner offers the right balance between give in support.In short, this is an excellent mattress at a very competitive price point.  I highly endorse it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKW616IHUIGTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO0TBCM#wasThisHelpful","RKW616IHUIGTW","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not the target demographic for these headphones; they cost more than my stereo receiver and I never would have even considered buying them.  That said, my demo may have shifted because these sound so good I‚Äôm not sure I could ever go back to plain old earbuds.  The sounds these headphones produce is rich and hits low bass and high treble without being loud.  They are extremely comfortable and fit snugly over the ears without feeling tight, although I will say that given they are padded and fit around the ear, they do start to make me feel hot after a while, but they are effectively earmuffs so that is hardly surprising.The headphones work in two modes powered (requires a single battery) and unpowered.  The unpowered mode produces excellent sound, but in my layman‚Äôs terms seems somewhat less crisp.  The powered mode produces a much richer sound and also actively dampens ambient noise.  I decided to stress test this mode by wearing them while I mowed the lawn with a gas powered more.  I‚Äôm not going to say that I couldn‚Äôt hear the mower, but it was dampened enough that I could hear the music I was listening to, something I could never accomplish with earbuds without completely blowing out my eardrums.  I would imagine that the effect on an airplane would be comparable, and probably filter the bulk of the cabin noise.There‚Äôs no denying that these are high end headphones, and I can‚Äôt say that they are for everyone.

I have a tough time reviewing YA books as the writing is by definition, juvenile, but the plot was robust enough to carry the story, and the writing was good in an age appropriate way.In this book, the main character, Michael Malone, discovers he has the power to alter reality after saving a dog from jumping off a cliff. He then is recruited by a top-secret organization called UNICORNE. I enjoyed meeting Michael, his classmate Freya, his mom, and his sister.  My favorite part of the book was when Michael accidently makes one of the UNICORNE agents into his au pair (and then his doctor, and then his French teacher) by altering reality.

"First off, I have to say that this thing is absolutely whisper quiet, the only way I could tell it was actually working was by putting my hand behind it.  I think this is important because the XBox 360 used to be so loud when the fan got going and the XBox One has been a huge improvement in that regard; I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want to add a peripheral that created a bunch of noise.  That aside, I think this does a nice job of circulating air, and for the price I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad investment, but with a little tweaking it could have been much better.First off, I don‚Äôt understand why the fan doesn‚Äôt vent forward.  It‚Äôs hard for me to envision a scenario where someone would have their device with more space behind than in front.  Mine is in a cabinet, so having it blow forward would have been great.  There is certainly value in having the air circulate within the space, but a forward vent would have, at least in my opinion, provided much more cooling for the buck.  Second, there is a temperature display which shows the ambient temperature and the temperature of the exhaust air.  This is kind of cool, I guess, but out of context it doesn‚Äôt really tell me anything.  I think we all know that cooler is better, but I certainly don‚Äôt know what the safe operating temperature for an XBox is; it would have been nice if the numbers were green, yellow, red (or even green/red) so that the user would know if their machine was really straining.Again, for the price I think this isn‚Äôt a bad investment, particularly if you have your machine in a tight space.

"This was a very comfortable mattress, and it carries price point that is practically unbeatable, but before I get to the heart of the review, a few notes about set-up for the sake of full disclosure.  First, as many others have alluded to, this mattress comes packed up at roughly a third of its full size and takes a while to spring back to its final shape.  I opened it up on a Tuesday and didn‚Äôt have time to deal with it until Saturday, and it was plenty ready to go; I‚Äôm reasonably certain it would have been fine on Thursday, but I cannot say for certain.  Second, I used this mattress on top of the foundation for our existing memory foam mattress; these are rigid and framed in steel and are not akin to a traditional boxspring.That out of the way, both my wife and I found this to be a very comfortable mattress.  Being a hybrid it definitely had a little more give and transferred a little more motion than our TempurPedic mattress, but neither was an issue.  The cool layer worked as advertised, and is, to my mind, and absolute must for any mattress that involves memory foam.  The product is so dense, and you move around so little (because you aren‚Äôt getting sore from pressure points) mattresses without some sort of heat wicking quickly become uncomfortably warm, even in cold climates.  As a matter of personal taste, my wife and I prefer a slightly firmer mattress, so we went back to our old one, but that is in no way an indictment of this mattress.  We moved it to our guest room and have already had two very satisfied visitors, and I expect many more in the future.Finally, for the quality, this mattress is almost absurdly inexpensive.  At ~$400 there is nothing on the market that I am aware of that comes anywhere close to the same value.  If you told me this was twice as expensive, I wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye, and I would still consider it on the cheaper end of mattresses.

"I‚Äôve been using a Foreman Grill of one type or another for probably 15 years now, but this one is by far my favorite.  The problem with old grills was that they excelled at grilling meat, at one temperature, and they were a pain to clean up because the plates were fixed.  With this device the temperature settings are variable, waffle plates have been added so that it‚Äôs not quite such a uni-tasker and the plates are removable, which makes clean-up so much easier.  All the while, the fundamental concept of these devices, that they let fat cook off and slide away, is preserved.  For instance, cook bacon on this and you get flat crispy strips, that, while certainly not healthy, aren‚Äôt swimming in their own fat either.  It‚Äôs also great for families as you can whip up grilled cheese and the like much faster than in a frying pan.Overall this a great kitchen gadget that is versatile enough to fulfill a number of tasks in an efficient, easy to clean package.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30788H3BBLQUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPYK18O#wasThisHelpful","R30788H3BBLQUL","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The level of detail is amazing and the quality is beyond compare.

"There are many things I like about this bag, magnetic clips, and abundance of pockets and strong security, but I think what I like best is that it keeps your laptop right up against your back.  The benefit of this is twofold as adds another layer of security for your machine, but it also makes ergonomic sense as it doesn't pull the bag away from your body as much as some other packs do.  Beyond that, this bag shines in the way it keeps your devices secure, the top flap pulls way down the front of the bag and is secured by magnetic clips that seem gimmicky at first, but that actually work great and won't wear out or snap the way plastic clips can.  Likewise, there are tons of pockets for your other devices (I would be comfortable carrying an SLR camera in the main pouch) and plenty of room for documents, etc.Aesthetically, the bag has a great look, although it might benefit from some additional color choices (the gray is a little bland).

"The remote itself is a nice universal remote with all of the wonderful form factor you'd expect from Logitech.  However, the core of what is being marketed here is the ability to use your smart phone as a remote, and while that sounds good in theory, in practice it doesn't really work.  The reason for this that I, like most people (I think), use my smart phone simultaneous to watching TV, so I don't really want to use battery life, or stop what I am doing to change the channel.  So while the app is pretty easy to use and set-up, I'm definitely not knocking the interface, but using it ends up being intrusive.  If you are absolutely certain you want to use your phone as a remote, I suppose you'll be satisfied, but I think most people will quickly sour on the experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20KE3WC22R69B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ5RYI4#wasThisHelpful","R20KE3WC22R69B","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm hardly an expert in wireless connectivity, but I have used a few different types and I can endorse this as a solid, easy to use device.  Set-up was fairly standard and it should be mentioned that the form factor is nice as I don't feel compelled to bury the router somewhere out of sight.  I can't say that I have observed significant increases in speed (although I was pretty happy with what I already had, I expect people upgrading from older devices may feel differently), but I am definitely getting improved range.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35JJNL5OLZX5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CL58K0Y#wasThisHelpful","R35JJNL5OLZX5E","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really, really want to be able to give this remote five starts, because it does some things really well, but a few critical, frankly glaring, gaps in it's capabilities prevent me from doing so.  That said, first, the good.As with all Logitech devices, the form factor is top notch.  The remote feels great in your hands and everything is place logically (I will concede the Fast Forward/Play/etc. buttons would be a little more comfortable below the screen, but I adapted without much trouble).  The centerpiece of the remote, is of course the screen, which is crystal clear and features haptic feedback.  There are three primary functions for the screen, which are accessed by sliding between difference ""Trays"" for lack of a better phrase:1. Turn on devices based upon a profile (i.e. turn on TV, Receiver and Cable Box and Set TV to HDMI1)2. Favorites, this is where icons for your designated favorite TV stations (up to 50) can be found3. A touch enabled field which can used to swipe to perform an activity (i.e. swipe right for channel up)You can also access more specific controls via a series of menus, for instance if you want to change the HDMI input, or, unfortunately, access a keypad.That's where the remote starts to fall down, it has this beautiful touchscreen, but that screen offers me less functionality than my old Harmony One.  First off, the lack of an easily accessible number pad is inexcusable.  No matter how visually appealing the favorites tab is, I won't always want to scroll through 50 icons (or access the guide) to change the channel, and getting to the number pad is a pain in the neck.  Job number one for Logitech should be to provide a firmware update that makes the number pad an additional tray like the one's detailed above ASAP.Second, I sometimes want to have two activities active at the same time, for example, have my Xbox and cable active at the same time so that I can toggle between the two.  The Harmony one supported this by allowing me to manually add buttons to the screen so that I could quickly switch between HDMI1 and HDMI3, now I have to tediously open up the menu, select the device, scroll to find the desired action, select it, and then navigate back to the home screen.  It is baffling that with a much more powerful device, featuring a bigger and more capable screen, Logitech has seen fit to offer less capability than found in the Harmony One.  Again, this should be fixable with a firmware update, but only time will tell if Logitech pursues this course.Finally, the lack of a hard ""Skip"" button is a pain; it has been replaced by a long press on the rewind/fast-forward button, which, if you aren't paying attention, will inevitably lead to unwanted actions.  Considering that most cable boxes will register the backward skip as a 5-15 second rewind, a function that I personally use constantly, I am befuddled by this decision.  There's no fixing this problem, and I would live with it if everything else worked perfectly, but right now it feels like the straw that broke the camel's back.There is so much potential with this remote, and frankly, it just looks so cool, I want to give it five stars.  However, there are so many critical gaps in functionality, there is no way I could recommend anyone spend $300+ on it when you can pick up a Harmony One cheaply that will provide better functionality in a slightly less appealing form.  If and when Logitech pushes any updates I will append my review, but for now I can only say that this is a very cool but fundamentally flawed device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E1Y4O4R6184Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ5RY1G#wasThisHelpful","R2E1Y4O4R6184Z","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At face value, this is a bike mount for Android smart phones.  It is durable, easy to install and closes securely.  I would definitely have no concerns about my phone being in this mount while biking.Except that it doesn't accommodate my phones (Galaxy GS3) when it is in its case, which means that in order to use this mount, I have to remove the case, which is a pain, but also risks me dropping the phone in the worst possible environment (garage, road, hard packed bike trail) with no protection.  Considering everyone with even a lick of common sense protects the $500 devices they carry in their pockets with some sort of case, that lack of space to accommodate a phone in case seems like a glaringly obvious oversight.Ultimately, I won't be using this mount because I don't want to deal with the hassle, and risk, of removing the case, even though the design is highly functional and easy to use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L465AKB8OVI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BYNAT7G#wasThisHelpful","R1L465AKB8OVI6","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The unibody soft/hard case is unique in my experience and insomuch as I can assess is more than durable enough for use in areas with high potential for damage like construction sites, warehouses or just hiking.  However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the lock and volume buttons are far too stiff and really make normal office/home use of the phone a bit of a pain.

"I've used Jabra corded earbuds for the last six months or so, so I was really excited to use the Bluetooth version, and they did not disappoint.  First off, if you have used Jabra earbuds before, these fit pretty much exactly the same, which is to say, they are exercise comfortable, by which I mean they stay firmly in place and aren't uncomfortable, but I wouldn't want to wear them for working at my desk or other non-pysical activities.  My biggest complaint is that you can't skip tracks using the device, you have to manually go to the device you are hooked up to.  I should also note that while I don't doubt the complaints about cutting in and out, I wear my phone in an armband when I run and haven't experienced this phenomenon, so proximity may play a role (although there is no excuse for a  Bluetooth device to be limited to such a short distance).

"Internet radios this size (I would call them countertop units) seem to have all converged on similar style for the time being.  An offset full color display, tuning knob and buttons, relatively painless wireless set-up and a remote of some sort.

"This is a pretty cool little device to either replace or upgrade the stock sound card in your laptop.  Installation is a snap, just plug it in and follow the instructions, and I was genuinely surprised at the improvement in sound quality.  I'm not a huge audiophile, so if you are looking for technical specs, there are much better reviews available, but I will say that the improvement is more than slight; there is a marked, real upgrade.  The only downside to this device is that it is a little awkward hanging off the side of your laptop.  If you move your machine around a lot, there is always the risk of banging it into something, and potentially damaging it and/or the USB drive it is plugged into.  Accordingly, the people who are going to use this device to the fullest are those who keep their machine in more or less the same location all the time.

"On the balance, I really enjoyed ""Demi-Monde: Winter"", the idea of populating a military simulation with some of history's worst sociopaths, and giving them free reign to wreak havoc after their own fashion, is simultaneously original, interesting and not wildly far-fetched.  Moreoever, the central conceit, that real humans can become trapped within the simulation is plenty believable to allow for the suspension of disbelief.  However, where there is potential for this proposed four book series to fall down, is the plot device that will drive future books.  I don't want to provide any spoilers, but in essence, this device shifts from the sci-fi basis of the novel and moves it closer to a sort of fantastical mysticism.  Now, to be fair, it may be that in future books this element will be re-grounded in the hard foundational hard sci-fi of the book, or it may feel more organic, and less grafted on as the series progresses.  However, with only one book to form an opinion on, I can definitely see this dichotomy becoming a problem in future installments.That said, for now I am willing to take things as they come.  The book is clearly meticulously researched, with historical figures acting in a believable fashion, without being carbon copies of their real world counterparts.  This is no minor accomplishment, as the author has taken a host of real life personalities and forced them to interact in entirely unexpected ways.  Moreover, the fictional characters are well drawn and blend surprisingly well with the electronic doppelgangers.Overall, this was a nice first start to a very original series.  Time will tell if its central premise proves compelling in the end, but for now ""The Demi-Monde"" represents and excellent first step on what promises to be an interesting journey.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IRLSGIH1RKCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062070347#wasThisHelpful","R3IRLSGIH1RKCC","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This little oven is a remarkably versatile piece of kitchen equipment, that I probably would have never thought I needed, but now find myself using more and more every day.  It is a very effective toaster, with different settings for toast and bagels, and a six slice capacity which is appreciated in my household of six, but as I said in the title to this review, on the balance it is really an oven that toasts rather than the other way around.  With dedicated settings for baking, broiling and pizza, it offers a great alternative to heating up the entire oven for small food items.  To me, the perfect example is chicken tenders; normally if I wanted a few to throw on a salad, I would have had to heat the entire oven, which is incredibly wasteful given then small size of the item being cooked.  However, with this unit, I can heat up a much smaller volume, saving energy and wear and tear on my oven.I will concede that the settings are not immediately intuitive, and a little work on the interface wouldn't be a terrible idea (too many combinations of button/knob, or rather a lack of flow in how they are laid out).  That said, once you have them down after the first few uses you won't give it another thought.  My only real concern is that the unit is not very well insulated, so if you use it to bake/broil for an extended period of time the outside gets very hot.  I don't think it's a real fire risk (it's not THAT hot), but I think there is a potential for a minor burn, particularly for a child who might not know better than to avoid the sides.That said, with a measure of prudence that frankly should be applied to any kitchen appliance, this is a tremendously useful and versatile addition to any kitchen.Jake Mohlman","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGPO5XIR0NY51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005O377UO#wasThisHelpful","RGPO5XIR0NY51","APRU373UYVK2Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APRU373UYVK2Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My husband wanted a close-up mirror he could use when shaving, and we were glad when we found this one.The mirror is good quality. He uses the ""normal"" mirror most of the time, but the magnifying side is also sharp and clear. The hardware is sturdy. The mirror extends and swivels easily. This is not a lightweight mirror or mounting. In fact, you need to be sure to mount it on a stud or anchor it well so it doesn't pull out of the wall.The brushed nickel finish looks really good with our other brushed nickel hardware (faucets, towel racks, etc.).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OYW5NHQIEUGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LKSZMW2#wasThisHelpful","R3OYW5NHQIEUGU","A24B990VP9QC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24B990VP9QC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We loved these fixtures when we saw them at a local lighting store. Unfortunately, they didn't  have any in stock. Amazon to the rescue! We bought two of these 3-light fixtures and one 4-light fixture in the same style, all in brushed nickel. All three arrived quickly in excellent condition and they look great in the bathroom.We put LED bulbs in all three fixtures. Keep in mind when choosing bulbs that the bulbs will be visible, at least partially, so choose bulbs that look nice with the fixtures. We chose some super-cheap LED bulbs at Lowe's ($2 each) that are perfect. Lots of light, and they look good, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13BWHUH52C0WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017HHSGY#wasThisHelpful","R13BWHUH52C0WG","A24B990VP9QC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24B990VP9QC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We recently remodeled our master bath. My husband has a bad back and wanted a grab bar in the shower, but I didn't want one of those ugly things that look like they belong in an institutional setting. This was a great solution.We bought Delta Lahara faucets, and bought the matching towel racks, toilet paper holder and this grab bar. The grab bar matches everything beautifully, without losing any functionality. This bar is heavy and sturdy.The only downside is that it is pricier than other options, but considering what we paid for the rest of the bathroom, a few dollars extra for a grab bar that looked nice didn't seem like a big deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH3ZSBQEEMO8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5QMATY#wasThisHelpful","RH3ZSBQEEMO8T","A24B990VP9QC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24B990VP9QC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The only ProActiv product I like and use is their refining mask. This is similar, but much better. After using it just once, my skin felt smoother. I had a few breakouts and the mask reduced the redness and appearance of them.The mask has a slightly gritty texture and the feel of a fine clay mask. There is a sandalwood scent that is light and pleasant.The directions on the package are confusing and contradictory. In one place it says the mask can be used 2 - 3 times a week. Immediately below that, it says to start with one application daily, then gradually increase to two times daily if needed.

"There are lots of buzzwords on the label: wholesome, organic, gluten-free (Huh? Is there syrup WITH gluten?), low glycemic, Non-GMO, etc. But the bottom line is that this is still sugar and should be consumed in moderation.Fortunately, a little of this syrup goes a long way. Do not expect it to taste like coconut. It is made from the coconut tree flower, not coconut meat.They say that it can be used as a 1:1 substitute for sugar, but you may find you can use less of this syrup than you would sugar. It is sweet, but it has a more complex flavor than plain ol' sugar. There are definitely tones of brown sugar/caramel here.

"I have a hard time finding purses I like. This one is great! I have used it for about a year now and, although it isn't used every day, it has held up well during that year and still looks brand new. So, what makes this purse great?First of all, it looks nice. It is not real leather (of course) but it is attractive. The top closes with a zipper, which is more secure than the ones that only have a snap or no fastener at all. The stitching is tight and neat, and the handle is attached securely.There is an exterior zippered pocket that is perfect for holding my cell phone. There are also interior pockets for holding items you want to get to quickly.The bag is perfectly sized for carrying a tablet (such as my iPad) and/or a paper notebook or book. The bag is roomy and holds a lot, but doesn't feel or look bulky.And then there is the price. I hate paying a lot of money for purses, and this one is a great value.The next time I need a purse, I will skip shopping all over and settling for something that is sort-of what I want.

"Running the air conditioner in the Texas heat gets expensive. I wanted a fan that could help cool the family room (where we spend most of our non-sleeping time) without running the A/C constantly. My neighbors have a Lasko fan that is very similar to this one, and I was impressed by how well it worked.First of all, kudos to Amazon for super-fast delivery. I am a Prime member, but got it in one day, not two.The fan was packed securely, but easy remove from the box. All of the parts arrived in perfect condition. The assembly instructions were simple and I was able to attach the base in just a few minutes, working by myself. (HINT: Put the top of the fan on the floor, using the styrofoam ring from the package to hold it steady.) The base is steady on carpet as well as hard flooring surfaces.There are three speeds and even the lowest speed cranks out a stream of cool air. Although a fan does not actually cool the air, this one provides enough air movement that you feel a nice cooling breeze. (Crank it up and it feels a little windy!) I always run it in the oscillation mode to really move the air around the room.Ionizers seem like a gimmick to me, so I don't care one way or the other that this fan has one. If the blue light bothers you, turn off the ionizer. It shouldn't really make any difference.The one negative is that you need a clear line between the remote and the fan to use the remote. No waving the remote in the general direction of the fan while clicking a button, you need to aim carefully. Of course, you can also use the timer to let the fan turn itself off automatically.This fan is an excellent value. I plan to buy at least one more for my upstairs office.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWMRSWWVOJBY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RL3UJA#wasThisHelpful","RWMRSWWVOJBY7","A24B990VP9QC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24B990VP9QC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, the basics: The planner includes monthly and weekly pages for July, 2015 - July, 2016. Each month gets a two-page spread with the entire month, followed by a two-page spread for each week. There are tabs dividing the monthly sections, so it is easy to find the date you want. There is ample room for notes. The three-year reference calendar in the front of the planner contains calendars for 2015 - 2017 all on one page. The back of the book includes pages for notes and contacts, a list of holidays and a map of the US and Canada showing area codes and time zones. The area codes are a bit small to read easily, but the time zone reference is handy. There is also a plastic pocket bound in to the back of the book, giving a place to put receipts or other small pieces of paper.This is a useful planner, but what about aesthetics? The cover is described as ""faux leather,"" and it is more faux than leather. However, it is very soft and smooth and has a nice feel. The wire binding is orange, and there are pops of orange in the design. It is simple and attractive.The size makes this a bit large for most purses, but it fits well in a portfolio or laptop case.With the wire binding, you can open it to lay flat, or even fold it ""backwards"" so that the current week is on the outside of the planner and immediately accessible.This is a functional planner that looks very nice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7R8QCR0YU797/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCC4WUA#wasThisHelpful","R7R8QCR0YU797","A24B990VP9QC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24B990VP9QC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I often end up plugging devices in all over the place, wherever I can find an open outlet. This (mostly) solves that problem.The stand will hold three items, so I can charge my iPod, iPad and iPhone all at once. My Kindle Fire (1st gen) doesn't fit in the slots, but I can charge it along with two other items by placing it next to the stand.Although I have not yet traveled with this charger, I see it being very handy in hotel rooms, where they seem to think we do not need access to electrical outlets. Finding one is usually manageable, but I am always worried that I will leave a device behind when I have the laptop plugged in one place, the iPad charging another, my phone in the bathroom, etc.It would be nice if the slots to hold the devices were a bit larger, but that would also make the charger bigger. The blue light would be annoying in a dark room, so I will have to cover it somehow when using it in a hotel room.Overall, this is easy to use and does what it is supposed to do.

"If you like to be awakened gently, and not jolted awake by a blaring alarm, this clock radio is a good choice.The first thing you notice is that it doesn't look like other clock radios. The round face is lighted. The light comes on 30 minutes before the alarm time, and gradually gets brighter. It can also be turned on at any time for use as a bedside light. While not bright enough to read by, it is certainly bright enough to use while settling in at night or if you need to get up during the night. The touch controls on the face make it easy to turn the light on and off.In addition to the light, there are three choices of alarm sounds. Two are nature sounds (e.g., birds chirping) and the third is FM radio. There is a snooze feature. Tap the top of the device and the alarm stops for nine minutes.One negative is that there is no battery backup. When the power goes out, you have to reset the clock. However, I found that it didn't lose my alarm setting.It is easy to set the time, and the controls allow you to set the time ahead or back (nice for turning the clock back when daylight saving time ends).The brightness of the display is adjustable, so you can make it as bright or as dim as you wish. If you need a better view of the controls (e.g., to turn on the light or turn off the alarm) just touch the front and the controls illuminate.I have been using this for the last few weeks, and find it a pleasant way to wake up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16BROH9IPC5SI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFNMYN8#wasThisHelpful","R16BROH9IPC5SI","A24B990VP9QC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24B990VP9QC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE 7/4/15: I wore three pairs of these shoes while pressure washing the driveway and sidewalks. They were FILTHY with dirt and mud. Threw them in the washer, let them air dry, and they are as good as new! I love these shoes!-------After buying several pairs of the Skyscape lace-up shoes, I bought a pair of slip-ons to wear on a flight. Love them! They are perfect for travel as they are comfortable to walk in, and they slip off and back on easily.The Skyscape shoes are some of the most comfortable I have ever owned. Although I do not have the shoe obsession that many of my gender possess, I own six pairs of Skyscape shoes (four lace-up and two slip-on). I wear them all the time.What you might want to know about fit: I usually wear a 7 Wide. In the lace-up versions of these shoes, I bought a 7-1/2 M because W is not available and I hoped that going up a half size would give enough room for my wide feet. They fit great. Many people say the slip-ons run large, so I bought 7M. They fit well when wearing thin socks or no socks, but they are a little snug when wearing thicker crew socks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QLE536GZY9YE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LH82Z70#wasThisHelpful","R2QLE536GZY9YE","A24B990VP9QC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24B990VP9QC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We usually use St. Ives facial scrub, but decided to give this a try. Very glad we did.Although it doesn't feel as gritty as St. Ives, it does exfoliate well with its wee scrubbing bits. The cleanser is soothing, with a gel consistency and a light citrus scent. Olay describes the scent as citrus-mint. I didn't really notice a mint scent, but there is a mild (pleasant, not burning) tingle when using this scrub.

"Scotland is one of the places I want to see soon, so this book got my attention. It is an excellent reference for planning a trip to Scotland.There are four sections:  Plan Your Trip: an overview of when and where to go  On the Road: specifics of where to stay, where to eat and what to see, organized by region  Understand: history and culture of Scotland  Survival Guide: practical information, including a directory, glossary and indexThe guide includes lots of maps, including a pull-out folding city map of Edinburgh. There are suggested itineraries for trips from five days to two weeks.I started by reading section one, to get the big picture of what there is to see and do.

"This is a great idea, but it doesn't work as well as I'd hoped. When I used it to take my husband's temperature, the readings were reasonably consistent (within .1 degree or so) but my readings were off by .5 degrees or more.It is easy to use. Just turn on the power, then press the thermometer button. There is a screen that shows when you are at the correct distance from the person's forehead, and the reading is taken. It is up to you to position the thermometer properly--an illustration on the device shows where to aim the light to get an accurate reading.I think that with practice it is possible to get more consistent readings; however, this is one of those things that you need to be able to trust. Having to get the technique exactly right in order to get an accurate reading is a problem.

"I am a sucker for office supplies. I love pens, notebooks and cool fasteners. Index cards are right up near the top of my list of favorite things. (Okay, that's a little weird.

The note cards come in an acrylic tray, making it easy to keep them nearby on the desktop.The cards themselves are not very heavy--more paper than cardstock, but they have a nice feel to them. The cards are printed with a small grid pattern, so you can use them for sketches as well as lists and notes. They have a space for the date at the top right, and the days of the week printed in the top left corner. A metallic copper edge on the cards give them an attractive look when they are stacked in the tray.This is a new product and I have not seen refills with only the cards, however, they may become available at some point.

"There is a cool factor with this grater. The color and style make it an attractive addition to the kitchen.So does it work? I used it to grate cheese and loved how easy it was to use. The cheese was finely grated and the ratchet made quick work of grating a block of hard cheddar.The only problem came when it was time to clean the grater. It comes apart and can be put in the dishwasher; however, taking it apart is tricky. There are two buttons (one on each side) that have to be pressed while pulling the ratchet mechanism out. I found it difficult to press both buttons with enough force while also pulling out the mechanism. There is a similar release on the compartment where you put the food to be grated, but that was easier to work.Once disassembled, the grater is easily cleaned on the top rack of the dishwasher.For quickly grating a bit of cheese, you can use your old-fashioned cheese grater. When you have a lot of grating to do, or you want to impress your guests, reach for this grater instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXKB1E3CHCIIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEOHQV0#wasThisHelpful","RXKB1E3CHCIIT","A24B990VP9QC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24B990VP9QC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a relatively short book, but there is a lot of ""filler."" I learned much more than I wanted to about people and events that had little or nothing to do with the theme of the book.For me, one bright spot is the telling of the author's participation in a two-day wirewalking class with Philippe Petit, who walked between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. The description of Petit's instruction and Fusselman's experience in the class made me wish I could take such a class from him, even though I have a fear of heights. Because such an opportunity is highly unlikely, I will settle for being inspired by watching and listening to him on film and video. That is something I probably would not have done had I not read this book, so I thank Amy Fusselman for awakening the interest in me.Other parts of the book were less interesting to me.

"I have a Microplane Zester/Grater that works very well, so let's compare the OXO to that one.The OXO grates to a fine zest, but the Microplane zest comes out a bit finer. I don't see this is a pro or con for either one. Both do a very good job.There are a couple of things I prefer about the OXO. It is easier to clean than the Microplane because the grating surface is not curved. Both clean pretty easily, though, so this is not a major point.The way the Microplane is made, you have to hold it in your hand to zest or grate. The OXO has an angled handle and the end is flat, so you can place it on a cutting board or counter and grate without holding it in your hand. It makes grating and zesting a little easier. (Of course, you can hold it to zest if you wish.)One feature that many will like is the the OXO costs a few dollars less than the Microplane.Both graters work well, and I will continue to use both. If you are looking for a zester, consider the OXO.

"I love the recipes in the previous Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day books, and this is a great addition for those who need to get gluten out of their diets.The concept works as advertised: You stir up some ingredients, let them stand for a bit, then bake a loaf of bread or put the dough in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. By preparing the dough ahead, you always have some ready to go, so you can make bread with just a few minutes of work. (The five minutes doesn't include standing time or baking time, just the time you work with the dough.)This book works much the same as the others in the series. The difference is in the ingredients. There is one extra step here, where you mix up the flours that go into the master recipe. The basic all-purpose flour is a combination of:white rice flour (or brown rice flour)sorghum (or oat flour or amaranth flour)tapioca flour or starch (or arrowroot starch or cornstarch)potato starchxanthan gum (or ground psyllium husk)The options are given in case you have difficulty locating a particular ingredient, or just prefer one over another. Most of the ingredients should be familiar to anyone trying to cook gluten-free.There is also a whole-grain version of the flour mixture, and some recipes call for the addition of other flours, such as coconut flour.If you love bread, but are trying to avoid gluten, you will love this book. The recipes include many familiar, traditional breads, as well as flatbreads, pizza and pastries (even cinnamon rolls!). There are beautiful color photos for many of the recipes, and the directions are simple and clear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KN2Z4J7KJLHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250018315#wasThisHelpful","R3KN2Z4J7KJLHE","A24B990VP9QC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24B990VP9QC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our two kitties always have two bowls of dry food available. Currently, their favorite is Nutrience Natural Healthy Adult Cat Food, 18-Pounds, Turkey, Chicken and Herring. They were happy to try the Pride food when I put it out, and the first bowl disappeared quickly.After a couple of weeks, they have decided that they prefer the Nutrience food over this Pride food. They still eat both, but this one clearly has come in second. I think if I only put out the Pride food they would happily eat it, they just like the other a bit better.The food seems to be tasty (I am relying on the cats here, as I have not tasted it.) and made of quality ingredients. So would I buy another bag? Maybe. As I mentioned, they always have two foods available, so I would consider this as a second flavor to keep on hand. One strike against it is the price. It is more expensive than many other foods that they like as well as this one. However, one thing to keep in mind if you are considering this as the primary food for your cat(s) is that they typically need to eat less of the quality foods than the ""low-cost"" foods. This can bring the prices closer together, so it is worth comparing the cost per serving. Even considering that, the Nutrience (also a quality food) that they prefer is much less expensive than this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15IO4BHO9PBZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOFKSD2#wasThisHelpful","R15IO4BHO9PBZN","A24B990VP9QC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24B990VP9QC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With a new food he usually eats it well once or twice, then never eats it again. I could not get him to eat this food at all.

"EDITED TO ADD: There have been questions about this, so here goes: These treats are made at a plant in Colorado. The package does not say that they are made in the USA, but the company has confirmed that to me. They say the packaging will be changed to note that they are made in the USA. We now return you to our regular programming. ;o)---My 11-year-old miniature poodle can be fussy about what he eats. We had not found a dental chew that he would eat consistently until these. Most just become dog toys, and he plays with them from time to time but never actually eats them.The first time I gave Nigel one of these treats he took it into the other room and left it on the floor. I thought we had another treat fail until a little later when I saw that it was gone. On subsequent days, he ate the treat right away without playing hard to get.Normally, Nigel's breath could peel paint. With just a few days of using these treats I started noticing a difference. His breath is not spring fresh, but definitely better than it was.I like that the treats are chewy and not hard. I think that one reason he doesn't eat the other dental chews is that they are hard and it may be uncomfortable to chew them. These take some chewing to finish, but they are not hard and crunchy.Although these treats are pricy, Nigel likes them and they seem to be good for him. The one negative is that they have a fairly strong pumpkin smell. One treat isn't bad, but it is kind of overpowering when you open the bag.I will continue giving these to Nigel as long as he likes them and eats them, but I may try some of the other flavors to give him some variety.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CDJ4OQNRCO3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4RPXGC#wasThisHelpful","R2CDJ4OQNRCO3U","A24B990VP9QC6C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24B990VP9QC6C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a long-time Judy Greer fan. When she turns up on a favorite TV show (Big Bang, Two and a Half Men, HIMYM, etc.) it is always the sign of an entertaining episode. And her performance in The Descendents was amazing. She is usually not the star, but always memorable. Although the book includes her story of how taking $20 made her so anxious that there were...unfortunate physical results, she apparently has no problem stealing scenes from her co-stars. ;o)Judy gives us a glimpse into the life of a working actress, telling a bit about auditions, life on location, etc. I would have liked even more of this, to learn about some of the interesting experiences she must have had in her career. Not a tell-all, just a few more good stories.There are good stories here about her life away from the set. Judy shares some of her day-to-day life with a husband she adores, two step kids she is learning to relate to, a dog with digestive issues, and parents with whom she has a close and loving relationship. Oh, and her friends, who are just as crazy (in a good way, of course) as Judy.This is a light, fun read. I enjoyed reading it and even laughed out loud a few times.

"For certain there are provocative elements for its day contained within the narrative of ""The Couch"" like patricide and incest but by today's standards they are quite dated.  The film plays like a homage (rip-off?) of Hitchcock most notably ""Psycho"" but that comparison only demonstrates why this film is lacking.  Puzzling because Robert Bloch who wrote the story that was the basis for ""Psycho"" wrote the script here based on a story by Blake Edwards and Owen Crump.  I think you can look no further than the flat direction of Crump and a ham-handed lead performance by star Grant Williams who won't make you forget Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates.

"I bought this one for my mother because I knew she was a big Ronald Reagan fan.  She explained to me that the stage play this was based on was quite the scandal in its day and the film was considered morally objectional in some quarters at the time of its release.  In a day where ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" is considered appropriate Valentines fare I had to check out this allegedly salacious exercise.  Having seen it the film is as harmless as ""Teletubbies"".  The film concerns itself with the growing relationship between aspiring actress Sally (Eleanor Parker) and nice guy G.I. Bill (Reagan).  Sally has foresworn love because her heart has been broken one time too many and Bill has seen his share as well but is ready to take a chance again.  The kids next door chemistry between Parker and Reagan is evident and you want their characters to make a go of it.  Eve Arden is on hand for comic relief as Parker's man crazy pal and Reagan's ex.  The film's stage origins are obvious taking place the majority of the time at Parker's apartment but it does not feel stagy or claustrophobic.

There is no doubt that she is up to the comedic requirements of her role as CIA handler turned field agent but who knew that she could master the physical aspects of the role.  Props also to Jason Statham who lampoons his action hero persona here by playing a real twit.  I also liked Miranda Hart as McCarthy's nervous colleague from Langley.  The central plot involving an arms deal is serviceable but superfluous being the vehicle for the comedy and action.  Along with ""Kingsman-The Secret Service"" these are the best espionage comedies since ""True Lies"".

"I was skeptical when I heard two actors were playing Brian Wilson.  Having now seen the film and how it's structured it's a terrific concept.  The film flashes back and forth in time with Paul Dano playing Wilson during his peak creative period and John Cusack playing him probably 25 years later while his psyche is fragile and his life is being dominated by Svengali like ""medical guardian"", the parasitic Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti).  It's a brilliant conceit that meets it's fruition when the two distinct Brians  compliment each other and meld into a single entity towards the film's heart wrenching conclusion.  I was fortunate to have seen Brian in concert three times including the masterful stage recreation of ""Pet Sounds"" in 2000 and I can say conclusively that both actors have channeled his essence in their performances most notably Cusack.  Cusack has Brian's ticks and mannerisms down pat but compromises none of the humanity in the process.  There are plenty of villains to go around aside from the aforementioned Landy.  You have Brian's vicious father Murry and his cousin, Mike Love, who in Machiavellian fashion wanted to wrest control of the Beach Boys going as far as kicking Brian out of the band during the notorious ""bed"" period.  The film's most prominent hero is Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) who sees sweetness and sensitivity in Brian and attempts to extricate him away from the controlling psychotherapist.  One of the film's other successes is how director Bill Pohlad establishes time and place.  The recreation of the ""Pet Sounds"" and the aborted ""Smile"" sessions is nothing short of jawdropping.  This is probably the best musical biography since ""The Buddy Holly Story"" in 1978.  Undeniably the best picture I've seen this year and probably some other years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D8YSS5WNOJYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01127XNEE#wasThisHelpful","R3D8YSS5WNOJYU","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Never have the troubles that plagued Northern Ireland been portrayed as succinctly as shown in ""71"".  The hostilities between the Catholic and Protestant population isn't as cut and dry as would be assumed more akin to the quagmire that was Southeast Asia that ran concurrent with the events portrayed in this film.  There are divisions within the Catholic militants likewise with their Protestant counterparts.  Throw into the mix loyalists, collaborators, and British undercover operatives you would be hard pressed to discern friend from foe.  The film focuses on young Gary Hook(Jack O'Connell), a British conscript sent to Belfast to police the unrest.  Separated from his platoon during a skirmish with Catholic locals Hook has to navigate the hostile landscape of the strife torn city to get back to the safety of his barracks.  His fear and anxiety is palpable and his every step is a potential landmine.  Director Yann Demange helms this tautly intense film with an assured hand allowing the audience to view events through the frightened eyes of Hook.  The success of the film is that it offers a fresh perspective on events in recent history that can't be explained in black-and-white terms.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROMQR6873IPBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3DC644#wasThisHelpful","ROMQR6873IPBT","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has to rank as one of the most boring films I've ever seen.  Nothing of consequence happens in this inert exercise and if it did I blinked.  Story never gets off the ground and the direction by actor Alan Rickman is plodding.  Workmanlike performances by Kate Winslet and Matthias Schoenaerts are left dangling in the wind.  Romance between the two characters is never truly developed ergo no spark in the tentative love scenes that are contrived here.  The best thing you can say for the film is it is a handsome looking period piece but that only goes so far. Narratively speaking the film could have used a little chaos to attain viewer interest.

"Unfortunately, the dubious reputation of this film precedes it.  In reality it's not a latter day ""Heaven's Gate"" but more a marketing challenge.  Truthfully, how do you sell a Depression era Shakespearean tragedy?  If you can cite a flaw in the film it's the flat performance by Jennifer Lawrence in the title role.  Lawrence work is okay in the early stages of the film but at the film's crucial midpoint she goes awry.  In demonstrating the malevolence of Serena Lawrence resorts to a comical faraway stare not unlike a refugee from a Kubrick film.  Regardless, this misreading does not prove to be fatal because Susanne Bier's direction is fluid and the script, based on Ron Rash's novel, is tight and literate. The picture looks great and the period is evoked nicely.  I'll take this ambitious offering over most of the cookie cutter fare offered up by Hollywood any day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LC0S4E26QUSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHJ7FL6#wasThisHelpful","R2LC0S4E26QUSW","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Despite the unique setting this film doesn't break any new comic ground but gets a pass for good vibes.  The plot concerns a milquetoast reporter (Robert Morse) and a womanizing photographer (George Maharis) jettisoned to an underground naval base in Antarctica cooking up a scheme to coerce a Russian scientist (Michael Constantine) to defect by flying attractive women into what was previously an all male conclave.  The cast is engaging notably Anjanette Comer as a Kiwi stewardess and Yvonne Craig as Morse's fianc√©.  Tackles Cold War politics with a feather duster as opposed to a sledgehammer.

"I came.  I saw.  I liked. How can one not with the Osmonds blaring over the opening credits.  What was it all about?  Closest I can figure is it's a dark comedy advocating abstinence.  How else do you account for the fact that all of the victims with one glaring exception are promiscuous nubile teenagers?  Sure our nominal protagonist, Ponce (John David Carson), gets deflowered by Angie Dickinson but everybody knows that there has always been a double standard in Hollywood with the boys and girls.  As a thriller it shows its cards much too soon.  I figured out whodunit by reading the back of the DVD case. That said the titillation factor is primary here with the cloak and dagger aspect an afterthought.  Some seem genuinely surprised that Gene Roddenberry would be connected with this enterprise but if anybody remembers the barely there outfits of the female characters on ""Star Trek"" it shouldn't be a shock.

"It may be a surprise to some and a shock to others that renowned British comedian Terry-Thomas made a predominately dramatic film.  On the same token some of his fans will welcome this departure from form and others incensed when you consider that the distributor of this DVD, Sinister Cinema, is marketing it as a straight comedy.  You would then ask how does he do?  Quite well, thank you.  Terry-Thomas finds himself quite adept in assaying the more serious elements of the story while appropriating elements of his comic persona in his portrayal of an inspector for the World Health Organization. In a nutshell his work here isn't on the level of an Alec Guinness (""Bridge on the River Kwai"") but comparable to Peter Sellers (""Hoffman"") when they strayed into the dramatic.  The film is diminished somewhat however by trite movie-of-the-week plotting which concerns the manhunt for the carrier of the smallpox virus.  The main story is straight out of ""Quincy"" or ""CSI"" ending up in James Bond territory.  Reservations aside I would recommend this as a must for Terry-Thomas fans which in a perfect world should be everybody.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QMIEDCWG3F42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LNOMYA#wasThisHelpful","R2QMIEDCWG3F42","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Terry-Thomas' status as one of Britain's renowned comedians is only diminished by the long shadows cast by Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness.  This double billing is a terrific primer for his inimitable brand of stiff upper lip tomfoolery.  The highlight of this set would have to be ""Make Mine Mink"" where Terry-Thomas plays a retired army major who along with his fellow boarders decide to pinch and fence mink clothing and donate the proceeds to their landlady's favorite charity in order to alleviate the monotony in their lives.  Best bits are a cheeky reference to ""The Third Man"" and a deliciously funny ending.  ""Too Many Crooks"" has its moments but it isn't as fresh as ""Make Mine Mink"".  The scenario has Terry-Thomas as a tightwad businessman whose wife is mistakenly kidnapped by bumbling hoods who think they've nabbed his beloved daughter.  His reaction is priceless as he refuses to pony up a penny of the ransom.  Highlight would be the scene where he repeatedly rushes into his burning house to recover money he hid under the floorboards.

"The most distinct impression you get from ""The Night Digger"" is the obvious influence of Alfred Hitchcock.  There's a certain psychosexual aura that permeates the proceedings but, alas, director Alastair Reid has the minutia of the Master down pat but is at a loss in the suspense department.  The nature of the misogynist killer, Billy Jarvis (Nicholas Clay), is revealed much too early depriving the film of a much needed pulse.  That said this film should be seen for the terrific performances of the leads.  Patricia Neal has never been better as the physically and emotionally scarred caregiver Maura Prince.  Probably in her mid-forties at the time the film was made and recovering from a life threatening stroke Neal makes Maura a pillar of strength even while the character she plays is breaking up inside.  Neal even uses the effects of her stroke to her advantage imbuing dimension to her performance. Pamela Brown avoids clich√©  managing to engender some sympathy as Maura's mean spirited and controlling adoptive mother.  Clay's work recalls Anthony Perkins' turn as Norman Bates in ""Psycho"" and makes Billy wholly original and empathetic.  ""The Night Digger"" is ultimately a film that falls short of its lofty ambitions but worth checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UVCOUXW1M7L1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LUK61I#wasThisHelpful","R3UVCOUXW1M7L1","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This trilogy of short films directed by John Ford is informed by his earlier works set in Ireland.  Whereas ""The Informer"" and ""The Quiet Man"" were outright homeruns this exercise is an admirable but decidedly mixed bag.  The first entry, ""The Majesty of the Law"", is a whimsical account of a proud Irishman consenting to his arrest for assaulting his neighbor only on his terms.  The story here is funny but a little thin.  The middle film, ""A Minute's Wait"", concerns a passenger train that is constantly delayed is the most successful recalling the classic Ealing comedies with an Irish sensibility.  The final story, ""1921"", about an attempt to free an Irish rebel set to be hanged by the British occupation forces for treason juggles the dramatic and humorous to a mostly successful result.  This film is a must for Ford enthusiasts and for those unfamiliar with his work should check out his earlier films set in Ireland.

"I have read reviews describing this film as lightweight formulaic fluff which does it a disservice.  Both this film and ""Where the Boys Are"" starred Dolores Hart and were helmed by Henry Levin.  Despite the levity contained within both there are cogent observations made about love and sexuality particularly from a young woman's perspective.  This film focuses on three stewardesses and their efforts to land a man.  Donna (Hart) is a cynic looking to grab a rich beau. Bergy (Lois Nettleton), the elder of the trio, is a lonely heart looking for a kindred soul.  Carol (Pamela Tiffin) is the romantic of the bunch just looking for a husband.  All get more than they bargained for.  This is a really good film with intelligent characters and believable situations that I wholeheartedly recommend.

It has the feel of a glorified student film.  One thing in its favor is that Jon Voight does project a certain degree of charisma but it's lost in the morass.

High point is Talia Shire manages to stave off embarrassment.  Elizabeth Ashley isn't so lucky in a scenery chewing turn.  The film's ineffectiveness comes as a genuine surprise when you consider this was the debut directorial bow of Gordon Willis who lensed ""The Godfather"" among other stellar achievements.

"For starters this has to rank with ""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"" as one of the strangest films ever made by a major studio, in this case MGM.  I have nothing against offbeat offerings but just because a film has a skewed sensibility doesn't necessarily make it good as is the case with the fore mentioned vampire movie .  Regardless, I was intrigued by this film's goofball premise.  In order for it to work, though, you need compelling performances by the main actors and the makers of the film get a spirited turn by Stacy Keach in the title role.  Keach makes believable his account of the state executioner who offers the condemned tender loving care before he dispatches them to the ethereal fields of ambrosia.  A lot of the dark humor is hit-or-miss but the script hits enough bulls eyes for me to recommend.

"John Milius' masterwork is old school in the best sense of the word.  As grand as the film is it is also highly literate recalling the collaboration between David Lean and Robert Bolt on ""Lawrence of Arabia"".  The beauty of the film is its scale doesn't overwhelm the characters.  Larger then life performances are offered up by Sean Connery as Berber chieftain Raisuli and Brian Keith as U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt.  Though neither man shares the same frame you sense the kinship laced with begrudging respect these two have for each other.  Candice Bergen has never been better as the kidnapped American widow offering up strength and tenacity.  It's almost unheard of in films of this type to see women with this kind of intestinal fortitude.  Add to that sumptuous cinematography by Billy Williams and a superlative score by Jerry Goldsmith you have an epic for the ages.  Milius had the temerity to make this film when the concept of gunboat diplomacy was frowned upon.  At the 1975 Oscars the film was virtually ignored.  I think Goldsmith got a nomination for his score.

"""Cop"" is a case of a film with a lot to offer that just misses the brass ring.  Pluses would be a none-too-surprising superlative turn by James Woods as a cop on the edge on the trail of a serial killer.  Woods eschews crime film clich√©s playing Lloyd Hopkins as a man who has seen too much with his anger and emotion barely contained and bubbling to the surface.  I also liked Lesley Ann Warren's performance of a feminist poet who vainly masks her pain and sensitivity.  Director James B. Harris, Stanley Kubrick's production partner for his early films, adds a gritty nourish veneer to the proceedings keeping the film on a smooth track.  If one were to quibble it would be with a trite central mystery.  Adapted from a James Ellroy's novel this is not as an assured narrative as ""L.A. Confidential"" would prove a decade later.

"I'd like to preface my review by saying this is a potentially great film tainted by a weak central performance by Bette Davis.  As Aggie Hurley Davis gives a mannered and affected account of what she construes  how an Irish housewife conducts herself day-to-day.  Davis is as convincing  an Irishwoman as Barbra Streisand would be. Her turn suggests the Bronx by way of Vassar.  That said the film more than compensates for this deficiency in many ways.  Paddy Chayefsky's teleplay, adapted here by Gore Vidal, demonstrates an innate understanding of the human condition. As shown previously with ""Marty""  Chayefsky empathizes with the working classes giving them dignity and feeling their pain.  Ernest Borgnine is terrific as the Tom, the patriarch of the Hurley family who innately loves them but harbors dreams of his own.  Debbie Reynolds as Jane, the sensible soon to be married Hurley daughter, gives probably the best performance of her career projecting poise and strength.  Barry Fitzgerald as Uncle Jack plays Barry Fitzgerald or at least a variation of the Barry Fitzgerald we grew to love in ""Going My Way"".  The film disappoints only when you consider it could have been so much more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QFTBL2H8UIZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005H4IIAS#wasThisHelpful","R3QFTBL2H8UIZ4","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these films released prior to the MPAA ratings system where subject matter considered taboo is discretely alluded to and danced around.  The topic of sex is referred to but never shown.  The scriptwriters would have to cleverly tiptoe around the subject which makes for a more satisfying experience than if graphic sex and nudity is on display.  Our main character is Eileen (Jane Fonda), a 22 year old virgin debating whether to give up the ghost.  For reasons too numerous to recount this sets off a chain reaction of comic events  involving Eileen, her brother Adam(Cliff Robertson), and a poor slob from Philadelphia named Mike (Rod Taylor) which include lies, half-truths, mistaken identity and whatnot.  Clothes are ruined and people inexplicably end up in bathrobes and girlfriends are on a one-way flight for Pittsburgh.  When the laughter subsides you're left with a lot of food for thought about sexual attitudes circa 1963.  New York looks fabulous and Peter Nero offers up a terrific score.

"Most reviews tag this film as a sex comedy when in reality it is more of a comic observation about the sexes.  The film debunks the wide held belief that men have a one track mind and want one thing from women.  Pause for a moment and think about the relationships between men and their mothers and you get the picture.  Sure men think they yearn to be like Hugh Hefner yet truth be told they desire nothing more than a home cooked meal or a listening partner than a roll in the hay. On the reverse coin women think they can view male-female relationships with cool detachment as represented by Kim Novak's post-grad sociology student.  That is, of course, if the male isn't represented by cool hunky nice guy James Garner.  The film has a funny astute script that makes cogent observations and the cast is uniformly excellent.

"This flick plays like a Euro homage to Sixties style World War II action extravaganzas like the ""Dirty Dozen"" and ""The Great Escape"".  The film lacks the panache, humor, and irony of those esteemed epics and what you're left with is a lot of gunfire and explosions.  Things blow up real good, though.

"Despite a promising central premise and a good cast ""Sam Whiskey"" never gets off the ground.  That can be attributed to flabby direction and an inert script.  Burt Reynolds can also take responsibility for the film's ineffectiveness.  In one of his earlier films he displays none of the charisma and sly charm that later made him a matinee idol and number one box office draw in the Seventies.

The reason I recommend it is for the indelible kinetic chemistry between Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli. Burt's world weary good-ole-boy shtick and Liza's bubbly hyperactivity emit sparks not unlike those demonstrated in a previously maligned flick from the Seventies, ""Lucky Lady"".

"The only thing these two films have in common is that they have the words great and bank in their respective titles.  Neither film is particularly memorable but work as decent time fillers.""The Great Bank Hoax""-Small town bank is embezzled to the tune of $100,000.00 (a lot of dough in 1979) so the bank executives scheme to rob the branch to avoid the taint of scandal.  Supposed parallel to Watergate but the metaphor was lost on me.  Fitfully amusing but not outright.  Highlight is Burgess Meredith's turn as a wily bank vice president.""The Great Bank Robbery""-Western parody about competing forces attempting to heist the gold from an impregnable Southwest Texas bank.  Film is more frenetic than funny but not without its moments.  Noteworthy is the diverse cast (Zero Mostel, Kim Novak, Clint Walker et. al.) and a script by William Peter Blatty who would subsequently write ""The Exorcist"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C6FF413VM3YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001T21R46#wasThisHelpful","R3C6FF413VM3YS","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was two years old in 1966 when this series premiered and four when it finished its run in 1968 so I have no first hand recollection of it.  I discovered it in the early Eighties when I attended college and it ran on the local UHF channel during summer break.  It was all the rage among my peers for its irreverence and campiness.  When the ""Batman"" film came out later in 1989 one was forced to reevaluate the Caped Crusader in respect to director Tim Burton's darker vision.  Christopher Nolan conception of the Dark Knight in his superlative trilogy offered the most definitive version of the Batman ethos.  In light of what transpired since the ""Batman"" series left the network airwaves how does it hold up today?  Remarkably well in my humble opinion.  I think the best way to view this series is  in sequential order taking note how the series evolved over the course of its run.  You will see its shift in tone is gradual and not that dramatic.  It is then you will see that every one of the 120 episodes, good and not so good, is of a piece to a satisfying whole not unlike the initial ""Star Wars"" trilogy or Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" cycle.  For sure there are some clunkers like ""Surf's Up, Joker"", the sexism of ""Nora Clavicle's Ladies Crime Club"" and John Astin's  misinterpretation of the Riddler but they aren't a deal killer.  I paid $99.99 for this set and consider it a bargain.  If anything the series is a font of delicious trivia when you consider all the guest villains and cameos. Bring on ""The Green Hornet""!  I conclude by leaving with this question-How many episodes do you physically see Bonnie, Commissioner Gordon's receptionist, in the flesh?","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RHRTUA3KVEA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LT1JKN2#wasThisHelpful","R1RHRTUA3KVEA6","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Our Mother's House"" is about seven young London siblings living in a semi-decrepit Victorian house who conspire to hide their religious  mother's death and their efforts to carry on normally.  The normalcy as comprehended by the Hook children would be one prescribed by their fundamentalist mother's beliefs.  Things go relatively well until their fun loving father, Jack (Dirk Bogarde), returns to the fold.  Jack initially agrees to keep the children's secret but it is soon learned that he has an agenda of his own.  There are not enough superlatives to describe how good this film is.  With the exceptions of Pamela Franklin and Mark Lester I had never heard of the young actors playing the Hooks but director Jack Clayton corrals terrific performances from the tykes.  These kids are the heart and soul of the film and they shine individually and as a unit.  Bogarde in his own right is superb engendering a semblance of sympathy for a character that is essentially an unredeemable heel.  The film is unremittingly dark and moody that builds to a crescendo that is genuinely shocking.  This film is relatively obscure but any adventurous cineaste looking for new and intriguing fare ""Our Mother's House"" is a good place to visit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VUR287G201RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEYPUMQ#wasThisHelpful","R1VUR287G201RJ","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Terrific ensemble cast with standouts being Rob Reiner as the nervous asthmatic younger son and Sid Caesar as the delusional uncle who still thinks he's fighting World War II.

"This alleged comedy about two shore patrolmen (Tom Berenger and William McNamara) escorting a sexy ensign (Erika Eleniak) for transport to the brig elicits a collective yawn.  The film is mundane to the extreme in both character development and plotting with the only reason to watch is the obligatory nude scene by Eleniak.  This is surprising because the film was helmed by Dennis Hopper who does offer an amusing cameo as a lingerie salesman.  I can't imagine Hopper's much maligned ""The Last Movie"" (unavailable on DVD) being this dreary and uninteresting.

"Director Richard A. Colla attempts miserably to fashion an Altmanesque account of the comings and goings of a Boston police precinct.  What this film lacks is Robert Altman's ability to corral large ensembles with overlapping dialogue and multiple story threads.

"The model for the classic gangster film was cemented by ""Little Caesar"", ""Public Enemy"", and ""Scarface"" and refined by ""The Godfather Saga"".  When the film code relaxed its standards by the late Sixties the Brits introduced a new language to the organized crime genre but the public wasn't quite ready for it.  Films like this one, ""Get Carter"", and ""Sitting Target"" introduced a harsh realism and brutality that made Cagney and Bogart seem tame in comparison and laid the groundwork for later films like ""The Long Good Friday"" and ""Mona Lisa"".  The character of Vic Dakin that Richard Burton portrays here is unlike anything he's tackled before or after, a virtual human powder keg with a short fuse.  Vic rules the underworld with his personal patent of viciousness and intimidation that gives enemies and associates pause.  This is an excellent performance by Burton careful not to overplay the character assaying Vic's innate ruthlessness despite the fact he's portraying a doting mama's boy with sadistic sexual proclivities .  The main plot threads concern a payroll robbery involving Vic that goes awry and the police efforts to nab him.  This is edge-of-your-seat stuff and there's a brilliant closing shot though it may be lingered on too long.  Recommended for Burton enthusiasts of strong constitution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29YQAV2UBPKNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0099116DG#wasThisHelpful","R29YQAV2UBPKNY","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Moonshine War"" is a good film saddled with an unevenness of tone uneasily mixing the comic with the dramatic. Set in the waning days of Prohibition in Kentucky the film concerns itself with the efforts of a revenuer to confiscate the liquor manufactured by a young moonshiner.  One problem is the key part of the revenuer from Louisville  played by the usually reliable Patrick McGoohan  doesn't seem to know whether to mine his character for humor or ruthlessness and that's not mentioning his curious accent.  Fortunately Richard Widmark as a disgraced dentist turned moonshiner steals the show recalling his cackling starmaking turn in ""Kiss of Death"".  Almost equally good is Lee Hazlewood, better known as the songwriter of ""These Boots are Made for Walking"", as Widmark's henchman.  The scene in the diner where Hazlewood forces a couple from Cincinnati to give up their clothing at gunpoint is priceless.  Ostensibly Alan Alda as the bootlegger whose supply everyone wants is the lead of this venture but in an appropriately understated turn wisely cedes the spotlight to his more colorful costars.  The bottom line is this is a better-than-average film easily enjoyable if you're not expecting anything special.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LZKQSUT00C4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU4DS26#wasThisHelpful","R2LZKQSUT00C4K","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in Tennessee circa 1972 the film concerns the feud between two rural clans, the Feathers and the Gutshalls, over a piece of desirable land.  The patriarchs of the respective clans, Laban Feather (Rod Steiger) and Pap Gutshall (Robert Ryan), exploit their offspring in continuing the squabble starting with petty vandalism which then escalates to rape and murder.  This is a smoking powder keg on the verge of exploding and there's no apparent civil law to impede it.  The theme of blood wars on display here has its American precedent in the famed Hatfield and McCoy feud.  The patriarchs instigate the war illustrated in the film using their offspring as cannon fodder and the inevitable  outcome is there are no winners leaving the respective parties to oversee the body count.  This is a gut wrenching film almost Shakespearean in its level of tragedy that also uses the then ongoing Vietnamese conflict as a parallel. It is also a good showcase for then fledgling talent that includes Jeff Bridges, Gary Busey, Randy Quaid, and Season Hubley.  ""Lolly-Madonna XXX"" is another unsung gem from the Seventies when American filmmakers took chances and challenged their audience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9FOMA3NDK0B6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU3R9MM#wasThisHelpful","R9FOMA3NDK0B6","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The average network affiliate newscast consists of equal parts calamity, sports, and weather with local interest pigeonholed in for a few insignificant moments.  The news honchoes convince themselves that they are offering the bloodthirsty public what they want while reaping the rewards of increased ratings.  Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) has no such pretensions making the natural career progression from common thief to nocturnal journalist.  He's a cold-hearted parasite and makes no bones about his intensions.  What he does want is financial compensation for his artfully constructed videotapes of murder and mayhem and a little bit of legitimacy for his efforts.  His employers need him more than he needs them and he knows it.  The decline of television journalism has been obvious for decades as demonstrated in 1976 with Paddy Chayefsky's ""Network"".  What director Dan Gilroy adds to the conversation is a high tech aura and acknowledgement of the influence of reality television.  The film makes its points forcefully sometimes a bit too bluntly but never redundantly.  Gyllenhaal's work here is a piece with the lovable rogues who've graced the big screen in the past careful not to overplay his hand making Bloom somewhat charming and empathetic if you judged him by his own criteria. Sort of like a devil with a camcorder and police scanner. Gyllenhaal is matched by Rene Russo as Nina, a Diana Christenson type who purchases Lou's ungodly product more from inate knowledge of marketplace than from any moral criteria.  ""Nightcrawler"" reminded me of an underrated film from years ago called ""The Public Eye"" where Joe Pesci played a freelance still photographer in the Forties who took salacious pictures of New York after dark and sold them to the local tabloids at the back door.  Pesci's character parts with Gyllenhaal's in that he was oblivious to the exploitative nature of his activities and regarded his photography as art.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0UVDFQQY9SQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3DLD68#wasThisHelpful","R2I0UVDFQQY9SQ","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Basically this is three-films-in-one.  Unfortunately none of the films are wholly satisfying as a stand alone particularly the way the narrative is structured flashing back and forth from time and place creating an unsettling feeling.  Perhaps it would have worked if the stories were told in linear fashion but more than likely scenarist Graham Moore bit off more than he can chew trying to convey too much in a limited amount of time.  Matters aren't helped by star Benedict Cumberbatch's turn as mathematician  Alan Turing which struck me as mannered and affected just the kind of performance Academy members would consider bold and daring.  The primary gist of the film is supposed to be about Turing and his team of wonks attempting to crack the Nazi Enigma Code.  It's kind of laughable because you get the sense here that nobody other than Turing does much of anything being content to bask in their leader's glory.  Equally laughable is that once the code is cracked Turing would be taken seriously as a war strategist.  There are some good performances in the film particularly by Keira Knightley as the sole woman on Turing's team, Charles Dance as the supervisor of the project who would have sacked Turing if he had his druthers, and Mark Strong as an MI6 agent.  Some would say I'm nitpicking but considering the superlatives accompanying the film I was a tad disappointed.

"Those looking for a conventional crime thriller should look elsewhere because ""The Drop"" is more character study than mystery.  One has to follow the deliberate pace of the film to reap the maximum rewards.  This film has one of the best ensembles of any film released last year.  The setting is the rough streets of Brooklyn where if you aren't tough you must have the pretense of toughness just to survive.  Chechen gangsters run the rackets and use the taprooms to deposit the receipts from their illegal operations.  The bar employees don't know which night the drop is going to happen until it actually does.  At closing time on the night of the drop at Cousin Marv's the bar is held up by two armed gunmen which sets off a chain of events that resonates.  It's secondary as to the identity of the stickup men and who their collaboraors are.  Foremost this is a film about complex personalities none more so than Bob (Tom Hardy), the bartender at Cousin Marv's.  Bob at first strikes you as a simple gentle guy but as the film unfolds  darker shadings start to emerge which can be explained as survival instincts.  Marv (James Gandolfini) seems to be a disagreeable sort but even he has good qualities such as a devotion to his dying father.  There's a mysterious quality to Nadia (Noomi Rapace) the waitress with an ambiguous past who Bob takes a shine to.  Then there's Eric (Matthias Schoenaerts), a local psychotic who may talk a good game but is probably full of bluster.  Most impressive is Hardy who gave two of last year's best performances in this film and ""Locke"".  Hardy knows how to dial it down and capture the soul of the characters he plays and mesmerize an audience.  Schoenaerts is no less impressive and his tension filled confrontations  with Hardy literally suck the air out of the room.  It's fitting that this was Gandolfini's last film because it is a piece with the gritty work he is best known for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M8Y2THRJ18ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLYTPEM#wasThisHelpful","R2M8Y2THRJ18ZK","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Godfather"" imagined a world where organized crime was run like a legitimate business.  ""A Most Violent Year"" reverses the logic and supposes that in order for the private entrepreneur to thrive they must adopt the ways of the Mafia.  The setting is New York, 1981.  Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is a fledgling home heating oil magnate who's looking to expand.  He puts a large deposit down on a piece of property with the contingency that if he doesn't come up with the remainder in a week's time he forfeits the down payment.  Timing couldn't be worse for Abel.  His competitors are employing mobster tactics hijacking his delivery trucks and assaulting his employees.  On top of that the district attorney (David Oyelowo) is making an example of Abel by investigating his business practices on the most specious grounds.  Abel prides himself about being above reproach but his present situation causes him to reconsider his approach.  J.C. Chandor's film is a fascinating account of doing business in an ethical cesspool.  It has a lot to say about how we conduct our affairs in America and the fine line that has to be nudged just to survive.  Isaac is nothing short of brilliant as Abel demonstrating his turmoil with few histrionics.  Jessica Chastain as Abel's wife Anna nearly steals the show in a performance that suggests Lady Macbeth.  The daughter of mobsters Anna subtly manipulates Abel to act in the ways of the world as opposed to his idealized vision of it.  A telling scene shows Abel hitting a deer in the road.  Abel hesitates in putting the wounded animal out of its misery before Anna pumps two slugs into it.  A fascinating film that may be misconstrued as a traditional gangster film in the Scorsese tradition instead of the work of a visionary up-and-coming auteur.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6EG0O4EVO4WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RNELG5E#wasThisHelpful","R6EG0O4EVO4WB","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We can herald this film because director Tim Burton has challenged himself by employing a conventional narrative to tell the story of Margaret (Amy Adams) and Walter (Christoph Waltz) Keane.  Theirs was a marriage of convenience in that Margaret needed a stable domestic situation to support her young daughter.  Because Walter was an inept artist he needed Margaret's artistic vision to compensate for his inadequacy.  As a woman in the Fifties Margaret wasn't taken seriously in the art community but Walter had the charisma and gumption to appropriate her works as his own.  Because her paintings sold like hotcakes Margaret was willing to hold her peace even as she simmered inside.  Walter on the other hand was wallowing in his newfound celebrity and as time elapsed began to believe  that he was the creative sparkplug behind Margaret's work.  ""Big Eyes"" recalls ""Ed Wood"", the last time Burton tackled an artist on the periphery of the American cultural scene.  In both cases the artists are savaged by the critics but have acolytes whose opinions resonate years later.  I wasn't particularly impressed with the artwork displayed here but one has to remember that Norman Rockwell and Andy Warhol were sneered at by the cultural scions only to be revered by the general public.  ""Big Eyes"" isn't a great film but it is a very good one that kind of falters in the homestretch.  Adams is a model of consistency evolving from a timid housewife to a woman with intestinal fortitude in reclaiming what was taken from her by the end.  Waltz's performance is more problematic in that he succeeds in the early segments as a caddish manipulator but  later in the film chews the scenery in embarrassing fashion particularly in the courtroom scenes. As always Burton knows how to evoke time and place and Danny Elfman offers up a decent period jazz score. An ambitious film demonstrating that Burton is still on his game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0YQPO0I80KF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RY87FTU#wasThisHelpful","R2W0YQPO0I80KF","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cheryl Strayed's (Reese Witherspoon) life is in tailspin.  After her beloved mother (Laura Dern) passes at the tender age of 45 Cheryl finds cold comfort in the twin evils of indiscriminate sex and hardcore drug use. In a moment of clarity Cheryl finds inspiration in a pamphlet for exploring the Pacific Crest Trail.  Cheryl makes the  decision to hike the entirety of the Trail though she has no prior experience to prepare her for this daunting task.  When her trek begins Cheryl is making little headway but as time elapses Cheryl picks up small survival tips to help her go the duration. Cheryl not only has to battle the harsh terrain and unwanted sexual advances of men she meets on the Trail but ultimately herself.  Jean-Marc Vallee's film has an interesting structure in that as Cheryl progresses in her goal we flashback to her unsavory past.  This suggests that Cheryl isn't so much running from her past but attempting to transcend it making her a better person in the process.  Witherspoon's performance is wholeheartedly in synch with her director's artistic vision demonstrating guts, determination, smarts, and tenacity.  Witherspoon's work here is truly inspirational probably the best of her career.  In essence Witherspoon is flying solo but Dern shines in her few scenes.  ""Wild"" demands the same perseverance from its audience that made Cheryl's journey so transcendent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9A62VXFW48FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6MBGY8#wasThisHelpful","R9A62VXFW48FH","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another great vehicle by Jason Statham that bypassed theatres and went straight to video.  For those following his career he offers up his best work in these underappreciated gems.  If you don't believe me check out ""Blitz"", ""Chaos"", and ""Redemption"".  I think the reason these films are hard to market is because the studio honchoes have pigeonholed him as an action star in the Schwarzenegger-Stallone vein that when he departs from form they are at a loss. Adapted by William Goldman from his novel ""Heat"" and previously an unsuccessful film starring Burt Reynolds this is more a noir than an action film though it does contain fight sequences.  Statham plays Nick Wild, highly paid bodyguard for hire who is also a compulsive gambler.  The fact that he chose to settle in Las Vegas doesn't help his addiction.  When a call girl acquaintance of his is brutally beaten by a mobster's son Wild acts instinctively instead of intuitively.  Statham gives a terrifically  brooding performance which is matched by a seedy Vegas ambiance.  You would think the gambling mecca had been mined by filmmakers of all freshness but director Simon West offers new perspective.  I would behoove you to check this film out along with Statham's brilliantly villainous turn in the just released ""Furious Seven"" as contrast.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MYSKWA1ZBG6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T2Z3P6K#wasThisHelpful","R3MYSKWA1ZBG6O","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Ender's Game"" is a terrific learning tool for pre-teens and teens giving them valuable lessons on the morality of warfare.  Like any endeavor we should abide by a morally humane code of ethics when engaged in combat and battle exercises.  This theme runs throughout the film making a cogent argument unlike the cynical ""Hunger Games"" movies that decry violence yet wallow in it at the same time.  Good performances offered up by a stellar cast led by Asa Butterfield (""Hugo"") who gives a mature and knowing turn that belies his tender years.  If I were to fault the film it would be over length and though the effects and art direction impress they add a certain sterility to the proceedings.  Regardless, an intelligent film for its target audience that offers them food for thought to chew on.  I received this as a Christmas present from my brother which I found curious.  I had avoided it because I thought it to be a young adult title.

"This film doesn't just hold you in suspense it grabs you by the lapels and forces your attention even if you want to look away.  Director David Fincher stylishly films Gillian Flynn's source novel of the ideal marriage  rotten at its core in such a way that you're left dizzy and examining your own relationships when the movie is through.  It's not only an exploration of good loving gone bad but an indictment of our media culture among other things.  Nancy Grace probably had her attorney on speed dial after viewing this one.  ""Gone Girl"" is helped immeasurably by a great ensemble cast led by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike.  Affleck continues the personal winning streak he's been on since ""Hollywoodland"" some years ago in his portrayal of Nick Dunne, the seemingly ideal husband who harbors personal peccadilloes that renders him sympathetic to pathetic as the narrative unfolds.  It's Pike in a starmaking turn who astonishes most as Amy whose sudden disappearance the film centers on.  In lesser hands this enigmatic character could have been one dimensional but Pike puts a human face on a character you'll love to hate.  Among The supporting players Tyler Perry stands out as a defense lawyer who bears more than a striking resemblance to Johnny Cochran.  Nobody gets off easy in this take-no-prisoners exercise and too much dissection would ruin the suspense for the uninitiated.  The film is quite graphic in the language and sex department and there is one particularly gruesome depiction of violence but those of strong constitution would be behooved to check this film out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R277G2QAJRGLIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q599A8S#wasThisHelpful","R277G2QAJRGLIA","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dreary account of a young couple (Michael Ealy, Joy Bryant) falling in and out of love with each other in modern day Los Angeles.  The film makes no cogent observations about the pitfalls of romance and the leads are as dull as dishwater making Rob Lowe and Demi Moore, the stars of the original film, seem like Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh.  Comic relief is offered up to a point by the usually dependable Kevin Hart and Regina Hall whose characters' tumultuous relationship is offered as contrast all for naught. The original film was no masterpiece but at least it wasn't as pointless as this exercise in futility.

"Sincere account of the Allied effort during World War II to recover artworks stolen by the Nazis that ultimately fails to resonate.  Director George Clooney has the minute details of this footnote in history down pat but the film falls flat because the script that he collaborated on with Grant Heslov doesn't fully flesh out the characters.  This omission reverberates  when you consider the array of talent (Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, et al.) Clooney had  at his disposal.  It doesn't quite negate but hinders in a way the message of the importance of preserving humanity's artistic achievements that Clooney is trying to convey. I was genuinely moved by the film's closing scene of a grandfather admiring the recovered artwork with his grandson in tow some thirty years after the events portrayed in the film. The film needed more moments like that.  I can also appreciate the earnest effort that was put into this project but would recommend it at best as a dry history lesson.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PXQPU24RAPJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DL48BM6#wasThisHelpful","R3PXQPU24RAPJY","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's interesting that a lot of reviews compare this film to ""Birdman"". It's probably because both films center on the theatre and have ambiguous endings though there aren't as many flights of fancy on display here.  If nothing else see this film for Al Pacino's masterful performance as Simon Axler, a once renowned actor who is losing his feel for performing and is contemplates suicide. After a stint at a mental institution he reconnects with Pegeen (Greta Gerwig), a thirtysomething lesbian who's burned the torch for Simon since she was a child.  Simon's relationship with Pegeen reinvigorates him but it comes at a cost.  Pegeen proves to be a selfish manipulative parasite who causes Simon more anxiety and complications than his fragile psyche can handle. On top of that Simon has to deal with Pegeen's disapproving parents and former lovers.  This is a carefully calibrated turn by Pacino of a man on the verge of emotional meltdown and he wisely dials it down.  Pacino could have howled at the moon as he was prone to do in previous roles but allows his raspy voice, age lined face and mournful eyes do the talking for him.  Gerwig is equally fine making a potentially obnoxious character not only palatable but somewhat endearing.  Good supporting cast but I'd give a special shout out to Nina Arianda as a woman who hilariously tries to contract Simon to kill her husband.  Last year Arianda distinguished herself in the relatively obscure ""Rob the Mob"" so here's hoping Hollywood is taking notice.  Director Barry Levinson expertly juggles the comedic and dramatic elements of the film based on a Philip Roth novel. Octogenarian Buck Henry co-wrote an acidly wicked script fifty years after he helped create ""Get Smart"" with Mel Brooks and contributed to ""The Graduate"" screenplay.  Which leads me to the question as to when they are going to issue on DVD Milos Forman's first American film ""Taking Off"" starring Henry.  I don't know if you can categorize any endeavor of Al Pacino's as a small film but ""The Humbling"" is an exceptional undertaking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39NDZYGJ2VQC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1JQ2EA#wasThisHelpful","R39NDZYGJ2VQC2","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lethargic account of the affair between Hollywood swashbuckling leading man Errol Flynn (Kevin Kline) and underage chorus girl Beverly Aadland (Dakota Fanning) never gains traction.  The culprits would be lackluster script and direction and a woefully miscast Fanning who never develops chemistry with Kline.  Kline and Susan Sarandon as Aadland's enabling stage mother are quite good but can't compensate for the film's shortcomings. A lot of reviewers take issue with Fanning being too old for the part but both Kline and Sarandon are close to seventy.  Last year Sarandon played Melissa McCarthy's grandmother in ""Tammy"".  It's like an episode of ""E! Hollywood True Story"" without the panache.  Universal partnered with the Lifetime Network for this flick and it shows. Not a bad film but glaringly bland and mediocre.  Made me long for ""My Favorite Year"", a 1982 film where Peter O'Toole played an Errol Flynn type actor trying to make a comeback by appearing on a TV variety show.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KIRB33Y12NYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5AGSHG#wasThisHelpful","R1KIRB33Y12NYW","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They've promoted this film as ""Mary Poppins"" meets ""Death Wish"".  The reality is that there are only three victims as a result of Miss Meadows' marksmanship and they were all vile predators.  The film isn't particularly gory either.  You could probably get a PG-13 rating if not for one particularly exuberant lovemaking sequence.  Ironic isn't it?  The filmmakers afford Miss Meadows with a backstory that includes childhood trauma reminiscent of a certain caped crusader.  Katie Holmes is ideal in the title role expertly demonstrating the gray areas of her well scrubbed girl-next-door persona.  She seems to be channeling the dark angst that she experienced while being married to Tom Cruise.

"Though Terence Malick's name is connected to this film it is definitely fledgling director A.J. Edwards' show.  Malick's influence is apparent but Edwards demonstrates enough unique flourishes to distinguish this work as his own.  Described by some as an art film I would characterize it as an exercise in artistry.  An art film connotes that watching this film is akin to viewing a museum piece which Edwards' film certainly is not.  The film is brimming with life appropriate to its early nineteenth century rustic setting.  Technically the film is a marvel with luxurious black-and-white cinematography, crisp editing, and evocative sound design giving you the you-are-there effect.  The beauty of the film is its technical proficiency doesn't overwhelm the actors who are uniformly excellent.  Though the adult performances (Jason Clarke, Diane Kruger, Brit Marling, Wes Bentley) are terrific the focal point of the film is young Braydon Denney as Abraham Lincoln.  Denney exhibits strength and stoicism in a turn that belies his tender years.  It's not only possible but plausible that this boy would grow up to be the  Great Emancipator.  If I were to quibble it would be that some of the characters speak of young Abe in messianic tones usually under hushed breath.  Some may fault the film as taking liberties with history but accounts of Lincoln's early life are somewhat speculative.  I think what is paramount is the essence be captured and niggle about the details later.  I'm glad this film was made and hope a wider audience gets a chance to see it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22GH2IKWB6H9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYZFNZG#wasThisHelpful","R22GH2IKWB6H9Q","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They must have written this script forty years ago and kept it in mothballs until Bill Murray was old enough to play Vincent McKenna because this character fits the sly old Irish dog like a well worn suit.  I went into this film with a few misconceptions firstly that this was a comedy.  Yes there are sporadic jokes and the occasional funny bit but this film for the most part is poignantly dramatic.  The scenes of Vincent with his wife who has early stage Alzheimer's disease in the convalescent home will break your heart.  Secondly, curmudgeonly Vincent is a creature of habit who doesn't change his spots rather it's those around him who are effected by his presence.  Terrific ensemble the best being Naomi Watts as a brassy pregnant Russian hooker and young Jaeden Lieberher as the shy youngster Vincent takes under his wing for better or for worse.  I usually damn with faint praise juvenile actors by stating that they are unaffected and natural but Lieberher gives an admirable turn reminiscent of a young Haley Joel Osment  and more than holds his own with Murray.  This film satisfies from first frame until last.  If you don't believe me consider the closing credits where Murray lays in a beach chair lip synching Bob Dylan's ""Shelter From the Storm"".  In lesser hands this would be the equivalent of reading the telephone book but Murray is brilliant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ORGHCUTOLL7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1WGHLI#wasThisHelpful","R2ORGHCUTOLL7U","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been an ardent film buff virtually my entire life.  Few times have I  said to myself after leaving the theatre that this is something special that this pushes the envelope of what is possible and impossible in making a film.  A few that come to mind are Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"", Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"", and Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"".  I'm not sure if repeat viewings will bear me out but Alejandro G. Inarritu's film may join this esteemed company.  It is rare that a film achieves maximum impact on all cylinders like ""Birdman"" does.  This flick nails it in all attributes from the technical side to the acting.  The two things that impressed me the most were the camerawork of Emmanuel Lubezki and Michael Keaton's go-for-broke lead performance.  At first I thought the extended tracking shots were  mere gimmickry but after a while they became like a second character not unlike the stellar cinematography of Gregg Toland in ""Citizen Kane"".  Keaton's work here is mammoth.  His Riggan Thomson is a  movie star who walked away from a successful comic book franchise and is now looking for validation as an actor and a human being in a dramatic Broadway vehicle.  Opportunities abound to chew the scenery and Keaton goes over the top at times but dials it down when requisite.  It is a carefully honed portrait of a man at the crossroads and possibly crosshairs of life and Keaton imbues him with complexity and empathy.  I haven't seen Eddie Redmayne's work in ""The Theory of Everything"" but I would be hard pressed that it is better than Keaton's work here.  The script is rich in detail giving shape to plot and characterization.  Film and theatre buffs will have a field day with all the inside jokes. Lastly one cannot overlook the film's terrific ensemble none better than Edward Norton's difficult actor and Emma Stone as Keaton's just-out-of-rehab daughter.  In lesser hands these characters would be clich√© but Norton and Stone bring dimension to the parts.  ""Birdman"" is a great film and will be heralded for its inventiveness and originality for years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REKE0QUTFD8ZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RO49JC0#wasThisHelpful","REKE0QUTFD8ZU","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In her Eighties heyday Kathleen Turner ruled the roost with terrific movies like ""Body Heat"", ""Romancing the Stone"", ""Prizzi's Honor"", and ""The War of the Roses"".  Subsequent years were not so kind to our heroine reaching its nadir with ""Baby Geniuses"" in 1999.  Two time Golden Globe winner (""The Truman Show"", ""Man on the Moon"") Jim Carrey has been riding high of late with flicks like ""Yes Men"", ""Mr. Popper's Penguins"", and ""I Love You, Phillip Morris"".  No swelled head on our Jimbo and when it was time to restart the ""Dumb and Dumber"" franchise he called on his old ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" co-star to join in the fun and add a little gusto to the proceedings.  Jeff Daniels?  Yeah, right!  If it wasn't for Carrey carrying his sorry behind in the first film he'd go the way of Julia Ormond or strumming Jethro Tull covers for spare change in Times Square.

"""Ida"" departs from most  post-Holocaust films in that it tackles both the twin evils of Nazism and Stalinism in Poland.  The year is 1962 and in its wake are the scorched earth left by the Third Reich and a picture of a deceptively benevolent Nikita Khrushchev adorning a bare wall.  Eighteen year-old Anna (Agata Trzebuchowska) is on the verge of making her final vows in becoming a nun.  She receives a visit from Wanda (Agata Kulesza), an aunt she's never met and a former fearsome Communist Party prosecutor now a prominent judge.  Wanda tells Anna bluntly her real name is Ida and that she is a Jew.  Wanda's intentions for Ida is for both of them to locate the remains of family members who perished during the war and give them a proper burial.  Wanda, a self loathing cynic, hopes to gain some semblance of closure while Ida goes along in hopes of receiving answers to the direction her life should take.  Alas, there's no easy way out as the women find out and their past is doomed to define their futures.  On the surface director Pawel Pawlikowski's film would seem slight filmed in stark black-and-white populated with few characters containing sparse dialogue and coming in at an economical eighty minutes but it's because of its simplicity that it achieves resonance.

"Provocative film about the role of faith and religion in modern society.  The film opens with Father James (Brendan Gleeson)  listening in the confessional to a man who was raped as a small child by a Catholic priest.  The man continues by saying that he will kill Father James in a week's time not because he is a bad priest rather by murdering a good priest the message he is attempting to send society will have greater impact.  Father James' reaction is to maintain a cool head and tend to the needs of his flock and do they ever need tending to.  You couldn't find more dysfunction on ""The Jerry Springer Show"".  This does not deter Father James however because as he sees it Christ served most those whom society deemed most unfit.  ""Calvary"" is an interesting if imperfect film that casts the mirror on both the clergy and its congregants.  The small Irish coastal village depicted in the film serves as a microcosm of the Church as it stands today defined by both clergy and parishioners.  Gleeson's world weary yet doggedly determined take on the modern priest is mesmerizing. Father James is pious but doesn't blanch at profanity or flawed character and isn't opposed to the occasional pint.  If I would fault the film there were moments that teetered on dark comedy that may have been purely intentional if you've seen director John Michael McDonagh and Gleeson's previous collaboration, ""The Guard"", but not always successful and at times the peripheral characters bordered on caricature. I wouldn't call this film heavy handed but the Christ allegory is hard to escape.  Regardless, a thoughtful film that raises a lot of questions that compel the audience to take stock of their convictions.  It should be noted that some of the dialogue on display is quite graphic and there is a depiction of violence that may give pause to the squeamish.  I should also note that I'm a practicing Catholic who's navigated the sex abuse scandals and found the portrayal of my chosen faith to be authentic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28YUKVKP2L1SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MM7VCD8#wasThisHelpful","R28YUKVKP2L1SE","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A chilly Valentine's Day in Philly and myself and my princess bride are housebound.  I have a collection of unwatched discs in virtually every genre and the missus wanted something appropriately romantic for the occasion.  She didn't want to watch anything maudlin like ""The Fault In Our Stars"" or ""If I Stay"" nor did she want to watch anything smutty akin to ""50 Shades of Grey"".  I didn't want to watch some saccharine Nicholas Sparks adaptation either.  ""The Princess Bride?""  I fancy myself a film buff but I had never seen this nearly thirty year old chestnut.  It more than filled the bill.  The success of this film lies in the fact that director Rob Reiner and scenarist William Goldman have an affinity for the mythology of the fairytale.  This is not a spoof or tongue-in-cheek enterprise save for a cameo by Billy Crystal but a gosh honest fairytale with all the conventions intact.  The damsels are beautiful, the heroes dashing, the villains nefarious and everybody lives happily ever after. The film is impeccably cast from the leads (Robin Wright, Cary Elwes) to the support (Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andre the Giant, et al.).  Nice framing device of having a modern day grandfather (Peter Falk) relating the story to his grandson (Fred Savage). A testament to the effect this film holds on audiences is it remains a top seller moving more units than recent films that were wide released.  Devoid of any pretensions this is flat out superb moviemaking.

"This is a tale of two movies.  The success or failure of the enterprise falls squarely on the shoulders of young Ellar Coltrane, the youngster tapped by writer-director Richard Linklater to be the film's focal point.  In the early scenes Coltrane is reasonably appealing and naturally unaffected.  The most compelling segment involves his mother's marriage to an abusive alcoholic college professor.  It's when we enter the turbulent teens that the film encounters troubled waters.  During those formative years Coltrane seems stiff and conscious that the camera is running.  More screen time is devoted to his character and he seems ill-at-ease.  It is this uneasiness that makes Coltrane's character seem less appealing. Fortunately the acting chops of the seasoned pros (Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke) compensate for their green star.  On the reverse Linklater's daughter Lorelei playing Coltrane's older sister is a model of consistency.  Her character progresses smoothly through childhood and young adulthood and remains appealing throughout.  Without being accused of nepotism Linklater should have looked at the dailies and centered the film on Lorelei's character.  In retrospect ""Girlhood"" wouldn't have seemed like a bad idea.  This film has received a lot of accolades and more than likely will win Best Picture at the Oscars this year.  This has more to do with aesthetics than artistry.  It's commendable that Linklater attempted to advance the medium but the end result is a mixed bag.  I was reminded of Michael Apted's ""Up"" films which were much more successful mining similar material in a documentary vein than Linklater's fictional film is.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QCRNNZXQB1MJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MEQUNZ0#wasThisHelpful","R3QCRNNZXQB1MJ","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I groaned when I heard the premise of this film.  Hotshot lawyer (Robert Downey, Jr.) defends estranged small town judge father (Robert Duvall) on a murder rap.  Watching this film it is much more than a routine courtroom drama.  Even the final verdict is ambiguous.  The film's main concern is the schism between father and son and the long hard road in mending fences and letting bygones be bygones.  The film begins with Downey's Hank Palmer getting word that his mother passed in the middle of one of his big money trials.  Justice is of little concern to Hank as long as he clients get off and he has another big payday.  For Duvall's Joseph Palmer the law is unambiguous and  integrity to the letter of the law is paramount.  He would rather be found guilty than violate the Founding Fathers' intent.  There's a lot of emotional tug-of-war between Hank and Joseph before a stalemate between the two is achieved.  Needless to say the performances of both Downey and Duvall are superlative.  Duvall, a national treasure,  illuminates the screen by totally immersing himself into character.  He gives Joseph dimension and you end up rooting for his character even if you're not certain of guilt or innocence.  Never better Downey wisely defers to Duvall but is not without his own moments to shine.  We witness Hank evolving through the course of the film in believable fashion from smug attorney to dutiful son.  The film derives its power from its humanism and is definitely one of the better offerings from last year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39HA2EZ2CRV5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OD37U7Q#wasThisHelpful","R39HA2EZ2CRV5S","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film seems to draw its influence from Quentin Tarantino, Sergio Leone, and John Woo.  Like those auteurs of stylized gunplay the violence is leavened by a hearty dollop of dark humor.  It felt darkly comic not unlike ""Kill Bill"" or ""Hobo with a Shotgun"".  If that weren't the case then this could easily be a dismissible empty exercise of gratuitous mayhem instead of a reasonably inspired shoot 'em up.  Keanu Reeves channels Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name as John Wick dispatching baddies with the efficiency of a killing machine and the requisite minimum of emotion.  Let me qualify that by saying the least amount of emotion you can exhibit if you are avenging the death of a puppy your recently deceased wife gave you. Michael Nyqvist makes for a particularly delicious adversary. Good bits by Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, and Willem Dafoe.  I particularly liked Clarke Peters' droll hotel desk clerk.  The narrative is a little thin but at an economical 101 minutes the flick breezes by at a nice clip.  I wouldn't describe this film as an action classic but it serves its purpose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27OKESHKEREFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV3VG96#wasThisHelpful","R27OKESHKEREFK","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film is reminiscent of the weepies of yore and not in the negative sense.  This account of an absentee dad (Jon Voight) forced to become more involved in his kids' lives once tragedy strikes is poignant and deeply emotional.  As demonstrated in prior films like ""Conrack"" and ""The Champ"" Voight shows himself adept at working with children and the bond that develops between he and the kids as the film progresses seems natural and genuine.  There are hints that the film may evolve into a custody battle between Voight and their stepfather (Richard Crenna) but  neither side is vilified and the resolution is very humane. When this film came out in 1983 it was generally dismissed by cynical mainstream critics but time has caught up with this film and there's no shame today in wiping back a tear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KJXJR2IINKYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007TKHH0#wasThisHelpful","R2KJXJR2IINKYX","A2B73CL3QSYWLB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2B73CL3QSYWLB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In our busy household, USB chargers seem to be at a premium. Especially since the likes of Apple, Amazon, etc., seem to only think people need a USB cable these days and want you to spend another $20 on a simple plug. This ""shortage"" has led to my wife and kids poaching my charging station, moving chargers around, etc. Of course, that leads to the inevitable lost charger and the ""I don't know where it went... wasn't me..."" spiel.Given the above situation, the GE In Wall Outlet with 2 USB ports was exactly what we needed! We have an outlet in our kitchen that is the popular plug-in spot, but this often resulted in someone unplugging someone else's device so they can use a different type of cable (lightning, mini-USB, 40-pin Apple, etc.), which then led to arguments. Such is life with kids. That location was perfect for this outlet, as we only plug in one thing there (besides chargers), which is a phone.On the whole, assuming you have modern wiring (my house was built in 2006), the installation was quite simple. In my case it involved a bit of extra work, as the outlet I wanted to use was a GFI. After confirming I could move the GFI outlet to another location on the circuit (which happened to be the other side of the kitchen counter), it just required some basic outlet swapping and a few tools (a multi-purpose screwdriver and needle nose pliers for straightening out and trimming wires). In total, it was about a 20 minute job, and was not difficult at all. Having the two 2.1a charging ports is very handy, and looks much nicer than oddball USB chargers.My only complaint is that the 'wall wart' of our cordless phone, which we plug in to that outlet, blocks the lower USB port when it is plugged in. So we have to unplug that if we want to use both USB ports, but since it doesn't keep the phone from working that hasn't been an issue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUJ2CXIWJPBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGME60A#wasThisHelpful","R2FUJ2CXIWJPBI","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Kojo is a bit smaller and ""squattier"" than I expected, but appears fairly lifelike in appearance from a distance. It is constructed from a nylon-like ""pop-out"" fabric that should hold up fine in weather. My primary intent is to use the Kojo as a decoy for coyote hunting purposes, but I've not been able to do that at this time (currently not in season). However, I have found articles online that used this decoy with success. In the interim I'll likely stick it in the garden and see if it keeps the rabbits and other critters at bay.

"We found these pull-ups to be of excellent quality and fairly true to size. My daughter is 30 months and weighs 33lbs. She is tall for her age (91 percentile), and the ""Pull-Ups NightTime Training Pants for Girls"" are for girls 2T-3T (up to 34 lbs). We have not had any issues with them leaking, but she will likely size out of them before she hits age 3.Of course, the nice thing about Pull-ups is that they work like underwear. So all of those ""false alarms"" where she tries to sit on the potty and does nothing are more convenient in terms of not trying to unfasten and refasten a diaper. But unlike pull-ups we've used before where once the side is torn, it's trash, these are nice in that they can be refastened, if desired. The only thing we have found is that the ""night time"" feature (glow in the dark elements) is really not all that important... she doesn't see them under her gown and blankets.We have actually used these more during the day time. The 'zoned protection' for girls and the designs that fade when wet make those times when you're not quite sure if it has been wet or not much easier to check.But perhaps the biggest test is our daughter, who loves these so much she can often be found carrying one around (for reasons unknown to me). She loves the design, and the Pull-Ups make her feel like she's wearing underwear like her older siblings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R210CRIFZR4LXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TX1KITU#wasThisHelpful","R210CRIFZR4LXO","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please note: This item was provided by ZeroLemon for the purpose of review. However, this review is 100% my opinion and experience.The opportunity to review the ZeroLemon Apple MFI 2M Lighting Cable could not have come at a better time for me. My wife recently 'upgraded' to my old iPhone 5, and my son replaced his old iPod touch with a new version that has the Lightening port. Combined with my new iPhone 6, cables can sometimes disappear around our house.What I needed was a cable to keep in my truck. I considered purchasing the $20 'Official' cable from Apple, which I will use for comparison purposes in this review (since that's what comes with the phone). Despite all of Apple's design prowess, that cable has several shortcomings. First, it's white. When a white cable is stretched across your dash, it screams ""hey everyone, I have a iPhone, please break into my truck and see if you can find it!"" Second, the 'official' cable (in this price range) is only 3.25' long. Unfortunately, that is NOT long enough to stretch from my center console to my dash, or use comfortably while the cord is plugged in. Third, it's white. Did I mention that? Well, when you work outside a lot, you sometimes get dirty hands. White cables do not look so great after being handled with dirty hands. Finally, the official cable is weak, with short plastic connectors.The cable I received from ZeroLemon was the 6.6ft (2M) ‚ÄúRugged Black Nylon‚Äù. When I selected it I was not sure what to expect, since the picture makes the cable look at bit 'plastic'. Also, I was afraid the cable ends would just be a thin metal. Not to over-state the value of a phone cable, but my skepticism was pointless -- THIS is what I've needed in my truck for a long time! First, the cable is a braided black nylon fabric. I'm sure there are normal wires underneath, but the nylon outer casing shields it well and is easy to handle. It has stiffened a bit in the super-cold weather, but is not unmanageable and has not caused any issues with tangling. It easily reaches my dash with the excess curled up in my console, and does not 'stand out' when its just laying there. The aluminum 'crushproof' connectors caps are indeed a sturdy metal, and provide ample area to grasp for connecting and disconnecting. I had no problem using the Lightening end with my Speck CandyShell Grip  case. Finally, I have had NO issues with this cable charging the aforementioned devices OR my iPad Air II, and have had no issues with the cable coming unplugged. This is why the ""MFi"" certification is important, which refers to Apple's licensing program.For a cable that currently costs the same amount as Apple's official cable, the ZeroLemon cable simply beats it at all aspects of the game. So while you aren't saving any money, you are getting a whole lot more value for it. Add ZeroLemon's 30 day money back 'no questions asked' refund policy and 2-year 'zero defect guarantee' warranty, and you simply cannot go wrong with this purchase. I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUV1YU2CD7F83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NABGIXO#wasThisHelpful","RUV1YU2CD7F83","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pioneer Elite... has to be awesome, right? After all, to be elite means you are 'above all others'... that you stand out from the crowd. In general, I'm underwhelmed. Not that it's bad - it's just not that significantly better than the Yamaha receiver I have, which in itself was a mid-line receiver.Personally, I feel like electronics these days are trying too hard to see how many logos they can apply to their boxes. I don't personally use Pandora, but the Internet radio features are nice. This receiver actually had a lot of features I just don't need or for which I'm simply not ready -- for example, the dual subwoofer pre-outs, 4k compatibility, or 2-zone output. I do not need the Roku compatibility, as I use a Tivo. I happen to have a 5-1 speaker configuration, so really do not need the 7.2 support. Perhaps someday... :) The Bluetooth functionality is somewhat misleading... I thought maybe I could use this in my living room with satellite speakers, but it turns out I'd have to purchase an adapter.On the plus side, the 140w per channel is nice, as are the 6 HDMI ports. I also appreciate the Apple Air-play functionality, though I have that with my Yamaha receiver, as well. The sound was good, and the setup was fairy easy.In general, I give the VSX-44 4 stars. Feature-wise, it competes well in this price range. But for carrying the Pioneer 'Elite' badging, I just don't get the sense that it stands out so much my friends & will be impressed or that sound is massively improved over my mid-level Yamaha. The controller could be arranged a little better, and the on-screen menu could be a little better, though most receivers are somewhat lousy in that department. I would certainly recommend this if you need a budget-friendly 7.2 receiver that's 4k compatible, but don't be fooled by the name.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG5VIZVMXHITH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIQ3HM8#wasThisHelpful","RG5VIZVMXHITH","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were tired of shucking our vacuum cleaner up and down the stairs, and needed something a bit lighter than the Sears Kenmore Buick that we had been using. We had another Hoover Windtunnel vacuum for our basement, which we liked, so this looked to be a promising option.Of the features included we really do not use the brushless bare-floor option often, opting instead to use a stick vac (okay, it's starting to sound like we have a lot of vacuum cleaners!). However, it's a nice option to have. I can't really say if the ""Windtunnel 3"" technology picks up that much more dirt, but it does seem to fill up quickly. The HEPA media is nice in that it does seem to filter the finer dust and keep it from re-entering the room, but it does get really dirty over time. It's fairly easy to clean if you just rinse it out periodically, but I wish the vacuum shipped with an extra so you could keep on using the cleaner while one filter dries. Of the included tools, the crevice tool is handy. I wish the bristles were a bit longer and softer on the dusting brush, and the 'Turbo tool' works OK for cleaning the couch, but otherwise does not have much use. Perhaps my favorite feature is the auto-rewind and cord storage. Our other cleaner has a couple of hooks that you have to wind the cord around, which is a real pain (iit rarely gets done right). So being able to just step on a pedal and have the cord wind up out of the way is nice.If you ask around or research online, you'll find a lot of opinions, facts, fiction, etc. about bagless vacs. I don't know if they are all true, but it feels more convenient and just as easy to empty. They can be a bit dirtier to empty, but I like the convenience of not having to buy bags and can easily see when it needs emptied. Overall, this is a nice vacuum cleaner. It has some helpful features and has held up well under several months of intense use in our four-family household. I am removing a single star for the somewhat underwhelming tools and the way the HEPA filter can clog up over time, but I still highly recommend this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R363OXSN2ZJM2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EEJUH56#wasThisHelpful","R363OXSN2ZJM2A","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a former football player (I didn't make it very far), current coach, and father of a football player, I really looked forward to reading this book. In the wake of concussion-related press and whether football is ""worth it"", I thought perhaps I would find some good rhetoric relative to the game I love. While I do not personally feel the need to defend the game of football, there are others who are certainly looking for answers as to why they should let their children play.On the whole, I believe Edmundson achieves this through his eloquent re-telling of his personal experiences and reflection of what impact those experiences had upon his own life. Some of his stories carried similarities to my own experiences, and provided unique insight into how they might have really shaped the adult I am today. Other stories were perhaps a bit ""dated"", so the parallel might have been a bit off from my own experiences. Certainly Mr. Edmundson grew up during a unique period of American history, and played the sport during a period in which it, too, was 'growing up'. Some of the things coaches and others said and did during those times would simply not be acceptable today.As you read through the book, each chapter generally (or at times loosely) addresses one bigger idea; Character, Courage, Losing, Patriotism, Faith,  Manliness, and Loyalty. Some chapters do a better job at this than others. For example, the chapter on 'Manliness' may as well have been titled 'Racism in the 60s'. The final chapter, where Professor Edmundson discusses his son, may has well have been called 'How Awesome My Son Was in Peewee Football' or ""How I Rubbed Elbows With Howie Long"".Perhaps one of the biggest shortcomings of this book, I believe, is in defining the intended audience. Throughout the book, Edmundson regularly recites passages from authors, philosophers, and thinkers. Frequent references are made to Greek mythology and classical literature. As someone who has a degree in English and education, and who has taken several courses in philosophy, I am familiar with many of the authors. I could appreciate the references, despite the feeling that they were a bit long-winded at times. But the real truth is that I felt some of those references slowed the book down. If I had no background with such content, I could see it being perceived as a bit high-brow and overly academic.In the end, if you are expecting 'Friday Night Lights' or 'Our Boys: A Perfect Season', this is not that kind of book. This is more of a psychological investigation into what the author gained (and lost) from his experience with football. I also feel like it served to provide the author some personal 'closure' on his own time with the game, since he can no longer play and his son is out of the game, as well. Since the book is largely based on the author's own personal experiences, the truth is that you may only find some relation to the content. The rest will be defined by your own personal experience with the game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N9RASINSAN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205752#wasThisHelpful","R3N9RASINSAN0","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We wanted to like this product. It seemed like the perfect solution to a problem. Chiefly, what to do when we're ""out and about"" and need a place for the little one to go? There are all kinds of nasty places out there - gas stations, some restaurants, or lord forbid the outhouse at a park! We had an ancient little potty we kept in the van, but it was pretty ""yuck"" after previous years of use.So while we thought it would really fit a niche requirement, we ran into a few problems or concerns...Foremost, my wife is a pseudo-germaphobe. I am too, to an extent, but not as much. But the thought of placing this potty seat on a public toilet (especially a nasty one) and then taking it with you? Makes you wanna throw up a little bit, right? I mean, you can Lysol bomb it, but then what? Put it in the dish washer or something (more puke)?! Or soak it in a tub of boiling hot bleach water? I don't care that it has a travel bag... I would almost prefer to teach the squat and hover technique.Second is the concept of ""doing business"" into a bag. Hoo boy you'd better hope that thing doesn't spring a leak! I mean, I know you generally aren't taking the ""doggie bag"" with you, unless your intent is to stash the seat in the car for those long road trips when the little one suddenly has to pee (or worse) when, as it usually goes, you're in the middle of no-wheresville USA. But THEN you've gotta pack that bag with you. A bag. Full of pee, or other business... in the car. Certainly it's not something you can (or should) just leave on the side of the road (or the Walmart parking lot - you people know who you are!).In terms of using it as a seat topper, we found this slid around a bit on a regular toilet seat. Like Gap jeans, maybe it just fits some seats better than others. But it's definitely a little concerning. PLEASE check it out before hurriedly plopping your tot on the seat. If it's loose and slides, you could end up scarring the poor child for life. Who wants to go through life afraid of the toilet?!Finally is the question of size. Our little girl is pretty tall for a 2-year old. By the time she hits her potty sitting stride (don't judge - we're working on it!), I really do believe she'll be too tall to use this seat on its fold-out legs. She'll be sitting there with her knees cranked up to her chest like an adult in an elementary school bathroom.So overall, I give this seat 3 stars, because... it's Okay. It's not groundbreaking, but it could come in handy. We'll tuck it into the van for camping trips or trips to the beach where we may have no other option. Perhaps it'll come in handy there. If it does and we have a revelation, I'll revise this review accordingly. Until then... sit tight. ;)","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AX5K4I6UQ7DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFJICEO#wasThisHelpful","R1AX5K4I6UQ7DG","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When my wife and I got married, we registered for (and received) a really fancy/expensive cookware set. It was shiny and not Teflon-coated. It looked really awesome. I imagine if we had hung it from a rack and never used it, it would still look awesome. But the truth is that it quickly became scuffed up from use, and is hard to cook on (as a novice) without sticking, etc. We found ourselves buying supplemental skillets and pots to ""fill the void"" of what our expensive set just wasn't right for.So let's be honest... if you're a professional chef or 'foodie', you're likely not looking for a sub-$100 cookware set. So I don't see any need for comparisons here. But if you are someone who is looking for an ""every day"" cookware set, or a decent quality ""starter"" set, this is a great place to start! The T-fal C912SE74 ""Excite"" set boasts several convenient features:- Nonstick: It generally is. Cooking bacon and eggs, I did not have any issues with the bacon. Eggs clung a little bit, but I likely had the pan too hot.- Dishwasher Safe: So far, this cookware has gone into and come out of the dishwasher clean and without any issues- Oven Safe: This is a bit of a misnomer. The instructions actually advise NOT to use it in the oven (it's not bakeware), but as long as you do and the oven is lower than 350∞, I guess you'll be OK. So not for cooking, but if you wanted to slide a skillet into a warm (NOT hot) oven to keep the contents warm, it should be OK.- PFOA Free: 'PFOA' is ""perfluorooctanoic acid"". It is a toxicant and carcinogen in animals. If you are using Teflon (PTFE) cookware, you should definitely ensure it is PFOA free. You do NOT want to eat this stuff.- Thermo-Spot heat indicator: This works OK, but as this is aluminum cookware, it heats very fast. It is easy to OVER heat, so be careful as you may want to cook at a lower temperature. But I found the ""spread"" of the heat to be very even when cooking, which is good. I think the grooves and design on the bottom help with this. Another note on letting this cookware get too hot is that aluminum can be vulnerable to warping if you are not careful and let it get too hot for too long, so that's another reason to keep the temperatures down a bit.Overall, we found the red color to be very attractive in our kitchen. It's nice to see several color options to accommodate everyone's tastes. The pots and pans were light-weight and easy to handle, with the handles easily putting your hands out of harm's way. The glass lids were nice to see your food while cooking, and the big knobs made them easy to remove, though perhaps a bit tricky to store.About the only complaint I have with this cookware set is the somewhat misleading claim that it's a ""14-Piece"" set. It came with four measuring spoons, which to me is really just one thing. Other photos show spoons and flippers that are safe for Teflon pans, which to me would have been much better to include. The measuring spoons are almost kind of a joke that allow them to call it a 14-piece set, but since I don't COOK with measuring spoons, it's really a 10pc set. If you are buying this type of cookware for the first time, be aware that you do NOT want to use metal utensils on it or it will potentially damage the Teflon surface.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R168K4OZ5047X0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGPAGK4#wasThisHelpful","R168K4OZ5047X0","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These 'Bird B Gone' Enviro-Spike Bird Spikes are the real deal! Time after time our kids were going out to play, only to come in and ask us to clean the bird poop off their swing set. And once we caught our daughter trying to clean it on her own. You know how those things go. It was disgusting and unsanitary, and was making a real mess of the swing set. Nothing like dropping $1500 on a swing set only to have the kids NOT want to use it!The 10-Feet length (in 2' sections) was perfect for my purposes. It took me 3 full sections and half of another. The staggered screw holes worked great since the top ""beam"" was really two 2x6's bolted together. I bought some 1.25"" coated deck screws so they wouldn't rust and screwed them on. The final section required me to just use about 1', so I had to cut a little off each end so I'd have screw holes. I tried using tin-snips, which was kind of an exercise in futility. How can something cut metal but not plastic? I should have tried a hacksaw or something, I guess, because it did not ""snap"" off easily. After jabbing myself in the hand a few times, I finally got it.Overall, it looks good. It took a little bit to get used to seeing the spikes, but it works so well. The spikes have held up to some pretty serious wind and even nickel-sized hail the other day. And nobody could be happier than my kids... well... except for me, the designated cleaner of said bird poo.Hooray for Bird B Gone - these things work!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OI58TIBASOJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZJ9FXE#wasThisHelpful","R3OI58TIBASOJB","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not one of those car-care nuts who spends hours polishing their vehicle. Sure, I'd like mine to LOOK like that, but I don't have the time. Besides, keeping a showroom sheen on a mini-van is kind of pointless. That said, we DO spend a lot of time on the road... driving to practices, events, visiting relatives, vacation, etc. You know, living life. A life that does not have much time for car maintenance, but also does not want its car to look like crud.Here's where Griot's Garage Bug and Smudge Remover comes in. Simply spray it on, do something else for a few minutes, then come back and clean it off. The bottle says 30 seconds, but more than that won't really hurt (ok, don't wait 3 days. Be reasonable). But seriously, once you come back and clean it off with a gentle sponge or microfiber cloth and a hose. Just like that, most of the bug guts, road tar, bubble gum, dried-up bird poo, etc., will be gone. It's not a miracle worker, so don't expect bird guts to disintegrate or pine tree sap to melt away. It's not hydrochloric acid.

Having recently spent money to convert my old 4-D mag lite to LED (which worked great), I doubted this would be as bright.Turns out, I was wrong. This light is VERY bright and has a nice hot spot in the center. The cast has a fairly tight center beam with a wide cast (the amount of light around the main beam). The throw of the beam - the distance - was more than sufficient. I was able to effectively light things that were easily 100-150 yards away. I like that this light has two modes - the full and nearly blinding 100 lumen mode, and an 18 lumen ""energy saver"" mode. The second mode was not effective for much more than looking for something you dropped in your vehicle, but it works well and would certainly be good to use in a tent or other situation where a lower light output is desired.In terms of build, I really liked the rubber head and tail cap, shock absorbers, and aluminum titanium construction. My old mag lite rattles and bumps around in my truck door - this light does not. It is a very sturdy and 'weighty' light that should take whatever abuse you throw at it. It also has a hexagon shaped bezel at the base of the head, which keeps it from rolling. That's very important to me and I was glad to see that feature!Honestly, at this price point, you can't go wrong. Due to the weight it may not be the best ""tactical"" flashlight, but it's all most people need. You can't go wrong here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YSOLOGJNMX2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009JCA280#wasThisHelpful","R1YSOLOGJNMX2R","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to keep this review simple... there are a lot of folks who will post read/write times, discussions of SSD lifecycles, etc. So let me just say that this drive is FAST. My computer, which is only a few years old and still very powerful, was freezing and crashing a lot. I followed the lifehacker articles on cloning your current drive to a SSD, and swapped out the 7200rpm hard drive with this SSD. I removed the old drive, installed this one, and my system booted right up. I DID have to make a few tweaks in the system config for it to know to boot from the SSD, so do your homework up front. But the lifehacker articles are great, and this drive will probably last you 10 years or better unless you are an extreme user (in which case you'll likely buy a new computer first). It's AMAZING how much better my system performs now and how much faster it boots and loads my profile on logon. THIS is how a computer is supposed to perform.

"When I wash my truck, I like to do it quickly. I do not like to let it begin to dry out, and I do not like using brushes or classic ""sponges"", which can pick up debris (like from the driveway) and seem to hang on to it. Another thing is having to constantly squeeze/wring out sponges or even the cloth-covered sponges.Enter the Zwipes Microfiber Wash Mitts. These are great! The microfiber ""pile"" is soft and safe for your car's finish. What I like to do is put one mitt on each hand, then washing in a swirling motion. I can cover a lot of ground quickly using both hands at once, and since they are mitts that slide over your hand, you don't have to keep wringing them out. Just dunk your hands in the soap bucket and go!Once finished with your car wash, simply toss the mitts and your towels in the washing machine. The ""Instantly restores your show car perfect finish"" might be a bit far-fetched, and these are large so they don't fit kids as well or those with small hands.

"This is a very nice combo for the ""do it yourself"" car washers. I often get frustrated because my F150 dries before I can get it sufficiently wiped down, leaving spots on my truck. The 'Dry Blade' comes in handy, especially on those large areas (hood, sides). That way you aren't trying to remove every drop of water by absorbing it with a towel. The blade is slick and, if you did a good job cleaning, should not cause any scratches. It also works well for window glass, which are often smeared by towels.The Pocketed Drying Towel is simply a large microfiber towel. For whatever reason, microfiber feels weird to me... like it wants to stick to me. But it still does a good job. Overall, microfiber is pretty absorbent and this towel is no exception. While some may complain about it being too large, it's large enough that you don't need 5 towels to get your car or truck dry. The 'pockets' are simply a nice convenience. You put one hand in each, then dry using a 'wipe on, wipe off' motion (see: ""Karate Kid""). It is lint-free, as the product promises. Once wrung out, the microfiber dries quickly. I recommend you wash it after each use, of course.Overall, these are a great addition to your car-care arsenal, and should last quite a while.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D6JG0V873FL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H72YG9U#wasThisHelpful","R2D6JG0V873FL8","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son is currently in his 6th year of baseball. One of my challenges in working with him has always been hitting and throwing practice. For throwing, I've always had to be on-hand. And while nothing replaces playing catch, I'm not always available. With hitting, it's just been difficult in our limited-sized back yard to hit much more than whiffle balls. We've always had to go somewhere else, then spend time chasing balls or picking up and re-hitting.Enter the SKLZ Quickster Baseball Combo Net system. This is really two great tools in one package. The quality of this item is typical of the SKLZ brand, and I was not disappointed. The system went together easily, and it is quite easy and fast to switch between the practice (hitting) net and the return (throwing) net. Once I got the hang of it, it also easily collapses for quick storage in our shed or travel to the ball field. I have no concerns about the durability, but would certainly recommend storing it indoors out of the weather. The combo system also includes a storage/travel bag and stakes to keep it from moving.The return/throwing net includes a 'pitchers simulation with strike zone target'. Honestly, my son is not a pitcher at this stage - he's still learning control. However, one of the best features is that the strike zone is adjustable (and removable). I moved it up a bit to use as a target, as if he were fielding and throwing to another player. This gives him an effective target to throw to when I'm not available. Be aware that this is NOT a ""pitchback"" net. While it is under tension and will roll the ball back (depending on how tall your grass is), it does not 'throw' it back. It just reduces the amount of chasing.The hitting practice net is durable and should last a long time. It is great for soft-tossing balls to him, or for him to hit off his tee and into the net. The netting holes are small enough to catch whiffle balls, while it is deep enough to capture hit balls and return them to the ground. This allows him to hit several balls in succession. And unlike some other hitting systems, it does not rely on a super-deep sock net that balls get all wound up in.The only things I would like to see improved on this system are perhaps better instructions on adjustment of the strike zone target, and perhaps some kind of colored 'zones' on the netting so players can see how/where they are hitting the ball. Also, SKLZ has many forms of ""Quickster"" systems available for sports such as baseball, golf, football, and soccer. Most of these fit the 7x7' frame. I would love to see the ability to buy additional nets (at a lower cost) to fix the system, instead of having to buy multiple frames.Hands down, this is a fantastic training tool for players of all ages. My son has improved already just from using the pitching target, and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NNX7NIY8WD3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXAFK9C#wasThisHelpful","R2NNX7NIY8WD3F","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was first introduced to using a roller at my company fitness center. I was having some muscle soreness and the trainer told me I needed to ""roll it out"". I was initially skeptical, and perhaps even more so after using the roller. It hurt like heck! While the ""hurt"" subsides over time (especially the more you do it), the trainer told me the fact that it hurt meant the muscle needed it. In a nutshell, the roller helps to improve circulation to damaged muscle tissue, which in turn helps the muscle recover. I have found the use of a roller especially helpful with my larger muscles such as hamstrings, quads, and back. It feels more effective than just regular stretching. The faster recovery time allows for a faster return to the activity, and thus more performance gain.Unfortunately, I did not have a foam roller at home. When I started to work from home full time, I missed having access to one following my workouts. So I was happy to try out the SKLZ TRAINERroller. While I was familiar with the use of a roller, the ""self guided"" cover is actually quite helpful, as it shows all the different ways one can use the roller including a few ways I had not thought of trying. There are 12 ""guided"" ways to use the roller that are outlined on the cover.Overall, this roller was comparable in size and firmness to those in my old fitness center, though the SKLZ roller was perhaps a few inches shorter. You WANT the roller to be firm, and this one is effectively so. My only real concern - and the reason for reduction of one star - is that the cover is about 1/2"" longer on one end than the foam core. Also the cover is just that - a cover. It is wrapped over the core and electronically welded. This does not inhibit the use of it, but it does move somewhat separately from the roller itself. I do wonder how this will hold up long term, but even if the cover were removed the core would still be usable. It would also look a bit neater had the cover fit a little better. But, I do appreciate that it's easily wiped down and you do not directly contact the absorbent/porous foam.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18RDNRYQ8Z9SB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A8DKTX2#wasThisHelpful","R18RDNRYQ8Z9SB","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Clorox Glass Wipes were an instant hit in our household. There are many times where using a spray cleaner simply isn't feasible or desirable. For example, if you wish to just wipe down your bathroom mirror, a spray requires you remove everything under it (such as toothbrushes, hair accessories, etc.). The Clorox wipes allowed an easy, streak and lint-free job without all the mess. The same applies to our kitchen window, which is above the dish drying rack. And I hate using spray cleaners in my truck, as the overspray gets all over the dash and towel lint is left behind on the windows (you can use newspaper to avoid lint, but I don't get the paper anymore so rarely have any). The Clorox wipes have been great in helping reduce the ""film"" that builds on auto glass (caused by plastics). In the home, these are great to have on hand when you receive unexpected company and just want to wipe down something quickly without trotting out cleaners and towels.

"These towels have been tested in our kitchen and we really like them. They remind me of the restaurant-quality towels my parents used to use in their ice cream store many years ago. The towels are very heavy-duty and should last a long time, but keep in mind they are for kitchen dishes - not for taking a bath. They are also very absorbent, which is good. For many years my wife and I have used ""flour sack"" towels for drying and light kitchen work. Those towels are a bit lighter weight and dry faster, but they do not soak up as much or come clean as easily. We do wish they were a bit larger (perhaps 18x30) as these can feel a little undersized at times, but overall they are a very nice product that should be in service in our kitchen for a long time! Thus far we have not experienced any significant shrinkage or unraveling.

"When I bought my computer a few years ago, I made every attempt to ""future proof"" it as much as possible. This included an i7 processor, HDMI video, 12Gb RAM, etc. I also ""added on"" two USB 3.0 ports, which was in its relative infancy at the time. What I did not realize or notice at the time was that the computer was short of USB 2.0 ports, and that one of the two 3.0 ports would be in the front. It actually has several USB2 ports, but they are in odd places (3 in back, 3 on top, one on front). Anyhow, fortunately, most things I use (keyboard, wireless mouse, iPhone, camera, etc.) still rely on USB 2, so I've been able to hold off for a while. And the USB 3 ports worked well -- one for my permanent backup drive, the other for my portable passport drive.This has continued to work well until recently, when I found myself not just needing more USB ports, but that most newer things are using USB 3.0. Enter the need for a USB 3.0 hub.As noted in the device specs, the ""AmazonBasics"" USB 3.0 4-Port Hub provides four downstream USB ports for ""plug-and-play connectivity"" to your USB 1.1 to 3.0 devices. And it's basically that simple -- plug it in, connect the hub to your USB 3.0 port, and now you have four instead of one. It is small enough to travel with, though the power adapter would be cumbersome if you needed to use it.There are a few things I would like to point out:- the reviews for this item cover 4 different items (4-port USB2, 4-port USB3, 7-port USB2, 7-port USB3). This review is for the 4-port USB 3.0 hub.- the hub I received has a brushed metal look, but it does NOT have a power indicator on the hub OR on the brick, which would have been nice.- the hub I received has a DC power option, which is important if you are plugging in several devices, but is not REQUIRED for low-power devices (keyboards, etc.). You mainly want to use this for devices that charge via USB (like phones, mp3 players, etc.)- the power ""brick"" is kind of odd/awkward. The plug is turned so that it would not cover up a 2-port outlet, but on my UPS device it prevents me from plugging it in without using an extension (otherwise it blocks other ports).- the Amazon ""frustration free"" packaging was appreciated, as always.Overall, this is a really nice hub. I would rate it 4-4.5 stars, subtracting for the odd power brick and the lack of anything to indicate it has power (such as a tiny led light). But I had no problems using it, and it has worked well for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NQCM7T8NH7KL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQFGH80#wasThisHelpful","R3NQCM7T8NH7KL","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After having thefts occur at numerous area farms, we were looking for a basic security recording system to help monitor our family's farm property. The Swann SWDVK-425554-US D1 Security Recording Kit certainly fits the bill. It has many positive features that we were looking for in a security system. Foremost, we don't want to have to ""mess around"" with it often. Thus, the ""set & forget"" continuous 4-channel recording for up to 15 days+ is a positive. Since we are monitoring outdoors, however, the motion detector feature is not really practical. Wind, horses, birds, etc. will all set it off, and there's (to me) always the fear of missing something.We are still working through the set-up on this, actually. We have to locate power to where we want to mount the base unit while still having plenty of distance to mount the cameras. Since each camera comes with a long cable, that should not be an issue based on our planning. However, we also want to make sure the base unit is also secure. What good is a security system if it can be stolen, as well? As such, we are considering building a lockable box. It won't be like putting it in an anchored/fireproof safe, but if we build a large box we can put a monitor in, as well, then close it up to protect from dust and moisture. Keeping that in mind, you WILL need a display for this, in some capacity. It does support VGA, so an older monitor should suffice.If you desire to use the Internet-based ""live viewing"", keep in mind you'll also need an internet connection. I've not gotten to the point of trying to configure this yet, as we do not have a network drop in our shop. As such, I'm hopeful I can use a wireless adapter. I just need time to work through it. It's a nice feature, but is likely to require some thought and configuration before I can use it. But it would be a VERY helpful feature to me for checking on the property and horses when travelling.So all this said, there are several things you should consider regarding this system. It is NOT just ""plug and play"":- You will need to plan the location of your cameras to record as many areas (or zones) as possible- You will need to carefully plan the location of the base unit to ensure your cameras all reach, as they are NOT wireless- You will need to install the cameras and run the wiring to the base unit. If you have an attic (vs. open rafters) this will be more difficult- You will need to ensure there is sufficient power at the location of your base unit- You will need to acquire a display for your unit, such as a computer monitor- You should plan to use a UPS device to protect the base from power surges while also recording during power outages.- You may wish to acquire an external hard drive for saving/transferring video for backup (to keep data for a longer period)Overall, this is a very nice unit and appears to be of good quality workmanship. As noted, it has many great features which will be helpful in keeping our farm secure. It is NOT an alarm system, but would actually be more helpful in catching a criminal who has made an attempt to steal something and has gotten away (it's hard to put an alarm on a gate). Just be aware of what you are getting, what you will need to provide, and what you will need to consider to set it up and you will find this to be a nice system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXFR1MN10ZVJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3E8ZEC#wasThisHelpful","RXFR1MN10ZVJJ","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's face it - painting is not a simple hobby to get started with. What kind of canvas? What kind of paint? What kind of brushes? If you're not ready to take classes and don't have a mentor or teacher, where do you get started?Enter the Aquarelle ""Watercolors Made Easy"" painting kit. The designs are attractive, and the process is simple. Think of it as ""color by numbers"", but without the numbers. The design lines are clearly defined, but are essentially ""invisible"" once the painting is completed. No, this will not look like a gallery piece worthy of the Metropolitan, but it is a great way to learn and enjoy the process of painting. The designs also do not completely restrict your imagination -- you can still exercise some judgment in your use of color.How easy is this? My 11 year old daughter thoroughly enjoyed painting one of the canvasses without any guidance. And the ""beach paradise"" scenes worked perfectly as a backdrop to her hermit crab tank!Overall, I give this product 4 stars. It would be nice if there were a little more paint (some of the colors were more ""full"" than others), and perhaps a canvas that was slightly more ""advanced"" to allow you experiment and branch out a bit further.

"I have previously review the HMDX JAM Plus speakers, and found the XT 'Extreme Wireless' speaker to be every bit the same quality. The sound that is generated by this little speaker is quite surprising, and is more than enough to fill the room. I also have a 'Bose Soundlink mini', and this speaker is nearly on-par for a fraction of the price. Although not having the same bass response, the sound is brighter and perhaps better for open areas.For me, however, the best feature of this speaker comes in the splash/drop/dirt proof rating! I board horses and spend a lot of time cleaning stalls and working outside. The fold-out carabineer Bluetooth range allows me to hang this little guy on a nail and whistle while I work, without having to worry about having my iPhone sitting out or dust and dirt getting into the speaker. This will also be a great little companion for our annual trips to the beach at Lake Michigan. The rechargeable battery should offer more than ample playback time for these occasions.Overall I highly recommend the HDMX Jam XT, or any of the HDMX line of speakers. I've tried the little pop-up speakers, and they simply can't hold a candle to the HMDX quality and sound.

"After years of having our old Liftmaster contractor-grade (chain-drive) opener rattle the house and groan like we were releasing the Kraken from the garage, I jumped at the chance to review the Chamberlain WD832KEV. Especially since our 1-year-old's bedroom is directly above our garage!This opener promises several things:*Ultra-quiet operation - I was skeptical of this, but indeed compared to our old opener, this opener is SIGNIFICANTLY quieter. In fact, the only real noise now comes from our door, itself, and NOT the opener. It no longer rattles and vibrates the whole floor, and certainly gives us more confidence in opening the door during our baby's nap and sleep hours. The 1/2 HP is more than sufficient to open our door.*Timer-to-Close feature - This is not something I use very often, as typically when I'm outside I want the door either open or closed. But it's nice to have this feature, and I found that it works well.*Light compatible with using compact fluorescents (CFLs) - This is important, as CFLs are replacing incandescent bulbs and would not work in my old opener. The motion-detection control panel is awesome and turns the lights on automatically (and off, later) when I enter the garage. That has been very helpful!*Uses less than 1 watt on standby power - Any energy-consumption is appreciated. I do not know how much 'standby power' my old opener used, but certainly this is good.*Lifetime warranty on motor and belt; 5 years for parts; 1 year for accessories - This is great, as my old opener only had a 1-year warranty!*Assembly required - This is VERY true. At first I wasn't sure everything was in the box, but it was. And the multi-piece rail had me concerned, since my old rail was one piece. I was also nervous about hanging the opener myself as I did not have help, so I paid a garage door company to hang it for me and adjust and lubricate my door. While the price they charged was a little high, it was worth it to have it done in a matter of a couple hours by trained professionals while also ensuring the door was properly adjusted. That said, I watched them and if you are handy and have help, you should be able to do this yourself.I also picked up the 'Chamberlain Universal Surge Protector' to ensure I had warranty protection and to protect the system board. I also purchased the 'Chamberlain CIGBU MYQ Internet Gateway', which perhaps is one of the best features of this door. The MyQ compatibility and Chamberlain app for my iPhone enables us to check the status of our door and open or close it from anywhere, which is fantastic (especially since my wife always thinks we left the door up). Expect to spend about $50-60 more for these features, as the opener does not include them. I found it money well-spent.The only issue I have had is with getting it to work with my Homelink buttons in our cars (2003 and 2006 models), but I've not put a lot of focus into getting that resolved. I suspect this has to do with the 'Security+ anti-burglary technology' (rolling code), so I may need to contact Homelink or obtain the special adapter. But that has only been a minor nuisance and by no means a detriment to the product, and the included openers have been fine. Since we will likely be in the market for a new car in the next year or two, I likely will not worry with it.Overall, this opener is really nice and I'm very pleased with it thus far. The Chamberlain brand has a solid reputation (unlike Genie) and this opener offers many great features at a relatively affordable price. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37RWD4HE0C2R4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APL6Q0W#wasThisHelpful","R37RWD4HE0C2R4","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used and reviewed multiple different cases for the iPhone 4 and 5, and to date this case is my absolute favorite. To be clear, I was provided this case for the purpose of this review. HOWEVER, I also own the black/slate gray version, which I purchased on my own and have been using for nearly a year. And while I have tried many new cases, as noted, I have continuously gone back to using the Speck CandyShell Grip case.In my personal opinion, this case has offered me the best mix of 'form and function'. It is very low profile, so I have not had to remove it from the case in order to use it with my dashboard mount or my arm band for running, as I have with many other cases. The raised, rubberized ""bezel"" around the face of the phone allows me to set the phone face down on a surface without it sliding or scratching, while the soft, rubberized interior helps protect the phone from impacts.This is not an ""all elements"" case for construction workers or great outdoorsmen, but it's pretty solid. It's also quite comfortable to use, with the textured rubber ""grips"" really allowing you to keep ahold of your phone. I've gone running several times with it in my hands and it has been comfortable to hold. I've had no issues plugging in my headphones and, although the speakers are protected by a bunch of small holes, have had no distortion with sound. The charging port opening has ample clearance and works well with the OEM lightening cable and the micro-usb adapter. I have not tried it with any docking stations or aftermarket cables, and I doubt that the 30-pin adapter would work, so please be aware of that.Initially I DID have some issues with my first Grip case, where the rubber grips strips on the back were ""peeling"" away from the case. Example of this can be seen in photographs from others. It happened on my first case after about 2 weeks, so I returned it and Speck replaced it (free of cost). Despite being careful, it then occurred on the second case after a month or so AND the small section above the charging port broke (a common weak spot on Speck cases). I used it like that for few months, then returned it. Speck again replaced it without question. HOWEVER, my third (black/gray) case AND the White/Black case I've received for review has NOT demonstrated this issue after several weeks to a month or more of using them. It feels to me like maybe the rubber is slightly stiffer than what I had on the previous versions.Generally speaking, I like a case that doesn't 'stand out' much. So at first I was not sure if I'd like the White/Black case. But after putting it on my black iPhone 5, it's actually kind of cool looking. I like to call it my ""iStormTrooper"" case, because it makes my phone look like a Storm Trooper. LOL! I've found the white case actually shows scratches less than my black case. I have had no issues using the flash with this case, either. Despite having both black and white cases, the white version has stayed on for now.There is actually ONE frustration point I have with this case: Although the covered volume buttons work great and the mute control is easy to access, the power/sleep/wake button is NOT as responsive. If I push straight done, nothing happens. I have to kind of ""push pull"" it toward me to get it to work. Both my black and white cases are like this, and it was NOT something I noticed with the previous two cases I had, which further leads me to believe something was altered a bit in the design. It almost feels like the button cover is out of alignment. But that has been a minor issue, and by no means reduces the appeal of this case.Overall I strongly recommend it and give it 4.5 stars, but with the reminder that it IS just a cell phone case and is not made of diamonds. It will scuff and get worn over time, as with anything you use daily and pull in and out of your pocket. In fact, I don't really recommend this case if you need to put it in your pocket a lot, because that will wear the grips faster. In that case, I'd look to a regular Speck CandyShell case. This case would also likely wear out a bit faster if you remove your phone often, so that's worth consideration as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ5H357SUWE1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0093IHXVE#wasThisHelpful","RJ5H357SUWE1V","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say, after years of helping my son try to piece together oddball creations out of random Legos, this kit was pretty refreshing! Not to say Legos aren't still a little fun, but the Erector Multimodel set is for some serious construction! The kit's 610 pieces allow us to build up to 50 different (suggested) things, and more if our imagination kicks in. And it's fun to ""modify"" the plans they give you, as well! Erector Sets have been around for ages, and they certainly are more 'advanced' than building blocks. So you'll need some patience and planning to build a model. But how cool is it to plug up one of the motors (6v or 3v) and watch your creation spin to life?!This kit comes in a hard shell case which is great for storing and travelling with all the pieces, and includes a small battery operated 'power tool', so nothing will disappear from my tool box. Keep in mind this is for kids at LEAST age 8 and up. Kids of a younger age will likely be frustrated by the advanced models, and the small parts should definitely be kept away from small children.As the parent of a young boy who has spend ENDLESS hours building things at his ""Lego table"", it's really fun to watch him dive into this set. I know he will learn a lot about how things move and take shape, which will only stimulate his mind further. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17I43CUOQKWS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00459UI4K#wasThisHelpful","R17I43CUOQKWS7","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite having a touch-screen ultra book, I'm still not a huge fan of Windows 8. I just don't feel the need to touch my screen when using the computer, and it's really not intuitive to me yet. My wife has adapted better than me, but I still prefer to keep my touch screen for my phone or tablet, and have my laptop be a laptop. Laptop touchpads have never been my thing, either, as I often hit them inadvertently, so overall I just prefer to use a mouse.As an IT worker, I've used many brands and types of mice over the years. Of those, Logitech mice have been a favorite. For many years (almost 10!) I used a corded Mx500, which I loved. Currently, I use a wireless Logitech M510 with my desktop, and a wireless M705 with my Win7 work laptop. So I was happy to try a mouse that is wireless and designed specifically to function with Windows 8.Compared to my other Logitech wireless mice, the M560 mouse felt lighter weight. That's not to say it felt cheap - it's perfect for using with the ultra book. The styling is simple and understated, with a matte black finish. Because I have large hands, the full size profile of this mouse was nice, but my wife found it comfortable to use, as well. The mouse was easy to configure -- simply plug in the USB receiver and it automatically synched with the mouse. The scroll wheel was also nice - more solid than my 510, but maybe not as solid feeling as my 705. The thumb buttons were a bit difficult to get used to at first. Experience has taught me that they are for forward and backward browsing, which is how they would function if used with Windows 7. But with Windows 8, they either minimized all applications or took you to the ""Start screen"" (formerly known as the ""Metro"" interface). Once I got used to that and using the scroll wheel for forward/backward movement, it was fine. The ""Edge"" shortcut button was also quite helpful for bringing up the apps switcher and ""charms bar"" (settings menu) on the left and right-hand sides of the screen.Overall, this M560 made using Windows 8 *significantly* easier for me to use, and would likely be a great asset for anyone who does not have a touch screen or who just prefers a mouse. The device should work fine with a laptop or desktop, as direct 'line of sight' is not required to the receiver. And if you still have Windows 7, it will function with that OS, as well. I've had no issues with using the mouse on a wide variety of surfaces, and while I can't speak to the battery life of this specific mouse, the batteries in my other Logitech mice have lasted a really long time.Overall, I highly recommend this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SDWFR64X66GM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DR8LB4Q#wasThisHelpful","R1SDWFR64X66GM","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, the Hape Galloping Zebra Cart is very attractive. Unlike so many of today's plastic toys, this one is made from wood that is sourced from eco-friendly sustainable growth forests. The paint is also water-based and conforms to ASTM testing, so no worries about toxic paints or chemicals. The colors are warm and fun, and the zebras are cute. It certainly takes you back to a time when toys were a bit more ""simple"" in function and devoid of all the flashing lights and bleeping noises.Overall, the cart was easy to assemble. The box came with the required Allen wrenches and I had it together in a matter of maybe 10 minutes (you only have to assemble the handle, fortunately). My 11-month-old daughter was immediately attracted to it, and wanted to put her things in it. That is where this cart has a bit of a drawback, as there's only one small area for this on the back. Otherwise, things get in the way of the zebras, which can then prevent it from rolling properly. I also felt the cart was a little on the light side, so it's not really something that counters a child's weight so she can use to pull herself up with. I also felt it was difficult for her to turn on the wooden floor, since the rubberized wheels do have a bit of a ""grip"" factor.One concern is that buyers should take note of the age recommendation. My daughter fell face forward toward this cart and got her face caught between the zebras! We actually had to ""extract"" her from the cart, which was a scary moment. Fortunately she was not seriously hurt and did not suffer any cuts - only a couple of small bruises. But it scared her away from the cart for a few days. And while she can stand, she has not yet mastered the idea of walking behind the cart, so she has a tendency to fall forward. As such, I'd definitely recommend the cart more for a 'toddler' who has taken her first real steps and just needs the cart for added stability.Overall, I give the cart a ""B+"", or 4 stars. I love the simplicity and colors, but do wish it were easier to turn and that it had a bit more 'heft' to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PA7NBI6B8TH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008E1912A#wasThisHelpful","R1PA7NBI6B8TH1","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Pampers 'Natural Clean' wipes are soft and lightly moist - a great wipe that isn't heavily scented or dripping wet. They are thick and sturdy enough for use, but not overly thick like some wipes. Just as the name says, the wipes have a 'fresh/natural' clean scent that is understated and not overpowering. They will not make your hands smell like baby's behind after using them.Perhaps it was just a coincidence, or perhaps the result of using these wipes, but within two days of using these wipes the mild rash (bumps) that had been on my daughter's bottom for about a week completely cleared up. We believe it was due to the fact that these wipes are perhaps more gentle than what we were previously using.The travel-size packaging is attractive and 'gender neutral', though it varied a bit from the product picture. The package size is perfect for your diaper bag, as well.Overall, highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HG7F9RADKDUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDMIPEA#wasThisHelpful","R1HG7F9RADKDUN","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We actually DID visit Disney World in Orlando in late-June of 2012. AND, we visited it with our kids, ages 8 and 9. My wife, who has been to Disney World numerous times and who actually worked there several years ago, still spent a lot of pre-trip time studying up and planning things out. But I can attest that this book was an invaluable resource for our family. There were LOTS of great tips relative to when to visit the parks, where to eat, how to save money, what attractions we should hit and what we could likely skip. This book saved us a lot of time and money, and was instrumental in the fact that in 7 days we were able to cover all four parks (Magic Kingdom x2, Animal Kingdom, EPCOT, and Hollywood Studios), AND spend a day at the resort and Disney's Marketplace. If you are planning a family trip to Disney World, this book is well worth the price. Especially if you are visiting for your first time, or are visiting the parks with young children. If you're reading this, I hope you enjoy your trip, and I highly recommend you check out this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2336TAB2WYTLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679009329#wasThisHelpful","R2336TAB2WYTLE","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's difficult to wax poetic about a pen, so the best thing I can say about the Pilot ""Dr. Grip"" pen is that it's sure to be swiped. Most likely by my wife, or perhaps a co-worker. Cruddy pens do NOT go missing, but GOOD pens... they're like a bowl of M&Ms. One moment they're there, the next they are gone.I found the ""Dr. Grip"" pen to be very comfortable to hold and use. I'm a dude with big hands, so small pens sometimes hurt to use. No so with this one! The cushioned grip fits comfortably in my hand, and it flows smoothly across the paper. And even better, the ink does NOT smear! For as smoothly as this pen writes, I was surprised to find that I could immediately run my hand across the paper and the ink did not smudge.So why only 4 stars? Constuction-wise, the pen just feels a bit cheap to me. It's primarily all plastic, with a metal clip and ""accents"". While it IS well-balanced, I would have preferred it to be slightly heavier and have a more solid feel, especially at this price-point.That said, if you do a lot of writing, you can't go wrong with Dr. Grip!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF7CFG1ZN6ZOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005U99Z2K#wasThisHelpful","RF7CFG1ZN6ZOJ","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's face it... no-one wants to admit their house smells. Well, mine doesn't either. But it HAS smells... like the smell of the bacon I fry in the mornings, the smell of our cat (which I could do without), my gym cloths accumulating in the closet, the smell of my son's football clothes laying around his room. Not exactly a bouquet of roses!Generally speaking, it's hard to quantify the performance of an air filter without some serious testing. But with the summer temperatures in my neck of the woods hovering in the upper 90s to low 100s, it's safe to say the AC has been running NON-stop for the past few months. And I can say that, after having installed this filter, it DOES seem to run less than before.So the A/C is perhaps running better... let's get back to the smells. Does this filter cut back on them? I'd say yes... especially with regard to the cat and bacon, which have a way of permeating the house.I would recommend this filter, especially to folks who may feel their home has a smell resulting from pets, meals, or stale air. It has worked well in the month that it has been employed in our home.* One note (or bit of confusion): I only received ONE filter from Amazon for testing, so I can't really swear on the long term use of these. The product says it is a 4-Pack, so I'm not certain what happened there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15V0ZE2KBH13X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006EI5V88#wasThisHelpful","R15V0ZE2KBH13X","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's the deal... I don't profess to be a TV expert. I can't really wax poetic about image processing, backlight scanning, speaker output, etc. But what I can tell you is that the 47"" Panasonic VIERA TC-L47WT50 is one AWESOME TV! Here are a few of my key observations:PROS:- LED HD Picture: It's simply astounding! SUPER clear. Black levels (I do know what those are!) are very solid.- Viewing angle: I know I can watch it from the side, and the picture is still great.- ""Smart"" functions: Built-in Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, YouTube, Skype, Twitter, Facebook, Web Browser, AccuWeather, and more... just... WOW!!- Built-in Wi-Fi: I'm able to connect to my home network without running cables, and maintain a solid connection. Nice touch!- Multi-task function: You can really do multiple things at once!- Size: This thing is amazingly thin, has a very small bevel, and a nice light at the bottom.- Remote: The primary remote is back-lit with red light (light button glows!) and very intuitive. I had no issues figuring it out.CONS:- I feel the TV could use a few more inputs, primarily for component video. As it stands, I can not hook up both my (original) XBox and Wii without HDMI converters.- I wish the TV had a simple audio-out so I could output the audio to my home stereo. As it stands, it comes out hollow and echo-y when I tried this configuration using the component audio-out.- Motion smoothing: Perhaps I've just not figured out how to tweak this yet, but sometimes the picture and things look ""fake"". Kind of an odd panning motion. It's just so clear, it looks odd. It's not bad, it just catches my eye sometimes.- It would be nice if the TV came with at least one pair of basic 3D glasses (not the active shutter, but just the basic glasses).Worth noting:- Sound: The ""3D Real Sound"" isn't bad. It's clear, I just wish it were a bit louder and had more bass. But it is not distorted by any means, which is good.- Viera link: I don't have a Viera-compatible home theater system, but I sure wish I did! This looks like one sweet feature.- VIERA Touch Pad Controller: I haven't needed to use this much, but believe it would be more handy if I had a Viera-compatible system.- Smartphone Remote Function: This is a very nice extra feature, as well.- 3D functionality: I do realize that this is a 3D TV, and certainly wish I could attest to those features. Unfortunately, I can't spring for 3D glasses right now, and I do not have a Blu-Ray player capable of playing 3D. If I get a chance to test these features, I will update this review. However, this TV is NOT ""just"" a 3D TV. It's a great TV even without consideration of that capability.The set-up of this TV was SUPER easy. It literally took me about an hour or less from unboxing to turning it on. I didn't have to jump through any extra hoops to set up the picture -- it was perfect out of box! I set it up the day of the Indy 500, and was blown away. Watching racing, the NBA Finals, etc. have been so awesome, I can't wait for football season! The movies we have watched have all been great quality (1080p DVD), so no qualms there. And I'm sure with BlueRay this TV would really shine! I had no problem updating the firmware on the TV, or figuring out all the extra functions. They just worked. All of this is more than I can say about another name-brand TV I own, which was a real nightmare to set up.Overall, if you are looking for a TV in this segment, you can't go wrong with the Panasonic VIERA WT50. It really is cutting edge, and is sure to enhance your home entertainment experience.One final note: This is not product-related, and is not the fault of Amazon or Panasonic. But my TV arrived in a damaged box, with one corner crushed and punctured, and the foam inside broken. It was also left standing on end agaist the wall of my front porch, which seems like a silly place to leave an expensive TV. I'm very disappointed in FedEx for how they treated this delivery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19QPZ3G8YH9YZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00752RAWW#wasThisHelpful","R19QPZ3G8YH9YZ","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After completing the loading phase and taking the second phase for several weeks, I can definitely tell that I was getting a bit of extra help from the creatine in my lifting routines and metabolic exercises. I was able to power through some extra sets that previously might have derailed me. So from that aspect, it worked. I have some skepticism on whether the loading phase is really necessary, but from what I can tell it simply helps the body ramp up the creatine levels faster.The BIO-SYNERGY Creatine Plus consists of two phases: Phase one consists of 800mg Creatine Monohydrate per capsule. Phase Two consists of 650mg Creatine Monohydrate and 150mg of Chitosan per capsule. The recommended intake is as follows:Phase One - LoadingTake 5 capsules, 5 times a day for the first 5 days, thereafter take a maintenance dose.Phase Two - MaintenanceAfter the loading phase, take 4 capsules per day, if a training day 2 (1 hour before training) and 2 (immediately afterwards) with a glass of water or carbohydrage (sugary) drink. If a non-training day take 2 capsules before lunch and 2 before dinner.Overall, I believe this was effective in some areas, and not so much in others. Without a doubt, my muscles appeared more full and I was able to get in some extra reps. HOWEVER, I also felt VERY bloated and gassy on the BIO-SYNERGY Creatine Plus, which I understand is a sometimes common effect of creatine monohydrate. I also gained a VERY fast 5-6lbs within the loading phase, going from around 208 to about 212. That is mostly water weight, which explains the bloated/puffy feeling. But it did help me add muscle (by virtune of aiding with extra reps), so it was beneficial from that aspect. But I did not lose significant body fat, so I don't know that the Chitosan as a ""fat eliminator"" really did much for me in that department. I read up on how it is supposed to act in that manner, but it seems the claims have not really been thorougly proven out. I do believe it can aid with kidney function, though.For those doing ""first time"" shopping for a creatine supplement, one thing I have learned is that Creapure (German manufactured creatine monohydrate) micronized creatine is considered more ""pure"" and often associated with less bloating and gas due to the purity. This product does not appear to use Creapure. Also, something that is not stated in the BIO-SYNERGY packaging, is that while taking creatine it helps to drink a LOT of water (perhaps more than usual).As with any supplement, do your homework BEFORE you start taking it. Know what it does, how, and why you are taking it. I was fortunate and willing enough to give this a try, but I would likely consider all options before purchasing it. I did find the pill form to be more convenient for me than a powder mix, so that was helpful.****************************************************************************************************Note: after submitting my review, I decided to read through some of the others. I particularly agree with reviewer ""E. Brown"" relative to the loading phase and BIO-SYNERGY's recommendation to take the creatine post-workout. If anything, the best time to take it is in the morning (upon waking, when your body more easily absorbs), and pre-workout. Also be sure to cycle on and off of creatine. No long-term studies of creatine's effects have been completed, so one should use with caution.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UX6W4F5LTLF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XFWGZE#wasThisHelpful","R3UX6W4F5LTLF1","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When perusing the cereal aisle, there are a LOT of choices these days. Some are clearly NOT good for you, some are, and some are just OK. You aren't going to be on a 3-hour sugar buzz, but neither are you really doing yourself that huge of a favor. Perhaps you are one of those who thought Raisin Bran was good for you... until you found out it has more sugar than Fruit Loops!Enter Quaker Oatmeal Squares, in this case infused with ""a hint"" of cinnamon. My first two thoughts are 1) must be good for you if it's from Quaker Oats! and 2) mmm... cinnamon!Bottom line: IF you sweeten it a bit, this cereal is good and crunchy at first. It does NOT have an overwhelming cinnamon flavor, and in some ways is a bit bland. But the flavor is acceptable. The crunch will wear off quickly, though, if you let it soak for more than a couple of minutes.The pitch is that ""each square has cinnamon baked into it"". Well, honestly, does it matter if it's baked in or sprinkled on? I think it could use a bit more flavor, but that's mostly just my opinion. Others may find it just right. The cereal consists of 46 grams of whole grains per serving, so that part is good. If you are going to consume cereal, you should consume those made with whole grains. It also packs a decent amount of soluble fiber (5g) and protein (6g - high for a dry cereal). There are 210 calories in a 1 cup serving of Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cereal (Cinnamon). The caloric breakdown is: 10% fat, 79% carbs, 11% protein. The cereal has 9g of sugar per serving.So if you're a cereal eater and looking for something healthier than Cap'n Crunch, this is probably a ""better"" selection. That said, I caution anyone against starting their day with a ton of carbohydrates, especially those derived from sugary sources. And as with anything, be aware of what a ""serving"" is and practice moderation. If not measured out, many folks would potentially consume 2-3 servings (in this case cups) in a single bowl, which would equate to a quick 400-600 calories just for breakfast!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G1MLA1I1SP6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OVPKCI#wasThisHelpful","R1G1MLA1I1SP6L","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prior to receiving these straps, I had two sets I was using... one is a set of 2"" Goodyear Racing branded straps, which are GREAT (tough as heck!), but are also very long and have long leads on the handle end. That makes them sometimes impractical for use in my truck bed. My other set were some basic 1"" straps, which were a real pain to use and not sewn very well.Enter these Macro Force ""Sure Grip"" ratcheting straps. The name includes 'PowerSports', and they are perfect for that purpose. I have used them to tie down my ATV and they work great. The 2,500lb break strength gives me confidence they will secure my ATV or my son's go-cart without issue (though I have to definitely use two on the ATV). The ratcheting handles are comfortable, and the release mechanism works smoothly (unlike my old ones, which were always jamming up). The stitching on the ends is also solid, with several cross pattern stitches that don't look like they'll be pulling loose any time soon. The nickel-chromium plated mechanics should also prevent them from rusting over time, since those alloys have excellent oxidation resistance, wear resistance and high temperature properties. One other thing I like is the rubber coated hooks. There's nothing worse than having a metal hook bang against the side of your truck!These straps also come with storage bags which, though not of super high quality, are a nice additional touch and helpful to have. I typically store all my 'truck stuff' (straps, gloves, cables, etc) in a bag under my rear seat, and the straps and hooks usually get all wrapped up in each other. This should prevent that from happening. I do wish the two bags weren't connected in the middle, though. Also note that some folks might find the 8' length of the straps to be a bit short, so definitely keep that in mind. However, they are perfect for me as my F150 has a 5' bed, so I often find some straps to be too long. These are actually the perfect length!I've seen more cheaply-made straps at places like HF and TSC that sell for more than the current list on these. If you're looking for good tie-downs in this size range, you can't go wrong!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JPLEX67KGTA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VV9X4I#wasThisHelpful","R1JPLEX67KGTA1","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I could easily write a review that repeats all of the aspects of this printer. And I could have easily written my review before I unboxed it, or after only a week of using it. But I have now been using this printer for approximately a year, so I feel like I have a good foundation of experience with it. So aside from all the marketing stuff, here is what I have found:- The printer itself seems OK. Perhaps a bit flimsy in some areas, but fine for the most part (it's not like I haul it around).- The printer size/footprint is normal for a printer with these features.- Setup was fairly simple. I was able to connect it to my wireless network and use it from two different computers.- Installation of the drivers was simple and easy. Both my XP system and my Win7/x64 system installed the drivers without issue.- Unlike with my old HP printer, I do NOT constantly experience driver issues or software crashes.- I only installed the software for scanning. I do not need more photo-organizing software.- The printer came with full ink cartriges, and they have lasted me nearly a year now. It seems to use less ink than my HP that had all-in-one cartriges.- The 'sample pack' of paper it came with was pretty much a joke. It was like 3 sheets.- Print speed IS pretty fast, and it is capable of edge-to-edge printing, which is nice.- The 'quick print' function (to save ink) is kind of frustratingly buried in the menus.- The auto document feeder is nice, and has not jammed or produced off-kilter images.- The ability to fax directly from the printer or my computer has been handy and has worked well. Speed has been normal.- I have never had the need to use the front USB port or memory card ports on printers. Ever. That's why I have a computer.- Printed pages and photos do seem to dry fast, though photo brightness depends on the paper.- I have not really had any issues with paper jams like my in-laws have had with their Canon Pixma, but the Canon is quieter and has a better interface.- Printing envelopes with this printer is a pain in the rear, and the address is often crooked. An envelope guide (to keep them straight) would have been nice.Thus far, I do feel this printer is worth the cost. It has a lot of features and has performed well. When I received this printer, I actually had my eye on the Canon printer. This one has performed better than I expected and restores a little shine to Epson's name. I don't ""love it"" to the point that I wouldn't shop around if I had to replace it tomorrow, but I DO like it and would recommend it as a solid home printer.Please note, Epson also now has the 645 model, which they did not have when I received this printer for review. The 645 also supports Apple AirPrint (app-free printing) and auto-duplexing, which are both great features. This printer is currently selling at the same or similar pricepoint, so be sure to do your research!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CYH421Q0HNWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XDU8P8#wasThisHelpful","R1CYH421Q0HNWP","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's keep this simple, shall we?What this IS:A great little low-end first aid kit for mom or dad to carry in the car, so they can address the typical minor cuts and scrapes that occur on the playground, etc. It might also be handy to 'stow away' with camping gear, in horse trailers, in the farm truck, etc. It is mostly bandages, and the majority of the time that is all a person will need. The container is a soft bag, however, so care should be taken not to crush the contents. The case is sufficiently large enough that you can add a few of your own items if so-desired.What this is NOT:This is not an all-inclusive kit to take on a hiking trip, ATV or canoe trips, office supply kit, etc. It's simply missing too many critical items, and there are many other things you should have for such trips. Please review the contents, and research what kind of contents you should have in a kit if you are participating in more extensive and physically demanding activities.In short, temper your expectations. Please do not order this expecting a fancy kit that will be suitable for all purposes. However, if you are looking for a handy little kit to stuff in the glove box for those inevitable cuts and scrapes that life deals us, you will likely find this handy.Please note: this review is for the 95 Piece kit.

"I had a couple of Adobe products that were working fine, so I held off initialy on installing the Photoshop and Premiere Elements 9. But as an experienced user of Photoshop, I was disappointed in the product. This is primarily my fault, as it is not bad if all you want to do is tweak photos. But if you desire to create your own graphics, you will need to stay with the full Photoshop program. Honestly, I think Adobe does a disservice to the Photoshop name by using it with this program, because they are not the same. But ironically, this product IS probably more of a 'photo shop' than the full-blown version, which has historically been a great graphics-editing application. This product WILL help you organize your photos and videos, if you want it to. But if you don't, it can be a bit frustrating to deal with. I had issues when resizing windows or trying to open photos side-by-side to compare them, and the software locked up and crashed more than once (on a loaded Dell 9300 running Win7/x64!). This software is very resource-intensive, so do not try to run it on an older computer! That said, installation was simple enough, and Adobe provided some decent tutorials.As another reviewer has noted, PSE9 is ""web connected"" software. You will have to create an online account with Adobe to effectively launch and use the applications, and the software does exchange information with Adobe about your installation and perhaps even how you are using the software. I personally find this a bit invasive, as I want to use my software anonymously and have it fully functional in a disconnected state without other 'requirements' such as this. I also do not like software to report on my system or usage history.Honestly, this software is NOT easy to learn. Yes, you can do a lot with it, but definitely expect a learning curve. Also, as of the time of this review, Photoshop and Premiere Elements 10 have now been released. As such, this review should not be considered reflective of this newer version, which may have worked out some of the kinks and/or changed some requirements. But for those who are considering this 'old' version, I encourage you to consider some of these factors as you make your purchasing decision.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XHFJOSQAWQMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YGME88#wasThisHelpful","R1XHFJOSQAWQMW","A1G8USRY17IR1X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G8USRY17IR1X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It has quite a selection of different sizes of brushes, I'm sure she will really enjoy using them. These brushes are to be used with NON-acetone polish remover.

"This Ultra Thin Professional Digital Touch Kitchen Food Measuring Scale is a pretty handy little gadget. I wanted it mostly to weigh items that I have to mail, but it also works great to weigh other things (such as food like intended). I have been wanting something that could easily weigh thick envelopes and small packages before going to the post office, then I can have the cost figured out ahead of time. I have had nothing but a positive experience using this scale. I have tested it using various things that had their weight printed on them, so far so good as far as accuracy goes.

"I bought the RiverStone Goods Ear Warmers because winter is here and these looked like they would keep my grandson's ears warm. He doesn't wear a hood so these really do come in handy. They fit on your neck, not on top of your head. They are made with a soft fleece material and are very comfortable to wear. The wires inside that hold the earmuffs on grip well but do not feel overly tight. I like that the ear muff parts are large enough that they cover the entire ear, it helps to cut down on the effect of the cold wind, and also makes them fit people with varying sized heads.

I spend several hours a day at my desk, and sometimes it feels like my head is just too heavy for my neck to hold.

It has tubes and a pump up bulb like the ones on blood pressure cuffs. The outer material is a very soft velveteen, in a deep royal blue color. Now, for the actual usage of the product. First, read the instructions. It is very important to be seated comfortably and go slow. After turning the knob to close, slowly pump it up until it alleviates the strain on your neck.

"As with all Majestic Pure products I have previously purchased, this Majestic Pure Therapeutic Grade Peppermint Essential Oil is of very high quality. The fragrance is pure, yet strong. I started with just a few drops in my diffuser and that filled the room with the smell of peppermint. I also mixed a little with some almond oil and applied it to my arms that had dry skin. It really smells and feels good used in this way too. Peppermint essential oil is used in our home to keep spiders out and it also helps to unclog stuffy noses as well. This is a large 4 ounce bottle so it will last me awhile. It comes in a dark bottle to keep the oil fresher, out of the light and included is a handy glass dropper.

"I am very happy with the quality and materials used in the PopUp Windshield Sunshade Ultimate Auto Protector by briteNway.

It is held in place by lowering the sun visors on the driver and passenger side. Truthfully it is not quite as easy to get it back in the little pouch as the diagram shows but with practice it can be done.

There are 30 lights on a this string. I was happy to find that I could charge them by setting the solar panel in my front window, and they stay charged for a long time.

This is a very nice set in an amazing array of color choices. The skeins are all uniform in size and banded to keep them untangled.

"This little 12-Led UV Light, Stain Detector Blacklight is nothing short of amazing. It is small but has a very bright light output. It needs, and does not come with, 3 AAA batteries.

We had a cat that marked and this light showed us exactly where the mess was so we were able to clean it thoroughly and easily.

"The first word I would use to describe this iPhone 5 5S Belt Clip Case, made by  Stalion¬Æ  is handy! It has a clip to easily attach your phone to your belt, and it works very well, stays put. It also has a flip out stand on the back to make viewing things on your phone easier and hands free. It is a very versatile case, and has a rugged texture to keep it from being slippery. This case protects the phone in many ways, and is reasonably priced. The only thing I think could use a little improvement is to make the stand a little more sturdy, it looks like it might not last too long. It is available in 3 colors. I was given the opportunity to receive the pink one free in exchange for an honest review.

"This is a 10 pack kit of Undermount Sink Clips - Undermount Sink Brackets - Epoxy Sink Clips. The set that I received came with no instructions at all, but I was able to find several videos showing exactly how to use them online. Although I have not yet used these to replace my sink, I did remove them from the package and try tightening and loosening the wing nut, checking the overall quality of these pieces. They all seem to be smooth and well made, I would say pretty high quality materials were used when making them. They will definitely do the job that they were made to do, and simplify it because of the adjustable bracket and the use of a wingnut to tighten.

I like that it is shorter, I can easily use it to roll on my leg, and also use it as a lower back bolster in my desk chair. It is easy to wipe off, the foam is dense, not like a sponge.

"If you need total darkness to fall asleep or to help fight a migraine headache, this is the eye mask for you. It fits so well, across the nose and it blocks out all light! This is one of the most lightweight and comfortable sleep masks I have ever tried. It has velcro on the back strap so that you can adjust it to the perfect size, and then store it in it's own little drawstring bag when you are through.

This large 4 ounce bottle of 100% Pure & Natural Cold Pressed,  Unrefined Organic Jojoba Oil is certainly no exception, I love it. Starting with the beautiful cobalt blue bottle, enclosed glass dropper, and careful packaging it only gets better once you feel the oil.

"I received this Kneeling Pad - 2 Pack by Navy Penguin practically free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. That is what follows. I will start off with the fact that these Knee Protection Pads are thick, really thick. They do not squish all out of shape when you kneel on them, but instead just cushion your knees, and support them off of the ground or floor. Not too big or too small either, they are a good size to carry around, and have a handle cutout for doing so. The foam reminds me of the same material used in high quality shoes, it is soft but firm. I'm keeping one in the house and one outside for gardening, etc. If you do any kneeling in your work or hobbies, these will be a big help to you too.

I've used it for a couple of years now to strengthen my nails and improve the health of my hair (thinning hair with age).The way it works-  Biotin is an important component of enzymes in the body that break down certain substances like fats, carbohydrates. The B complex vitamins are important in metabolism, helping your body to process energy and transporting carbon dioxide from your body's cells. It contains water-soluble form of vitamin B group which actually helps to transform proteins, fats and carbohydrates into energy, which is so necessary for normal functioning of a human body.My hair slowly started growing in fuller, my nails are stronger than ever. My hairdresser even commented on my hair. She asked why all of a sudden all the fly-a-ways..I told her THAT'S NEW HAIR GROWING IN :)I will continue to take Biotin and long as I see positive results!Product received in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQONM2KGLQ634/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NM8F6U#wasThisHelpful","RQONM2KGLQ634","A2F4H5QWBBWXCN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4H5QWBBWXCN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes the camera on my phone just isn't enough, this fisheye lens helps me capture pictures that I couldn't be able to without it.

Simply slip the lens on your phone(works with both front or rear facing cameras) and enjoy the amazing wide effect right away,Wide angle lens is great for taking pictures of large ranges, groups of people, buildings and landscapes.*Product provided in exchange for review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LMQEZ3NX0FWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZ7O4IK#wasThisHelpful","R3LMQEZ3NX0FWX","A2F4H5QWBBWXCN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4H5QWBBWXCN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Electronic Luggage Scale by Aerb is perfect for preventing additional charges at the airport for overweight or oversized luggage. It makes life a lot easier for the frequent traveler.I was really surprised because usually digital appliances always let me down. But this scale has been accurate every time I've tested it against a digital scale we have at the office for mailing items. I still have yet to take it on a trip with me but many family members have borrowed it and it's proven to be very useful for them. I definitely recommend this product to anyone. I'd buy it as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. My uncle actually got the regular old school scale. But yes a travel luggage scale is a must nowadays in traveling.

"My husband is a medic and many times his phone has died due to not being able to be on a charger, he is not the only medic on the truck needing a cell phone charge, and many times he is rushed due to emergencies and hasn't been able to hook his phone up to get charged. Having a quick reliable battery source is necessary for him, this is a great resource.This battery case is a great substitute as a bedside charger, battery pack, travel charger, or extra battery. The slim case looks nice and is well designed, all the cutouts are in the right place, and the power and lock buttons work flawlessly. Also, you do not have to take your phone out of the case to charge it. You can charge your phone separately from the case and vice versa.Most other cases I've used in the past has an assemble process where there are two pieces encasing the phone from the front to the back. This housing design is so much easier to place your phone inside. This case won't provide the same level of screen protection as most other cases do but the thick lip around the front will protect it if dropped. There is also a small groove for the camera so that it doesn't get scratched. This case has some grip to it, it will not easily slide from your hand.Overall this is a great cell phone charger, it will be interesting to see where hard case chargers go from here...Product provide in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KW15HYKNIFQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RG8TB0Y#wasThisHelpful","R1KW15HYKNIFQG","A2F4H5QWBBWXCN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4H5QWBBWXCN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the slimmer and trimmer iPhone 5S battery charger cases I've had the opportunity to evaluate and it adds very little overall bulk. I like the look of the iPhone, Otterbox cases are very bulky and always seem to takeaway the look of my phone (yes they do protect but also adds so much). This cell phone charger/case by Tomameri maintains the sleek look of my phone all the while keeping it charged and protected. Great little kickstand feature for watching movies & videos too.When the case is plugged in it charges the phone first (this is the power pass-through technology) then it charges the extra battery. The phone is the priority, the case just stores more juice for a later charge. This feature is very beneficial when you do not have a copious amount of outlets available.Product received in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REQVLYWCKAU1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZU9L9YW#wasThisHelpful","REQVLYWCKAU1J","A2F4H5QWBBWXCN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4H5QWBBWXCN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This lightning to usb cable is one of the best cables I have used so far. My husband and I are very hard on our charging cables and they don't tend to last very long around our house. The main factor in any iPhone/iPod/iPad charging cables is the MFI (Made For iProducts) rating. If the cable is not MFI then it is most likely going to be useless. I have had non MFI rated cables and they won't sync or charge your device the way their suppose to, usually giving the error message on your device that the cable is unable to charge or sync. This cable is durable, I have found that the nylon braided cables seem to be the toughest cables that you can get. The cable does not kink at the charger connectors like most cables do, The braid keeps the cable from pinching and keeping a crease on the wires which ultimately lead to the failure of a cable. I have ordered several of these cables because they are incomparable to other cables.This cable is worth every star and even though I did receive this cable for my unbiased review, when I do need more, I will be ordering the JOTO Lightening Charging Cable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YD9RK4CDSRK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015FD3JRM#wasThisHelpful","R1YD9RK4CDSRK7","A2F4H5QWBBWXCN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4H5QWBBWXCN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My sister is currently 30 weeks pregnant and she found her first angry red colored stretch mark on her tummy two weeks ago even after using bio oil and stretch make creams from Maternity shops. Now this freaked her out so I decided it was time to let her test the Body Merry Stretch Mark Cream. She has used this stretch mark therapy for two weeks now and honestly, she say's this is like a miracle cream, her stretch mark is not ""gone"" and it never will be but I can hardly see it. It has gone from being a bright red very noticeable mark to purple then to white and now it practically blends in with her skin tone. We are both so impressed with this cream and she will continue to use it after her pregnancy and in mine if we have more children.I have a quarter size scar on my right hand that I got from sticking my hand in a water cooler heater when I was a kid. I am going to update with pictures but I have been using this cream on it as well. I will update as soon as I see results, which I have no doubt will be soon.I have used several Body Merry products in the past and always have such great luck with all of them.

"I workout 5-6 times a week and I always carried a water bottle with me and it gets a little annoying having to carry my water bottle with me every step of the way and constantly having to stop my workout to refill it.

This hydration belt works for me. It's very convenient for my workout. The super stretchy waistband is comfortable, it doesn't ride up on my waist and sits pretty still as I walk or do my elliptical machine. I have found if I turn the belt around (wear it backwards) for certain exercises, it's helpful.

"Protect the floors in your home while house-training your pet with these leak-proof puppy pads.I tried these California Pet Supply puppy pads for our dog Allie, typically we use Hartz Home protection puppy pads but these puppy pads worked surprisingly well. Our dog is an inside dog but likes to go outside every couple of hours to use the bathroom. We keep her inside when we're not home but if we have a long day at work and can't get home to let her out she must resort to the puppy pads. They absorb well and they haven't leaked not once. I place one on our bathroom floor for her and she knows exactly where to go, and can use whenever she needs to.I find that one pad lasts all day. Our dog uses the pad approximately 5 times before we need to replace it, anything more than that we are pushing it. These pads are easy to dispose of as well as easy to replace with a new pad. The super absorbent filling can turn urine into an instant gel-like substance which holds up to 3 cups of liquid.

"My first impression was that these little LED Night Lights Set were all packaged nicely and are very unique. My children could not wait to test them out in their rooms.A little known fact about LED lights - LED (Light Emitting Diode) lights are known to consume 10% of the energy of incandescent lamps and should drastically reduce your energy consumption. LED technology is revolutionizing the lighting market.This 4 piece Night Light set worked perfectly and all had vibrant colors (Pink, Blue, Orange & White). The auto control light sensor activates at night, and turns off at the first sight of light. The sensor is extremely sensitive too which surprised me for their size. The indirect lighting design casts a wide light pattern that doesn't blind you. They are easy to install, just plug into a standard outlet (no batteries necessary).I gave them to my kids to test and they love them. I plugged the Pink & White in my daughter's room and the Orange & Blue in my son's room and the bathroom light was no longer necessary, both kids were satisfied with the light these little night lights put out.

Easy installation had the system working in minutes and duel receivers lets us hear the doorbell throughout the entire house. It has excellent range between the button and the receiver units.

"Whether you cook over charcoal or gas, the Burley Brush Stainless Grill Brush is a necessary tool for all grill cleaning.I was afforded the opportunity to try this in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion and since we have a very dirty grill, I was happy to give this tool a try.I used while at the lake on a large, tri-burner propane grill with stainless steel grates. This brush cleans the grill quickly and thoroughly every time regardless of the level of build up. The 18‚Äù handle is long enough that, even when the grill is on or is still hot, you can feel comfortable that you will not scorch clothing or arm hair during the grill-cleaning process. Its design features an innovative three-sided profile. That makes the brush very effective for cleaning your grill since you can turn it sideways to scrape off residue lodged between the grates.

"It started innocently enough, with a pair of cheap false lashes from the drug store. Drug store false lashes are THE BEST the best the best. Two thumbs up! I got a little bit accustomed to seeing my face framed by enormous lashes and so suddenly, one day, it wasn‚Äôt enough to glue them on every day. I wanted something more‚Ä¶ permanent. That‚Äôs when it got progressively more serious, with some at-home DIY lash extensions experiments (which I don‚Äôt not recommend trying, but which I also can‚Äôt totally recommend, either..), and then when those DIY lash extensions started falling out and taking my real lashes with them I knew I needed to get back to the basics and start fresh.My mother was using Latisse at the time, a prescription-only eyelash growth serum and, having seen the results in person, I decided it was high time I start doping my lashes so they‚Äôd come back in with vigor.

"Truly an amazing products! Cellulite is nothing more than normal fat beneath the skin. Weight loss and exercise can help improve the appearance of cellulite. A few days ago I looked for reviews on the internet for different body shaper creams and Body Merry is one of the best rated creams for cellulite.It significantly shrinks and reduces the volume of subcutaneous fat cells that cause skin to take on an irregular, pitted, or dimpled appearance so I recommend this cream to anyone who wants their cellulite gone. Using this cream with a cellulite messager brush will also be helpful in getting your desired results.The only sure fire way to get rid of cellulite permanently is by working out hard.

"There are hundreds of teeth whitening products are available in market. Most of them are waste of money. They will not make any good results even after long term use. Some of them have side effects such as sensitive tooth. This product really did work and made my teeth significantly whiter, the strips stay in place, they're easy to use, and no mess involved AND they won't break the bank like most other tooth whitening products.Here in the South, we drink Sweet Tea, lots of it too, tea will stain your teeth after a period of time. I like to bleach my teeth about once a year. Teeth whitening strips contain peroxide or bleach. Thus, they work to whiten your teeth the same way bleach works to whiten your clothes or your hair. The peroxide bleaches color from your teeth in order to restore their natural, white color. Strips are the easiest way to bleach your teeth in my opinion, all you have to do is tear open one pouch per day, one pouch contains 2 strips, one for top and one for bottom.

"I purchased this UTC Heavy Duty Belt for my husband for work and he absolutely loves it.It's a heavy duty belt, and is made with high quality material. The belt is adjustable by using Velcro and sliding the buckle through the belt to adjust it to your size. I did check and the belt can adjust smaller than a 30"" waist. The buckle is made of thick plastic and locks securely so you won't have to worry about loosing your gear while in the heat of the moment.I purchased this item for my husband who is an EMT, he has several items he keeps on his belt and when he has to sleep at the station, it makes getting out on a call in the middle of the night a lot easier and faster because all he has to do is keep the items on the belt, put it on and go.The one thing he was worried about is being able to put some of the items that are designed for a little narrower belt to fit. He did have to force the edge of the belt into one of holsters (Leatherman Raptor Trauma Sheers) and was able to fit the holster for the sheers on the belt but wont be able to take it off very easily, all of the others holsters fit just fine. The belt keepers are also made of high quality, the snaps are nice and secure, there's no doubt they will hold up to the test.My husband does use magazine holsters but on his carry belt, this belt comes with two and they are made of the same high quality material that the belt and the belt keepers are made of. The holsters have an adjustable snap buckle that are secure and easy to release for quick access.This belt is definitely worthy of the 5 star rating and when the time comes again, which will be quite a while I'm sure, I will be happy to purchase this again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R91W9RGP2TIXO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BR4T7G#wasThisHelpful","R91W9RGP2TIXO","A2F4H5QWBBWXCN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F4H5QWBBWXCN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really love this thin little keyboard.  I was initially hesitant to go with a keyboard that was separate from the case, but this is so thin and easy to carry with my iPad that it hardly detracts from the portability and usability.  When I first looked at keyboards in the Apple store they had a similar one, but the surface was very smooth and it was difficult to tell where the keys were and if you pressed them sufficiently.  This one, however, has a slight fuzzy or velvety texture to the keys, making them easier to use.  They also depress slightly - not as much as the keys on my Belkin case - but enough to feel comfortable.  My only concerns are that it's so thin as to almost feel delicate, and I worry about accidentally bending it.  The power switch is also so tiny that it's slightly difficult to turn on and off, but this keyboard is very easy to use and has enabled me to leave the laptop at home for my writing.

"One of my favorite lines from the movie ""Back to the Future"" is when Doc Brown asks Marty McFly who the president is in the future.  When Marty answers ""Ronald Reagan!,"" Doc laughs and asks skeptically, ""The actor?!?""  And it's funny because we seldom associate actors with being deep thinkers - at least not the kind of thinkers we'd want leading one of the most powerful nations on earth.But Ronald Reagan *was* an actor in the beginning.  Actually, before that he was a sportscaster on the radio, who then landed some roles in Hollywood, even becoming a rising star before World War II came along.  His eyesight was poor enough that he wasn't allowed in a combat role, but his solid good looks were a natural fit for the government training and 'propaganda' films.  And when the plum movie roles dried up after the war, he found work in some less serious films such as ""Bedtime for Bonzo,"" where he co-starred with a chimpanzee.  It's no wonder Doc Brown was dismissive.In Reagan: The Life, H. W. Brands treats us to a fairly detailed (700+ pages) biography of the 40th President of the United States.  He covers his early years with an alcoholic father, his college-forays into acting, and his desire for an ever-larger stage from which to perform.  When his Hollywood career stalled, he became the unlikely spokesman for corporate America on television's General Electric Theater where he honed his public speaking skills.  His political career began as a union leader for the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), following which he was elected California's governor.But his presidency is the focus and bulk of this book, beginning around page 200 and consuming the next 500.  Brands covers it meticulously - almost to the level of minutiae - and frequently compares his impact to that of FDR's, Reagan's early hero.  I was a teenager during the early Reagan years, and saw him as restoring pride and confidence in America at a time when both were at historic lows.  Yet, I knew not everyone saw him as positively as I did: the editor of my high school newspaper went out of his way to criticize Reagan (I wonder how many high school newspapers were so overtly political?).  I was living out of the country (and out of touch with politics) during the final years when Iran-Contra and much of the negotiations with Gorbachev happened, so that was insightful to me.  And while Brands avoids 'falling in love with his subject,' as some biographers do, it's still a mostly friendly bio.  He frames Iran-Contra as Reagan's effort to bring hostages home and Nancy's reliance on astrologers as a possibly over-protective impulse after the assassination attempt, but in other places he is less than flattering and more objective.  That's probably how it should be, but if I had a complaint it's that the book sometimes feels passionless.There will certainly be some on the far right who feel it's not praising enough, and some on the far left who feel it's not critical enough, but I found it to be an informative and entertaining read.  I've read a couple of books by his speechwriters - one was good but too patronizing and the other too presumptuous.  I've read great books about Reagan's handling of the air traffic controller's strike and his near-assassination, and even one about a great speech he gave.  But Brand's book does a good job of approaching 'scholarly' while remaining 'readable'.  I wish it had covered his pre-presidential life in more depth, but I guess that's worthy of a separate book or two.  For those primarily interested in his presidency, however, this one should please most readers.  (I received a free copy from the publisher.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W2HCX9P9PLJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536399#wasThisHelpful","R2W2HCX9P9PLJL","A3CWEK9HY2VPDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWEK9HY2VPDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shy, a Mexican-American kid from a small border-town near San Diego, is working on a cruise ship and earning good money.  He's dealing with his grandmother's recent death from Romero's Disease when a drunken guest talks to him before jumping overboard.  Shy tried to hold on, but the man seemed intent on ending his life.  But on the next cruise, a mysterious man in a suit wants to know exactly what the guy said before he jumped.  But none of that matters when the ship is hit by a huge tsunami and Shy is fighting for his life... or does it?I had some problems with this book.  First, the story is predictable - it was hard NOT to see where it was headed almost from the beginning.  Second, the profanity is pretty bad (and really stands out in the audio version).  Plus, it begins to drag when Shy and Addy - the snotty rich blonde girl - are adrift on a raft, fending off sharks and trying to stay alive.  And yet, in spite of that, I found the story compelling.  It's heavily plot-driven and the action kept me hooked, but the characters are also mostly well-developed and likeable.  de la Pena is clearly a good storyteller, and I found it hard to stop listening.  I'm even tempted to look for the next two books in the series to see how it ends.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33L1LKKLJD06Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1491544155#wasThisHelpful","R33L1LKKLJD06Y","A3CWEK9HY2VPDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWEK9HY2VPDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't really have a lot of reasons to own a knife like this one, but it's going to come in handy when camping or backpacking.

I also hadn't realized there was also a 'sparker' on the top of the sheath, which produced large sparks and we quickly had flames (using a small fire-starter cotton ball soaked in Vaseline [I think?] that my son made).

"This microphone feels solid and well-made.  I got it for my son, who is a budding musician and wanted to record some songs he's written.  I'm no expert on such things myself, but the microphone itself is just a tad on the smaller side.  I imagined it could be simply plugged into one of his amplifiers but it didn't quite work out that way.  A friend who works in the music industry came by and brought some extra equipment and got it to work for us, so if you're more familiar with equipment than I am you'll know better what you need and what to do.  The one item I thought would be nice was a taller stand, but the small tripod works well enough for most applications.  I also took it over to our church and was able to plug it in without any extras.  As for the performance, I thought it sounded really well (and my friend agreed).

"I've always felt the KitchenAid mixer was The Standard in this kind of countertop mixer.  I bought one twelve years ago (for my wife, although I think I probably use it more than she does now) and it still works perfectly.  I'm not sure how well this one will last compared to the KitchenAid (I'm not willing to bet it'll last as well) but for $100 cheaper it's not a bad product.The draw with this one for me was the two different-sized bowls - 4.6 and 2.2 quart.  The small bowl almost seems TOO small (my KitchenAid has one 5 quart bowl), but it's nice to have the option.  The attendant downside is having to store 2 bowls instead of one.  The variety of attachments is also nice - 2 beaters, 2 whisks, and 2 dough mixers.  I also like that the bowl can be offset on the stand, making it easier to add ingredients while in use than my KitchenAid, although the attachments don't scrape the bowl quite as well.  Also, the bowl isn't locked into place and tends to wobble when mixing.  Furthermore, I had the impression that the bowl spins, but YOU have to spin it yourself.  It's not a problem - just a misunderstanding I had based on the pictures and description.Personally, I didn't care as much for the speed knob on the back of the unit.  It's quiet enough but I wasn't expecting it to be silent.  It's much lighter than my KitchenAid, which makes it easier to pull out from the back of the counter.  Overall, it's a good product and a decent value, but I expect this one will die before my already 12-year-old KitchenAid does.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLVDIWJLN5SQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5RUU8M#wasThisHelpful","RLVDIWJLN5SQL","A3CWEK9HY2VPDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWEK9HY2VPDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice looking... um, not quite sure what to call it because to me a ""hamper"" is a larger recepticle for dirty clothes, kept either in a bedroom closet or a bathroom.  This is a small round canvas container/bag to keep other (smaller) things.  Since it's round (instead of square) it doesn't work efficiently on a closet shelf (too much wasted space in my crowded closets).  It looks nice enough that it can be kept out in the room, but because it's flexible it doesn't stand up by itself.  We used it as a beach bag but at only 13"" across (diameter) and 16"" tall, it's only big enough for a couple of beach towels (not the larger ones) and some sunscreen and a magazine (and maybe a book, depending on what I'm reading).  The handles are too short - not enough that you can put it on your shoulder - so it's not perfect as a beach bag (maybe if my wife was alone?), otherwise I'd prefer a slightly larger size (and more oval than round).In the end, it looks great - the pattern and color is very pleasing - and it's well-made, but we're still searching for the ideal use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K9OMXOWPJUAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5ZIXTK#wasThisHelpful","R3K9OMXOWPJUAY","A3CWEK9HY2VPDL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CWEK9HY2VPDL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before receiving this grinder set at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review, I used Kyocera Ceramic Coarse Mill.  Unlike the Kyocera (which is very difficult to open), this Silva grinder is very easy to pop open.Unfortunately, the Silva grinder has one very big flaw.  Because the grinder is at the bottom, placing it upright gets a lot of spice dust on my counter, making a mess (see my picture).  I avoid this by storing the grinder upside down, but because there isn't a cover for the bottom, it can get grease splatters from cooking in the grinder innards.  This is unsanitary conditions and cause the grinder to ""gum up"" from grease splatter.It does a great job of grinding everything...  salt, pepper, spices... it handled everything I threw at it with ease.  I like that I can control the coarseness of the grind by twisting right or left.

"This backpack is constructed solidly.  The stitching, zippers and fabric seem to be sturdy.  The big problem I have with it is the lack of padding on the sides and top of this backpack.  The sides and top is a single layer of canvas.  To be sure, it's quality canvas, but the lack of padding means a single bump could ruin my husband's laptop.  Without any padding on the sides and top, all the other cool features (back venting, extra pockets, opening at the top for headphone wires, sturdy construction, and comfortable back straps) begs the warning to keep searching for a better laptop backpack.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RULLYU3R3GVY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDSMNJK#wasThisHelpful","RULLYU3R3GVY4","A16AXQ11SZA8SQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16AXQ11SZA8SQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this set in exchange for an unbiased review.It worked (and felt) great while scrubbing my back, but after it dried (I hung it on my shower curtain rod), it dried all twisted.

Being cut on the bias makes the issue of shrinkage even worse, which results in one of the fabrics twisting.Normally, this type of item would be a suitable stocking stuffer.  Unfortunately, while my scrubber is still suitable for scrubbing my back during my shower (and it still works and feels quite nice for scrubbing my back), I wouldn't feel good about giving this as a gift, knowing what happens with use -- and laundering makes it much worse.To sum it up, if you buy this for yourself it will do the job adequately -- but don't buy it as a gift for someone else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PQ4H1QN084QG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131MHXIA#wasThisHelpful","R1PQ4H1QN084QG","A16AXQ11SZA8SQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16AXQ11SZA8SQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is touted as ""a healthy alternative to sweet and salty snack options.""  If this isn't sweet AND salty, I don't know what is!  The turkey flavor has 600mg sodium and 9g sugar.  The beef has 580mg sodium and <1g sugar.  Okay, so the beef is low sugar, but with that much sodium, both flavors are unhealthy.  As far as nutrition goes, depending on the flavor, these have 11-12g protein, 0-2% calcium, and 4-8% iron.Here are the ingredients for the beef: beef, contains 2% or less of: salt, corn syrup solids, spices, dextrose, lactic acid starter culture, natural flavorings, sodium erythorbate (made from sugar), garlic powder, sodium nitrite, water.The ingredients for the turkey are: turkey, water, brown sugar, dried honey (refinery syrup, honey), contains 2% or less of: hydrolyzed corn protein, salt, fructose, lactic acid starter culture, sodium erythorbate, sodium nitrite, in collagen casing.If you like Slim Jim's, you'll probably like these.

"I've been losing weight (so far, 30 pounds, and 60 more to go).  Needless to say, this has left my flabby body even flabbier, with looser skin.  I was excited with offered this Detox Body Wrap at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.  It's fairly easy (though messy) to use.* Boil some water, remove from heat, add the wraps (basically extra wide ace bandages) and allow to set for 10-15 minutes;* After the water/wraps have cooled for 10-15 minutes, mix the clay powder with warm water and apply to the desired area;* Remove wraps from water, wring until no longer dripping;* When you burn yourself from wring the wraps, place them in a spagetti strainer to cool further, then wring the rest of the water out;* Wrap the bandages around the desired area (I did my tummy), and secure with the included clips;* When the clips break, go get some safety pins (which I should have got before I started all this), and use them to secure the wraps.* Put a warm damp towel over the wraps (or do as I did and use neoprene wraps, which are better at holding in heat);* Wait at least an hour before removing everything;* Then clean up the mess you made, and measure yourself.As you can see, there were a few kinks.  I needed to let the wraps cool longer before trying to use them, and the clips ALL bent to the point I was unable to use them.  That said, I noticed a definite improvement in my skin tone.  I've attached Before/After pictures (using a ""cutout"" artistic effect -- lets face it, nobody wants to see a fat, old tummy in Amazon's pictures).  You can see that I still have a lot of work to do, but the after picture showed definite improvement.  While I received this at a deep discount for review purposes, I plan on buying more of this product at full price to keep toning and tightening my skin as I lose more weight.

I expect that will be mid-2016.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NF1EV3HW75WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012KPK5PW#wasThisHelpful","R2NF1EV3HW75WM","A16AXQ11SZA8SQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16AXQ11SZA8SQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I take CoQ10 to protect my liver while taking Red Yeast Rice. While Red Yeast Rice isn't as toxic on the body as statin drugs, it does have the same properties, so it's always a good idea to add CoQ10, whether taking statins or Red Yeast Rice for your cholesterol.This also has BioPerine, which is also known as Piper Nigrum.  It's what gives peppers their spicy taste. So far, so good. It has been found to increase the absorption of a variety of nutrients, including vitamin C, selenium, beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin B-6 and coenzyme Q.  Even better. However, it can also increase the absorption of some medications (which can bring them to dangerously high levels in your blood), so check with your doctor before taking any supplement with BioPerine if you take any medications. BioPerine is also an immunomodulator, which can suppress one's immune system. This can be helpful if you have any condition caused by an overactive immune system or inflammation. However, if your immune system is already lacking (for instance, if you you're on chemo or taking steroids), it can be dangerous to take BioPerine.  To sum it all up, if you're relatively healthy, BioPerine should be safe (and likely helpful). If, however, you're taking any type of medication, it might be better to take a CoQ10 supplement without BioPerine -- ask your doctor.Before trying this supplement, I was taking Red Yeast Rice and another brand CoQ10 that didn't have BioPerine.  It did lower my cholesterol, but not enough.  After switching to VivaLabs CoQ10 with BioPerine, my total cholesterol level dropped 50 points in two months.  All my cholesterol levels (total, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL) are now in the normal range, and my doctor  is thrilled.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FNAE6VOFU6D8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JWGXJG#wasThisHelpful","R1FNAE6VOFU6D8","A16AXQ11SZA8SQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16AXQ11SZA8SQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was not meant for multi-tasking (much).  If I try to do more than a couple things (or have more than two browser tabs open) at once, the computer slows down.  This is likely because the Click 10 has Windows 10 (a resource hog), but only 2GB RAM.  For a multi-tasker like me (who usually has 10-15 things going on at once from my HP laptop), it‚Äôs hard not to multi-task.  For someone like my husband, who does one thing at a time (and does it well), then goes onto the next thing when the first task is finished, this isn‚Äôt an issue at all.Some other thoughts on:* Operating System: This is the first Windows 10 computer I‚Äôve owned.  As timid as I was about the switch, Win 10 is not nearly as difficult as I thought.  For the few things I couldn‚Äôt figure out on my own, Windows 10 has a search bar at the bottom of the screen that allows me to search the computer or the web.  Sorta makes me wonder why I was so afraid to make the switch.* Storage: The Click 10 has 64GB storage. Toshiba erroneously calls it a solid-state drive. In real life, the drive is eMMC, an embedded MultiMediaCard (basically a memory card soldered on board).  It performs better than a mechanical hard drive, but not as well as a true SSD.  Accounting for Windows 10, you‚Äôll have about 50 gigabytes left for other files.  This works for my husband, as he mainly uses it for surfing the net and checking his e-mail.  If you save a lot of files (especially pictures or videos), you‚Äôll want to make more use of cloud services.  There is also a MicroSD card reader, for extra storage or transferring files.* Graphics: The Click 10 includes an integrated graphics engine called Intel HD (Cherry Trail). You will notice worse gaming performance than on a dedicated computer (one that doesn‚Äôt serve as a tablet and a laptop), so not many games work seamlessly here. You can effectively play lighter games like Diablo 3, World of Warcraft, or League of Legends. However, graphics-heavy Windows-type games such as GTA 5, Battlefield 4 and The Witcher 3 will be too much for this tablet/laptop.* Resolution: The monitor has a 1920◊1080 touch display, which makes it easier to read and do other tasks on the computer.  The clarity is what you would expect from this Full HD screen.* Connectivity: You get one micro USB 2.0 port on the monitor (which is where you plug the charging cable) and two full-size USB ports on the keyboard.  This isn‚Äôt a lot, so I am using a USB hub.  You also get a mini HDMI port, making it possible to use the Click 10 to stream video content onto your television.  Networking interfaces include a 802.11n WiFi adapter. Because there isn‚Äôt an RJ-45 port, you need a USB adapter if you want to access Internet with cable. Bluetooth 4.1 is supported (and very easy to connect to your BT devices).* Cameras: The Click 10 has two cameras, a 2MP one in front (for selfies and Skyping) and a higher resolution 8MP camera in the rear.  At 2.4 pounds (including the keyboard), you likely won‚Äôt use this to replace your digital camera, but it‚Äôs nice to know I can if I want to.* Keyboard: It‚Äôs a bit glitchy for the touch typist.  I have to press hard to get each key to type, and often I won‚Äôt notice a pressed key didn‚Äôt register the keystroke until the password I typed has failed.  Since my husband uses the ‚Äúhunt & peck‚Äù method of typing, this doesn‚Äôt bother him as much as it does me.In General: The Click 10 LX0W-C64 will work well as a general-use laptop for those who need portability.  I do like that this will work as a laptop, as well as a tablet, and when we go on vacation, we will take this instead of my full-size laptop. The Click 10 can run everyday Windows 10 programs (web browser, Office suite or HD content from Internet). Games won‚Äôt work well, there‚Äôs only an integrated graphics for them.  I like the resolution of the monitor. If these things interest you and you don‚Äôt need a heavy-duty computer, the Click 10 should put a smile on your face.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R346P52AZ4OV72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106UNMQW#wasThisHelpful","R346P52AZ4OV72","A16AXQ11SZA8SQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16AXQ11SZA8SQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This bag will help prevent that, as it will keep bugs and humidity out of my yarn.Even the smallest of the three bags is plenty big, as you can see from my Before and After pictures.  I'm using the smallest bag to store 12 skeins of sock yarn (plus a few half-used skeins that I couldn't bear to throw away), and it only took up half the bag.  It was super easy to do...  I placed the yarn into the bottom half of the bag, used the white zipper closing mechanism to seal the bag, used my vacuum hose to suck the air out, then screwed the black cover (shown to the side of the bag in the Before picture) to keep the out from seeping back into the bag. These bags are nice and thick, and they feel like they should last a good long time without allowing any air in.I received these bags in exchange for an unbiased review.

"I'm in my mid 50's and my eyes are definitely showing aging, so I was hopeful when offered one box of VIIcode free in exchange for an unbiased review. As the title says, the results are not instant, but by Day 6 they were visible (please see my photos showing the difference).The eye cream definitely does a good job moisturizing my eyes, and I used it above and below them. As you can see, the eye cream didn't do much for the puffiness above my eyes. This leads me to believe that the eye cream needs the pads to work its magic. I took before and after pictures, shown side by side. But comparing the two, I could see the puffiness is definitely reduced by Day 6. I don't see much difference in the tiny crows feet at the outer corner of my eyes. I probably would have with continued usage if this were more affordable.I do love the cooling feeling I that I experienced immediately after applying the pads under my eyes each evening. I also discovered, if I replace the film on the eye pads (the film is what keeps the pads from drying out), I can get one more use out of each pad (even experiencing the same cooling sensation the second night).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N7ZBIC763D2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111NPLSA#wasThisHelpful","R1N7ZBIC763D2H","A16AXQ11SZA8SQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16AXQ11SZA8SQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was hoping, since Viva Labs has 25 Billion CFU (as opposed to the Nutrition Now's 14 billion), that Viva Labs would keep my symptoms in check all the time.  Unfortunately, that's not how it turned out.  In order to give Viva Labs a fair trial, I completely stopped taking my normal brand, and that very day I started getting all the Candida symptoms I always get if I skip a dose of my normal brand.  I looked on the ingredients list (something I should have done before starting the Viva Labs brand), and noticed that, while Nutrition Now only has 14 billion live cultures, it has 8 different strains of probiotics (compared to Viva Labs 6 different strains).  I do know different probiotic strain affects a different part of the body, but I don't know which of the strains makes the difference (each brand has probiotic strains not included by the other brand).If you've got a problem helped by the probiotics included in Viva Labs, there are lots of live cultures (25 billion per capsule) in this brand.

It did smooth out the fat ripples; I have to give it credit for that.  However, it also made me itch everywhere I applied it.

If you don't have sensitive skin (and if you're not sensitive to strong aromas), I recommend this because it really does what it's supposed to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q95C7G8W6SLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010976HS2#wasThisHelpful","R2Q95C7G8W6SLG","A16AXQ11SZA8SQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16AXQ11SZA8SQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 4:16 MinsI have to say this was happy when I got the item , once I opened it up, I can tell the quality is not going to be so great. As I always do I try them out to see how it is and hoping for the best. Their is a few reasons why I'm giving this a 3 star. It's a great set up though.The quality on the vacuum is not so durable as I thought, as the plastic was breaking from me inserting and removing the attachment in the first use. I had to remove the lid and clean filter a few times in the same area. As their was not much to clean up on the carpet, by doing so I made a little hole on the filter. It does a good job on the seats a fabric material, although not on carpet. I had a hard time with it that if you have time to kill then go head. I suction is powerful but until the filter gets clogged up, within a few seconds, then the suction on it goes down.The attachment got hard to put in at times and when putting the attachment on the plastic area started to crack or chip off, very disappointing. I do like the attachment, how thin and long it is. Its a great idea, and came in handy. So if your get this do the vacuuming first then add the attachment so their is no cracking or chipping on your lid.Overall great for seat and fabric material, not for carpets and you need to keep cleaning the filter every few second or every other minute. Great suction then looses it after a while. Be careful when removing the filter as it rips easily.

" 0:22 MinsI have to say the mask is cool, very well detailed.I was highly impressed with the great quality and with adjustable straps. It comes with a 7 inch by 2 1/4 inch padding that you can place underneath the mask if the mask is a little big. I place it on my forehead.The mask looks just like the image listed here, great detail, the mask does have some weight to it, not to much. The quality is great is not the cheap plastic kinds, it's made with resin material,  feels like clay. So do be careful with the mask, as it can break if dropped.The mask is sturdy, it has openings for the eyes, nose and mouth. The mask is 6 1/2 inches wide and 7 1/2 inches from top to bottom.The straps can be placed from 11inches to 14 1/2 inches with out being stretched and 1 inch width. The straps are thick and sturdy, with hard black plastic ends. It stays in place and the straps stay closed. It does not make it uncomfortable to wear or put pressure on my head.The mask is a great size for my face as it covers it from top to bottom, and it lines up just great. I am able to see perfectly fine, it does not restrict my vision or breathing. The mouth opening is a great addition as details matter. If you have a big head then this maybe be small for you as this barely fit my brother who has a chubby face. The strap went around just fine but he said if the face didn't sit right.When wearing the mask do mask sure that if your face is clean or carry a cleaning cloth as this will catch any dirt your face may have. As I wear make up and mine tend to catch on to the mask, it's not a big deal because I can easily wipe it off. My eye liner has not stained the mask so far so good.Overall great mask, Love the quality, it's not cheaply made, durable, stretchable bands are are resizable. I didn't see any imperfections on this mask colors and detail are impressive. Great for any Anonymous or Vendetta Fan. This can be worn for any event. Worth the price, you wont be disappointed and well packaged.

"Okay, who doesn't like the egg mc muffins, I know my kids and nieces love them. I was just never able to make the circular eggs as hard as I tried it never came out. Well I found one one and it's great, simple to use and easy to handle.The ring is made with silicone and it's flexible, easy to spin handle with a nice small silicone grip. When using one of these you can tell the quality on the material by how it reacts to heat and how thick and durable the material is. The material is thick, feels solid, even the steel handle is thick and long with a thick circular silicone gripper, so we don't burn our fingers. The rings are about 4inches wide with the inner circle being 3 3/4 inches with 3/4 inches width, the handle is about 2 3/4 inches long with about 3/4 silicon grip.This set comes with four and can be used for more then eggs, I have also used this once on pancakes. Do spray some non-stick spray or place some butter so the food does not stick to the pan.  Small enough to use all four in the same pan, easy to clean and dishwasher safe. All connections can come apart for a good cleaning and be put together when dried.Overall great silicone rings, durable, sturdy, and easy to use. Makes for yummy and fun breakfast days.

"Okay, I have been using these for the full a couple of days now, I have tried a few wraps before and some were just to messy or it just didn't work what so ever. As making a wrap is a new thing, which was a learning experience as well. it comes with 9 packages and two bandages and each has its own set of clips.The bandages are a good length about 5 1/2 inches and about 66 inches in width, great for small to large people. It is lightweight and thin, durable and stretchy.  I warmed up the water and then poured the packet into the water and then put the clay over, and wrapped my stomach with the bandage and then placed plastic wrap, if any smears off it would be caught by the plastic wrap.I kept it on for about an 2 hours, this is great and easy to use and you can tell it's working. You will notice a difference in the second use. It comes with two bandages you don't have to use both or if you want you can at two different areas. Great quality detox body wrap.

" 4:09 MinsMy living room is not the brightest area in my house, which no one likes to be in because they struggle to see. I have to say this bulbs are super bright and now my living room is bright and lite up, it looks like it's daylight at night in that room. I have a 3 setting lamp set up and I replaced three of the bulbs to try them out and they out did my 60 watt bulbs by far.So I only use it on second setting, it only turns on two bulbs, as I don't need three bulbs in the room as it becomes white as daylight with just two I don't want to over do it. I did not tell my husband about the bulbs or that I had switched them out and he noticed right away the difference in the room once he turned the light on,  as he said ""WOW it looks brighter, you can actually see"". So two of these 9 watt bulbs have out done four of my 60 watt bulbs dramatically.I gave a pair to my mother who is going blind and having a hard time seeing, and she is using on big 90 watt bulb in one side of her room, as this can give the same amount of light but for fraction of wattage power, and with two her room is now lights up instead of the dull look/color she had. These can be used with a dimmer set up or a lamp with a dimmer set up, as my mother has one with four touch option. This do as much work as the 90 watt bulbs but with half the size and energy cost.Overall, I do highly recommend these bulbs and they can be used inside or out. You will not be disappointed as I was highly impressed with the bulbs. Their great quality 9 Watt LED daylight bulbs and it comes in a bundle pack of six and each bulb is individually packaged.

I came across this one and I was like this is must have for me as this looks great and seems durable. Once received I was amazed with the size of the opening it has and how great the quality it was made.  The material on this is thick and well built. The handles are big and perfect for any size hands.The handles have a rubber coating so help with non slip when in use, but if your hands become greasy then it will tend to slide, as it happened to me but when dry it stays right in place. This does a great job on only letting the grease, water, oil, liquid out and keep the food in the bowl. So no more throwing food out because of the strainer. Also the handles do not get hot which is a big plus.The strainer has a big circular foot for perfect balance and opening to let the liquid flow right though. Stays firm in my sink, and wont have to worry about is shifting on me.

" 3:00 Mins This is a nice little humidifier, and small enough to take with you. I had a little trouble at first trying to get this to work, as I had it upside down. I didn't realize it till little after. This is great to have and my mother has been wanting one humidify a her room for extra comfort. This is simple to use and for her great to have.It also have a nice source of blue light that can be used for a night light or decor during the day, as this has an auto shut off. Just fill the bottom half with water and let it run as you go on with you day or night. My nieces like it and want it in their room for the night light feature. If you are looking to add more moisture into a small area then this is great and simple to set up.I like it, great and durable, lightweight and simple to use. Comes with a extra filter.

" 3:00 MinsMy husband loves bluetooth speakers and I know he would really enjoy using this one. He has a small one that he carries with him everywhere in the house and complains about the blue blinking light that was not able to be hidden. I said ""You must be kidding me!"" then why are you always using it, time for another one. I came across this one, it looks nice and big. I got the black speaker, and I'm glad I did, it looks nice and it's a big speaker.It's easy to set up and jam out or put a movie on and enjoy the sound. The sound quality is good, and you can hear the bass coming from the speaker and it gets loud you can feel the bass bumping. It has the buttons on the back Line in, USB, Slot for SD card, and off and on. I was able to pair Android and Apple devices with the bluetooth speaker.On the top of the speaker it has Volume control with hang up option, the sound quality when use as a phone call through the speaker is great. I can hear great communication and they can hear me clearly.  You can manage how loud or quitly you would like to have your conversation. Theirs also Fast forward and rewind  with a play, pause, mute in between. I was able to skip music on Pandora and I was also able to fast forward, and pause.This is a great portable bluetooth speaker, with a unique look. I love the sound quality and the bass coming from the speaker. The sound can get loud and not loose its quality on the sound, like others it tends to have some static if turned up to loud. I am impressed with the design and how great it is.

"I highly recommend not buying Rocketfish tripods. If you ever need a replacement part (even something simple like the quick release plate, which you would expect would be readily available) you will have a very difficult time obtaining it, if you can get parts at all.I owned the RF-TRP65C which is similar and from the same line -- when the quick release plate was lost by my spouse, I contacted the manufacturer who told me what the part number was for the plate. I ordered it, and it was the wrong part. I contacted them again, and they assured me of the part number -- it was wrong and I got a second wrong part. The third contact, they just said oh it's not available. Add to this that their parts fulfillment happens through yet another company --- and add in the 3 calls to that place --- and I spent about 3-4 hours trying to get a $5 quick release plate, and in the end -- couldn't get one.Add to this that when I contacted the manufacturer, Rocketfish, and felt like the person I was speaking to had no idea what the quick release plate even was, I asked ""are you familiar with camera tripods at all?"" and he said ""no, not really"". There's your Rocketfish tripod support in a nutshell.Any other significant tripod manufacturer provides replacement parts -- I highly recommend AVOIDING Rocketfish. The product itself was ok but kind of pricey for what it was. In that price range, reasonable parts support should be assumed. I can understand on a cheapo $30 tripod but the 65C was $150...I can only assume you will have a similar experience on TRP47C as I had on the TRP65C since they are in the same product line.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K5QXKYMSXYW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DY38A8#wasThisHelpful","R2K5QXKYMSXYW2","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This has been my favorite Stratocaster bridge because I really like the pop in arm both in terms of convenience and also just arm shape/position. However, it has suddenly doubled in price. You could buy the deluxe/ultra strat bridge prime for around $75-$100 recently...now it's suddenly $140+.Also -- When the heck will fender make this available in Gold?? You can buy the Gold American Standard bridge with the same style saddles but a screw in arm, but not the deluxe model with the pop in arm in a gold finish. Yet they sell the gold pop in arm, and the gold saddles, but not the gold tremolo plate or gold complete tremolo. You can also find a part number  and the complete part for a left handed pop in arm version in gold, but not a right handed version. C'MON MAN!!I recently decided to try some other brands of 2 point tremolos in gold finish since Fender has stubbornly resisted putting this 2 point bridge out in gold.

"PROS* various finish options* priced in the range of other strap locks* flushmount is a nice option if your guitar can accomodateCONS* not easily reversible due to needing to drill a larger hole for the flush mount insert* requires drilling about 1/4"" deeper than a standard schaller straplock* maintenance is recommended in the instructions -- cleaning with wd-40 to avoid jamming/sticking* may have difficulty using certain higher quality/thicker leather straps* error in instructions calls for drilling with a 0.400 drill bit (good luck finding one). They actually mean that you should drill with a 3/8 bit, to a depth of .400 - measured the part with calipers before I installed.DETAILSI usually use Fender/Schaller style straplocks on my guitars and have never had an issue with those, other than the nut that holds the top half to the strap can come loose - but when it does it is typically obvious before you would ever have an issue. You tighten it with a socket on one side, and an adjustable wrench holding the other side -- and it will stay tight for a long, long time. The only problem -- on an SG the strap lock is on the back, facing your stomach, and the Schallers stick out about 3/4 of an inch, and poke you in the stomach. (Or possibly worse if you like to hang your guitar more at groin height. Can I get a snare hit?) Dual design Dunlops also stick out too far, really, on the SG. I tried those first but finally came back to the Flush Mounts, and in the end I'm very glad I did. However...I'm confident that both Schaller and Dunlop make good products that work well when properly installed. But the countersunk Dunlops are a little tricky on an SG. Mine is a '61 SG reissue, for reference.  Compared to a ""normal"" straplock - Schaller or dual purpose Dunlop -, the screws will go about 1/4"" deeper. (The actual screw length is similar but they are mounted deeper due to being in the bottom of the flush mount insert.) See photo of 2 screws and consider what is flush with the guitar body and that will make sense to you.The flush mount Dunlop *seemed* genius and like it was the perfect solution. Unfortunately, the screws are so long that they will go slightly through the front of the guitar, although in a location that is covered by a plastic cover. I read on a website that on an SG you will actually hit the truss rod, but mine didn't - I was extremely careful to drill with a tiny pilot drill first, and ""feel for it"", gradually expanding until I had the right hole.I removed the front plate, felt for the pilot drill, finally put the screw in once I determined that it was no big deal, and filed the tip of the screw so it would be flush with the face of the guitar, then replaced the plastic cover that hides it.If you use a thick leather strap like a Levy's leather strap, you may have difficulty getting these on the strap. I have several Levys straps, and on one there was no way these would ever work. On the others, I was able to actually get it to fit ok.On the bottom edge of the guitar after drilling the 3/8"" hole, I discovered Gibson had a 15/64"" hole inside with a plastic anchor for the original strap button -- too big for the screw to fasten into obviously. So I had to drill that out further to 1/4"", glue in a hardwood dowel, drill a pilot hole in that, and then mount the new assembly.It has worked out fabulously well, but this was more work than any other straplocks I've installed. On my SG, the other style locks sticking out was a real pain, and this is much better -- I'm glad I did it but it took a bit of extra work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26LNVQ6D2JTZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EENER8#wasThisHelpful","R26LNVQ6D2JTZQ","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"SUMMARYFantastic amp at a decent price. Better if you can work negotiate a discount and avoid tax. Sounds great - Small form factor (size/weight) is ideal for practices with a band, practice at home, or even gigging at smaller clubs or if you mic it, anywhere really. It is probably a bit overpriced at current $950 pricing, but...it is a real amp, not a toy. If you can only have one amp, this might be the one to have, or possibly a DRRI.PROs- Small size and weight- Big sound and great tone- Single channel blackface fenderCONs- Fender always uses cheesy metal feet that scratch the hell out of anything the amp sits on. Replace them with rubber feet for $5.- Lacks a cover (at least mine did).FEATURES THAT MAY BE PRO OR CON DEPENDING ON YOUR SITUATION- It's pretty loud, especially at 7-10 on the volume. Probably louder than you expect.- Removable power cord - I always think I want this but now I have it and I'm not sure it's a good thing.RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS YOU CAN MAKEDisclaimer: I gig. If you don't, some of these might be less important to you, like the cover, eliminating the footswitch, or the tilt back legs- Add rubber feet and throw out the scratchy metal fender feet before you destroy things.  ($5) Best $5 you can spend on this amp.- Add a D2F cover - nice padded covers do a good job of protecting amps. (about $75)- Consider tilt back legs if you gig...eliminates the need for an amp stand. (about $40) available on amazon.- Get an attenuator! Addition of an attenuator can really let you access the best sounds in this amp at manageable volumes for practice. I highly recommend this if you want to get great amp tone while saving your hearing, which is your most important asset as a musician. Attenuators can be had anywhere from $50-$500 or more, and you do for the most part get what you pay for. Finding one used can help reduce the cost if you are patient and get a good one. If you haven't tried attenuators you owe it to yourself to get one and try it out.DETAILSThis is what I always wished my Blues Jr's sounded like, back when I had those. I had BJ's stock, and modified with BillM Mods, as well as loaded with all kinds of different speakers but they always came up lacking no matter what. I did. It's the amp circuit. Loved the form factor (size and weight) but not the sound...now the PRRI costs more but wow what a difference. Sounds great and it's small and light.I also have a Deluxe Reverb, and I've owned Super Reverb (both reissues). This sounds similar to a Deluxe Reverb but is a lot lighter and a little smaller. Remains to be seen how it holds up in the band setting --I've owned about 20 different amplifiers, Fenders, Mesa's, Vox's, Marshalls, Oranges, Crates, Line 6's, Rolands and more. I have to say that if you can buy this on a discount, this might be one of the best amps available for most players. Paired with an attenuator, you have a lot of versatility for practice and bands, in a package that is easy to carry around. There is a lot to be said for that. The DRRI is great but even that gets heavy lugging it around.I bought my PRRI used for $675 in pristine condition, and I love it already. I also have a DRRI I bought brand new at deep discount, which I'm also very satisfied with. I bought the Princeton hoping I could get into the overdrive tones at a lower volume (which I can, a little lower) but even with the PRRI unless you're playing with a band, you'll need a good attenuator to get into the 7-10 range on the volume where the sweet overdrive is, without being really loud. Also hoped to find great tone in a small package, and it DELIVERS on that.My preamp tubes (originally 12AX7A) were replaced with -R suffix instead of -A...might be a warmer tone - not sure. Gotta look into that. I like the sound. Overall, love the form factor (size and weight) of this amp, the single channel which I all I ever used on my deluxe reverb and super reverbs in the past anyway. Easy to carry, plenty loud. I haven't tried it with the band yet as I just got it but I'm impressed overall, and I think it has enough juice and volume to hang in fine with the band. This might end up replacing my DRRI as my primary practice and gigging amp with the band, depending on if it can deliver stage volume with my heavy handed drummer.Overall very pleased -- I haven't had mine long yet but have not experienced any of the rattles, hum etc that I see people grousing about in reviews here. Frankly, my advice on those is to send 'em back on return, or if it's too late for that -- call Fender and demand a repair or replacement under the 5 year warranty. They will usually take care of your issue, although it can try your patience.I'd have to say that while I'm a little concerned about some of the reviews commenting on quality issues -- I still have to recommend this amp highly. If you are concerned about those issues -- buy in a store instead of online -- where you can try the amp before you buy it, and also have the opportunity to haggle on the price and knock 10% to 30% off that price tag.I've had no issues whatsoever on my PRRI, which I bought used and which was shipped from Texas to California...no rattles, no hum etc.  at least so far.I will update my review as my experience grows with this particular amplifier.UPDATE - I have had the amp several months. No issues. Love the amp in stock form. As always the aftermarket D2F cover is useful when transporting to gigs, especially if it rains. Worth every penny. I got caught in a downpour and had to carry gear in the rain - but the amp stayed dry thanks to that cover. I also discovered that unlike my DRRI, if you turn on the reverb and tremolo with the footswitch plugged in, then unplug it, both functions remain on and adjustable. This is also the case after power cycling the amp, and after unplugging the amp. I thought I would need to make a ""shorting plug"" or ""always on"" plug to replace the footswitch and keep these functions on all the time -- but no need. On my DRRI, I used a shorting plug in place of the foot switch. Not needed here on the PRRI. Nice practice volume & of course would be great for recording I'm sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUVM7ASJUWSHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037FKRC6#wasThisHelpful","RUVM7ASJUWSHF","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my favorite speakers, and I've tried a bunch. This 12"" C12K 8Phm speaker came in my Deluxe Reverb amp stock.I'm a tone chaser so I've tried just about everything else too...Greenbacks, Creambacks, V30's, Jensen P12Q Alnico's, Jensen C12N's, Eminence GB128 Legends, Eminence Patriots, Swampthangs, Eminence Cannibis Rex, and even other sizes from 6"" to 15"".This is a great and versatile speaker, and a good price point at $95-$100. The biggest difference between this Jensen and most of the others is that it has what Jensen calls a ""tight"" low end. Most of the others have a looser low end that can be a little farty (P12Q comes to mind.)The only downside I see to this speaker is it is a bit heavy at 9.65lb. That big heavy magnet is the price of the tight low end. The other feature that could be a downside or an upside depending on your specific application is that it is fairly efficient at 99.1 db sensitivity, so it can be a bit louder than some other speakers at the same volume setting.Give it 75-100 hours of good ""stage volume"" break in, and she'll mellow out and sing for you. Jensens are sometimes a bit harsh until broken in. (As are many other speakers but Jensens in particular.)  Does good with distortion, overdrive, and every effect I've put through it. Overall, this is a great sounding speaker that cuts in the mix, and gives great sounds across a variety of genres and styles of play. I keep trying to find something I like better and I haven't been able to, although I haven't tried those creamback 65's in the deluxe reverb yet so those are TBD still.It's hard to find a more versatile and balanced guitar speaker, in my opinion. Sparkling cleans, chunky low end, and takes distortion and overdrive well.Highly recommend you listen to the sound samples on the Jensen site for tonal differences between speakers.

"SUMMARYPROs- low sensitivity (95 db) means this is not as loud as some other speakers at the same volume setting. (6 on the volume with this is about the same as 4 on the volume with a C12K in my deluxe reverb)- very light weight for a 12"" speaker - at 4.1 lbs, it's a full 5 lbs lighter than a C12K (9.65 lbs)- good Jensen ""brightness"" - would definitiely ""cut"" in the mix.- 8 mounting slots means this can be a drop in replacement in Deluxe Reverb or other amps with 8 mounting studsCONs- Farty low end when amp is driven into overdrive, or when amp is clean but fairly loud- Fizzly high end when amp is driven into overdrive - this can be EQ'd away by backing off treble about 3 notches.- Seems overpriced for what it is. CDETAILSI picked one of these up and tried it in my Deluxe Reverb, in part because it is a lower efficiency speaker so is a little bit lower volume for the same power input. Also, it's substantially lighter (5 lbs lighter) than the stock C12K. And last I tried it because I loved the sound of my (former) Super Reverb that used four Jensen 10"" speakers of similar style and magnet. I also watched some demos of FSR Deluxe Reverbs that use this speaker, and thought the earlier breakup would suit the style of music I am currently performing.However, compared to the Stock Jensen C12K, it turns out I prefer the stock speaker quite a lot.And compared to a 10"" Jensen P10R, I like the 10"" better than this P12Q.This P12Q is by comparison - almost fizzly sounding if you crank your amp enough to get the overdrive tones, or use an attenuator to get there. (It's not the attenuator, the comment applies without the attenuator as well.) Rolling back the treble helps that fizzly high end. But what I could not EQ successfully was the Farty low end. Jensen describes this as ""loose"" low end in the product description on the Jensen site. The C12K is described by Jensen as ""Tight"" low end. I guess a like a tight low end. The sound samples on Jensen's website do give a feel for the differences between the speakers - they play the same riffs through all the speakers so if you have decent computer speakers, you can hear the differences if you turn it up a bit.Speakers are a very subjective thing, and I'll also add that the differences may be more noticable for recording than for live performance in a club atmosphere. And their are tradeoffs. If the weight of hauling your amp around is killing you - this can shave 5 lbs off but sacrifices the low end and might need a little different EQ settings. It can also allow you to get to the tube overdrive at a lower volume than a C12K. But for me the farty low end was a killer.In my opinion, there are cheaper and better alternatives available from Celestion, Eminence, Weber and others. I've bought lots of speakers and tried them (including break in periods)  including Greenbacks, V30's, Creambacks, Legends, Patriots, Jensen Ceramics, Jensen Mods, Jensen Alnicos, Carvins, Mesa's and different sizes as well - 6"", 8"",10"", 12"" 15"". You might say I'm a tone chaser, a gear junkie, or a mad scientist of guitar gear. This speaker, to me, has less bang for the buck at $139 than almost anything else I've tried. Luckily, I bought mine used for significantly less than that, so I can't complain too much...and I can afford to resell it without taking a bath. Or I might keep it in a 1x12 extension cabinet and see if it mellows with more playing. I can't be certain how much break-in it has seen, which might help the highs, but is unlikely to fix the farty ""loose"" lows. They sound similar to the Jensen sound samples so...I probably should have started there.I highly recommend using Jensen Speakers audio samples on line to listen carefully to various speaker choices from Jensen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FK4VO2KRPZGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003470R40#wasThisHelpful","R1FK4VO2KRPZGI","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought one of these in 2001 and installed it myself. It lasted about 13.5 years before it started leaking at the veggie sprayer O-ring and at the handle O-rings. I ignored it for 6 months (bad me) then called Delta support in Feb 2015 - they sent me a rebuild kit and a new vegetable sprayer under warranty, no charge. Took about a week to get it.The finish on the faucet still looks like brand new, and with the rebuild, it's working like new too.I like the look of the chrome & brass...even though the style has now changed away from Brass it will come back. My faucet did not use the ""quick connect"" sprayer hose, but Delta sent me one that did, along with the adapter to update it. That will make future replacement easier as well. (At least in theory, if they don't change the method again.)My only beef is they discontinued the correct sprayer in Chrome & brass -- so had to send me a different one that doesn't quite fit properly. I will call them back and see if they have a hose with a properly fitting base that I can swap.Great support by Delta, just wish they wouldn't always keep switching the finishes.I bought new bathroom faucets & shower set in brushed nickel finish a few years ago -- went to add some additional accessories to match from the same line, and found they have pretty much discontinued brushed nickel finishes now. Seems like it's chrome or the stupid black/bronze finishes. Luckily, Moen still does brushed nickel so spent $$ with Moen on the stuff I needed in a line that was similar looking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GH8UQ2NBTKIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NQB71W#wasThisHelpful","R3GH8UQ2NBTKIQ","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After one use:SUMMARYIf you are trimming with gas, you're a sucker. I'm done with gas and headed toward all battery powered yard tools after using this. The ability to use this early in the morning because it is quiet is really awesome. Low noise protects your ears and expands the working time so you can start early and get the job done while the neighbors are sleeping! This works as well as a gas trimmer in terms of cutting power, it's quieter and requires no futzing with gas and oil, no carburetor replacements, and the weight is lighter. Yes, batteries are expensive but so are carbs and I end up replacing those regularly.  Height was perhaps a little too long -- I'm 5'11"" and felt like I had to lift up on the trimmer. I had wrist and back pain after trimming for a full charge - which was 45 min. Overall, I'm impressed, but a little concerned about the ergonomics. An adjustable length handle would have been a design enhancement, and a different trigger system would have been nice too. UPDATE: THE LINE FEED IS NOT VERY GOOD ON THIS UNIT AND I MESS WITH IT ALL THE TIME.PROS-Cutting power is fine - as good as the gas trimmer it replaced.-battery life 45 min is probably long enough and if not can be fixed with another battery purchase-LOVE the lack of noise - means I can trim at 5am if the sun is up without bugging neighbors-worked better than expected in ""edger"" mode.-Never ran out of line during a full charge - this is good. I hate stopping to mess with line.CONS-Ergonomics seem to be lacking - I had back pain and wrist pain after 45 min with this trimmer, not sure I want to endure that for the life of the tool-Switching to edger mode (rotating the shaft a quarter turn) was a three step process -- loosen a handle, then push in a button, then turn. My old Black and Decker electric did this in one push and turn motion.-Lack of ability to replace pre-wound spools -- but Might be able to buy ""replacement heads"" and prewind them to avoid mid trimming ""rewind"".- Seems like a lot of grass gets past the trimmer guard - I was covered half way up my to my knees.- UPDATE: THE LINE FEED STINKS -- for this reason I'd now recommend a different unit -- all I do is mess with the line when trimming. It's a pain.DETAILS, OBSERVATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONSINITIAL IMPRESSIONS - BEFORE FIRST USE After assembly, but before actually trimming with it I had some concerns and observations.1) Not sure the ""round"" handle is all that stable - might be prone to slipping position. I didn't find this to be true in use.2) The length seemed good for me, I'm just under 6' and I didn't think I'd be hunched over with this thing. I was wrong, it seems a little long and I have some ergo concerns after using it.3) I like the idea of the ability to add attachments, and noticed they also sell reconditioned ones pretty cheap, so might try a reconditioned edger. TBD4) I like the look of the battery charger, and the battery charge indicators that are built into the battery itself.5) After seeing the head, which looks like the same head I had on a homelite gas trimmer (and hated) I was wishing I had ordered something with replacable pre-wound spools. (Black and Decker or Worx, for instance.) All my prior electric B&D tools were pretty awesome, and the trimmer had prewound spools available. I think I'm going to hate hand winding cord onto the one spool, and I'm concerned about how the line will feed in use. Maybe I can buy a couple replacement heads or something so I can prewind them and have them ready to go. Nothing pisses me off more than running out of string and having to stop and hand wind a spool. I bought some Ryobi 0.080 prewound spools but they aren't the right thing for this trimmer, even though the label says it works on 40V Ryobi - no model numbers shown. The concern is that if this is anything like the similar head that was on my homelight gas trimmer -- I spent more time futzing with that than actually trimming (what a POS.) After use, the head worked ok so I'm less concerned. -- UPDATE - the factory wound spool as ok -- once I had to wind my own it's been nothing but trouble. either I'm doing it wrong, or this line feed system stinks! Fairly certain I'm doing it correctly.6) I'm a little concerned that the plastic trimmer guard and the metal connection remind me too much of the last homelight gas trimmer I had -- the metal parts would collect heat as the shaft heated up from use, then eventually the stupid thing melted away and I had to order another. They aren't expensive but I don't want to have to do that. The connection point on this one looks similar so I'm a little concerned. After use - thought this did ok but allowed a lot of grass to fly by and hit my shoes and legs.OBSERVATIONS AFTER FIRST USEI charged the battery fully (plugged in overnight), and took it out back for some Heavy trimming in high weeds on my multilevel backyard. I'm on a .25 Acre lot, with a several hundred linear feet of flowerbeds and retaining walls to trim around. The grass was badly overgrown as the yard is ""mid renovation"" so had been let go during the winter season and just got its first mow.1) I LOVE that I could go out at 6 in the morning without any concerns about the noise of a gas trimmer waking neighbors. This is when I have time for yard work!2) I didn't notice the trimmer being much lighter than my gas trimmer in use, but it probably is a little bit lighter.3) The ""balance"" seemed a little less than optimal. I felt like I was lifting the head up, as opposed to holding the head out and letting it ""hang"". So I noticed a bit of lower back tension using this trimmer.4) I found the trigger system a little cumbersome wearing gloves. The gloves seemed to get caught a little under the triggers at times. Minor regripping solved it but...do I want to mess with that for the life of the tool? Not sure.5) The battery lasted about 40-45 min on a full charge in very heavy trimming. Not bad, but only got me about half way through the task at hand. In normal conditions, probably would be enough to do my backyard but might need another battery...not sure there is another unit with much longer life so it's a function of the Amp-Henries of storage on the battery...easily solved for $125 for another battery.6) My biggest concern is that after the trimmer my right wrist was really sore....so ergonomically, this trimmer is putting a weird load on my wrist. This may be enough to convince me to take it back and try a black and decker or something else.7) Cutting power was as good as all my prior electric and gas trimmers or better.8) The auto feed head worked great, alleviating some concerns, although I wonder once I have to wind it myself if it will feed the same.OBSERVATIONS AFTER SEVERAL USESI really like the trimmer except the line feed is terrible. If I had it to do over, I'd have bought a different trimmer because of this. I should have known but I'm into this one for two batteries, the trimmer and an edging attachment (which is awful) so for now it stays. Still...a good battery trimmer is as good as gas...just costs more up front on batteries.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37LKGD20VMCJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K34DZAA#wasThisHelpful","R37LKGD20VMCJC","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great little overdrive pedal at a nice price. I always like the form factor, size, and simplicity of controls on Electro-Harmonix pedals like this. They use the ""standard"" 9V power supply and put the jack where it belongs on the back. Also with the quick peeling off of the rubber feet, you are one piece of velcro from sticking this on a pedal board without weird topography on the bottom of the pedal -- it's just flat, with recessed screws -- perfect.I bought this just for the hell of it because it's inexpensive - and I really like it so far. Have only used it on a small amp that needed just a hint more overdrive and it worked great. This could be used for clean boost, or as an overdrive pedal. Or buy two and have BOTH.

"Bought the iPhone 6, 4.7 inch Space Gray, Edge to edge Ballistic Glass 1 pack.SUMMARYReally like the product but mine had a small flaw right in the center. For $20 for a small sheet of plastic, I don't think that should happen so I contacted their support. Took 5 days and multiple emails to resolve, then will take up to 10 days but probably less for me to get a replacement. They did agree to send replacement though, which is the right thing to do. Fit is good but they might consider making it about 1mm wider all around, not sure. Overall I do really like how the product installs and how it seems to function. Once I get the replacement unit that isn't flawed, I think I'll be happy with the purchase.PROs* Presumably more protection than a flexible plastic skin* Easier to lay down for a clean fit than the flexible plastic skins* Proper preparation did a nice job of eliminating any dust/bubbles* Thicker, stronger than a plastic flexible skin* Issue was, in the end, addressed with the right answer - a replacement. (i.e. Support ""did the right thing"")CONs* Expensive (for what it is)and if the product has a problem, now you are messing with support or returns. With a multi pack of cheap skins, throw away and try again with another - no support required.* Size - Looks slightly smaller than I expected for ""edge to edge"" product. It looks to run close to the edge of where the glass rounds over, but looks like it could use 1mm more coverage all the way around. It's not a big deal and I'm sure it provides good protection in a drop/scratch situation.* Support was slow - would have been faster and easier for me to just return and order another unit prime shipped.SUPPORT EXPERIENCE* Support - They included in the package one of those messages saying ""Don't return the product, give us a chance to make it right if you aren't happy"". I took them up on that. It took 5 days and 5 different people handling their tickets and e-mails, but they did agree to send a replacement. I had to nudge them 4 days into the process and say - hey this is taking too long - what is the resolution. I'm told all replacements ship out of LA by first class USPS mail, so please allow 7-10 days for delivery. I live in Northern California so I expect I'll have it in a day or two. On the one hand, it's great that they responded and are replacing the product. On the other hand, it would have been at least twice as fast and taken less of my time to just return the product and order another. It would have cost me return postage, where in this case they did not ask for a return of the defective unit. Oveall, they did the right thing but need to improve their support communications and streamline their process. Something like this should take, at most - 2 replies, the first asking for any information needed, and the 2nd informing that the issue has been handled and how.My advice if you have an issue - is return the product on day 1 and just order another, especially if you have prime shipping. It will take 2 days instead of 2 weeks. Or just get it at your local ""phone"" store and have it installed right there - if there are any issues insist on a different unit right then and let them deal with the manufacturer.

"BACKGROUND/BASELINE INFOI am reviewing the 820H, which is the 8"" speaker. Amazon shows all the same reviews for both the 620H and 820H, which I think can  be a little bit misleading. The 6"" and the 8"" will sound different. I want to be clear that my comments are regarding the 820H 8"" version. Also, I've had the speaker mounted for about 3 months now to give it sufficient break in time.SUMMARYI found the speaker to be a quality speaker with a pretty good sound for an 8"" speaker, but not nearly as good on the low end as a 10"" or 12"" speaker. It will tame harshness in a very bright amp as it is mellower on the highs. However, I found it to be overpriced for what it is. Most 8"" speakers are $35 range - this is $70. It sounds a bit fuller, but I didn't think the value was there at $70. Also the power rating at 20W RMS is limiting in terms of putting this in a cabinet as a small option. Ok for 10W amps, but I'd start getting nervous trying this with a 15 or 20W amp. If this was rated for 35 or 40 watts, it would be more versatile. I'm currently running this in a standalone 1x8 cabinet with a mesa boogie mini rectifier head in 10W mode as a practice amp. It's ok...but a 1x10 is really better.PROs and Best Uses- Amps 10W and less (due to it's 20W RMS rating)- The Champ it was designed for- Amps that are harsh on treble - this will cut back the treble a bit- Slightly better/tighter/fuller bass response than most 8"" speakers- Use in ""bedroom"" sized amps.- Use in a cabinet with a high quality head as a practice rig - for helping keep volume controlled.CONS- Twice the price of comparable 8"" speakers from Jensen, Celestion and others- Power rating at 20W makes it a less practical speaker for use with amps in the 15-25W range.Probably need to stick to 10W amps and below.DETAILSFrom reviews I've read, people seem to really like this in a Fender Champ. And it appears it was designed specifically for that application so that makes sense. More power to them. I don't have a Fender Champ, so can't comment there.There is also a Bugera V5 crowd that seems to like it as well, although I found it to be a downgrade in that particular amplifier. That amp is a bit short on treble and adding this speaker gives it even less. I did not experience a richer low end either - I preferred the stock Bugera branded speaker in the V5, and I wouldn't recommend this speaker in that amp if you are considering it. I had this mounted in a V5 for about a month.I've also run this with a Mesa Mini-Rectifier head in 10W mode as a practice amp. For this purpose, it's not bad. It has a fuller low end than say a Jensen C8R, but also less treble. It still does not have the low end you get from a 10"" or 12"" but it's not bad. I think a pair of these in a 2x8 cabinet would be interesting and open up the options of running with amps like a princeton reverb, deluxe reverb, or even the Mesa mini rectifier in 25W mode. The 20W power rating is a bit limiting in that respect for one speaker. But at $70 each, that's $140 for a pair -- you could buy a better sounding 10"" for less than 2 of these...I own several amps and several speakers including sizes 4"", 6"", 8"", 10"", 12"", 15"" and 18"". You could say I've been on a speaker exploration for a few years. I've tried a lot of speaker and amp combinations and bought and sold a lot of speakers (about 20-25 different speakers) in the past few years. I've tried smooth cones, ribbed cones, hemp cones, paper cones, different magnets, different sizes and voices, and most of the major manufacturers.Also combinations of different speakers. It's a subjective thing but I can tell you when you find a speaker or speakers you like with a particular amp, you know it. It's also important to play in both a real band situation, and just playing in your practice space alone.It wasn't that this is a bad speaker or sounded bad, it just didn't sound that much better than other 8"" speakers and it cost twice as much. Also the power rating at 20W is limiting. I would really like to see an 8"" speaker with this sound and a little higher power rating -- so it could be used as an ultralight, small, portable cabinet with enough power to run  20-25 watt amp head.I have bought lots of eminence speakers new (and used) but I don't get all the hype or the price on this one. I know there are lots of folks who seem to think it's great but I'm not hearing enough benefit to warrant the price tag personally.Overall it's a decent 8"" speaker, it just doesn't seem to be a very good VALUE in terms for what you get for the extra $35 - $40 compared to other 8"" options.It looks like maybe they have started to lower the slightly price from when I bought this -- so maybe others felt the same - that it was priced too high for what it is. I'd probably give it 4 or maybe 5 stars at the $45 price point.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ZGYEK8VFIAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BM9HOVG#wasThisHelpful","R39ZGYEK8VFIAH","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally had an identical case for my iPhone 4. I think I paid $40 for it from Verizon at that time. I never liked the way the belt clip dug into my side, so I ditched the front but kept the back on the phone for 3-4 years. I dropped it a few times on concrete and never broke anything. I also found the pop out stand very handy and used it all the time. The case back did a good job for me, so...Now I just got an iPhone 6, and saw this online for $9.99. What a great deal. Bought it right away, popped this on the phone, and still don't like the way the belt holder digs into my side. So once again, I'll keep the back, toss the ""front"" with the belt clip, and carry the phone in a leather holster.I was surprised this came with a screen protector and a stylus. But I separately ordered a ballistic glass screen protector so if that fits with the case, I'll be using that. If not, the little thin plastic one that came with this will be handy to have. The stylus...not useful to me as there is no place to clip it into the case. I don't see using that.My -1 star is for the hard plastic belt clip that is very uncomfortable.

"SUMMARYI love the look and the light weight. But it's a nice looking guitar that has been unusable in a band situation due to bad quality. A non-starter at it's price point, compared to fender, epiphone and others. This is really a novelty toy guitar. Buy only if you want the looks, then plan to spend money on different electronics or repairs. This is not a guitar you want to rely on as a primary guitar but if you want a novelty item for a couple songs, it's ok. I really wanted to love it and was considering several other Dano models for my collection, until I played it, then it made me go ""meh"" when I actually played it, and the quality rendered it virtually useless. It sat on the rack for 9 months and I'm now finally coming back to explore warranty repairs before the warranty expires. Standard warranty 12 months, requires you to ship to LA for repairs.  Danelectro lacks local authorized repair shops. With prompting, they agreed to pay for my local shop to make a repair.PROs- cute cosmetics- sounds decent in the center position with both pickups engaged, when it works.CONs- build quality is lowest possible.- factory setup is fair to poor- electronics failed on first use- I've also noticed a potential issue with the bridge inserts which may render it impossible to setup - so may be looking at further warranty repairs or replacement.- Standard warranty support is bad with no local authorized repair sites - must ship guitar to LA for warranty repairs - expensive and time consuming - or repair it yourself locally - Danelectro will send you parts, you pay any labor or do it yourself. With some prompting they agreed to pay a local shop for my initial issue - a bad 3 way switch.DETAILSI really wanted to love this guitar, but it sucks. I have many other guitars (about 20 at the moment, have owned and sold many others) and this has turned out to be the worst guitar purchase I ever made.I realize others may have better experience but I got a bad unit. A return was also no economically practical for me. I bought a DC59 in Alligator Blue, which cost about $50 more. Because that model was not widely distributed, I had to buy online from an East Coast music store that had it in stock, and I'm in California. Not an issue, except when it had a problem, making a return became an expensive proposition.The quality of the electronics is very low. The first time I played the guitar was in a band practice, and the switch failed after just a few songs. At that point it became noisy any time you touch the switch, and it fails to cut off the bridge pickup in the position where it should do so. I considered a return but due to cost to ship back, stuck it on the shelf thinking I would check into warranty repair, but didn't get around to that for some time.When I contacted Dano about warranty, they offered to fix in LA if I ship to them, or they would send the part. After some prompting they did agree to pay for me to have a local shop do the repair, and they are providing the part. So they are making an effort to improve the service around the warranty, after some discussion.I do appreciate that they took care of the issue - with the switch replaced, it is a lot better. I did some minor adjustment and changed the strings and it's a little better now.When working properly, the guitar sounds pretty weak on either pickup - I would mainly only play it in the center position with both pickups on. Otherwise it sounds very thin. I don't really believe in ""good sounds and bad sounds"" just different sounds that can be used to create different feels in songs, so those thin pickups could be useful in specific situations. But not for ""workhorse"" guitar work on most songs. You will typically want to run in the center switch position - both pickups on.The volume and tone pots are concentric stacked, and if you try to adjust either while playing, you will find it takes 2 hands to adjust volume and tone independently -- grab either knob and they both turn together. Limiting on stage, to say the least. There's always ways around that - use a volume pedal...etc.The factory setup isn't great either - but I'm not sure I want to pay the cost of a setup on this guitar. I was excited about it when I bought it but because of the low quality it's never been played at a gig and only in practice once. In my opinion, it's a toy and should be priced accordingly at about $100. I'd be surprised if it cost them $50 to build it. The body is plywood, and mostly hollow. All of the component parts are the cheapest available anywhere. Pull the pickguard off and look for demonstration in ""cheap"". Yet the guitars cost as much as a Fender Standard or Epiphone. Kind of a ripoff there but ok the brand and looks have some value and history.But without function, it's only good for hanging on a wall and looking at it. Back in the days of the originals, these were known for being very inexpensive. But now you pay a lot for the brand name and the look -- so the value isn't there like it once was on Danelectro/Silvertone etc.Compared to a Fender Mexican Stratocaster or an Epiphone in the same price range, this thing isn't even in the ballpark in terms of sound or build quality, materials, and design. Just isn't. So if you are buying a first guitar and want to get years of use out of it without issues -- don't buy one one of these - get a Fender or Epiphone or spend more for an american made Strat or a Gibson. The ability to properly adjust and setup your guitar on a Fender or Epiphone in the same range makes it infinitely better.For example, the bridge height adjustment is on two screws the are simply screwed into the wood -- by comparison to a Fender or Gibson which uses studs screwed into metal inserts....so the Dano is not really built for a long life of adjustments and fine tuning, but it functions.I tried playing this Dano through the new Digitech 12 string simulator pedal last week, and thought the lipsticks would really give the jangle but it wasn't great for that either. My better guitars with better pickups and better electronics all sounded much better through that pedal.In the end, I think Danelectro really needs to contract with someone like Guitar Center who has a national footprint, to provide basic warranty repairs. The basic quality of parts is subpar in the $400 range so just know that what you are paying for is the look, the shape, the cosmetics, and to a degree the sound. If you are a serious player, you're probably going to want to make modifications to the electronics to install something more durable. Also know that other mechanical design features are the cheapest conceivable...the way the bridge mounts, the way the neck mounts etc. The guitar has a purpose, and it can be playable but know what you are paying for and what to expect. It's a kind of a toy. So I won't say ""buyer beware"" but I will say ""buyer, be aware"". There are better built guitars available for half the price, and pretty much everything in the same price range has a far superior build quality.I don't hate it but if only they would use slightly better materials, it could be a lot better. If yours works it can be fun as a novelty item and can offer a little bit different sound, a cool historical look, etc. But you would never want to rely on one of these as a primary guitar at a gig, and because of poor quality, low value relative to the price, I have to rate the product down overall. It's ""ok"" but novice players buying this guitar should know that in the long run, you would be better with something else for durability and hassle free performance.I was considering several other models but the quality is so low, I can't see buying another one unless I buy it used and substantially cheaper than the new price.That said, now that mine is functioning properly, it's kind of fun and I do still appreciate the two things I originally liked about it -- the light weight and the kinda cool looks...Just be aware if you are buying one that it's built cheap, and consider your intended uses. To me, it's kind of a novelty guitar, not so much one you want to rely on day in and day out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L99K4V7LL457/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WMURBQ#wasThisHelpful","R2L99K4V7LL457","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good quality, good colors, and tons of pockets and storage mostly in the right places. This is nearly a perfect configuration, other than the contents of the front lower pocket, which really needs rethinking, and the lack of any smaller compartments in the main section.Description Back to Front:- Nicely padded shoulder straps, plenty of length adjustment- Adjustment  straps have plastic finger loops for easy adjustment- On top there are two ""handle"" type straps. One is well padded and very visible in the product photo. This is the main grab handle. There is also a canvast strap that runs parallel to this handle, but is more on the back surface. I think that is intended for if you need to ""hang"" the pack. It isn't padded.- Main compartment has a well padded laptop slip in compartment with a velcro strap. I think the velcro strap is quite a bit longer than it needs to be, but I guess that accomodates larger laptops. There is then another padded flap that I think is there with two purposes. You could slip a tablet in the pack between the laptop pouch and this flap, creating another section with padding on both sides. Or if you fold this flap down it fits perfectly in the bottom of the bag and provides a sturdier ""bottom"" to the bag, with padding. That is probably the main intended purpose, and I think it is a flap so the bag can be ""flatter"" if desired, and for when they store them and ship them. The main compartment is 7"" deep at the bottom, so you can put a lot of stuff in this part of the pack. Books or folders with papers, or jackets, hats etc. I would have preferred to see this about half as deep, with the 2nd compartment splitting that depth. Also would prefer to have some smaller net storage in here to contain for instance a laptop power supply and cord, pens/pencils, etc. It would be nice to access that all from the main compartment.- Side net pockets - for water bottles etc. These are great for coffee cups or water bottles. I wouldn't have a pack without these. Stay hydrated. If you are in college, this is where you carry two extra 40 oz beers you can drink on the way to your most hated class. You know...unless you want to graduate.- 2nd large zippered compartment is not padded but is large enough for documents, or a variety of items you may not want ""on display"" when you open the main compartment to pull out your lappie. For instance, I have placed medications, or confidential papers, or just things I carry around but don't use and don't want to see the wear and tear of the main pocket. This is also a good place for my Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones in their zippered case.  There is a nylon divider or pocket in this compartment, so you could put papers in the pocket and then a rolled up jacket or baseball cap in the other section outside the pocket.- Front top zippered compartment: This is my favorite -- I put my work badge, a wireless mouse, various USB flash drives, and anything small that I need quick access to. This is just a zippered compartment - it contains no additional pockets or features. But, it is one of the most used pockets on my backpack.-Lower front zippered compartment - this one might be overkill inside, but if you like a lot of separate pockets for distinct items -- this is the place. Inside this chamber these is another horizontally zippered compartment basically the full size of the pocket. Then on top of that there is a net pocket suitable for a phone or calculator, or perhaps something like passport wallet. In the center there is a vertical pouch with a velcro strap on top. Open that and the thing expands and has another velcro top slightly smaller pocket, and on top of that a 3rd small pouch. I'm not sure what I would use those for and I'd have preferred to see pen/pencil compartments across this section. To the right of that is a slightly wider pocket that is just the right size to put a hohner harmonica in it's plastic box. for most people, I'm not sure what this pocket is good for, it's too small for a phone and too big for pens and pencils. The front face of this has 3 layered slots at different heights. Again..usefullness of that is TBD. I really wish this section had individual pen/pencil pockets. That would be perfect for a work bag.- The front face has 4 canvas loops sewn in which I assume are for hanging other items from with carabiners. Maybe I will order some carabiners so I can use these :)PROs* Good Quality of construction and materials* Good design of most pockets* Price wasn't off the chart, although more expensive that some others of similar quality but lesser features* Water bottle pockets and top front zippered pocket are ""must haves"" for me.CONs*  The first negative I see is that the strap adjustment slides and the 1 carabiner loop on the straps are plastic. If they were metal, this would be the perfect bag. The problem with putting the plastic parts on this or any backpack is that they usually break before the pack is worn out. These are the weak link in the design of most packs. I don't see metal hardware on many if any so...I guess that just is what it is. They don't rust, on the upside.*  The front lower zippered compartment is too busy with too many little compartments that don't seem to be designed for anything I own. I'd prefer to see one section for pens and pencils, one or two net sections for sunglasses/(or glasses or reading glasses) cases, etc.OVERALL SUMMARYHappy with the pack, it's almost perfect and a good replacement to a similarly designed pack I had for several years. Wish it had better compartments in the front lower pocket. Worth it's cost, and looks pretty good too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IH4LRNVEJBM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002N2W0AQ#wasThisHelpful","R2IH4LRNVEJBM9","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pedal is available in either this 300 watt version or a more modest power rating (I think 100 or 150W).I have the lower power version -- the functionality is the same.See my review of the regular ($229) version for more detail.-1 star for design choice to use the proprietary 15V Wall wart. That's dumb. Just make it 18V so it can be run from most pedal board power supples instead of the custom wall wart. I hate it when pedals require a special power supply becuase it is more gear that has to be carried to a gig and not easily prewired. Not too bad if there is 1, but a real pain if there are several.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY3Z8H96DMELB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015VW2HC#wasThisHelpful","RY3Z8H96DMELB","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lots to like here. Not everyone needs one of these, but it can be very useful if you have some specialized sounds that you need to get to in one stomp, but that require multiple pedals. For instance, I have one loop that contains an Electro-Harmonix B9 organ machine and a Hammond Leslie pedal -- these two together can get a great Hammond B3 + Leslie speaker sound, and with the looper -- it's on one stomp.I also like having the boost on the pedal. I set this one for a small boost, and I also have another clean boost pedal at the end of my chain, following this pedal. With the two I have 3 levels of clean boost -- ""moderate"", ""pretty loud"", and ""you just blew the paint off the walls"" (both combined).I've used the remote control feature as well. It's ok but what I'd really like better would have been if it had a way to switch in one stomp between the two loops.PROs- size is reasonable- seems transparent enough- tuner input- boost button with adjustable gain boost-two loops, plus passthroughCONs-Weird 15V power supply means I HAVE to use the provided wall wart. That sucks -- just make it 18V so it can run off a pedalboard ""brick"" type multiple output power supply. -1 star for this bad design choice- The loops, when remote controlled, don't work quite the way I'd like them to in terms of how you go from one loop to another and the configurable options for the TRS input. Hard to explain here.- I have heard you can't insert this looper successfully into your amplifier's effects loop, but I haven't tried that. The amp I'm currently using it with doesn't have a loop, it's a Fender DRRI. Not a big deal for me but I can see how it could be for some folks.SUMMARY- If you need to simplify the pedal board river dance and have  a couple multi-effect sounds, this is a pretty good way to do that without a huge investment in more sophisticated controllers. The slingshot remote control option also opens up some interesting possibilities in terms of putting this in a rack with a drawer full of pedals and then putting the remote pedal in front of you. It's a cool pedal. Maybe priced a bit high for what it is. I bought mine used and still thought it was a little more than it should cost, so new the price is high. Maybe that's why there are so few reviews.Build quality seems very good. I'm happy with it but really wish they had used a 9V or 18V power supply instead of the really weird 15V option.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C1MFOWVUNNSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002F569S#wasThisHelpful","R1C1MFOWVUNNSO","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me, this is just what the doctor ordered. I'm playing in a blues/blues rock band that needs some organ sounds, but we have not been able to find a keyboard player to provide them (at least so far.) As I took about 5 years of organ lessons as a kid, I was considering buying a portable organ (about $1500) until I saw this pedal. This pedal brings some Hammond sounds into our Allman Brothers and Bluesbreakers tunes, and without my having to buy an organ or carry it around. For my purposes, it's perfect. Good sounds, easy to use, small size, highly portable.PROS+ great organ sounds.+ simple to set up and use+ ""standard"" 9V power supply and the jack is located on the rear vertical surface where it belongs+ small form factor / doesn't hog space+ eliminates need to carry a keyboard to blues gigs, and helps maintain a simple rig and small footprint+ I did not experience (at least so far) any weird noise from the pedal, so I suspect what some people have reported may in fact be related to their technique, their pedal board setup, or their power supply. I have played at high volume with this pedal on a board once so far. (I've only had it less than a week.)+ Plays well with Hammond Leslie pedal. The two together can really provide that Hammond B3 + Leslie sound including the flexibility of speed up/slow down/braking multi speed Leslie, plus the organ tone coming from this B9. I put those two pedals in a loop so I can step on one button to get my organ tone. Then I manipulate the Leslie pedal buttons as needed. If you don't want to spring for the leslie pedal, you can still get a pretty decent sound from the B9 alone, it just doesn't have a way to adjust the leslie speed while playing and it doesn't sound as good as the leslie pedal. But it's pretty decent alone.CONS- a bit expensive for what it is...seems like this should sell for $150, not $220. Get a coupon or negotiate with your local store and try to get 20%  or 30% off. I didn't have too much trouble getting 20% off at my local store, took about 3 minutes of negotiation, saving just under $50.OBSERVATIONS* The pedal is sensitive to your technique, so like some other effects, you need to learn how to use it. You can't quite just plug in and use it perfectly the first time -- although it is pretty close. It only took me a few minutes of messing with it to ""figure it out"". Just like you have to learn to play a wah pedal musically, you need to spend a little time understanding what works and doesn't with this pedal. For instance:* Responds best to smooth light consistent picking - it IS sensitive to the level of your attack - if you pick one note hard and another soft, it will play those notes louder or softer. That is a little weird since organs, unlike pianos, are not ""touch"" sensitive in that way, but if you learn to work that you can make it do good things. As a guitar pedal, I like the dynamics of that but if not used correctly you could get some weird results. Might benefit from putting a compressor in front to smooth out the signal -- I have not tried that yet as my compressor needs a new switch.* Does not respond well to intense string bends or huge barre chords. Playing the notes straight with no vibrato and sticking to 2,3, or 4 note chords or single notes works best.* Sliding into a note across a few frets sounds great, like a keyboard player swiping up or down the keys to a note.* For a grittier sound, kick down to a bridge humbucker with your volume up. To smooth it out, kick up to a single coil neck pickup and/or roll the volume back a little bit. You can also stick a tubescreamer in front of it to dirty it up a little for a grittier tone.* It is VERY sensitive to volume adjustment, and the response is not instant so if you roll from 10 to 5 you are likely to find it doesn't change much on the note you are playing, but when you hit the next note, the adjustment is immediately apparent. So subtle volume adjustment is required, or adjustment over several notes, or through practice, knowing exactly where you want to move that volume knob. Otherwise if you are expecting it to adjust volume instantly on the fly, like a guitar usually does -- it's a little weird. Again a few minutes of playing with and you will figure out how to use your volume control effectively with this pedal.STILL TO DETERMINE* I've read it doesn't take a battery, but haven't pulled the back off to look or bothered to look in the manual. I pretty much plugged it in and went to town.* Have run only with provided power supply so far, not with my pedal board w/ mounted power supplySUMMARYThis is a really cool pedal if you are a guitar player in need of organ sounds. I'm a fan. The small form factor and standard power supply are both a big plus, and the ease of operation is nice too. It makes some great organ sounds and has a variety of settings. I like the #1 setting with most of the knobs at about 1/4 to 1/3 (or combined with Leslie pedal, I turn the mod knob all the way down.) If you just need some organ chording or some simple organ notes to fill in selected parts in songs, this seems like a great way to get that. It's not a keyboard player in a box, but it's about as close as you can get and it does it for a heck of a lot less money than buying an organ. It's also a small addtion to the pedal board instead of lugging a keyboard and stand around. This helps you keep a small footprint on stage as well. Two thumbs up for the B9 !! Very cool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QQP1YJZ34G2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L6HR4VE#wasThisHelpful","R2QQP1YJZ34G2Z","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's a guitar. Not a great one, and it's not supposed to be. These have a plywood body, and cheap parts.And still, it sold new for around $449 new, without a case.  They must be selling out or sold out because now I see 2 sellers on Amazon selling these at > $1000.00 (or trying.)For me, this guitar sounds best when running both pickups. I find the bridge alone to be thin and weak, and the neck alone to be a little boomy. But together...pretty nice. The highs are maintained and the lows are in perpective at this point. Put some reverb and chorus on that and you have a nice tone for Pretenders clean tones. Kind of sparkly but full enough.I'm really not crazy about the tone and volume stacked concentric rings. For starters, I can never remember what is what. And for finishers, they two rings move together when you try to turn one or the other. Very awkward. But if you manage to dial in a tone and volume you like, then I guess it's ok. The switch is definitely cheap...the hardware is cheap, and the tuners are crappy. This has a metal nut as well.So what's to love about it? Well, it has a cool look, a little different tone, and who doesn't love a blue alligator. You might not want to buy it as a primary guitar, but as a specialty piece in your collection, it's interesting.While loading gear for a practice today, I noticed and appreciated how light this guitar is.I think this might be one of those guitars that is just interesting to pull out from time to time and play with.

"I bought one of these used but in ""almost like new"" condition for about $350 with a transparent blue top. By ""almost like new"" I mean the body and finish had no marks or dings, and the frets had no visible wear. The electronics however, were starting to wear. There's a lot I like, but a few things I have to downgrade my rating for.PROs- attractive finish and top- dual HB tele with coil splitting- decent fit and finishCONs- cheap, non-standard tuners harder to upgrade cleanly (different 2-pins location than typical 2-pin fender/schaller modern tuners)- cheap import electronics don't last, and sound somewhat muddy- lacks a case at the $700 price point, on an Indochina(current)/Korea(older model)guitarDETAILS AND COMMENTS ON UPGRADESOn the upside, the top of mine looks really nice in the flame maple trans blue stain. I like the set neck and the feel at the heel is ALMOST as good for reach as my american deluxe strat with a tapered heel. This isn't tapered, but the shape is less boxy because it is a set neck. The neck is narrow both in width and thickness, so players with smaller fingers can get a bit better reach. Some people don't like the Jumbo frets but I don't mind them at all. The weight of the guitar is really light - which is nice if you play or practice long sets. The body cutaway on the back is also a big plus for comfort.Most notable, the tuners are not great, and if you try to upgrade them to a normal 2-pin drop in replacement tuner for strats and tele's you will find they do not fit. This guitar does use a 2-pin tuner, but the pins are about 1 pin thickness closer to the center post of the tuning peg so that a ""normal"" fender/shaller tuner will not fit. And worse, it's designed so that if you try to drill it, it will be very difficult to do even with a tuner pin jig, because you are basically trying to drill on the side of the holes. Minus 1.5 stars for this...I normally replace all my fenders with locking tuners but I only do drop in replacements for a clean look. I don't like to drill additional holes or leave exposed pin holes, because then it looks like a hacked job. There are plenty of tuners that I'm sure CAN go on, but I now have to hunt for one that is going to fit and cover properly. (Update: locking Sperzel tuners will cover the two pin holes, but require drilling a single, centered pin hole. I have a pin jig for this, but...the black Sperzels have a silver center peg?! so from the front, you lose the ""blackout"" look. I ordered planet waves locking tuners, and installed them. They just cover the 2 pin holes of the original tuners, but do require the drilling of a small hole for the anti-rotation screw these tuners use. I measured the bore of the tuner holes in the headstock and it is 25/64"". This is the same bore Gretsch used for the Sperzels, and the Planet Waves auto-trim lockers fit this nicely as well. I'm overall very pleased with the Planet Waves, they provide a clean install, good function, and full blackout on the front. Also, they are not as expensive - $52 vs the Sperzels at $70.On my model, it used Fender Pickups instead of the Seymour Duncans. They are ok but not great. Perhaps a bit muddy. I expect to replace them before long. A few years ago they switched this model to SD's, but I'm not sure they are the ones I would pick to put in here. No downgrade in rating, just an observation. After all, someone else might love these pups.The electronics (switches & pots) on mine are ""import grade"", and I can feel it, hear it...and in fact, they are shot. Now I bought this used but it has pretty clearly seen limited use so for the electronics to be crapping out this early in life...is indicative of the cheap import parts. So I'll be replacing those, hopefully with American parts assuming they will fit properly. I am downgrading half a star on that because frankly, there is no reason to use the cheap crap on a $700 guitar. Fender has such huge purchasing power that they could easily standardize on the same high quality electronics for everything, and from a cost perspective (cost not price) it would save them money. A little searching on the Fender site produced the factory wiring diagram, but changing the pups will change all the wire colors anyway. So...more to come on that as well. I will most like put Pearly Gates in both neck and bridge. (Not the ""Plus"" found on current models, and not the '59 neck RP pup.) Again, I will update this review when that is done. I'm exploring if I need to get an RP (reverse polarity) neck pickup similar to what was done by Fender. I like the push pull pot being on the tone knob for the coil splitting.Last, lack of a case. This model sells for $700 without a case...that's a lot for what it is. This is made in Indochina...(mine was made in Korea). So they really could include a case at this price and still make a good profit. At least throw in a decent gig bag, Fender!All in all it's an interesting Telecaster for the dual humbuckers and flame top, but if you are used to player american fenders or even current MIM fenders, there are some features of this that fall short as shipped. I'm not saying don't buy it, I'm just saying be aware of the differences it has compared to a MIM or American product. I think buying used then scrapping the import parts and upgrading may produce a better guitar for the same, or less money. (That's my hope, anyway.)","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FQWXMPQ65G9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002KZWZQ#wasThisHelpful","R2FQWXMPQ65G9Z","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROs* Reasonable price at $79 for the full kit, shipped prime.* Pop in tremolo arm is a time saver, and convenient* Shape of tremolo arm is preferred to traditional arm - doesn't angle ""up"" as far.* Flat saddles work better for palm muting that traditional saddles (at least for me.)CONs* Lack of other finishes like Gold, Black, or Nickel* Unavailable on Amazon for some time now...how about some stock guys?SUMMARYThis is my favorite bridge for Stratocasters.  I put this on all my 2-point strat bodies, and I no longer buy bodies or guitars drilled for a 6-point tremolo because I like this 2 point bridge so much more. I originally got this factory installed on my American Deluxe, and since then I added it to a couple of American Standards and a special run MIM with 2 point setup. My only real complaint is the lack of other finishes. I've seen it left handed in Gold, but never right handed except on a factory special edition, and never in black or nickel. I can't downgrade this item based on that...but it is another example of why I have a love hate relationship with Fender.

"Pros------It's cheapIf you want something relatively low power, this could be a good fit.Would work great for amplification of a podium mike -- people speaking.Cons------Lacks 1/4"" outputs - requires speakon to 1/4 adapter if you want to run 1/4"" TS cables.Audio is not that clean...sounds muddy by comparison to better amps.Power ratings are misleading - they are peak ratings, not RMSI bought some old Behringer monitors used and ran them on a friends QSC power amp...and they sounded really clear and good. I was frankly surprised how good they sounded. So I decided to add this Behringer power amp for use in my studio with the same monitors. However, with this amp, they sounded muddy and not that great.It's not terrible...it works, but it's not the crisp clear sound I got from the QSC amp. Gotta say, not really a fan, but if you need an amp for something like people speaking at a podium, this could work well. For music...I'd recommend something clearer if you want really good sound. It works, and of course you have to be realistic at the price point which is pretty low...you can use it for music but it's no match for a better quality amp in terms of the sound quality.Wanted to like it but just put it up for sale on craigslist.

"I like Chuck's playing...a lot.I just got this and have been sampling it...have not gone through the whole thing but already it has exceeded my expectations.For the people saying there is no instruction...I think they are saying it isn't a Mel-bay/Hal Leonard 1-2-3 book.But there is a lot of instruction if you listen to what he is saying, and watch what he is playing. I bought this to get a nice clear view of Jessica, even though I am more guitar player than piano player. But I find there are good useful instructional elements that go beyond piano technique. Things like how to think about what you are playing...notions of warming up, how to approach studio work, etc. This stuff may sound boring but I have a seen a lot of players who need to hear this stuff! Beyond that...it includes 8 PDF files of notation, and the keyboard is visible from an overview view when he is playing. Presumably, as a musician most of you also have ears...so use 'em. :)Personally, I think this video not only can help you be a better piano player, but a better musician on any instrument you play.And...I just love the stuff he is playing on this video.

"Disclaimer: I purchased ""Jessica"" digitally, rather than this whole book, but the version I downloaded was from this specific book.I am using that to evaluate the quality of the book, based one (very famous) song from the book.SummaryThis is in the Piano/Vocal/Guitar format -- which means it includes guitar chords, but not guitar tab. It is intended more for a piano player and includes a treble clef and bass clef standard notation, and guitar chord charts. For songs with words the vocals are also included. If you are a piano player and want to play the chords and/or something similar to what The Allman Brothers Band recorded, then this is ok. However, if you are playing with a band and seeking the actual piano solos, they aren't here. For me that was a disappointment because that is really what I wanted.Pros- Good collection of ABB songs- For a piano player, a good starting point on the songs- for a beginner guitarist, provides chords for songs, so you can strum-relatively inexpensive at about $15Cons- For Piano player specifically -- lacks the note for note transcriptions of solos and instead has ""ad lib solo here"". That is fairly useless since if I wanted to ad lib the solo, I wouldn't have bought the sheet music!- Not really for guitar players, it is just chords. Guitarist should seek out the guitar tab versions of the songs. They are available in similar collection books, or digitally online from hal leonard's joint venture called sheet music direct US.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF4WG246H2398/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0793573734#wasThisHelpful","RF4WG246H2398","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for the case, but the one I received is not what is shown in the product photo.However, it works for me as it matches another hohner case I have.I got the same case shown here:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GF9AS6/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1It is a black case, with zipper around the side, no flap.The harps look like toys...I plan to give them to a local kids charity.It's ok for $18...as long as you mainly want the case and not the harps.UPDATED REVIEW:These never made it out of the house as a donation, they were still sitting in their case, fully packaged when I decided to try the Bb harp since my Marine Band Bb developed a bad reed. So now that I tried the actual harmonicas, I have to downgrade my rating to 1 star. The volume of these harps is about half that of a ""real"" harmonica. They feel very cheap when you play them. And on the one I tried, the 3 blow hole makes no sound at all.The volume difference between draws and blows is significant, and the volume differences from hole to hole are also noticeable. This harmonica is not suitable as a musical instrument. These not only look like toys, they ARE toys, plastic made in china. Literally non-playable junk when brand new. Don't buy these unless you plan to throw the harmonicas in the garbage and just want the case.And unfortunately, I see these are now $24 instead of $18, and at that price, it's a ripoff. You can buy a much nicer case for around $30 that holds more and has a hardshell and a handle. I even got a nice hardshell 12 harp case free with a microphone purchase so you might consider that too. The harps are total junk and NOT RECOMMENDED.If you want to play harmonica, start with 1 good quality harp in the key of C.A Marine Band, Blues Harp, or Golden Melody are good choices.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18V76NAG3548R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A2HDXA#wasThisHelpful","R18V76NAG3548R","A20JJ8634DG3FS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20JJ8634DG3FS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted to love this skimmer. Protein skimmers are a simple idea, but they can cost a ton. I thought this option might be the solution. For my set-up, it just wasn't at all.The problem I had with this skimmer is that it just doesn't stay together. It's super-thin plastic that is not snapped together, adhered together, or even firmly connected by size or pressure. It just gently rests together at four or five different places. Unless, of course, you touch it, in which case it falls apart in four or five different places.For example, my sump is a bit crowded. I couldn't even get this in the sump without it falling apart a half-dozen different ways. Once I did, moving it made it fall apart again. And going into that compartment to do anything, again, makes it fall apart.If you can (a) get this together, and (b) keep it together, it might be great for you. But I couldn't get it to do either.

"This is a great little lantern, especially for camping. I recommend it to others.TaoTronics sent this lantern to me to review, like they do for lots of people. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:1) plenty of light for walking on a path, in a small tent, or around a house in a power outage2) easy to find at night because there's a small flashing green light on the front (always on)3) very sturdy4) the light adjusts from low to high to flashing5) it has a place to hang it either upside down (like from a tent pole) or normally (for carrying it)6) it is surprisingly lightweight even though it is a tough little lanternCons:1) the positive/negative terminals of the battery chamber aren't marked2) the green light that flashes cannot be turned off, so it will slowly drain batteries if you leave batteries in it3) there's not much difference between low and high light settingsOverall, this is easily a five-star lantern, especially given the price. It's rugged, provides plenty of light, and is easy to hang or hold. It is great for camping and would be pretty good for use in a power outage. The only real drawbacks to each are that you would want to face the flashing green light on the front away from your face if sleeping, but that's not a big deal because it isn't a bright, annoying light or anything‚Äîit's subtle.For power outage use, it's a bit less ideal. You shouldn't store it with batteries in it because the flashing green light will drain them over weeks and months, and since the battery chamber doesn't have positive/negative markings, it is a little annoying figuring out how to put the batteries in when you need the lantern. Still, these aren't a big deal because you can tell how the batteries go in by looking at the spring/metal parts in the battery chamber. But terminal markings, especially large ones you could feel in the dark, would be better.But, for the price, these are small things. Still, I recommend this lantern more for camping than power outages. And of course, as of writing this review, the name of the item is ""camping light,"" so that makes sense. Overall, this is a great, rugged lantern. I recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BYZLFRIYK06N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S0W0JKG#wasThisHelpful","R1BYZLFRIYK06N","A42TV8FJP7MI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42TV8FJP7MI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great package of items. I recommend it to others.I've been using this kit, along with other tools I bought previously, to bond acrylic together for saltwater fish tanks. It's important to have fairly fresh solvent, so I needed more Weld-on 4 and this kit was a bargain since I also needed more Weld-on 16. If you're working with a big tank (or bonding a big piece of acrylic for any reason), having a second bottle applicator handy and full of Weld-on is essential in case your main bottle runs out in the middle of gluing a long piece together. So though I didn't really need more applicators, they were a great bonus.Plus, if you've never tried putting down Weld-on 4 with larger vs. small applicators, you are depriving yourself of a handy set of options.

"These are great battery-operated lights. I recommend these to others.I received four of these as a holiday gift and fell in love. I later bought four more myself. They have a great soft glow when it is dark and there is no motion, and they light up a nice-sized area of the floor well enough to see when walking. They make my trips down the stairs at nice much safer when I don't want to turn on the big oversized light and blind myself (and others).They also aren't battery hogs. I put in rechargeable AA batteries (using C-size spacers) and only have to replace them every few months. I do recommend you get rechargeable batteries, though, because these would be costly over time if you used disposables.Otherwise, these are easy to install and have held up well over time.

"This is great foam tape. I recommend it to others.I was using this tape to make boards that could help level acrylic while bonding large pieces together. Acrylic naturally warps, but if you set it on boards with strips of camper tape, the acrylic naturally sinks at the warps and makes a flat surface. A flat surface is essential to bonding two pieces of acrylic together securely. This camper tape fit the bill perfectly for that task.It would work well for other tasks, too. It attached securely to MDF board and has held that position. When I removed the acrylic tank, the camper foam didn't stick to the acrylic on the non-sticky side of the foam (aside from a little bit from pressure). It came off quickly and did not peel away from the MDF board at all‚Äîit had a firm grip on the MDF board. I've used it for a few weeks now and it shows no sign of wear despite living in my very hot and humid garage.Overall, I recommend this foam to others. You probably aren't using it for what I was doing, but it's still a great, durable foam with a strong adhesive grip on one side, which will be well-suited to many other uses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A2ZCVLSNXVP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000117C4A#wasThisHelpful","R2A2ZCVLSNXVP4","A42TV8FJP7MI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42TV8FJP7MI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an okay item, but it didn't do all the reviews said and did not work for my purposes.I was using this item as a temporary refugium to house macro algae in a saltwater tank. I was counting on the feature that it would cling to/stay on the side of the tank, as some reviews described. Unfortunately, that didn't happen for my tank and I have a guess why‚Äîmany saltwater reef tanks have more flow than non-reef tanks. The flow in my tank, even when not aimed at this breeder chamber, pushed it off the wall regularly and send it floating around and into corals. You can rig something up to keep it in place, but that wasn't an option in my particular set-up.Otherwise, this is a fine isolation chamber. I plan to put it in my sump in between a few baffles as a way to keep macroalgae where I want it (and give copepods a place to live). I think it will be great for that. It is well-made and I otherwise like this item.If you need something that will stick to the side of your tank and you have much flow in your tank, this isn't it. Otherwise, this is a good isolation chamber for the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R367VPX1B2CX0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002APRKG#wasThisHelpful","R367VPX1B2CX0G","A42TV8FJP7MI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42TV8FJP7MI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recommend these motion-detecting lights to others.Full disclosure: I was provided these lights for review purposes. That has not affected my review, however, because I only write reviews I believe in.These are great lights. In testing, they were at the bottom of three flights of stairs with the goal of lighting the bottom of the steps during evening, night, and early morning hours when lighting at the bottom of the stairs was inadequate.  The lights properly and timely activated when the steps were approached, and they remained on a short period of time after leaving the area.  The lights were bright enough to illuminate the area in the vicinity of the step. They don't make it daytime or anything, but they easily get the job done of putting convenient light where you need it and without having to think about it.There's not a lot more to say about these lights. It can be just a bit tricky opening the back compartment at first, but it's easy once you get the knack. Adding markings to the back of the device would be helpful.  However, it's otherwise easy to use them. I suggest using rechargeable batteries for these so you save in the long run.Overall, these are good lights that get the job done.

"These are solid earbuds. I recommend them to others.First up, I was given these earbuds to provide a review of them. My review is not based on that, though, as these are solid earbuds.As others have noted, these are pretty standard earbuds. The easily paired with my S4. They fit comfortably in my ears, which is rare for most of these (most other devices I have to wrestle with). It came with a few other covers that you could swap in if the default piece didn't fit well for you, but I didn't need to do that.I have listened to a variety of styles of music on these and the sound quality is very solid. They reproduce mids, highs, and even bass cleanly, which is a nice change from many other units in this range/size that can't handle hip hop, dubstep, and other bass-heavy genres. Sometimes I wish the highs were just a little more crisp, but it's hardly noticeable when I'm not actually thinking about it.These also seem pretty durable. I didn't have any trouble when using them. If I run into any issues while using these in the future, I'll update this review.One quick tip on use: The ""next track""/""previous track"" buttons, like most earbuds, double as +/- volume buttons. But unlike some others I have used where pushing + increases or decreases volume, here you have to hold the + button to increase volume. Pushing it once will just skip ahead to the next track. That's no problem, but it's the opposite of what I expected.Overall, these are great ear pieces. They perform well and are durable. I recommend them to others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FWPUFRO52K8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RSUFT5G#wasThisHelpful","R3FWPUFRO52K8H","A42TV8FJP7MI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42TV8FJP7MI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great humidifier. I recommend it to others.Perhaps because I bought so many TaoTronics products over the years, I was sent this product for review. Except for one or two items, I've been a TaoTronics fan. This humidifier is no exception.First off, this things looks really sleek. The ocean blue color of the reservoir tank is great, and the white has a high-tech look that reminds me of many Apple products. I love the nightlight that illuminates inside the tank, and the display is a fairly nice LED instead of the all-too-common cheap LED screens I usually see on tech products in this level.The unit works well. In my testing, it detected the humidity within a few points of what my wall AC panel displayed. The mister has an auto-shutoff feature that stops producing mist when it detects the humidity in the room matches or exceeds the humidity you set the unit to produce. When I tried it, the unit accurately detected the mist. Note, though, that it didn't detect it for me until I changed it from the factory default. If you want to keep yours at 40% humidity but yours doesn't detect humidity and shutoff, try cycling up to 45% and then back to the factory default 40%.The unit also has a timer and says it has an auto-shutoff feature for if the water gets too low, though I didn't test that to avoid damaging the unit. It's easy to change the humidity setting‚Äîjust push and hold the button and then cycle through 5% intervals with further button pushes. I didn't see a way to be more precise than 5% intervals, but I don't think most people will care about a 53% humidity setting vs. a 55% or 50% setting. It's equally easy to cycle through the three mist output settings (low, medium, high) by pushing the mist button. The buttons are clearly labeled so there's no guesswork here.A few quick tips in using the device. First, don't fill the reservoir through the top/output. Flip over the reservoir, remove the filter (it unscrews), and fill it there. When you pop the filter back on it won't leak or something when you flip it over as long as you hold it by the provided handle. Do be careful when filling it that you don't get water in the dimple that will be where the light goes. Although the light might be water-resistant, there's no reason to add water to where electricity will almost be.Overall, this is a solid humidifier that, as a bonus, looks great. I recommend it to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32G35NZGAVS9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7M9YQQ#wasThisHelpful","R32G35NZGAVS9R","A42TV8FJP7MI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42TV8FJP7MI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fairly sturdy selfie stick that, like the other TaoTronics products I own, I would recommend to others.First off, I should note that I was sent this product for review. Although selfie sticks aren't really my thing, I was surprised at how fun this was to use. I've done the awkward ""take a picture of me and someone else"" arm-twist at theme parks and special events too many times. The photos, even when you use a front-facing camera so you can see the screen, are usually a little odd, a little too close, or both. A selfie stick solves that problem.But a selfie stick is no use if you won't actually take it with you. The collapsible arm on this unit makes this a stick that is both versatile and has a great reach when fully extended (about 30 inches). Because it collapses, it's easy to store in a large pants pocket, cargo shorts, a backpack, or a medium-size purse (it wouldn't fit in a really small purse).This unit feels pretty sturdy because the arm is made of a fairly thick metal. It feels kind of like those extendable antenna on remote control cars. This makes for a pretty firm pull required to extend the arm fully, but it's very manageable. The weight balance shifts from the handle towards the camera when in use because the weight in the handle comes from the collapsed arm. That's not a problem, though, because the handle is ridged and easy to hold.Finally, the other features of the selfie stick work just as they should. The tension hand grips the phone well and easily fit and held onto my S4. That's critical so you don't end up dropping your phone when trying to take a photo, especially if using it in a crowd at a party, bar, club, concert, theme park, etc. The bluetooth button is large and easy to push and has virtually no lag time to trigger the camera.Overall, this is a well-designed, rugged selfie stick. If selfies are your thing, I recommend this to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29J4T8HIQCZVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI2HCS4#wasThisHelpful","R29J4T8HIQCZVT","A42TV8FJP7MI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42TV8FJP7MI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great rechargeable batteries. I highly recommend them to others.About a year and a half ago, I put a number of battery-operated devices in my home recently (hallway lights, outside lights, etc.) and I didn't want them to cost me a fortune in battery costs. I switched to rechargeable batteries to try to save money. I'll never go back to disposables‚Äîthese batteries are great.First, they last just as long as the disposables I had at the time. I put the last of my disposables in at the same time I put rechargeables in other, identical devices, and they lasted a similar duration. Recharging is easy (I use an Eneloop/Sanyo charger), though you have to charge two batteries at a time which is a bit annoying for me (my hall lights, for example, generally use three batteries each).The best thing is that you don't need a fleet of C batteries, Ds, and AAs. You can just get AAs and AAAs (if you need AAAs) and use spacers so the AAs fit in C and D-size devices. Note, though, that AA batteries have a much lower capacity and will not last as long as C or D batteries would. That works fine for me, though, because my devices are generally low-draw (LED lights, etc.). I've recharged mine maybe a half-dozen times and they're still going strong.Do be aware that this manufacturer, like many others, regularly releases new versions of batteries. The newer versions generally can be recharged more times and might have a slightly different capacity. You might want to double-check that you're buying the newest generation of product.One last warning‚Äîif you're going to use these in devices that go outside, either make sure the device is truly waterproof or consider switching to disposables. Rechargeable batteries save money over time, but not if they get waterlogged and die before you get your money's worth. For some of my devices, I still use disposables outside in case water gets in. I'd rather a cheaper disposable battery be ruined by water than a more expensive rechargeable.Overall, these are great batteries. They save money over time and are easy to use. I highly recommend them to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O2ULE3BVOI85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CWNMV4G#wasThisHelpful","R1O2ULE3BVOI85","A42TV8FJP7MI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42TV8FJP7MI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product works as described, and I recommend it to others.I was having a phosphates problem for a while in my salt water tank at work because some of my macro algae had broken down in a spot I couldn't reach and was decaying there. I also, unbeknownst to me for a while, had an reverse osmosis/de-ionization filter system that wasn't pulling all the phosphates out of my top-off water. Bottom line, I was able to get the problem in better control using PhosGuard. That's good because the excess phosphates were really feeding some hair algae that had sprung up in my tank.The one thing that you have to note about this product is that it really needs to be in a place where it gets good water circulation over the media. I haven't had much luck in applications where there isn't much flow going directly over the PhosGuard.Additionally, depending on the prices at the time of purchase, you may be able to save money by buying a bag for the PhosGuard and buying the larger quantities of PhosGuard. Once when I did the math, it was about the same price to just keep buying these 100 mL bags, but the next time I needed some it was cheaper to buy the bag and the larger bottle of PhosGuard.

"I recommend this printer to others.This is a great printer. It's fast, it has a variety of settings, and inexpensive ink is readily available. The quality of printed items is excellent, but we mainly print boring documents and I haven't tried fancy photo prints or anything like that. It also makes great copies and scans things quickly and effectively.Okay, so time for the nit-picking details. First, this printer is huge. It's like a tank. I was a bit surprised to see how huge this thing is for a modern printer. It also doesn't exactly feel modern. The noises it makes (button pushes, operating sounds, etc.) are something I'd expect to hear from a 1980s fax machine, and the buttons themselves are huge and kind of clunky. However, some users might find the oversized buttons helpful (for the same reason some people prefer larger-button cell phones, etc.).

"I enjoyed my Jawbone UP 24 for about four months but then it started to work less effectively. The lights on the band stopped coming on and the rubber-like cover started to slip over both ends. However, I was able to return mine for a replacement with no issues. I didn't keep the replacement, though, because I wanted to switch to a smart watch instead.Otherwise, however, i was a great product. I especially liked how easy it was to switch to sleep mode (just push and hold the button on the band) or to start recording an activity (same idea with an extra push). I loved that it had a thirty-minute or so idle alarm: anytime I was sitting around at work for too long, it would buzz and I'd stretch or go for a walk (if I had time at that moment). It was really great. That same buzz helped remind me to walk around more often.

"I recommend Zyrtec to others battling allergies.I adopted a shelter dog and two shelter cats and discovered, to my surprise, that I am allergic to this kind of dog. Everytime she licked me, I'd get skin irritation there and when I woke up in the morning I was all congested if she had been on the bed. We didn't want to kick her out of the bedroom (and certainly didn't want to return her!), so I tried a few different allergy products. Even though Zyrtec had not had great impact on environmental allergies I had, it worked wonders for the pet dander. I am now a few years into having the same animals and have minimal allergy problems as long as I take Zyrtec.I'll note that I also tried taking a generic brand of Zyrtec (to save money) and it did not work for me as well as Zyrtec did. I tried the other brand for a month and have tried alternating from the generic to Zyrtec, and Zyrtec always works better. It seems like the generic version wears off sooner. That's possible I suppose because, although the product mights be chemically identical in terms of active ingredient, Zyrtec might have a patented (or just better) delivery system that causes the generic brand to last less than 24 hours. Anyway, that was my experience with the generic brand in case that helps you.I recommend this product to others battling allergies, especially pet allergies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL4ABEG5YINHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000X1IZD0#wasThisHelpful","RL4ABEG5YINHU","A42TV8FJP7MI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42TV8FJP7MI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great automatic-top-off unit.I use it in a twenty gallon tank and it does its job well. The basic idea is simple: the floating water sensor is held in place by two powerful magnets (don't get your fingers or anything else between them when moving them near each other‚Äîthey snap together pretty strongly). When the water level drops, the Tunze pumps water into the tank for about 1.5 minutes. Then the pump shuts off.The one thing that you want to watch out for with this ATO is that it will pump different amounts of water depending on how high your tank is compared to the pump and water reservoir. The ATO instructions explain those numbers, though, so you don't have to guess. In the end, it won't matter much because if the unit doesn't pump enough water in when the float drops too low, it will just pump more in when the float gets low again.Overall, this is a great, cost-effective ATO.

"This is a beautiful necklace. The topaz are all excellent quality, and the necklace is well assembled. I bought this as a gift and it was very well received.My only complaint is that the metal work around the diamonds looks a little off. It's hard to tell if it's intentional to catch light or if it was chipped in assembly. Given that the same work is on the matching earrings (but it is much less noticeable there), I think it was intentional. However, it looks a little odd on very close inspection. However, no one is going to be that close to a necklace (and if they are, they probably aren't looking at the necklace's details), so it doesn't really matter. Still, that's why I scored this four stars.Overall, this is a beautiful necklace that goes great with the matching earrings. I recommend it to others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H4XNQK9LTBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043RTOW6#wasThisHelpful","R2H4XNQK9LTBK","A42TV8FJP7MI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42TV8FJP7MI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE: (increased to four stars)I've been wearing this watch now for about four months, and I've grown to like it more. Each new software update has gradually increased it reliability. It still sometimes disconnects from my phone momentarily and does not receive updates (like texts), but that only happens maybe one day a week. Repairing it seems to solve the problem. It also remains fairly mediocre at voice recognition spoken into the 360, but it's decent if you enunciate very carefully. All in all, it's a pretty solid product.One last new tip: if you want the metal band, don't buy it from Motorola. A Pebble black metal wrist band matches the black Moto 360 pretty well, and it's only $20 or so. It fits perfectly on the Moto360, so there's no need to buy Motorola's version (which as of writing this update is much more expensive than the Pebble metal band) unless you want a perfect color match to the body of the 360 (the Pebble band is very close, though).***ORIGINAL REVIEW:Overall, this is a solid smartwatch. I would rather give it 3.5 stars, but I can't do that here, so I'll lean towards 3 stars just slightly. In a nutshell, the 360 feels like a first-generation offering, and it doesn't do everything that I want it to do, but it's pretty great at what it does. This review is based on my daily use of the 360 since a few days after it was launched.Short version:The 360 is a great watch for receiving alerts like text messages, seeing your calendar appointments, and doing simple tasks from your wrist via voice command. It also looks gorgeous and feels sturdy. It's the first smartwatch that I've had that I can say both of those about, and I've had several other smartwatches. It also has great battery life and great watch face options. However, the 360 doesn't excel at voice commands, it loses connection with the phone from time to time for no apparent reason, and it has some limitations that are silly (read on for more on that). With a little more power, it could go from a watch that I like (4 stars apparently means ""I like it"") to a watch I truly love.Longer version:Pros:First off, the watch looks great. Though the metal band version is what I'm after once they release it, the 360 looks better than any smartwatch I've owned before (except perhaps the Gear Fit with the curved screen, but that was basically a fitness band).The 360 also has a great feel to it: the metal base feels sturdy and like a quality watch. The glass is durable and smooth, though I still put a screen protector on it. If you're wearing a Movado or something nicer, this isn't going to be ""luxury"" in your book, but as far as smartwatches go, this is a high-quality smartwatch that looks great.The 360's display is also great. It's bright, colorful, and makes good use of the circular display. You can see the pixels if you look closely, but that doesn't detract from everyday use for me.The 360 performs well. I haven't had it hang with anything I've done. When the watch is starting up, though, I have seen it stutter on the animated logo graphics.The 360 is solid for everyday tasks, too. I love being able to see when my next appointment is on my calendar by just glancing at my wrist, and receiving texts is easy even if my phone is tucked away.Finally, the watch has a great battery life. I can easily wear mine all day and only be at around 50% when I go to bed. Still, though, you should assume you'll be charging this either every day or every other day.Cons:The 360 is limited in what it can do. If you want to use it to do voice commands, it can do that, but imperfectly and you need your phone in range for it to work. For example, I often tell mine to start a timer when I'm cooking something, etc., and I sometimes have to tell it a few times. You also have to get the commands just right or you'll end up with a Google search on people who play music instead of a command to, say, open your music player.The same limits apply to voice-activated text messages, which are prone to errors. Plus, you don't have a way to correct what it heard you say, so you better hit ""cancel"" on the message before it finishes sending if it interpreted your text as something ... awkward. Even though my phone takes voice commands with no problem, my 360 has some issues with understanding what I'm saying.The 360 also gets a little limited when you have two text messages (or more) that have come in at once. If I get one text, I can open it on the 360 and read it then swipe it away. But if two come in together or before I check the first one, I can't open either one unless I get my phone out. That's silly. Hopefully this will change with a future software upgrade.The 360 sometimes loses its connection with your phone for no apparent reason. Even when they are right next to each other, it still seems to happen a few times a day.Finally, the 360 doesn't work as seamlessly as I'd like with my various other apps. That, too, will hopefully change with time.  This is, after all, a first-generation product.No metal band. I don't want a leather band, and Motorola should have launched with a better band. The leather band does not feel that quality, and it detracts from the overall luxury feel of the 360.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XHWECQODD5R0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC8PMUK#wasThisHelpful","R2XHWECQODD5R0","A42TV8FJP7MI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42TV8FJP7MI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I recommend this to others. It's not a fancy rotary, but it gets the job done at a great price.The rotary itself gets up to speed fairly quickly and does a good job. It doesn't hold onto the attachments quite as well as I would like, but as if you're paying attention you'll see if it is slipping. I have only had that problem infrequently.One thing this definitely has going for it is the wide-variety of accessories. It's a great bargain when you include all of them. Note that they aren't all fancy, though. The cutting discs, for instance, have broken on me a few times cutting things. Be sure you wear safety goggles and hand protection in case this happens. As others have noted, the case for the accessories isn't very fancy and opens easily.Overall, this is a great item for the price. The quality isn't the best possible, but it's very good and just as good as any other rotary I saw at this price.

"I highly recommend this to others looking to put some oomph in their coral.Before I tried this, I was skeptical. I dose a variety of other supplements, do regular water changes, run the core reef tank equipment such as a protein skimmer and high flow, and I have both plenty of reef rock for filtration plus supplemental mechanical and chemical filtration. I figured: how much could this really do?Now I know. I feed about once a week and my corals have an obvious response. My blue ridge heliopora has come back from almost never opening up after feedings of this, my goniopora loves it, and even my low-maintenance corals like zooanthids respond to this stuff. The feeding response is obvious, too: the discs of my sofies enlarge visibly and the whole specimen looks healthier.I haven't seen a water-quality hit either. My ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates are all still at zero, even with my protein skimmer turned off for the last few weeks (long story). I do feed only once a week, and it's target feeding for all of my corals in moderation.All in all, this is a great supplement.

I used mine to cut four holes through 3/4 inch birch so far, and I'm sure I'll use it for other things in the future.Be sure to adjust the pilot bit to be slightly ahead of the cutting edge of the hole saw. Otherwise, the spinning motion of the hole saw will move the drill out of place and you'll scratch up your surface (or worse yet, drill the hole in the wrong place).Overall, these are a great, functional hole saw.

"I can't recommend this product to others. Mine had a missing item (the squeegee card) and they were cut to the wrong size.First, these were missing an item. There was no squeegee card in mine. Apparently they have been discontinued and are no longer included with this product. You can use a credit card or gift card, though, and they do the trick. So this isn't a big deal.Second, these are the wrong size. Some people get the right size but some don't. Mine were too big. As a result, the edge of all the protectors in mine accumulated random fuzz and debris because the protector was too large for the watch face and the adhesive grabbed random debris from normal wear. It looked ugly.They also are imperfect plastic. The first one I installed had weird warping in the plastic, which made it unattractive. When I replaced it, the next one has slight ripples in the plastic. It's not on improperly, the plastic is just naturally imperfect.Finally, in terms of touchscreen use, they did not interfere with use of the Moto 360.I have contacted Skinomi and they say they are sending a new set that will be the correct size.

"I recommend this charger to others. It's a great model that combines style, versatility, and charging power.The RAVPower 3rd Gen Deluxe 15000 mAh is a convenient way to charge your devices away from home. Though larger than the RAVPower mini, this version is still small enough to fit in a purse or suit pocket.This device is great for traveling. If you don't want to be tied to an airport or train station wall or charging station with a dozen people, you could take this along. Or, while on a long plane trip, you could recharge on the plane. If you flew overseas, for example, this could be a great device to have along. You will need to check, of course, the rules on traveling with a device like this, which may vary, but these seem fine with TSA.It's also great in everyday life, even if you don't travel a lot. For example, a few times last week I was away from home and needed to charge my phone. There was no wall outlet available one of the times and the other time I was in someone else's car. Both times, I just plugged my phone into the charger and was good to go. Both times I started well below 50% and used my RAVPower to get back up to full power. I did not need to recharge the RAVPower between uses, and it still had some charge left over after both uses.The 3rd Gen Deluxe is also easy to use. An LED bar on the unit tells you how much power it has by displaying different lengths of blue light. You can plug it into your computer USB port or a wall charger (not included, but the cable that goes in the wall charger is). Be sure to use the right ports for charging your device vs. charging your phone.

"This is a great scraper for a great price. I recommend it to others with glass aquariums.I use this scraper on a 20 gallon reef tank that has some tight edges. The razor does a good job of scraping off algae and crud, but it would be rather risky to use on acrylic surfaces. Even on glass, you'll want to be careful to keep the blade parallel to the glass surface and apply fairly even pressure so you don't accidentally gouge the surfaces.In summary, as long as you're careful, this is a great scraper.

I found that my magnesium was in a good place.As some other reviewers noted, the container the items are stored in is fairly cheap plastic. But, it gets the job done and the rest of the kit is great quality.I have used many test kits over the years for many different parameters (standard reef parameters like nitrates, nitrites, ammonia, pH, KH, calcium, phosphates, copper, etc.). The Red Sea test kits are some of the best out there. They come with various tools that make testing easier and safer like droppers and special vials for mixing.

"Auto open/close has always been one of my requirements for an umbrella. I have small kids so I usually only have 1 free hand. Being able to open with a push of a button is very convenient. The open/close function has worked great every time I have used it over the last week since I received the umbrella. I like the compact size. The canvas is plenty large enough to offer full coverage and the handle is shorter than the average handle. I actually like that, but it may not be what everyone is looking for. When the umbrella is closed and wrapped up, it fits in a pouch that keeps it protected so it won't get ripped when stored. It's a good, small size so you can easily keep it in a backpack (where I keep mine) or a large purse. I walked in the rain for about 1-3 minutes at a time during 5 different occasions. No water leaked in and I stayed nice and dry. There was virtually no wind though so I didn't get to test out the wind resistance.

"The first thing you notice when opening the box is that the washcloths are unbelievably soft. Definitely not something that will scratch. Between the softness and the fact there are no dyes or chemicals, these are perfect for babies (or adults) with sensitive skin. I put 2 in the bathroom to be used during showers for my toddler. I keep 2 in my kitchen so that I can reuse them to wash her face and hands when she makes a mess eating. The other 2 are in my diaper bag for cleanups while we're out. Usually I use baby wipes, but something more absorbent like the washcloths comes in very handy in certain situations that wipes just aren't enough for.

"I keep the Reboot Energy Spray next to my bed. Each morning I use the spray when my alarm first goes off then hit snooze. When the alarm goes off again 10 minutes later I am always ready to get right up. I usually do 5-7 sprays each time and within those 10 minutes I experience a noticeable increase in energy. It lasts for a few hours and when it wears off I don't experience a drastic drop in energy. It's a good gradual drop. I use it in the afternoon for a second boost most days. I hadn't told my husband I was using this and on the third day he asked, ""What's up with you and all this energy?"" I was very impressed that it was working well enough for my (usually oblivious) husband to notice. :-) Prior to using the spray I took a B-12 capsule daily. The spray is more convenient and it works faster and longer. I also love the cinnamon taste. It's an energy boost and breath spray all in one.

"I maybe only be 32 years old, but I feel like my skin tells a different story. I generally have very dry skin that is looser than it should be. I have been using the Joyal Beauty Hyaluronic Acid for about 3 weeks. I have not been using a moisturizer along with it since I wanted to see how well it did on its own. My skin is now better moisturized and less dry than it was when I used a daily facial moisturizer. It makes no sense to me, but I'm happy for the improvement. I haven't noticed a visual difference in firmness, but I can feel it so I think it's just a matter of time.I have used other HA serums in the past that were not as beneficial and that weren't in proper containers. I have done my research and it really is essential to be in a dark container with no exposure to air. The Joyal bottle offers those necessities. I also have a background in health and nutrition. I can't even express how important it is for products that you ingest or put on your skin on a regular basis to be organic and free of parabans and chemicals. I also only use products manufactured in a facility that follows GMP standards because it's the only way to ensure quality.

"I have recently lost a decent amount of weight, but my older sister has been struggling for over a year with not much success. I gave her a bottle of Diet Super Blend to try and help her out. She has been using it for 3 weeks. Within the first few days she said her energy was way up. She had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and actually had the energy in the afternoon to workout. That alone made a huge difference in her efforts and mood. She has lost 9 lbs since she starting taking this supplement. That's more than she lost in the previous 2 months!! She hasn't experienced any side effects and she said she ""feels amazing.""

"My husband often comes home from work at 7pm having eaten nothing all day. He's very busy at work and rarely gets a break. He doesn't have time to eat. I figured having some protein bars in his desk drawer was a good solution since they are convenient and quick. The 22 Days bars have a better nutrition ratio than an average meal. He gets a decent amount of calories while not having to spend much time or really any effort to get a healthy small ""meal."" He is very happy with the ratio of protein, fat, and fiber. The levels are on point with what you would want and expect from a protein bar. He prefers to eat organic so that's another great bonus. He has tried 3 different flavors. His favorite by far was the almond butter chocolate chip. He really liked the taste of that one. He said the peanut butter chocolate chip nirvana is okay, but he couldn't finish the coconut chocolate chip bar. The flavors do need improvement, but as far as nutrition and healthy eating is concerned, these bars are high above the competition.I received three 22 Days protein bars at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

"I've been working on losing the baby weight and just don't have time to go to the gym. I have an elliptical at home, but doing the same thing all the time gets old. It's also in the playroom in the basement so not always the most convenient for a quick workout. That's where a jump rope fits in perfectly. I keep my Crossfit jump rope in the living room so I can grab it for 5 or 10 minute workouts throughout the day. It's perfect for using while I watch TV... something I normally do while sitting on the couch.The Crossfit jump rope is very well made and the cable seems a much sturdier choice than a traditional rope. It's slightly weighted so it keeps its shape and it doesn't get tangled. I appreciate the ball bearings in the handle which gives a much more fluid movement. The handles aren't particularly comfortable and it would be nice if they were padded, but if that's the only (very small) negative then I'm fine with that. I am the only one that uses the jump rope so I did have my husband cut off the excess rope that isn't needed. He said it wasn't super easy, but also not that difficult. You're not just going to use scissors though. I also find the bag the jump rope comes in to be a nice bonus. I can put it away neatly when I'm done and keep it out of reach from the kids.I received the Crossfit jump rope at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

"I always sleep with an eye mask. I can't fall asleep without one. I have two other sleep masks already. One I love and one I tolerate. I only used the extra one when the good one was being washed or I couldn't find it. I plan to throw that extra one away because I now have two equally great sleep masks. The Rested Eyes mask is very soft and comfortable. The microfleece is perfect for cool temperatures. Our bedroom is always cooler than I'd like and having that extra layer of warmth on my face is very nice. The straps are adjustable for length so you can get the right fit around your head. For me the straps were plenty long enough and fit comfortably. I didn't feel the mask was too snug at all, yet it fit tight enough to block out all light. I also really liked the double straps. Being able to have one higher and one lower ensured the mask stays in place all night. I have used it every night for almost 2 weeks and I always wake up with it in the same spot and have had no light break through. I also always sleep with ear plugs.

"Delicious! I made this for dinner a few nights ago to be a side with grilled steak and peppers. The directions are very straight-forward and easy to follow. The rice came out the exact texture I expected and it was not al dente or over cooked. My husband, 7 year old, and I all loved it. The 2 year old wasn't convinced, but that's not surprising. My daughter and I thought the flavor and spice level were perfect. My husband likes things VERY spicy so he felt it was too mild and he added additional spices to his. I did add a little butter when cooking it per the optional instructions, but didn't need to add any additional butter or anything else.Of course the flavor is extremely important, but the quality of the product is a very close second. We try to stick with organic food with most of what we eat. Especially if the kids are going to have it. I love that this brand is organic with no GMOs.

"All my life I have just had the cheap white plastic rings that I bought from a department store for a couple dollars. Those types of rings don't look good and they are a pain to hook. I was offered a promotional code to try the Just Hang Em shower curtain hooks at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I figured it was about time for an upgrade. They make such a big difference. First of all they are fairly easy to install on the rod and to hook the shower curtain and liner. We have a pretty heavy curtain, but the weight is no problem for these hooks. They do not sag at all and the way the hooks close really does ensure the curtain and liner can't fall off the hooks. They slide easily without making much noise or catching on our grooved rod. I haven't had them long enough to back-up the ""no rust"" claim, but they're all brass and seem like they are very good quality so I don't foresee that being any kind of issue. The rolling balls on the top are not only functional, but attractive. They add a nice look to the hooks and bathroom.

"I have been taking this every afternoon consistently for just over 2 weeks. I have been breastfeeding for 2 years and have actually GAINED weight during that time. I lost 6 lbs over the last 2 weeks and the only change I made was adding L-Carnitine Tartrate to my daily regimen. I can't even tell you how relieved I am to have seen the number on the scale finally go down after all this time. I have 75 lbs to lose in total and this seems to have kick started things for me to get me towards that goal. During those 2 weeks I did not change my diet or exercise at all. So with a combination of L-Carnitine, healthy eating, and exercise I should finally be able to get this weight off! Also, during those 2 weeks my husband and 2 daughters all got a pretty bad cold that lasted for over a week. I got a very mild cold that lasted 4 days. I'm attributing that to the immune boost I got from taking these supplements. I'm going to get more for my husband to take because when he's sick he's a big baby. Obviously I can't attest to how well they're helping with heart/kidney health or bone lose reduction, but seeing how much they have helped in the other areas I am pretty confident that this is a quality product that delivers what is promised. I also LOVE that there are no GMOs, pesticides, fillers, etc. It's very hard to find a product that is so pure. I used to sell vitamins and I know how important those aspects. I also realize the unquestionable importance of a supplement being made in the USA in a NSF facility. The regulations followed ensure excellent safety, quality, and efficacy.

"Prior to getting these locks, we only had the ones that go inside the door that you pull out and then press down on. Recently, my 2 year old opened the cabinet door under the kitchen sink and was able to pull out the dishwasher detergent!!!! Those locks open too much and they aren't safe enough. Fortunately I was standing right there, but those locks could lead to a very dangerous situation. A week later I was offered a promotional code to try these locks at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Talk about great timing. First thing I did was put a lock on the kitchen sink cabinet. Now they don't open more than maybe a centimeter. No little hands are getting in there and nothing dangerous is coming out! I put 2 more on my other low cabinets, one on my toilet since the same 2 year old is a little too curious in the bathroom, and 1 on my fridge. Yes, that only comes to 5, however, the package comes with 6. A word of advice, before you put one of these on your refrigerator you should think about everyone that needs to get into your fridge. Don't be like me and put it up above the handles where your 6 year old can't reach it! She can't get a chair every time she needs to get into the fridge. What was I thinking??? LOL. I had to remove the lock and throw it away and put a new lock under the handles. I'll tell you those things hold really tight! It was on less than 3 minutes when we realized what I had done. The instructions say to leave for 24 hours to let them set. They were very set in 3 minutes and we couldn't just pull them off. I love that they are so strong. We looked up on the Baby-Keeps website how to remove it. Once we knew what to do it was easy to remove and it left no damage. These locks work very well and are easy to resize and use on just about anything. They're also easy for adults and older kids to open, but younger kids won't be able to figure it out. Baby-Keeps also included a cute snail that can be used to hang things on the wall. Nice bonus. I highly recommend these locks and I think they will be a new ""go-to"" for baby shower gifts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29KUUH9O5ENCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UE7RLJM#wasThisHelpful","R29KUUH9O5ENCH","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the caramel nut flavored coffee as a gift for my husband for Father's Day. He only ever buys the store brand coffee so I thought this would be a nice treat. I received a promotional code to get this at a discount in exchange for my honest review and it couldn't have come at a better time. The smell is so strong (in a good way) that when I hid it under the bed my husband came home that night and mentioned smelling something great, but not being able to tell what it was. As soon as I gave it to him a few days later he said, ""That's it! That's the amazing smell."" We both kept sniffing the bag. It was kinda weird. LOL. Within 5 minutes he had it in the coffee pot and was brewing 12 cups worth. He likes his coffee cold so he usually brews it ahead of time and keeps a few days worth in the fridge. I think this was the first time he drank hot coffee in about 3 years! He added nothing to it though he normally adds cream and sugar, mostly because the store brand stuff isn't that good. He also never drinks more than one cup at a time. He drank 2 hot cups of coffee within 20 minutes and kept saying how much he loved the flavor. Before every sip he would take a big whiff because the smell of the freshly brewed coffee is even better than it is in the package. I think it goes without saying that the gift went over very well! He also mentioned he liked that the bag was resealable. He often has to use Ziploc bags to keep his other coffee fresh so this is an added bonus. Personally I don't like coffee. At all. Not even a little. I gave this a try since he loved it so much and because I thought it was a good idea for my review.  I actually took 2 sips and was like ""Hmm that didn't make me gag."" It may not seem like it, but that is REALLY saying something! My husband was so happy with the coffee that we will absolutely be trying every single flavor that Latitude 23.5 offers.

My husband and I kept commenting on how long it was staying up and flying around even when she stopped moving. She dragged it on the ground a few times and there were no tears or anything.

"I have been taking Vitamin D for years. Just 1000 IU a day though. I thought it was plenty, but my doctor recently told me I was low in Vitamin D and that was why I was experiencing muscle weakness, fatigue, and depression. I started taking 3 pills every day, but then I received a promotional code to try this 5,000 IU supplement at a discount in exchange for my honest review and was thrilled to get an even higher dose in just 1 pill. I have been taking ActiveFlourish Vitamin D daily for almost 3 weeks. My muscle weakness is 100% gone!!! My fatigue and depression have diminished significantly. Any residual symptoms are likely caused by something else because taking this supplement is clearly working wonders for me. I'm not surprised I have low Vitamin D since I live in Maine and we have long winters plus I'm a home-body so I barely go outside even in the summer. I'm not getting the Vitamin D from the sun. If you don't get outside often and you're experiencing any of these symptoms it's likely due to a Vitamin D deficiency. Taking 5,000 IU will absolutely make a difference in how you feel. I love that it's D3 because that's the best form to take. D2 is not sufficient enough. I also appreciate that it's made in the USA and in an FDA approved facility.

I received a promotional code to get this at a discount in exchange for my honest review so I decided to give it to him for Father's Day. That went over very well!

It's a great size, looks very nice, and closes to keep all off the spices fresh and separate without needing their own individual lids. The spices provided are everything needed to make perfect, authentic Indian dishes (besides fresh ingredients of course). We only had 3 of those spices already so getting them all at once and having them in one place is very convenient. The recipe book is well organized and nicely put together. They have a great variety of dishes for all preferences.They provide information on each spice and there are 27 recipes. My husband's favorite Indian dish is Lamb Vindaloo. The book provides a recipe for ""Steak & Ale Vindaloo"" so that was the first dish he made, but he substitute in lamb in place of the steak. It was fantastic! It was especially impressive since he had never made Indian food before. We both loved it! A week later he made my favorite dish Chicken Masala. It was different than what I'm used to, but it was still absolutely delicious. We're looking forward to making more dishes with this set and trying new dishes we've never had before.

"This is the first time I have used what I would consider a ""real"" face mask. I have only ever used the cheap ones from local department stores. I was offered this facial mask at a discount in exchange for my honest review. First off, there is NO comparison to the cheap stuff. I'm now realizing what a waste of time and money I put in to that junk. I have had this for 3 weeks and I have used it 4 times. It is suggested to use it once per week. I like that it comes with an applicator though it's not necessary. It goes on smooth and spreads easily. It dries in just a few minutes and doesn't make my face feel stiff and like I can't talk. It rinses off very easily and leaves no residue behind. My face really does feel cleaner after and I love the smell. Can't quite figure out what it is, but it's familiar. The best part about using this clay mask is I have noticed my pores are shrinking. I usually have HUGE pores on my nose and chin along with blackheads. The blackheads are almost completely gone!!! I have also noticed a pretty good reduction in a few acne scars.Yes, I am one of those people that has a habit of picking at pimples. After only 4 uses those results are impressive in my book. Though it's not essential for me, it is definitely a bonus that the mask has all natural and organic ingredients. The fact that I've used it so few times and have not only seen some improvement in my skin, but also the container looks like I haven't even touched it and will therefore clearly last quite a while, tells me this product is high quality and worth the cost.

"I have been using little kid scissors with a pink handle in the bathroom for years. Never really thought much about it, but when I received a promotional code to try these nose hair scissors at a discount in exchange for my honest review, I figured it was time to get some nice, adult scissors in the bathroom. First of all, I do not use these for nose hair though based on how much I like them and how well they work I believe they would be excellent for clipping nose hair. I have used the scissors around 8 times in the last 3 weeks. I use them to trim little hairs on my forehead hair line. They cut very precisely and I am able to get much closer to my skin than I did with my old scissors. I also use the scissors to cut split ends off my hair fairly regularly. They do a great job and I never cut off more than I intend. My husband uses these scissors to trim his beard. He originally told me we didn't need new scissors, but after using them the first time he said the words every wife loves to hear... ""I was wrong."" He said he gets a much cleaner look with these since they are so precise and sharp. We both find them comfortable to use and think they are very well made and agree with the description that they are clearly high quality. I also appreciate that they come in a pouch to keep them clean. The round tip is nice since it protects you from cutting yourself. One of the reasons I used to have kid scissors in the bathroom was because we have kids and I didn't want any accidents! I used these to trim my 6 year old's bangs and I wasn't concerned in the slightest that I would cut her. We highly recommend these for any hair related needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29U9PNU3BX1IE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBO4OW2#wasThisHelpful","R29U9PNU3BX1IE","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am by no means an athlete and I barely exercise. Yeah, I know that's not good. However, I do have a shoulder injury that is unexplained. I have been dealing with the pain and weakness for about 4 months. It was even bad enough that one night my arm ""let go"" and I dropped my daughter. I went to the doctor and she suggested physical therapy. As a stay-at-home mom I don't have time for that. My doctor recommended kinesiology tape. Two weeks later I received a promotional code to try this VARA tape at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Good timing! I wrap my neck and shoulder similar to the way it's done on the package. I followed directions to warm it up and let it set for 30 mins. I have been using the tape for 3 weeks and I have only applied it 3 times. Each application has easily lasted a full week even with taking showers. The tape stayed in place very well and didn't peel at all. When I removed it, it came off easily. It left just a little residue, but it was very easy to clean off. The instruction e-book that was emailed is very well written and detailed. I greatly appreciated that since I had never used kinesiology tape before. I do wish there was a specific section for neck/shoulder application though. Now for the most important part... my shoulder/neck pain is nearly gone. I have significantly better movement in the area than I did before and it barely hurts at all and only during certain movements unlike before where it was constant. I can't say how this compares to other kinesiology tape, but I can definitely say that it exceeded my expectations and I will happily recommend it and continue purchasing it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W054ZU6AM8XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GQK0TCM#wasThisHelpful","R2W054ZU6AM8XU","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm fairly new to the whole working out thing. I went to the gym for a little while YEARS ago and have fallen very out of shape since. I wanted something I could do at home where I would feel comfortable, but actually get a decent workout. This resistance band set is exactly what I needed! I received a promotional code to try this at a discount and I am very happy I took advantage of the offer. First off the bands are a great quality. They are very well-made and sturdy. I have no fear of them tearing or snapping. The resistance levels are abundant since you can add them together to get a whole bunch of different resistance amounts. I'm still on a fairly low resistance, but I love that it's a product that can grow with me as my strength improves. I have used these alone (I looked up videos online to find suggestions on the best ""moves"") and I've used them with my Taebo videos. They make a perfect addition. The possibilities are endless on how you can utilize these for all different abilities for every different muscle. My favorite part is that it comes with the ankle straps. It's an amazing workout for my legs and glutes. My house isn't big and I don't have room for workout equipment so resistance bands are an excellent tool and the Fitness Glory bands are definitely the way to go!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22C3J06GVOHRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGKVC5U#wasThisHelpful","R22C3J06GVOHRC","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are just too perfect! My husband's biggest pet peeve is that I reuse cutting boards. Meaning I'll leave it on the counter for a few days and just keep using it. When I told him I had the opportunity to get a promotional code to try these at a discount he told me I HAD to get them no matter what! Haha. They are small, but in a good way. We don't have a lot of counter space and these fit very well while still having plenty of space to cut up varies foods. They are thin, but sturdy and stand up well to knives. They clean easily and the handle is great for hanging them out of the way. My favorite part is the grooves that help catch juices that run from tomatoes, lemons, etc when you cut them. No more spilling over onto the counter creating yet another thing to clean.

"My husband was very eager to try this when it arrived. I think it was out of the box only 5 minutes before he was outside washing our cars. My husband is a stickler for having our cars clean. He always took them to a car wash and I would complain about the money. He started cleaning them at home and complained often that washing with the big yellow sponge was useless. I received a promotional code for this car wash set and figured my husband might like it a little better. I was right... well actually that's an understatement since he thinks it's ""genius"" and ""works better than going to the car wash."" I checked out all 3 pieces before he used them and noted that they were very soft and well made. They seem quite durable. My husband said the gloves fit him perfectly. He loved that he could use this set both inside and outside our vehicles. The inside dusting and window cleaning was easy and worked wonderfully. For the exterior he said the the mesh on the sponge did a great job for getting bugs etc off the windshield. Cleaning was fast and easy with no damage to the paint since the microfiber is so soft. He noted that the sponge holds a good deal of water so he didn't have to dip it in the bucket nearly as often is he did with our old sponge. My husband's biggest pet peeve is our neighbor's tree that hangs over our driveway constantly dropping thousands of buds all over our cars. He's afraid they will damage the cars so he likes to clean them off often. This car wash set makes that fast and easy and most importantly affordable since we no longer see the need for going to the car wash. We've only had these for about 3 weeks and they have already gone through the laundry 5 times. They still look brand new which goes to show the quality is excellent. My only wish was that I had waited to give these to my husband for Father's Day since he loves them so much!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R312N80JMSN6G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFCPF16#wasThisHelpful","R312N80JMSN6G3","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a different yoga mat last summer that was fairly cheap. I used it and found out why. It was too short and too thin. I had been meaning to get a different one when I received a promotional code for a discount on the Ashram yoga mat. I decided to give it a try and see how it compares. Honestly there is NO comparison. This mat is really long. I'm 5'4"" and there is plenty of room for me to do yoga on this mat with my almost 2 year old joining in at the end of the mat. She copies me and we can do poses together. Besides yoga, I really enjoy pilates. This mat is far superior in regards to comfort on my back. It has a perfect thickness with a great level of cushioning. I liked the non-slip side since I do yoga in my playroom which is on a rug. The mat does not move at all. The handle makes it very convenient for transport. Not something I do often, but I can see where it would make it very convenient for someone that goes to classes outside their home and has to travel with their yoga mat. The only downside was that one side of the mat keeps rolling up. It's not too much of an issue for me now that the mat has been on the floor and used for a few weeks, but it could be an issue if you're regularly rolling the mat. I still give it 5 stars because a little rolling isn't enough to detract from the overall positive qualities though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R85F99JKX9O5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P2T3IG2#wasThisHelpful","R85F99JKX9O5P","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This knee brace is so well made. Very sturdy with strong seams and velcro. Definitely will last a long time. It had a strong smell at first, but I just aired it out for a few days and the smell completely dissipated. I have had a mysterious knee pain in just my left knee for about 2 months now. My doctor gave me stretching ideas that really didn't help. When I received a promotional code to try this brace for a discount I thought it was great timing and definitely worth a shot. I have worn the brace at least a few hours a day for about 2 weeks. My knee pain is not gone, but is significantly better. I am no longer making pain noises when I stand up and my knee hasn't ""given out"" at all. Something it had done a few times that resulted in me falling over. It's not all that comfortable to wear alone so I wear it over my pants. I do wish the straps were longer. I wear size 12 pants and the straps for the brace just barely wrap around my knee enough to hold tight. It's technically fine for me, but someone of a larger size would probably find this wouldn't be large enough for them. I do not currently have a need for the ankle brace, but I did try it on and felt that it fit very well and was comfortable. Happy to have that in case it's needed in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV9SIAZ6GLRHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7FMEOK#wasThisHelpful","RV9SIAZ6GLRHT","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this watercolor pencil set for my daughter's birthday present for her 7th birthday. Drawing is basically her favorite interest and she's amazing. She has filled so many drawing books with hundreds of crayon drawings. I felt like it was time to step it up a notch so I jumped at the chance when I got a promotional code to try these at a discount. I haven't given them to her yet, but I did try them out for myself to make sure they were going to work the way I hoped. They are perfect! There's a great variety of beautiful, bold colors, the pencils are strong and the tips do not break easily. They are very easy to sharpen without any issues. The color covers nice and smooth. The practice drawing I did came out beautiful and I have never used watercolor pencils before. This is so much better than using regular colored pencils or trying to get a good effect with watercolor paints. I love the metal case that they come in. It looks nice and will keep them all together and safe. Pretty important when they belong to a child. She is going to be thrilled. I do agree that paper specifically intended for watercolor is best. I used regular printer paper and it was fine, but I could tell it would have been better with the correct type of paper. Though I loved the pencils and I was surprised how well I did with them, I am NOT an artist so I'm not going to share my painting right now, but I anticipate my daughter making some very share-worthy pictures that I will post later. :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CK1P1JTUB9LS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PE8IHCG#wasThisHelpful","R3CK1P1JTUB9LS","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried many face serums over the years. It's becoming more and more necessary for me to need a great one. When I received a promotional code to try this at a discount I decided it was worth the try. I was right. The most important thing I wanted it for was to help with scaring. I'm not proud to admit it, but I tend to have a nervous habit of picking at my pimples and leaving acne scars. I have 3 very noticeable ones on my chin. I've been using this serum for almost 3 weeks and the scars that I've had for 2 years are about half what they used to be. I am in shock. I'm not sure if they'll go away completely, but I'm thrilled with the results so far and anticipate even more improvement. I also love that the serum has made a nice difference in skin firmness around my neck. I've lost weight recently and loose skin was a little bit of an issue. Again, not completely rectified, but clearly going in the right direction. The serum is very moisturizing so I don't even bother with an additional moisturizer. It's not greasy or sticky and absorbs nicely. The pump works well and doesn't give too much so I'm not wasting any by getting too much out at once. My skin is looking great and is crazy smooth. I will be happy to continue using this and be able to stop searching since I found a serum that really works for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FZIOT48BE5XN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MDKICPK#wasThisHelpful","R1FZIOT48BE5XN","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mother has celiac disease and a great number of digestive issues. I've been telling her for years to try a probiotic, but she never got around to it. When I received a promotional code for the Ultra-Biotics, I figured I'd buy it for her and get her to see how much it can really help. With celiac she doesn't absorb nutrients from her food very well. This leads to her being very tired. The first thing she noticed after taking these is that her energy levels increased a great deal. She also noticed after about 2 weeks that her nails were stronger and her skin looked better. Again, issues she experienced because of the lack of vitamins absorbed. Clearly this was helping! She also noticed she had less gas and stomach ""noise"" after eating. She is very happy with the results and plans to continue with this brand for the long haul. She also said she appreciated the convenience of not having to refrigerate the bottle. The price is great considering the fact you're getting the benefits of both a probiotic and prebiotic. It's not easy to find a good quality product that has both for such a great price. My mother says, ""Thank you for such a wonderful product.

"I recently went on a diet and started eating much healthier. This included a salad for lunch every day plus 1-2 veggies with dinner. Also more fruit. Well it didn't take long before my digestive system was upset with all the ruffage. I was experiencing gas, bloating, crazy stomach noises, and stomach pain. I was advised to take a probiotic and when I received a promotional code for the Living Natural probiotic I figured it was a good idea to give it a try. Almost immediately I noticed a difference and within 4 days my symptoms were completely gone. Gone! Absolutely no more stomach issues from the veggies/fruits. That was a big relief on it's own, but I also noticed I had more energy. Now I can't be sure it's because of the supplements or my improved eating, but I think the probiotics definitely had something to do with it. At the very least the fact that they are likely helping with the digestion of my food which I'm sure increased the amount of nutrients my body is absorbing. I feel like this probiotic is also helping in my weight loss efforts. It's a quality product that I'm happy to recommend and continue taking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3APR7XD54A6IH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N18F0NA#wasThisHelpful","R3APR7XD54A6IH","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a nursing mom and I have 2 nursing covers already. Not super thrilled with either of them. When I was given a promotional code in exchange for my honest review I figured it was worth giving another cover a try. Compared to the other 2 covers I have, this is definitely my favorite. It's very large and gives excellent, full coverage. I am nursing a 21 month old so we need a good sized cover to remain discreet. The velcro fastener worked well for me. It was easy to attach and line up where I needed it so that I still had a good opening at the top so I can see my daughter, but not show too much. The pattern is very nice. Not too flashy and very gender neutral. I appreciate that the cover comes with a bag to help keep it clean. I used to keep my other covers in plastic Ziploc bags in my diaper bag. When I first received this I noticed a slight odor to it and the material was a bit stiff. I washed it before using it and that removed the odor and softened the fabric to where I believe a nursing cover should be. It was soft and not irritation on our skin. The cover is well made with strong seams so it won't come apart during the many washes I expect it will get. I also appreciated the suggestions for other uses. I guess I always assumed when you're done nursing you're done using your nursing cover. I never thought to use it as a changing pad, blanket, or cover for the stroller. Excellent suggestions to help get more use out of an otherwise time-limited product. My only suggestion would be for the pictures accompanying the product. Perhaps a better selling image would be that of a woman of nursing age nursing an actual baby rather than an older woman past mothering age nursing a doll.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVG0KE745Z2PH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RXJTPAW#wasThisHelpful","RVG0KE745Z2PH","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I learned a few months ago the using dryer sheets is very bad for your health. I switched to wool dryer balls instead. They are working amazingly, but I miss the added scent since we use unscented laundry detergent. I received a promotional code to get this essential oil for a discount so I thought I'd give it a try. My husband was a little leery at first about having our clothes smell like lemon. He thought it would be weird. We've been using it for 2 weeks, which in this house means about 10 loads of laundry. We just add 1 drop to each of the 3 wool dryer balls after the clothes are dry. Then we put it on the lowest heat setting for an additional 10 minutes. Our clothes smell GREAT! It works so well and both my husband and I enjoy the scent. Even though that's the main reason I wanted this, I love that there are additional uses because it's lemon and not a flower scent. I have begun adding it to water in a spray bottle for a disinfectant to clean the kitchen. We have young kids so I feel much better using this than a chemical.

"These are going to be great for my daughter's birthday party! We're having a garden theme party with butterflies and flowers. The pink pom poms can easily pass as a flower decoration we can hang from the ceiling. After the party we're going to hang them in her bedroom.

"I used to use an eyelash curler all the time, but when it broke a few years ago I didn't bother replacing it. There have been a few occasions since then where I've wished I had one. When I was offered this as a promotion for my honest review, I figured it was time to finally get a new one! I forgot just how much of a difference they can make. I have short, thin eyelashes so adding curl really makes them look so much nicer. The Iris in Paris eyelash curler is very easy to use and curls just they way I would expect. I always get the results I want. The handle is comfortable and the curler appears to be great quality. I don't think I need to be concerned about it breaking like my old one.As for the false lashes... not something I ever had an interest in, but since it came with the curler I figured I'd give it a try. For a first timer they were very easy to apply. They made a HUGE difference! My eyes really did look sexier. ;-)  I didn't leave them on long, maybe 2 hours, but during that time I didn't experience any discomfort. In fact I forgot they were even on. The lashes were easy to take off and seem like they will last a while if I take care of them.

I removed the foam insert from the case that's intended for the GoPro. There is plenty of space to carry my cellphone charger, headphones, and numerous other items in the other half of the case. I can throw it in my backpack and not have to worry about it. My 6 year old is just now starting to use my Kindle to read books when we're out.

"One of my biggest pet peeves is having to get up and use the bathroom in the middle of the night and deciding between peeing in the dark or turning on the light and burning my retinas. I purchased this motion sensor light with a promotional code because I thought it might be useful in fixing this problem. I was right! There are 3 options for installing the light and we chose to permanently install it to the bathroom wall. You can set it to continuous or auto. We leave it on auto so that it comes on only when it's dark and detects movement. It gives off the perfect amount of light to make it possible to see as needed at night without hurting my eyes that are adjusted to the dark. It's pretty much perfect for what we needed it for.

"My husband does most of the cooking and he spends so much time chopping veggies. We got this a few weeks ago when we received a promotional coupon and have used it many times already. First my husband made chili. He used this to chop onions, 3 kinds of peppers, and tomatoes. He said it was so much easier and faster. The blades had no issues with the peppers or tomatoes. It cut them well and did not squish the tomatoes. He did have to break up the onions into a few layers at a time, but once he did that they chopped perfectly. He has since used it to chop mushrooms, garlic, and cucumbers. All were done with ease.Though I don't really do the cooking for the family, I do make homemade baby food. I usually have to cut everything up into small chunks before steaming them. This saved me so much time!!! I easily chopped apples, carrots, squash, and pears. I was also able to chop rutabaga, turnips, and sweet potato though I had to slightly soften them in the microwave first.The blades are sharp and are holding up well to many different kinds of fruits and veggies. The chopper seems well made and it's a great size. I like the addition of the grips on the bottom that help keep the chopper from moving across the counter. I really appreciate that the whole thing is dishwasher safe! Full convenience from every angle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDQ22BF4ZPFW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSY2CJA#wasThisHelpful","RDQ22BF4ZPFW6","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchases this Forskolin Extract for my mother who is very overweight and wanted something to help her curb her cravings and help burn the fat quicker. She is the type of person that needs to see results fast or she gives up. I got this with a promotional discount so she could give it a try. She told me she felt a big increase in her energy levels pretty much right away. After a few days she noticed she was having less cravings for sweets and wasn't unnecessarily snacking as often. In those 3 weeks she lost 6lbs!!! She is thrilled and plans to continue using this supplement since she still has a ways to go. She did say it is causing some mild headaches, but she is finding that they are decreasing the longer she takes them and aren't as bad if she really keeps up with her water intake.

"I recently found out that I am anemic. Not only is this not good for me, but it's not good for my nursing baby. I was having a hard time finding an iron supplement I was comfortable taking while nursing. I take other supplements by Pure Micronutrients so when I realized they had an iron supplement I knew I didn't need to keep looking. I was even fortunate enough to order during a promotional period at a discount. All of their supplements are very high quality and the iron is no exception. I love that they are so safe to take and don't have any junk (aka GMO's, dyes, colors, etc). I have been taking it for about 3 weeks and I have noticed a huge increase in my energy. Also, my nails have never been stronger! I haven't been to the doctor again yet to check my iron levels, but based on my experience with this company and how I'm feeling, I have no doubt that there will be improvement in my test results.

"To be honest, I don't eat as well as I should. I'm sure I am missing out on quite a few vitamins and minerals in my diet. Some of my biggest complains are muscle cramps, low energy, and anxiety. My doctor suggested I take additional magnesium, so I thought I'd give this a try when I received a coupon. First off, the pills are easy to swallow and result in no GI upset for me. That's pretty important since I typically have issues with supplements. Second, they made a huge difference in a short period of time. In less than 48 hours I noticed that my leg cramps (Charlie Horses) were completely gone. I used to have them every single night and I haven't had even one in 2 weeks!!! Also, in those 2 weeks, I have noticed that I'm sleeping better and my energy level has increased. I'm having less difficulty getting myself up in the morning. Forcing myself out of bed used to be a HUGE struggle for me. Lastly, my anxiety has improved a great deal. It wasn't significant to begin with, but enough to affect some of my day-to-day plans. I have found that less days have been affected lately and things are continuing to improve.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBSRQ2VFLBZTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRQ06VM#wasThisHelpful","RBSRQ2VFLBZTI","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been taking a basic calcium supplement for years. Now that I'm nursing I really wanted something that was stronger, better absorbed, and had more to it than just plain calcium. I purchased this supplement with a coupon and gave it a try. My first impression was that it seemed very high quality from a reputable company based on the packaging alone. I hate when I receive supplements where the label looks like it was printed on a 20 year old color printer in someone's basement. The ingredients are so much better than supplements I previously took. Really there's no point in taking calcium without magnesium and I unfortunately was doing just that. This Bone Support supplement has a great calcium to magnesium ration. The addition of Vitamin D3 is very appreciated. Not only is it the best form of Vitamin D, but it eliminates the need and cost of me continuing to buy an additional separate supplement. The pills are easy to swallow and I have experienced no stomach upset. Osteoporosis runs in my family so I will happily continue taking these supplements knowing I'm getting high quality ingredients and results that I'm looking for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TMK3ACS9YONQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRQDT70#wasThisHelpful","R2TMK3ACS9YONQ","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

February broke a record for being the coldest month EVER! All my husband had to cover his face was an old knit ski mask that didn't block the wind at all. I asked him what he thought of this and he said, ""It's perfect. I can't believe what a difference it makes. It's really warm and completely stops the wind.""

"I use the Atal Anti Aging Serum and I love it. I received a coupon for this Eye Serum so I figure I'd give it a try. I was looking for something to give more concentration on smoothing out the wrinkles around my eyes and lightening the dark purple circles. This did not disappoint! Admittedly I'm only 32 so my wrinkles weren't horrible, but they were there and I wasn't too happy about it. I've been using this less than 3 weeks and I have noticed a drastic reduction in wrinkles. Considering how much improvement the serum resulted in after such a short period of time, I'm confident that my wrinkles will be a thing of the past very soon. Even more important is the change in the circles under my eyes. I usually wear a ridiculous amount of makeup under my eyes to try and cover up the purple circles. I always have to edit out the circles in pictures because they are so bad. They are so much lighter now that I barely have to do any touch up on pictures and I am definitely wearing less makeup. I'm thinking just a few more weeks and I'll be circle free.

The last thing I want to do is waste time scrapping off my windshield while I'm freezing and the kids are in the car waiting. I jumped at the chance to get this during a promotional offer to see if it would help. It very much does! I can't tell you how amazing it is to just walk outside, pull this off, and go! Sure I sometimes still have to clean off the other windows, but they are much easier to clean and often times not necessary at all.

The vitamin quantities are great, especially the vitamin D level. I like that they are all natural and I LOVE that they are manufactured in a GMP approved facility in the US. Safety standards for vitamins, especially for children, need to be high. The packaging is nice and colorful which made my daughter more interested initially.

It worked wonderfully and that alone would have been enough for us to be happy with it. However, I found that it was great for getting glasses and cans off the high shelves in our kitchen and GREAT for picking up all the random stuff our 19 month old likes to drop behind the couch that gets stuck between the couch and the wall. No more climbing on chairs to get things off the shelves. No more having to move the couch on a near daily basis. We've only had it for 2 weeks so I'm sure we'll find even more uses.

"We have been using coconut oil for a while now for so many different things. I'm always careful to make sure it's organic and the price of this oil was the best I found recently that is certified organic so I decided to give it a try. I separated about half out into a different container so I could take it as a supplement and use it for cooking. It tastes great, melts easily in the microwave so I can add it to my smoothies, and works perfectly as a butter replacement for cooking. My 6 year old won't usually eat coconut oil right off the spoon, but she had no issue with this one. The other half of the oil I used instead of diaper rash cream for my 19 month old. It's so much safer and works just as good if not better! I've been using this brand for about 2 weeks and we haven't had even the tiniest amount of rash. Usually I use coconut oil for 4 days or so and then have to do a day of Desitin. We have been able to use just this! I will be ordering more containers so we have one going at all times for diaper rashes, 1 for daily supplementation, 1 for cooking, and 1 in the bathroom for skin and hair conditioning.

She is 19 months now, but we are an extended rear facing family so she'll likely be rear facing until after her 4th birthday. I need to be able to see her! Thankfully I finally found a mirror that will work. I think this will be my ""go to"" baby shower gift from now on. My husband wanted me to add that he really liked how witty and funny the box was. He got a real kick out of it. :-) Also, my 6 year old is planning to make something out of the box as suggested.

"I feel like anything you write for a product like this will be TMI, but then again if people are looking for this product they probably need to know it works and are anticipating reading about sex.

The dryness makes it uncomfortable and sometimes painful for both of us. We found we were having sex less often because it wasn't as enjoyable. NOT OKAY!!!

It hasn't been long (about 2 weeks) and she's already noticing a difference. She said her knees and wrists both feel so much better and she can definitely tell the inflammation has reduced and the pain is about half what it used to be. She said she's also sleeping better. She hasn't experienced any side effects and is extremely happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G66857I6F6BX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCXUO48#wasThisHelpful","R3G66857I6F6BX","A1NCBAR3ANANGR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NCBAR3ANANGR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jeffrey Osborne's ""A Time For Love"" is the great but underrated balladeer's tribute to classic standards. The late George Duke was probably the producer who brought out the best in Osborne on albums like 1982's ""Jeffrey Osborne"" and 1983's ""Stay With Me Tonight"" and the magical chemistry between them is still there. Considering the state of the music industry today, ""A Time For Love"" is a beautiful  CD that can be viewed as an oasis in the middle of a scorchingly hot and relentlessly dry desert (so to speak!). If you like smooth, heartfelt, romantic and passionate music then you really should waste no time in getting this CD.

"In 1983, the late, great and much-missed Louie Ramirez accepted a rather strange assignment from the K-TEL Records label (which was then primarily known for its countless Rock, R&B and Disco compilations). The assignment in question was to produce a Salsa ""covers"" album in which Latin Pop ballad hits were given a Salsa ""makeover"". This album was the first of three ""Noche Caliente""  albums and the two primary lead singers featured were Ray De La Paz and Menique. Its big hits were cover versions of Raphael's ""Estar Enamorado"", Jose Luis Rodriguez's ""Dueno De Nada"" and Jose Jose's ""Preso"".

Vitamin E was a Soul harmony vocal group with a strong Gospel influence and the title track deserved to have been a much bigger hit than it was. Produced by the great Norman Connors this album (like most R&B albums from the late 1970s)  features uptempo Disco numbers, sultry and soulful ballads and a mid-tempo number or two as well.

"""El Que Mas Goza"", ""Ya No Regreso"" and the stunning ""Guaguanco Africano"" are the standouts on this 1982 release which was produced by the legendary Johnny Pacheco. Orquesta Inmensidad was one of those Salsa bands that enjoyed a certain degree of consistent success but that never truly became as big or as popular as it could have been. While it is true that the early 1980s are regarded by many Salsa purists as one of the worst eras for the Salsa genre it is also true that Orquesta Inmensidad was one of the best new Salsa bands of the 1980s.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHA2BMZSDYT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BJSS6I#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHA2BMZSDYT5","AORCXT2CLTQFR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AORCXT2CLTQFR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Orquesta Inmensidad was a truly unique Salsa band that recorded several albums for the Fania label during the 1980s and which featured Roberto Blades (Ruben's brother) as its lead singer. This fine but under appreciated album got plenty of radio and club play and was a noteworthy success for the band but Orquesta Inmendsidad was never able to duplicate its success.

These two albums were among his most successful for Capitol and both prove that he was a singer who could convincingly sing different musical genres even when the material given him was not always great. If you are either a fan of or are only familiar with Lou Rawls' Philadelphia International recordings of the 1970s and '80s then this CD will probably be an acquired taste and one you will probably listen to attentively before you really like it as its material is certainly different from Lou's subsequent albums.

Al Green was truly one of the 1970s biggest R&B stars and a true icon of R&B/Soul music and this collection is definitely a fitting tribute to one of the genre's most important male vocalists. The songs are included (with one or two rare exceptions) in chronological order  and both the big hits and other tunes that are not so well-known are included as well in order to (presumably) give this box set balance and perspective. If you have all (or most) of Al Green's classic albums from the 1970s (all of which have been reissued by different labels in both non-remastered and remastered editions) then this box set is not for you but if you (on the other hand) are looking for the hits and have no intention of getting the original albums then this box set is definitely for you.

What a relief.  they worked right away.NOTE:  Okay, I've been taking them for a month.  If any sign of the diarrhea I take two, but no more than four a day.  Otherwise I've been taking one twice a day.  Unfortunately there have been side-effects.  I know they are not meant for long-term use so keep that in mind.  I have headaches in the morning; I have a very foul taste in my mouth; I have mild nausea; I have a stomach ache while I'm eating; and I have this low-key anxiety type feeling which is very uncomfortable.

"I'm a bit torn on these wheels. I bought these to replace a set of MT Sidebiter wheels. I wasn't very happy with those either and its a very long story of why I went with another set of MT Sidebiters. The old set were made in Taiwan where these are made in China. The last set were difficult to balance because the center holes were not perfectly centered. Add to the fact that the design made mounting the tires a chore and I wasn't really that happy with them.These new Sidebiter II's are a better design for mounting the tires. They also have a bit more back spacing. I actually like the satin finish better than the old gloss finish of the Sidebiters.So, why only 3 stars? Actually I'm being a bit generous here. Two of the 4 wheel I bought ran pretty true and were easy to balance when the tires were mounted. One wasn't great but not terrible either. One of them was way out though. The center hole was way out of center.it took about 16 Oz to balance on the inside! I really should have sent it back but there is no guarantee thinned one would have been any better and I realty just didn't have the time. I needed the wheels for an upcoming trip.The biggest issue I have with these wheels is something I found when I went to mount the tires. There is a warning on the wheels not to mount a tire larger than 31"" in diameter on them! What? I mounted my 35x12.5's on them and ignored the warning. Heck, I think stock Ford F150 tires were larger than this. In my application I have 5 on 5.5"" which is stock F150 bolt pattern so the 31"" limit is really impractical.Between the poor quality control and 31"" tire diameter limit, these were disappointing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMEVTSCE78FAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JIELJWC#wasThisHelpful","RMEVTSCE78FAW","AJCHGS1GND4OA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJCHGS1GND4OA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"By far the most important aspect of safety gear is that it protects you when you need it. Looks and design take a back seat to its most important aspect, protecting you. I had a pretty significant crash at Road America in turn 5 a bit back. I hit the pavement hard and slid for quite a while. These boots have some significant black scuffs from sliding on the asphalt. The plastic ""armor"" held up very well and the boots overall came out of it with just scuffs. From a safety perspective I give these 5 stars.From a functional aspect I have a few issues. First, the Boa system works fine. The problem I have is that to get them really cinched down you really need to crank on the rotator. The rotator is grippy but it is just a smallish round disc. Maybe a folding flat tab that would give you some more leverage?Another issue I have is spare parts. Unlike some of the more established brands it seems that spare parts are a bit harder to find and some of the parts that should be replaceable are either permanently attached or not available. Boots from companies like Sidi have many more replaceable sliders and armor that would allow you to replace parts as needed to keep your boots looking and performing like new for a very long time.The last issue I have with them are the toe sliders. I often drag a toe and being plastic these wear out quickly. Replacements are available but you only have a choice of the exact same plastic slider. Again, Sidi makes the standard plastic, metal, and a slider with ceramic inserts.Overall these boots offer great protection, great fit, and easy on and off. Everything you need for a great boot out on the track.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LIXMAQLZI9IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007N7TDAQ#wasThisHelpful","R2LIXMAQLZI9IW","AJCHGS1GND4OA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJCHGS1GND4OA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these to replace the standard incandescent lights on a horse trailer for my daughter. The standard incandescent lights suffer from both burned out bulbs and poor connections between the bulb and socket. These should solve both problems as the LED's should last a very long time, and they are permanently mounted to a board and completely sealed in some sort of epoxy.I have two minor items I would change if I were designing these. First I would make them a one wire connection and rely on the mounting screws for the ground. I quite simply pulled the white with into the housing and grounded it with the mounting screw anyway. This isn't a huge issue but I think in most applications a hard wire connection to ground really isn't needed. The other thing I would change is to have a void behind the base of the fixture. The way it is made the wire has to go directly into a hole to keep from being squished by the housing when mounted.

"I've only installed one of these so far. It went in with no issues and the printer recognized it. The printer is working just fine with it.On the past I've tried generic and refurbished cartridges in my Lexmark printer and couldn't get them to work. These newer printers use RFID chips embedded in the cartridge to make sure they are compatible and keep track of their ink level. Unfortunately the cartridges I've tried in the past, again with the Lexmark, couldn't get past this RFID programming. These, at least the first one, do not have this problem.If for some reason the next cartridge I install doesn't work I will update this post.

"I put this battery in my CBR1000RR track bike and so far it is working perfectly. I've had zero starting issues with it. Not only is it much lighter than a lead battery but it is much smaller. That makes fitting into most bikes a breeze.I also have a Lithium Iron battery of a different brand in my Buell 1125R street bike. The experience I've had with these batteries has helped my understand that these batteries may not be for everyone.First and foremost is how these batteries work in the cold. When it gets cold the bike may at first turn over very slowly and not start. This is actually normal. Depending on how cold it is and how hard your motor is to crank you will need to get current flowing in the battery to warm it internally. They recommend you turn on the headlights for a period of time. Trying to start the bike, letting it sit a bit, then trying it again until it starts has worked for me. The problem is it is a bit counter intuitive. You feel as though if the battery is too weak to start the bike running down further will just make things worse. The fact is it is different technology than the old lead batteries and therefore it works differently. It takes a bit of getting used to.The next thing is that draining them to nothing is a sure way to kill them. I accidentally drain my Buell battery and I got very lucky that it took a charge and still works. A friend of mine with a track bike has yet another battery brand that uses the same technology. At the end of a track day he forgot to turn his bike off. The next morning the battery was dead and unfortunately junk. These batteries do not like to be run down to nothing. In most cases its not an issue but if you leave the key on or otherwise run it down to zero you can plan on needing a new one.On that same issue, if you live where there is a riding season and an extended non riding season you will have to take precautions. Any computer controlled bike will draw a small amount of current even when the key is off. This small current draw will drain any battery down with time. If left sitting long enough the battery will be drained completely and once again with the Lithium Iron battery you'll likely be replacing it. The instructions say that if you leave it in the bike and it is not ridden then you should charge it once a month. That is very similar to a lead battery. Where these differ though is that there is nearly no internal discharging. A lead battery must be periodically charged even if they have no external current draw. These batteries do not self discharge. Because of this the best way to store them for the winter is to pull them from the bike and store them inside the house. If you do that they need no attention over the winter. I did try this with my Buell Battery the first off season and the bike fired right up in spring when I put the battery back in.If your willing to live with their limitations they are great small and light alternatives to lead batteries. This battery in particular is also nice because it has the positive and negative terminals on both sides which makes installation more flexible. It also was priced lower than any of the other brands so I thought I'd give it give it a shot. So far I have no regrets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIOMZATM5Z62M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9LPJ8S#wasThisHelpful","RIOMZATM5Z62M","AJCHGS1GND4OA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJCHGS1GND4OA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far these have worked out great. I had a set just like them (unsure of the brand) that I bought out of a discount bin at a hardware store years ago. That set held up great for years.

I did a search here on Amazon and found these and they appear to be nearly identical to my old set but with better chrome.

This is true even with high end brands such as Snap On. If you need to really torque a screw on or off and don't need a ball style you are better off using straight hex style sockets.As a side note these tools are imported as you may have guessed.

"In the past I have used Bloxide. The price and availability of Bloxide lead me to look for an alternative.When welding two pieces of sheet steel together I don't like the idea of having raw steel against raw steel. To me you're just looking for a place for rot and rust to start. Regular paint doesn't work because it contaminates the weld. Also, any area subjected to heat will burn off and you will end up with unprotected areas near the welds but between the steel. That's where weld through primer comes in. You can coat the bare steel and then any area where the steel touches will be protected.Bloxide has always worked well for me but as I said it seems to be pretty expensive and hard to find. This product seemed to work just as well, at least at the weld. Only time will tell if it protects the two sandwiched pieces of steel I welded together. I think for certain it will be better that if it was bare steel to bare steel.After spraying this on and then welding I can say that the welds went on contaminant free, unlike regular paint. As I was welding I didn't notice any of the primer burning off like paint normally does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7JLZFS3IRLAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TQGT4S#wasThisHelpful","R7JLZFS3IRLAQ","AJCHGS1GND4OA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJCHGS1GND4OA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice enough cap and rotor set for what it is, a stock replacement cap an rotor. The cap terminals are of course aluminum which aren't as good as brass, but of course it isn't priced like brass. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the metal pieces of the rotor are a little thinner than I would have liked to have seen. It works well enough, at least in my stock application, that it may make no difference.I will say it is getting harder and harder to find a cap and rotor set with the older rotor style. All of the brass terminal sets I cold find included a new TFI style rotor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZTT6F8MKU3LC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C95856#wasThisHelpful","RZTT6F8MKU3LC","AJCHGS1GND4OA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJCHGS1GND4OA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love these hose clamps. They have constant tension for the entire circumference of the hose and never need to be retightened. The first time I used these I was very worried about leaks and if the hose would be tight enough. My fear was un founded as the hose seems to be as tight as they ever were with regular hose clamps. Also, you never have to worry about over tightening a clamp. The only other clamp I feel even compares to these are the OEM constant tension clamps. As any one who ever had to remove one of those knows though removal and installation can be a pain to say the least.The only issue you will ever have with these, provided they are properly installed, is they are a one time use item of course. To remove the hose it will have to be destroyed and a new one installed. They are not super expensive but if you have a hose you remove every so often it could get a little pricey.One other thing I like about these. They have a very ""clean"" look when installed. Many of the SS worm drive clamps look a little cheesy to me depending on the application. On a show car a improperly sized worm drive clamp can look down right terrible. These have a super clean look when installed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W1NSW7SYIU65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CRHLAS#wasThisHelpful","R2W1NSW7SYIU65","AJCHGS1GND4OA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJCHGS1GND4OA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These hoses work great for times when there is no molded hose made to fit your application. I am using this one for a lower hose in a Jeep Cherokee with a 5.2L Magnum engine swapped in. It flexed to fit right in and should last a very long time.What I has on there before this was one of the stainless steel corrugated flexible hose kits. It is similar to this hose but it is made of stainless which I thought would be a good thing. Unfortunately you still need rubber connectors at both ends of that stainless hose. Now you have four clamps to leak. Also, the rubber those couplers were made out of were horrible. They started cracking after about 12 months. These flex hoses have none of those issues and actually look better too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N23WWGMQGAO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C30JR4#wasThisHelpful","R3N23WWGMQGAO9","AJCHGS1GND4OA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJCHGS1GND4OA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Considering how well it works at allowing you to make 3 incremental adjustments to your snare wires at the flick of a lever it is well worth the extra bulk.

"About the Book:Six-year-old Gretl Schmidt is on a train bound for Auschwitz. Jak√≥b Kowalski is planting a bomb on the tracks.As World War II draws to a close, Jak√≥b fights with the Polish resistance against the crushing forces of Germany and Russia. They mean to destroy a German troop transport, but Gretl‚Äôs unscheduled train reaches the bomb first.Gretl is the only survivor. Though spared from the concentration camp, the orphaned German Jew finds herself lost in a country hostile to her people. When Jak√≥b discovers her, guilt and fatherly compassion prompt him to take her home. For three years, the young man and little girl form a bond over the secrets they must hide from his Catholic family.But she can‚Äôt stay with him forever. Jak√≥b sends Gretl to South Africa, where German war orphans are promised bright futures with adoptive Protestant families‚Äîso long as Gretl‚Äôs Jewish roots, Catholic education, and connections to communist Poland are never discovered.Separated by continents, politics, religion, language, and years, Jak√≥b and Gretl will likely never see each other again. But the events they have both survived and their belief that the human spirit can triumph over the ravages of war have formed a bond of love that no circumstances can overcome.My Review: Gretl Schmidt is six years old and is on the run from the Gespo. Being a German Jew she doesn‚Äôt really have any allies. The Polish despise Germans and the Germans despise Jews. So with her family having no where to turn to, do the fact they are on a train to Auschwitz, they decide to sneak Gretl and her sister Elza off.Jak√≤b Kowalski fights along with other Polish men to rid the Germans from their country. Planting a bomb on the train tracks for a coming German Troop transport seemed like a reasonable idea. That is until he takes little Gretl in. With her mom and grandmother killed on the train he helped destroy and her sister dying from a fever, she is all alone with no one wanting to take in neither a German nor Jew. So Jak√≤b decides to keep the little girl by his side.Three years later, Gretl looks more and more like a German everyday and Jak√≤b is worried for her safety. With no where else to turn, Jak√≤b must send dear little Gretl to an orphanage in South Africa. Where maybe just maybe a nice Protestant family will wish to adopt her.The Girl From The Train is a wonderful book about love and endurance.

"About the Book:Shining coat flashing in the sun. Silky mane rippling in the wind. A toss of the head and the stamp of a hoof.Few of God‚Äôs creatures are as noble and soul-stirring as the horse. Even those of us who aren‚Äôt lucky enough to have horses of our own seem to have an innate desire to connect with these beautiful, regal beasts. As children we read stories about them, collected models of them, and tacked posters of them up on our walls. Throughout history they have carried us and calmed us, pulled our loads and pulled at our heartstrings. They give us a taste of wildness and yet make us feel at home.In this inspiring collection, you‚Äôll meet horses who show up at the right time, who help their humans learn important truths, and who rescue the very people who rescued them. These true stories of horses and the people who love them are sometimes touching, sometimes humorous, and sometimes miraculous. Always they are inspiring, like the horses themselves. They will touch your heart, renew your spirit, and show you that surely God had us in mind when he created these magnificent creatures.My Review: I‚Äôve always had an odd infatuation with horses. I‚Äôve always wanted one even though we of course have neither the money nor time that it takes to have a horse. Instead I drowned myself in books and movies about them. So when I had the chance to read The Horse of My Heart, I of course was ecstatic.The Horse of My Heart is a wonderful book full of stories about different people‚Äôs various experiences with horses. Each story has an important truth that was taught to the owner at one time or another by their horse. I really enjoyed how each story was wonderfully wrote. Being the horse lover, I am I‚Äôd say this book was beautifully put together with each story complementing the others perfectly.The Horse of My Heart is just one of Callie Smith Grant‚Äôs many books. This book was a wonderful read and can‚Äôt wait see what this editor has in store for us next.**Disclosure** This book was sent to me free of charge for my honest review from Revell.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FC6WRLYYSOVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800723341#wasThisHelpful","R3FC6WRLYYSOVO","A15P6JXOSIN2TG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15P6JXOSIN2TG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But all bets are off when Rocky follows Frannie to Texas to plead his case. Could he be the Christmas gift to end all gifts?""My Review: Just as the holidays are beginning to approach, this is the time when I start thinking about all things related. So My family and I have already started our pumpkin muffins and hot chocolate tradition because that's how we roll. Christmas is the best time for family and An Amish Christmas Gift is the novella to accompany us on this ""sweet"" tradition.Naomi s Gift by Amy Clipston Amy Clipston can really give you a good story to sink your teeth into. She does it rather well and we see that in Naomi's Gift. A story about a twenty something girl that feels there is no hope left for someone like her to find true love. But as the story goes, you find love when you least expect it. And so it goes for this young lady when she meets a young widower that instantly melts her heart.An Unexpected Joy by Ruth Reid Abigail is just fine with being an old maid. Every guy that has even looked her way she manages to scare off. She seems not to be troubled by this, but deep down I feel for her. And I think it just plain old hurts when a guy won't stick it out to get to know her a whole lot better. Soon Abigail receives what she may of needed all along in the way of Micah Zook.A Christmas Visitor by Kelly Irvin A sweet Christmas story to enjoy. I liked this one the best because of the cozy feel. The author made it feel like home and I think it resonated more with me than the other two. But each story was equally brilliant. Frannie receives a welcome surprise this Christmas but will she feel it's so welcoming when Rocky shows up at her Aunts home to plead his case? Each story is perfect for a cozy read under a blanket accompanied with some warm coffee cake and a cup of hot chocolate by the fire. To welcome in the holiday season, An Amish Christmas Gift is the book for you!**Disclosure** This book was sent to me free of charge for my honest review from Book Look.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GTX5H08NGHUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718039653#wasThisHelpful","R1GTX5H08NGHUU","A15P6JXOSIN2TG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15P6JXOSIN2TG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Babadook is the heart-warming story of a woman, her seriously annoying son, and the children's book that nearly tore them apart.The son is basically the type of person you'd wish someone would lock in a car on a hot summer's day, but his mother puts up with him, bless her heart. Until one day, a children's book arrives mysteriously, and has lots of spoooooooky pictures and cryptic poetics about some guy in a trench coat. The mom starts to lose it, and the more she loses it, the more the trench coat guy pokes at her. But as she loses it, the son becomes less annoying, so pretty soon you're hoping he will ""accidentally"" push her down the stairs. But he puts up with her, bless him. Soon they join forces and turn the trench coat guy into a house pet. The end.It's not a bad premise really, I always thought children's books were the perfect medium for seriously twisted stuff, so that's a cool feature.

"This book lives at the nexus between a corporate finance textbook and a popular management book. It condenses a lot of information that seems like the stuff you'd learn in the first year of business school, but yet is very instructional for anyone just learning organizational capitalism and all that it entails. I imagine this would be an excellent refresher for highly motivated executives as well, although I'm not sure there are many of those around.I took the advice of another reader who recommended pairing this with the McKinsey Valuation Workbook, but I had to do a lot of side research to fill in some technical gaps.

"I have owned this book for six years and have done my best to do the exercises daily. I have found it to be far more potent than any other system of internal training I have tried, and the instructions in the book are much better than the instructions I have received in personal training. I do not own the DVD, but I watched several segments of it and found Tim's examples to be very close to my own movements. The trick is the movements you cannot see, of course, but this book gets into that as well.Basically the meat of this book (for me) is the 17 exercise system of xingyi neigong. Each exercise is explained three ways - one is a translation of the original Chinese teaching, one is an English-native explanation (from Tim), and one is a ""traditional"" explanation (very poetic, but points out more esoteric features not covered in the other explanations). Read all three carefully to get all the points. It will take a while, and you may want to check your work with a martial arts instructor or (in my case) a TCM practitioner.Very highly recommended. Too bad it's out of print.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30MMJ22OV0WD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0865681740#wasThisHelpful","R30MMJ22OV0WD5","A3JI0XP54T2HQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JI0XP54T2HQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A retired pilot guy lives in South Dakota. He stumbles across a NASA base where a scientist has discovered a hole in some Jupiter moon. The hole leads to some other galaxy with a bunch of planets. The scientist convinces the pilot to fly through the hole and find out what happened to a bunch of other people who went in and never came out. The pilot goes in, and finds the most boring planets ever. Knowing that he should have stayed home, the pilot tries to kill himself by flying into a black hole. Come to find out, that black hole is actually a portal to his daughter's bookshelf, which makes him super upset. But he gets over it, then programs a wrist watch so it will communicate the black hole's physics to his daughter so she can build a spacecraft and save all of humanity.Twists and turns abound... We learn that the scientist thought that flying into the other galaxy was a waste of time but he didn't bother telling anyone. But it turns out that it wasn't a waste of time because the aliens who built the hole to the other galaxy weren't actually trying to get us to live on the planets there. They were trying to get us to fly into the black hole, but we wouldn't have known that if the planets weren't so deadly boring that they drove the pilot to try to kill himself. So they must have made the planets boring on purpose, so anyone who went to them would instantly choose death and try to use the black hole to commit suicide. And it turns out that they aren't aliens at all, they are us! We built a space-time manipulation computer inside a black hole inside a galaxy inside the hole inside a moon inside our solar system! It was all a ploy by future humans to save the past humans by tricking them into trying to commit suicide. Brilliant!But that's not all... Nolan actually designed this film to be so boring that YOU will want to kill yourself, thereby taking the meta-plot and making it a meta-meta-META-plot. You will suffer the same horrifying boredom that the pilot endures in the film, and you will want to travel back in time to your own bookcase to warn yourself not to watch it. The level of brilliance is now, officially, through the roof.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VTIR4HU7NTGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFTCGES#wasThisHelpful","R3VTIR4HU7NTGD","A3JI0XP54T2HQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JI0XP54T2HQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of the better side-opening autos out there for the money. The design is simple, ergonomics are clean, the size is decent enough for hard use and the weight is manageable for regular carry. Legalities aside, this is an excellent choice for a folding knife that requires rapid one-handed deployment.One thing to note is that the X1 version of this knife has the fish-scale milling, but only the ""M"" version has the safety switch. The price difference is about $20-30, so is the switch worth it? Personally I think so - I would rather have it and not use it than not have it at all. But it does get used - I find I am much less apprehensive about hard use when I know the button cannot be depressed to unlock the blade. I don't see how the switch would be useful in the closed position, since the button is flush with the surface, the blade is tip-up (facing the outer pants seam instead of the crotch), and deployment is greatly compromised when you have to remember (under severe stress) to flip the switch.In all this is a fine knife that holds its own against pricier competitors without compromising build quality or reliable use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G8N0C0QAKSH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCHXPQY#wasThisHelpful","R3G8N0C0QAKSH0","A3JI0XP54T2HQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JI0XP54T2HQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not that this book needs another five star review, but I have a reason for chiming in. I was reading Ron's books starting around 2005 or so, and while I loved the way they made me think about everything. After writing five books that I know of, Ron produced this work, which summarizes everything from previous books and offers a hands-on approach to his value pricing model.Now, Ron is an accountant. This means you have to be able to think about what he is saying in your own context. He cannot give you your context, only his own. This doesn't make what he says any less useful in any professional service. The idea of value creation as a measure of company plus customer profit, and how to apply this concept to define price, is applicable to anyone who uses their brain to make money. And there are many ways to think of a fabrication company as a professional service provider, so no one is entirely excluded.Another selling point for this book is that this is where the nuts-and-bolts of value pricing ended up after all revisions of The Professional's Guide to Value Pricing went out of print. So if you missed that one entirely, if you're new to Ron's work, or if you're a professional looking to radically rethink how you and your company create value, get this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G2P8R153RW86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470584610#wasThisHelpful","R3G2P8R153RW86","A3JI0XP54T2HQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JI0XP54T2HQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these shoes. They work great indoors and out, on tile, dirt, grass, concrete, wood, and that padded crap in dojos. Wear resistance will vary, depending on the abrasion level of the ground you're training on, and how much or how hard you train. They fit well and don't cause any problems, no markings on the floor or pinching/rubbing on my feet. Nice.Measure your foot while standing (as your foot will splay out a bit) and if you buy the right size you'll be fine - but they are a little narrow. I prefer these to the low tops for training and I prefer the low tops for exercise. So get a pair of both, then double up on the one you use most.

"This is it, Spyderco's definitive gentleman's no-nonsense utility folder. While they took the gentleman's wharncliffe folder to new levels of style with the Air and the Des Horn, the Kiwi 4 strips away all but the bare essentials of functionality. Here are some important design points:1. The design is 100% ambidextrous, you get full opening, using, and closing functionality with either hand, and it carries on either side with a simple swap of the clip.2. The blade is full flat ground, providing unprecedented cutting geometry for slicing tasks, which is pretty much all this knife is designed for.3. The Kiwi 4 was designed by Spyderco founder Sal Glesser as both a size and utility upgrade from previous Kiwi models.4. The Kiwi 4 is actually lighter than the Kiwi 3 by a few grams, despite being larger overall with a longer blade.Criticisms I have heard include the price, the use of pins instead of screws, the design differences from previous Kiwi models, and a stiff pivot. Here are my thoughts on these.The price isn't much different from other Moki-produced Spyderco lockbacks, and for the use value and production quality you're still getting a lot for your money.You could never make the knife this compact with screws, so the design would have been chunkier and defeated its own purpose.I don't see how simply enlarging the previous Kiwi profile would make this a better knife. Clearly Sal didn't either.If the pivot is stiff when you get it, add a drop of oil. Problem solved.All things considered, I feel this is one of Spyderco's better products in general and it has largely taken the place of my Dragonfly 2 and Caly 3, which have many similar attributes. Once the novelty is worn off I might find myself alternating it more often, but if I could only have one, this would definitely be it. Good job, Sal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35LYS6QHM9NTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILFN8Y6#wasThisHelpful","R35LYS6QHM9NTL","A3JI0XP54T2HQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JI0XP54T2HQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a difficult book to review without having completed every training protocol outlined by the author. The first training set (basic physical conditioning) is prescribed after only ten pages of introductory content, and the reader is instructed to do these exercises for three months before you continue reading the book. Most people simply do not have the focus and self discipline to do this, and moreover it is difficult to be motivated when you are still on the fence about jin or qi in general.There is another complication: the martial applications are systemic (taichi or xingyi, for instance) and thus not included in this book. The author claims this is a future project, but for now you are on your own. And if you study something non-Chinese in origin, you'll be on your own even if the author makes a follow-up book. So be prepared to find or modify your own path once you're done with this book.So what do I think? I think this book required a leap of faith, both in internal martial arts and in the author's ability to instruct you via a book. I also think it is worth it. Even if you have your doubts, you will feel profound changes in your body by doing exactly as the author describes.With this book, you spend a lot of training time developing strength in parts of your body that may seem irrelevant to martial arts, but are actually the key to mastery. Anyone who has trained with a credible instructor can attest to some inexplicable things - the inability to move them, the shock and pain delivered by casual looking strikes. The instructor seems to expend no effort yet can throw people twice their size. Few books out there really explain how this works, and nearly every instructor or student I have trained with believed these abilities came with endless repetition of forms.That is why you need this book. You will learn, firsthand, why this power (jin) is so hard to explain, but you will learn through your own practice and honing of form and movement. There is an undeniable logic present here, even if is is intrinsically tied to mysterious invisible energy channels. And if you think this latter item is a complete myth, try suspending your disbelief and follow the instructions as written. You will learn for yourself what you are really capable of, regardless of your opinion on the theoretical underpinnings.In all this is an excellent resource worthy of diligent study and use. There is much more use than study, however, so you'd better be willing to make time in your schedule, or else you're better off not getting this book in the first place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OBQJR7CIWMYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583947604#wasThisHelpful","R3OBQJR7CIWMYF","A3JI0XP54T2HQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JI0XP54T2HQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is not a bad introduction to real options for people who have some corporate finance background and who work in project management specifically. I do think it is one of the better introductory texts to real options for those who have to actually use it, but I am also highly spoiled.Before I read this, I was fortunate enough to get Shockley's Real Options Valuation book, which has a heavy emphasis on applications. It contains a mind-blowing number of examples and practice questions that will get you fully up to speed on how and when to use real options valuation methods in lieu of static-NPV based methods that do not account for optionality over multiple time periods. This is something Project Valuation Using Real Options briefly covers but not to the level of practical detail that I think project managers will truly appreciate and heavily use.In sum I want to say if you are not sure what real options are or how they are used, and you need a brief corporate finance refresher to help you pick it up, then this is a good choice. If you want heavily theoretical literature, go for Real Options by Trigeorgis and dig in to your heart's content. But if you want advanced practical applications, get the Shockley book. None of them are necessarily good or bad, but are relative to what you're trying to accomplish.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG4E9DRTALE4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1932159436#wasThisHelpful","RG4E9DRTALE4B","A3JI0XP54T2HQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JI0XP54T2HQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm no athlete, but I know a good idea when I see one. I have trouble finding time in the day to eat the right things, and eating big meals a few times per day leaves me alternating between hunger and over-filled bloatedness and lethargy. One option is to snack on whatever is available, but that often becomes handfuls of nuts, granola bars, and other foods that are bland or overprocessed.So what is the solution? How about portable mini-meals that can be made quickly in batches and individually wrapped for portability and portion control? Brilliant. And this is the book that got me there. Now I don't even need to worry about meals when I'm on the go, and I don't feel like I have to give in to the all-too-easy temptation of junk and fast foods. And the real kicker is how easy this stuff is to make and to modify to fit my individual needs and tastes. Brilliance, once again.Besides the wide range of recipes presented, this book provides a fair amount of nutritional information as well. Although geared specifically toward athletes (and professional athletes at that), it works great for busy people who want alternatives to premade foods that never provide the satisfaction of real, home-cooked food.For those looking to go beyond recipes and get into the science of nutrition without going totally overboard, I recommend Teri Tom's Martial Arts Nutrition. That book plus this one make a great team, and now I have Biju and Allen's previous book on order so I can learn even more, feel even better, and make more incredible foods that satisfy both the body and the palate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SFM5X3AC3TQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937715000#wasThisHelpful","R1SFM5X3AC3TQN","A3JI0XP54T2HQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JI0XP54T2HQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of the better sunblocks I've tried. It is very dry, making it hard to spread over wide areas but great for faces and other areas you don't want to look or feel greasy. It smells weird - my wife says it smells like ""plants,"" but I think it smells like a room that hasn't been dusted in years. There isn't much else to add, just don't use it for large areas like your chest, back, or legs because it absorbs fast and dry and you'll likely end up using more than is economical.In summary, I tend to use one very dry sunblock for my face and neck and another wetter kind for larger areas. This one fits right into the type I use for my face, and it a bit more robust than what I'd use day to day.

"It's hard for me to believe I never reviewed this book before. I have to say that when I first got it, I wasn't sure what to think of it. The layout is insane, with photos and drawings and clever use of white space and text size. Paul was an ad man, so this makes complete sense.As for the information, well, Paul seems to harvest his ideas from the farthest corner of the left field. The main point of the book is that you can only get something insanely audacious if you immediately try to grab hold of it. This forces you to curb fear of rejection and possible lack of credentials and simply act as if what you want is already yours.Of course, doing this will lead to spectacular failures. But reaching for something high requires a few bad falls, and the only alternative is to live on an even keel. And if that's what you want, then why are you here?I'm not sure what I would have done with the last ten years of my life if I hadn't read this book, but I'm sure it would have been much duller. I was certainly more inclined to do something risky (write and publish a book, defy an old boss who fired me as a result, etc) and for every fall I ended up gaining something bigger and different than I could have ever predicted. And every time I think of Paul and his books.I understand that there isn't a lot to read here, but there are a lot of behavioral pointers that will have powerful consequences in your life. If you made only one piece of Paul's advice a part of your life, you would be a different person.

"Very nice jars but from the picture i expected them to be taller and not so wide. They won't work for what I was going to use them for but they do seem to be quality jars. I had wanted to use them for spices but they are too wide to fit where I wanted. I am guessing the lids are one time use since you are not to reuse a jar lid that has already been heat sealed.

"We tried this and it just doesn't shave close enough unless you remove the guard and then the blade itself is exposed. I tried shaving a few hairs off my legs just to try it and I have to go over it multiple times just to get a few hairs. My son tried it and the only way it actually shaved well was to remove the guard. It really isn't very good and didn't give the results we wanted. My son is very disappointed in this. It would not give a close shave on any hair and trimming hairs with the guards didn't work well, most of the hair didn't even cut.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HUSTET0NQX4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010XIGBUQ#wasThisHelpful","R2HUSTET0NQX4C","A1X2LENOF84LCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2LENOF84LCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ingredients seem to be OK, there are some I am not sure about like turkey tails? what is that? It does seem to be healthy and gives good protein and digestive ingredients too. I would be pleased with the product if it weren't for the taste. I think it tastes terrible. To me the chocolate tastes fake or it is not a good chocolate. I do like that it has stevia in it instead of some fake sugars. I have had things with stevia and as long there isn't too much in it, it tastes fine. I think they put a little much in this since the flavor is off and it is too sweet. It is better with milk but still not good enough. So while the ingredients seem to be good the taste is enough to keep me away. Apparently there are some people that like this, we don't but I noticed others here do like it so I guess it depends upon your taste buds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKW811412YCZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WW8ZA30#wasThisHelpful","RKW811412YCZT","A1X2LENOF84LCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2LENOF84LCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For being an inexpensive and small unit this works surprisingly well. I like the collar because I can adjust it and it stays so I just need to buckle it. The only reason it loses one star is because of a few minor things that could be improved. I would like to see 3 buttons one for each the tone, the vibrate and the shock. The way it is now you have to cycle through the options to get to what you want. There is no on/off button, it goes into standby but a couple times we had to push a button a couple of time to wake it. The range isn't as far as the more expensive ones but for in the yard it works well. We have an older german shorthair and she mostly just needs a reminder to listen and we don't have to use the shock most of the time, just the vibrate or tone but when we do need the shock we need it immediately not after cycling through all the options.If you need a trainer this would be great for most dogs and the collar is adjustable, I know there is a lot of adjustment left for my dog. I don't think it would go real small though but you could put another collar on this I would think just so it is wide enough. My dog sometimes wants to take out after a deer or a cat and that is when we need the shock to stop her and bring her back.I received this product free or at a reduced price for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B4H4GKTW70AI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6UVROK#wasThisHelpful","R3B4H4GKTW70AI","A1X2LENOF84LCQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2LENOF84LCQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A yummy complex sugar that is much better for you than the processed sugars with some minerals and fiber others don't have. It is certified organic so there are no chemicals used in the growing and production of this sugar.

This year with all the rain and lack of sunshine my blueberries are not too sweet, neither are my raspberries so this makes a nice compliment to the berries. It is great in pancakes, muffins.

"Headsets are everywhere these days and I suspect many of them share the same guts.  Fit and comfort are a place where these differ.  I have a giant head - my bike helmet is called a ""Kinghead,"" my proper circumference is 62cm - and these expand to fit adequately without dragging my ears down or pressing on the tender point right under the ear.  The earpieces are not super cushiony; they're soft, roomy, fit easily and well.Sound quality is average for headphones these days, which is to say very good indeed; that crystalline sparkle of the $250+ Sennheiser is missing, but these are neither Sennheisers nor anywhere near as expensive, in fact, you could outfit your whole guild with these for that price.  The mic seems OK; no one had any trouble understanding me and it was easy to position, and the foam windguard cuts down on breath noise.You can use it with nearly anything that takes a 3-lead 3.5mm jack, including an Xbox, a PS4, a Mac, an iPhone 6, my gaming PC's front headphone/mic jack, and probably a lot of other things that I didn't try; I don't have an Xbox, but I tried it on everything else listed above and it worked perfectly, no muss, no fuss.  Packaging and instructions were adequate; I don't care much about those things and they did what they needed to do.I like the way these phones look; the electric green color is kind of sassy and I enjoy it.  So I'd say if the price looks right and you don't mind a wire tether - I don't, wireless headphones are a huge hassle - then pull the trigger on these cans and get shooting!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RJUSN3R46V8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5U40#wasThisHelpful","R1RJUSN3R46V8K","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm pretty passionate about knives.  I love cooking - enthusiastic amateur - and as far as I am concerned, good knife work is the first step in getting the best flavors out of meats, vegetables, and fresh herbs.  And you can't do good knife work with a bad knife.My mainstay for comparison is a Global 8"" chef's knife, G-2, and I simply adore it for its weight, balance, and edge retention; so I'll be using it as my benchmark in this review.  (I've also had a variety of Henckels kitchen knives including both their middle-of-the-road and top lines; Buck, Marbles, and handmade hunting knives; and an old Solingen carbon-steel knife from the 1950's.)  I found myself using the Sabatier a lot over the last month as I compared them side by side.  The Sabatier is as light as the Global - the only other Chef's knife I've used that's as light.  The blade is actually smaller, both shorter and less tall, and I didn't like that as well; it is thin enough that it almost feels like it might flex, which is really undesirable in a knife.  It has a full tang but the handle is very light.  I have gotten used to the Global integral handle, which is hollow textured steel that has captive sand in it so the handle weight shifts depending on how you're holding the knife; this knife doesn't do that, but the handle is light enough that it only feels a touch handle heavy by comparison; I can chop and dice just as fast as anything, the knife never slows me down.The factory edge was great but not quite surgical; and though it is Cromova, edge retention was nowhere near as good as the Global alloy.  I mostly cut vegetables on plastic for the month I used it, and at the end of the month it was dulled worse than the Global, which I last sharpened more than a year ago.  Don't mistake this for a complaint; this knife comes in second of all the knives I've ever had for edge retention; I had to sharpen my top-end Henckels twice a week, and the middle-of-the-road Henckels simply wouldn't get sharp enough to satisfy.  The Sabatier is also super easy to sharpen; I dread sharpening the Global, it takes most of an afternoon to get it right without wrecking my Arkansas oilstone in the process.  Sharpening the Sabatier back to better-than-factory took less than 5 minutes and it felt good - it was easy to know where you were with the edge.I love the mother-of-pearloid handle.  (In Fender guitars, this plastic is affectionately called MOTO - mother-of-toilet-seat.)  It's beautiful; it feels nice; and it's super easy to clean, indeed it's hard to dirty it.  The edge of the blade is something I use a lot to carry diced stuff around; it's not too sticky and most of the back is straight, but the short height of the blade means there's less area to use as a scoop, and I found myself swearing as I had to go back for second and third swipes between board and pan.  The aggressive taper of the tip doesn't help this either; in fact, it's not good for much of anything and I wish they'd put a bit more curve on the bottom of the tip and left a little more metal at the top.Details.  This knife is great.  It's not good enough to switch me from Global, but for someone who wants an attractive, easy to clean, easy to sharpen, absolute top of the line 8"" chef's knife that's super light, this has got to be top of your Christmas list!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R5YZHGZUK6GI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SYHNFRG#wasThisHelpful","R3R5YZHGZUK6GI","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It'd been a long time since I'd done regular workouts with a bag - I got my black belt a full 25 years ago, quit working out a few years after that.  I ended up buying a Ringside heavy bag to work out with and these fill the bill nicely, keeping my knuckles looking pretty on Monday morning.  They fit well, they're easy on and off, and there's enough room inside for thick tape if you are wanting to go that route - I don't, the padding of the glove is enough for me.  The force of the impact distributes nicely and there's no sideways forces to knock your knuckles out of line.  They're quick to put on and the thick velcro is quick to cinch up and highly adjustable.  I can go a full half hour with these on, which is about as much bag work as I need to do.

"Cuisinart is a name I associate with best-in-class food processors.  But I can't imagine this pizza server is best in class.  It's two pieces of sheet metal, stamped, folded, and then welded together - and then the weld filed down.  Edges aren't sharp, and the shape of the thing is right.  But the cheap, sticky black rubber that surrounds the handle belies the Cuisinart name it's stamped with.  It's not nice to touch and it smells funny.  The hook fell right out as I opened the package; it's just a bent piece of wire that can fit into the hole at the end of the handle.I am sure that if what you need is a tool to lift a pizza slice - or a small trowel - this will fit the bill nicely.

"This is a deep plastic tub designed to go under a normal sized washing machine to catch water leaks.  It comes with a fittable hose-bib so that leak water could be redirected via hose wherever you wanted it to go.  It could also underlay a hot water heater, I think.  But I have been using it to sit under a portable window-A/C unit that sometimes overflows water on humid days; it catches that and keeps it off my hardwood floor.Another use for this tub is washing large, flat things, like small rugs and car floor mats.

"These gloves are large, but they are not particularly large-sized.  Usually an L fits my 7.5 size hand but these L's felt more like M's to me, the fingers were about a half-inch too short.Because the glove material is thick, it is a bit less stretchy than the usual nitrile exam glove, compounding the sizing problem.  But the thick nitrile is super tough; I can't imagine anything piercing it in normal use.  Nitrile is non-reactive and resistant to a variety of oils, solvents, and alcohols, and these gloves are totally water-tight as well.

"Very standard, thin, single-use nitrile glove.  The ""L"" size is a good fit for my size 7.5 hands, the fingers are the right length, a touch baggy in the palm.  The fingertips are textured for better grip when handling tools, but in general these are quite thin gloves, they'd be appropriate, for example, in a breast exam if you needed to be able to feel small lumps.  They're not particularly stretchy and are prone to tearing if you over-stretch them.They're nitrile so they are resistant to a variety of alcohols, solvents and oils as well as 100% watertight.  Light blue color is what it is.  Downside is they're not very durable.  If you're doing anything with edges, corners or abrasion, these gloves will last 10 minutes tops before you get a rip in them.

"These thick black nitrile gloves are a true M in size.  They are stretchier than some nitrile gloves and have a good tack to them so they are form fitting on my size 7.5 hands, but the fingers are not long enough; I think they'd be a perfect fit for a 6.5 and a good fit on a 7.  They are not slippery and make it easy to pick things up; they are totally watertight, so if you use them on a hot day, soon your hands will be swimming in sweat.  They're also resistant to a variety of solvents, oils and alcohols that I work with; I didn't find anything that dissolved them or that went through the material.  And they're tough, quite resistant to rips and tears in a way that usual exam gloves are not.The black color is what it is; if you are working with dirty things, it makes it very difficult to tell whether your hands are too dirty to touch something that you'd like to keep clean.  On the other hand, if your shop's workers are seen by the public, these gloves don't show dirt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JYTX8VGAUJND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BR571K#wasThisHelpful","R2JYTX8VGAUJND","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been writing coffeemaker reviews on Amazon for nearly 15 years.  Consumer-grade grind-n-brew?  Yeah, been there, done that.  I recall one prior Cuisinart that I slammed for ""near-total absence of venting and valving;"" that one let steam into the grinder each brew cycle, requiring two paper towels to clean it per session.  Another, a Krups, seemed to get the valving right with a rotary disc; but its blade grinder ground too coarsely and it broke a lot: after six months it had spent more time in repair (two trips!) than actually on my counter making coffee.  And in addition, it leaked onto the countertop.I'm pretty happy with this Cuisinart, after using it daily for three months, and I'm going to write a little bit about what they got right.First of all.  I don't usually drink 12 cups of coffee.  4 cups is my daily dose and I needed a machine that could brew that, hot and on time, and deliver it with the same quality found in the occasional 12-cup batch brewed for guests.  This ruled out the plastic insulated carafe models.  4 cups of coffee into a 12 cup carafe - well, by the time the carafe warms up, your small volume of coffee is now lukewarm.  It'll stay lukewarm - the carafe is insulated, right?  But it'll never be hot.  Yuck.  This model, the 700BC, has a glass carafe that rests on a very conventional electric heating element.  The coffee drips into a hot carafe and is kept hot; it gets sour after about 90 minutes and I think there's auto shutoff at the 3 hour mark.  The carafe itself is nice to hold, nice to put together, holds tight through a dishwasher cycle (don't add extra heat, you'll melt the plastic top).  My favorite of all: you can pour quickly, even past vertical, and the spout will not splash coffee everywhere.  It is an anti-spill top and it makes it easy for me to direct coffee just where I want it, even before my first cup when I am not quite awake yet.  I have yet to have a spill and am considering getting rid of the plastic tray that my last 10 years of coffee pots have needed to sit on!Now let's talk daily operation.  Time is easy to set; program time is just as easy to set.  The dials and lights are easily viewed from adult height.  You get the choice to program a start time for grind-n-brew operation, or if you want to pre-load grounds the night before you can set it for 'grind off', that is, brew-only operation.  Or if you want it to go immediately, you just press the button and you are off to the races.  The grinder is a little bit loud; I can't hear it upstairs, but it definitely alerts my backyard bluejays that it's time to come and get their morning cashew.  It's not painfully loud nor is it an unpleasant sound; it sounds like a coffee grinder.Grinding has a few settings: you set it for number of cups and mild, medium or strong.  I have mine set on 4 cups and strong and it gives me a very consistent, predictable dose.  The burr grinder is light-years ahead of the cheap blade grinders in other units; yet, inferior to a real pro burr grinder like my la Pavoni.  On the grind chute:  there's all kinds of people talking about cleaning the chute being a pain.  Pro tip: don't bother.  I think I've cleaned the chute twice.  It's not necessary to clean the chute if you make coffee every day; you may get just a tiny bit of day-old grounds in your coffee.  It doesn't plug up, at least not if your beans are fresh and dry.Assembly is easy.  The grounds assembly is two parts: a normal basket filter holder (I use Melitta Basket Coffee Filters, Natural Brown) and a tight-fitting lid that has a spinny disc on it.  After putting it together, you have to line up the disc properly with the housing when you close the door on the assembled filter holder.  Now this disc has three holes, which are lined with a stretchy synthetic-rubber valve seal: one is for grinding, one is for dripping hot water, one is for sealing the aroma in.  Works like a charm, no muss, no fuss, no moisture in the clear plastic bean hopper, ever.  Easy to clean under a running sink; you'll know when it's clean because just the pressure of the water will spin the disc in either direction.  And you can load the filter in wet and let it sit overnight, it'll work just as well as if you bothered to dry it.  Cleanup takes 15 seconds; reloading is another 15 seconds; I usually let the grounds assembly drip dry in between.  They can go in the dishwasher, but I don't bother.  This is the first coffee maker where I've ever actually been pleased with the convenience and ease of this step.The hopper holds about a half-pound of beans.  Its lock mechanism is a little fiddly but once you figure it out, no big deal.  I like that the top is crystal clear so I can see my beautiful, oily beans; and yet it is moisture sealed, an excellent place to store beans.  The clear plastic looks like it ought to scratch, but it hasn't yet.  The brushed-steel and gloss black plastic surfaces are handsome and wipe down easily with a paper towel when necessary.  Controls are firm, decisive, feel nice to use.  The plug is a bit flimsy, my Breville appliances have spoiled me, but it is an adequate length.This is the part of the review where I talk about what I don't like.  I had to stop and think; there isn't much.  I am very happy with this machine.  The door in the back where you pour the water in is a little narrow.  You have to have good aim or you will miss.  I have splashed a bit of water behind the coffee maker, maybe every day.  No big deal.  The machine is tall; I have standard height cabinets over a standard height counter and I have to pull the machine all the way to the front because there is not enough room to get the carafe in above the machine, yet below the cabinets.  Again, no big deal; I can push it back again when the water is loaded in.  I don't bother with the included charcoal filter because I have RO water.Durability is the last word.  It's been working perfectly for about 90 days.  If it breaks, I'll update this review.Until then, this coffee maker has my 100% recommendation; with no reservations.  It is far and away the best daily coffee pot I have ever used, it beats the competition by a country mile.  If mine went out of commission for some reason I'd buy another one tomorrow and I have recommended it to all my friends!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HY8S3CWBY7HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000T9SCZ2#wasThisHelpful","R1HY8S3CWBY7HB","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Canon was a pleasant surprise for me.  The last time I used an inkjet printer, they were just cheap, flimsy plastic housings for expensive inkjet cartridges.  But this device is much more than that.Setup was easy; it was nice to be transferred from a no-words giant poster, that had substeps 1,2,3 and 4 for step 1, then went on to step 2 - confused yet?  I sure was - to the touchscreen, which provided a nice animated way of explaining what you were supposed to do.  There is a lot of tape to peel off and plastic fiddly bits to throw away; it helps to know that all the discarded stuff is orange.  It took about 15 minutes to get it all set up: install all 5 cartridges (I got black on my thumb, but I am a klutz;) print out the calibration page and scan it; and then hook up to my password protected WiFi network.  I use an Apple Airport, so I couldn't use WPS; that was under 'advanced options'.  Software install was easy, I went to their webpage; and as a bonus, my Macbook Pro noticed I had a Canon printer, immediately went online the next day and downloaded a driver update and the Canon software.  I like that the printer doesn't have to sit near a computer; it's happy where it is.I immediately started by trying to print a high-res, very saturated photo (Nikon, even) of a sunset that I had tweaked in post until it showed every color of the rainbow.  Performance was surprisingly good, but not perfect; the vibrant purples turned into a sort of washed-out mauve, the reds turned into oranges, and the deep aquamarine, one of my favorite colors, turned into cyan.  On more restrained images - faces, a Christmas tree - color performance and resolution was acceptable.  And this was on regular paper; I'm now motivated to get some glossy paper and print out some snaps.  The included software also helps you print out other things, like Christmas cards, and I'm interested in getting that to happen too. But I wouldn't use it for volume; a quick online search suggests that 100 4x6 glossies would cost about $80 in supplies, so I think if you had 100 identical cards to print out, you'd do better with an online service.I don't have much need to scan or copy but those features work, in color or B&W, and it's nice to have this around for the occasional quickie scan.  And the interface and menu is typical Canon quality, lightyears ahead of the 10 years old LaserJet multifunction beast that this replaced.I'd recommend this to anyone who is in the market for an inkjet photo printer - it surpassed all my expectations.  If Amazon doesn't barf on my review this time I'll try to add pics: of the original sunset photo, and then a photo of the printer's attempt to reproduce it, tweaked in post to match what my eye sees (turns out digital cameras see things differently than the eye does; the photograph of the print looked identical to the original, not washed out at all.)

Check the product photos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQBN5O8DH6SCK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOSGRDK#wasThisHelpful","RQBN5O8DH6SCK","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A large hook for attaching to matte tiles.  Fine.Doesn't use adhesive or friction.  OK, now you got my attention.A clear square plastic sheet, sticky on one side, 3x3"", sticks to the tile.  It's pretty clear - you can't see it in normal light.  A suction cup, except no suction, locks into the back of the hook.  Oh wait, whoever installed the plastic into the back of the steel hook got it upside down, it doesn't lock this way.  2 screws later, it's right.  The flat plastic ""cup"" sticks to the slick square.  Great.Put it up.  Hang a bathrobe on it.

"I am a physician who has been in practice many years.  My Littman Cardiology III has saved lives.  Supposedly carotid auscultation is neither sensitive nor specific - OK, fine, but my Cardio III has picked up a few high-grade stenosis, one double stenosis on a 79 year old with recurrent syncope.  That man was about to die; a week and two operations later he was right as rain.I've also picked up pericardial tamponades, VSDs, all sorts of valvular abnormalities, succussion splashes, and even the occasional bruit from an AVM or vertebral artery abnormality.  And I can hear all of the Korotkoff sounds on those occasions where I choose to take a manual brachial BP.This 'scope is no good if you don't know what you're listening for, don't care to hear it, or haven't been trained.  It won't train you.  The tunable diaphragm is a neat feature - I use it every day because I'm accustomed to it.  That takes time.I knew a cardiac surgeon towards the end of his career who was going deaf - he took around a Fisher-Price scope.  You could hear murmurs through it but it was like listening through a fuzzy curtain.  But in his case, and for the rest of you wangs who didn't train in physical diagnosis, a nod is as good as a wink - to a deaf bat.  Buy a status symbol.But if you want comfort and quality sound amplification, this scope is the one.  Buy it, use it everyday, and, then, you will have the luxury afforded by any good tool - you can forget about it and get to work.  I'm buying another because I want an extra scope for my doctor's hospital bag; I still have my original, and it's been through some pretty rough use - looks brand new.One downside: people steal these all the damn time.

"I have been running one of these for about a year.  I bought the bulb as sort of a foray into LED lighting, and interestingly, the price has not gone down one bit - so much for those promises.The bulb consists of a finned housing that contains some ultraviolet LEDs, and a big yellow plastic thingie, donut shaped, that the LEDs sit upon.  UV light makes this yellow plastic donut glow, and it glows bright white.I was one of those guys who liked soft-pink incandescents - the very mildly tinted GE brand - to illuminate his room, and I'm totally left behind by the low-energy revolution.  Billionaires need fossil fuels for their wars; they can't afford to leave any drop of oil behind for their serfs.  So by their imperious mandate, I am left with harshly lit rooms at home and at work.I was hoping that a glowing yellow plastic donut might provide a softer light.  I put this into an upright torchiere with a plastic translucent shade, and there it has remained.  I have a normal white incandescent, same lux, on the opposite side of the sofa and compared to that soft orange wash this throws a harsh blue light.  But there is no flicker, no green tone, and the tone is warmer than the average 'warm white led'; so it's been the best I could find.I guess I got lucky; other had noisy bulbs, or early failure.  I am pretty sure I am coming up on 10000 hours on this bulb and I have never had any such issues.  There is a slight delay, this bulb takes about 1/5 sec. to power-up.  And, though it is dimmable, the torchiere I have it in has a 3 way rotary switch.  The bulb does *not* work with the three-way switch; it turns 'off' in the 'off' and '50W' setting, turns 'on' in the 100W and 150W settings.  So there is an extra click to turn the bulb on.  I should probably switch it over to the better torchiere with a potentiometer and a tan cloth shade over on the other side of the couch, see how that works out for me.EDIT:  So yeah, I tried this bulb on a torchiere with a continuous dimmer knob instead of an on-off switch.  For a moment I thought a swarm of bees had landed in my lamp - it was that loud.  Put it back over to the on-off lamp - no buzzing at all.  So if you dim this 'dimmable' bulb, get ready for a lot of noise!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39HK7BP729LDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7SZGXA#wasThisHelpful","R39HK7BP729LDG","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Battery died after 6 weeks.I will probably at some point be able to get a replacement under warranty, but it took an hour to find the toll-free number to call (it's 1-800-682-7664), and I chose a wrong time to call that number, and I know what this means; more and more hours trying to have a working ultrasonic toothbrush, when the current state of affairs is that I'm out six bills and have no working toothbrush.Since what I wanted was a working toothbrush, not a non-working toothbrush and an obligation to fight repeatedly with customer service specialists on the phone for a few hours, I regret the purchase.  I will update this review with news on how the fight went, but it'd take an act of FedEx to make me change the star count.The toothbrush is almost as good at cleaning my teeth as the 8 year old Sonicare Elite - still working, by the way - that it replaced; and it's easier to keep clean owing to the sealed design.  If it actually worked it'd be somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.EDIT:  Once I finally got through, during working hours, it took 32 minutes to get the guy on the other end to agree that the battery was defective.  To his credit he promptly shipped a replacement battery, which has been working fine for a month; they made me ship the old one back, on my own dime, which is against the law where I live, but whatever.  Add a Hamilton to whatever you thought this thing cost.It works fine.  I usually spend about half as long as the device thinks I should, twice a day; and I floss once a day.  The compact DiamondClean bristle tip I chose works very well, cleans everything, even the little spaces between the gum and tooth junction; when I had to go on a trip for a few days and bring a normal toothbrush because this one was out of commission, I missed having clean teeth.I still have all the teeth I was born with, intact; and I plan on maintaining that state of affairs for another 40 years.

"You always see palm trees in the desert and other dry areas.  So when I bought a home with a couple queen palms out front it didn't occur to me that they need special treatment.  But they do; they need lots of water and they prefer special food.  This formula greened up my palms - no, that brownish-yellow color isn't necessary, they can turn bright green, has to do with potassium and trace minerals - and, along with copious watering, got them to grow a foot taller just in one summer.  I use it every 8 weeks along with a regular saturation-watering schedule and I couldn't be happier.I even sent this jug to my mom.  It pops open and the top has a special scattering system so she doesn't have to bend over to scatter the granules; she is older and has some joint troubles and I didn't want her to have to bend over or crawl around!  She was very pleased with that.PRO TIP:  If you like the shake and feed jug as much as I do: When it comes time to refill, save the empty jug and buy the 8 lb refill of granules.  Pour them into the old jug.

"I bought this to replace an old one which had yellowed and gone opaque.  It is good to know, maybe, that this sink saddle is slightly fluorescent; in daylight there is a definite blue glow to it, and it will not match anything white or clear that is in your kitchen, unless you are wearing a highly fluorescent diamond ring - it's that same color.  At night this goes away.  No big deal but sort of weird.It's sturdy, has square edges that hold their shape.  You can rest a very heavy pot on it no problem; it totally protects the underlying sink divider, which in my kitchen is porcelain and needs the protection.  Yet the flower pattern has enough holes in it that water evaporates away before annoying slimes and molds can accumulate there.  My old sink saddle would melt if anything hot touched it, even for a moment by accident; I've had a few touches with hot pans and rotisseries on this one and it failed to melt, though I'm sure it's not intended for hi-temp use.I guess I'll be buying another one in a few years.  If I did, I'd be delighted if this one were still available; I'd buy it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R278SHWKH2A47I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QDWTGC#wasThisHelpful","R278SHWKH2A47I","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best kitchen faucet available on the market today.  Amazon often has open-box returns and I took advantage of that to purchase one that was in new condition, had never even been unpacked but the seal on the box was open.  You can get a significant discount that way so I do recommend checking the Warehouse Deals on this product.Ladylux 3 is a Grohe model, it means you get the one-handle design that controls both flow rate and temperature.  The moving parts are ceramic and are warranted for a lifetime of use. During installation, the handle can be positioned to the right, left or center in case you wish to accommodate lefties or little ones in your house; but it's easy to use in any position.  (I find that, though I have the faucet head installed on my right side, I am often holding something, like a heavy pot, with my right hand when I turn it on, and my left hand operates it naturally without any trouble.) The spray head easily detaches and if installed properly has a nice spring action that is light but easily auto-retracts.I bought this faucet in RealSteel, which is solid steel construction.  If you choose to verify this with a magnet, as I did, here are two things to know:  1)  Steel becomes less magnetic where it is bent.  The graceful bend at the top of this faucet is one such place.  2)  A metal magnet, or indeed anything harder than steel, will scratch the beautiful brushed-steel finish of this faucet.  Use a tissue or a thin cloth.  I have, however, been using this faucet for a month and nothing else has scratched it; I think it's safe to say that this faucet will be the hardest thing in most kitchens.  (My chromium-molybdenum-vanadium steel Global chef's knives, for instance, won't scratch it; it would scratch them if I scrubbed them against it, which I do not.)I bought this because I had just switched to soft water; hard water had pretty much spoiled my previous faucet, a Grohe white plastic number that is no longer made.  (The soft rubbery water outlet does make it pretty easy to get rid of limescale, but it'll build up eventually.)  A plumber took about an hour to take out the old one and put in the new; I did request that he remove the flow restrictors and given other reviews I am pleased I did, the flow of this faucet is not particularly powerful.  That's nice because it doesn't splash out of the sink even in the shallow side (8"") of my double sink.  Yet when the spray button is pressed the flow is strong enough to wash off baked-on food.  It's just right.The faucet is 15.25 inches high from my granite countertop vertically to the highest part of the arch.  The water impacts in a radius 8.5 inches from the center of its mounting hole when the spray head is pointing down.  You can make the spray head point out instead of down by rotating it 180 degrees; the water impact point stays in my 31 x 20"" sink when this is done, though I have still not found any reason why this would be useful.  The width from the center of the mounting hole to the widest point of the faucet lever is 4.5 inches.  I rounded all these measurements up to the nearest quarter-inch.The finish, RealSteel, is gorgeous.  It is simply solid brushed steel, grey with a matte shine and just the tiniest hint of blue, as steel does have.  (This faucet is not blue; I am talking about a tiny hint of color, usual for steel, that, at the age of 42, as a guy who loves colors and material science, I can barely see any more with my old eyes.  My iPhone 6 camera can see it!)  Grohe makes this faucet in three finishes.  Mine is RealSteel, which as far as I can tell is solid steel through-and-through with just a wire-brushed finish on it.  The others are Starlight Chrome and Brushed Nickel, which I only know from photos.  Both of those are brass with a coating of either chrome or nickel.  As far as I can tell these are some of the highest-quality coatings on the market and are warrantied to match; I like the RealSteel and expect it to last decades.The upgoing and arch parts of the faucet are very thick steel pipe stock; the spray head and spray button are a much thinner steel, so lightweight I initially thought they might be plastic.  They're not; they're very strong, tough steel.  The rotating part of the faucet I think might actually be plastic; it's replaceable and has a little rubbery seal where it mates to the stem of the faucet.  The lever feels substantial, moves smoothly, stays put.It's surprising how much a person uses their kitchen faucet.  If you're like me and like to have the very best, stop looking - this is your faucet.  And if you're upgrading, don't forget a matching dishwasher vent cover - I got this one: KOHLER K-9111-VS Air Gap Cover with Collar, Vibrant Stainless - and I found it to be an excellent finish-match.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZJ3O56EH1U4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5DM128#wasThisHelpful","RZJ3O56EH1U4F","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using this for years.  It used to be colored yellow and come in a clear bottle.  It's not something you'd want to eat - it's a bunch of substituted quat-ammonium surfactants - but it's safe for food prep surfaces, not poisonous, and it wipes off clean without residue.  Rinse and wipe down the surfaces after use and you're good to go.It's particularly good at getting baked-on oils off of appliance surfaces like oven or dishwasher doors; it is excellent at cleaning and re-whitening the matte plastic door of my fridge, where hand grime accumulates; and while I don't really like using it on my granite countertop, porcelain sink or my wood cabinets, it doesn't harm those if overspray gets on those surfaces.A bonus: I'm pretty touchy about foul scents and perfumes added to a lot of products.  This cleaner has a very mild lemony scent that doesn't even cover up the smell of the active ingredient - and which doesn't trigger my migraines.

"This little quad is not the cheap junk that was flooding the market a few years ago.  It's sturdy, well built and easy to get up and flying for this beginner.

Crashes are a part of RC flight but if you install the included prop guards like I did, it's pretty hard to damage the little beast - haven't managed to do so yet.  (That install requires a bit of fine dexterity and a bit of strength - it's a press fit, props have to come off, then you place flexible plastic hub around a metal axle; it's not a task for little hands.)The Kodo's amazingly fun and a tiny little marvel of technology and design.

"Unpacking this valet stand, my heart sank as 1,000,000 fragments of cheap styrofoam flew everywhere.  You already know what you're in for, don't you?You'll need 2 philips head screwdrivers, a large and a small, to assemble this valet stand - if you buy it, which I don't recommend.""Wood"" is very cheap, very thin mahogany veneer - I think - over MDF.  As I pulled out the hanger part, I thought there was some white paint on its edge, so I went to scrape it away with my fingernail.  The white area expanded instead; apparently I was scratching off finish, which had started when the wood rubbed against styrofoam in the package.  What's white about wood, I'm not sure; if you thought you were buying a wooden product, you're mistaken.  I banged the piece against a white molding carrying it into my bedroom; didn't dent, it was just a touch, but it left a big purple streak like a crayon.  I rubbed that out with a Magic Eraser, so you may want one of those if you're buying this too.  (And def have a vacuum nearby; there'll be a little pile of sawdust and styrofoam bits.)The parts list wasn't complete; there were two tiny little wood screws that weren't on it.  Don't mistake them for the single, short metal screw (parts list calls it a wood screw), which is used in step 1.  If you use a long metal screw (called a wood screw on the parts list) instead of the short metal screw, you'll break the veneer over the little valet tray from below.The instructions are poor; they instructed me to leave out a wooden peg, and at the end I realized I'd just made a mistake.  They also don't tell you what to do with the tiny wood screws; they're to hold the hanger onto the frame, although one of the holes for them wasn't drilled, just touched with a drill to break the finish.The piece is small and rests on 6, not 4, rubberized feet; it'll never sit level on any surface.  It's about 15 inches wide - it looks a lot wider - and tall enough that a light touch is enough to knock it over.  Did I mention it marks purple whatever it lightly touches?  So that's great.  I'm kind of afraid to put nice clothes onto it, and I don't really need this kind of stand for play clothes.I went back and looked at what I paid for this, thinking, heck, what do you expect for an Andrew Jackson, from China these days.  But China is actually putting out some top quality stuff.  (This ain't it.)  And this thing cost an army of Jacksons; after tax those Jacksons were knocking on Mr Franklin's door.  That's ridiculous.I think this is probably going to collect dust for a few weeks before I throw it out.  And that's the kind of thing I'd like to know about something before I bought it.

I like the slightly heavier bottom for the thump that gets the rhythm going and then if I am doing a melodic line I can actually do a couple runs on the G string.Recommended, no reservations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R1HMSGA1USBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFRXACG#wasThisHelpful","R2R1HMSGA1USBK","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have a pastry bag and like piping decorative icing, these will increase your possibilities.

"Hostess got a lot of free publicity when it declared bankruptcy and voided its obligations to pay its retired employees pensions' and healthcare obligations.  Of course the 'assets' - the factory and recipes - were quickly sold to venture capital; and employees who didn't care to be out of work along with their suddenly-evaporated non-pensions were rehired, so pretty much business as usual in the USA.This free publicity reminded me of Hostess Cup Cakes, my favorite in the 80's.  They used to come in packs of 2, so when I saw that this was a box of 8, I thought it was a box of 8 packs of two.  Nope, it's a box of 8 single cupcakes, each one individually wrapped.They're also about half the size they were in the 80s - if that - and they are not packaged in plastic cups any more, just sitting on a cardstock board, so they are sort of squashy and get molded roughly into a cube shape on their journey to your house.They tasted just like I remember 'em; moist cake, rich chocolate flavor, creamy icing, and of course that white foam, reminiscent of Chantilly cream, in the middle.  They arrived a few days before their sell-by date and freshness was not in question; they tasted fine.I am not sure I am really on board with a buck fifty apiece for such tiny morsels - I can get larger, fresher, less technologically engineered cupcakes at that price at the local bakery - but otherwise, these cakes deliver as expected.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QAX8UQ7R2932/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0005ZHOUO#wasThisHelpful","R1QAX8UQ7R2932","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom line, moved to the top for clarity:  a designed-infused coffeemaker that is beautifully designed and makes lukewarm coffee.Bodum is a company famous for design, and particularly design parsimony.  Their vacuum powered coffee makers - one piece of glass, a handle, boiling water, coffee, no moving parts - are famous as design tour de forces and are still preferred by a lot of coffee snobs today.  But this is their take on a 10-cup drip coffee pot, with some innovative design features.I get why design aficionados might want this coffee pot.  Pee-Wee Herman would love it - it's his favorite color, a sort of slightly pinkish bright red - and it won't match any other red appliances you have in your kitchen.  Kids would love it too because you can see all stages of the brewing process.  Heck, I like that too.It's lightweight, but covered in no-slip nubbles so you won't drop it - and it's transparent in the back, so you can see that the interior is held to the same design standards as the outside.  Drip coffeemakers are simple - steam water with electric heat, use steam pressure to pump water over grounds - and you get a good look at this process with the Bodum.This shipped in a cardboard box.  Inside the cardboard box there is another cardboard box.  Inside this cardboard box there is another cardboard box, this one with glossy printing on it; and a two page too-long-didn't-read summary of the neat features of the coffeemaker.  (For instance, the steam tube is tempered glass so no plastic odor gets in the water.)  Inside the third cardboard box, there is a bunch of cardboard eggcrate material; a thick instruction book which I didn't touch; and the coffeemaker itself, each part wrapped in styrofoam and bubblewrap.  If this sounds like it was overpacked to you, it was, which is odd for a coffeepot trying to position itself as environmental.It's easy to set up and use.  The grounds holder is made of a very, very fine herringbone titanium weave.  It is incredibly fine mesh.  If I liked metal mesh groundsholders, which I do not, this would be the best one I had ever seen.  Only the very finest bits of grind get through into the coffee; which in my opinion is only somewhat inferior to no grounds getting in the coffee at all.  However, the book chastises paper filter users for 'loss of aroma', so I didn't use any paper in my trials.Ergonomically this thing is great.  The filter holder has a nice rubbery handle about the size and color of a clown nose; makes it easy to take it out, empty it, clean it.  Cleaning the metal mesh filter will spray grounds all over your white porcelain sink, of course, another reason I prefer paper, as after a few months of this your porcelain is now brown.  I like the clear water reservoir; it's easy to remove and replace, easy to fill, and gradated in every sort of volume measurement system known to Man - cups, SI units, Imperial units.The carafe is almost worth the price of admission.  It's beautiful red ABS plastic, double-walled (so they say) steel interior, has a little thumb-lock so it won't pour until you want it to, cuts off the flow immediately when you let go of the trigger, and doesn't drip.  It also has a spring-loaded top so you can steal the first cup brewed without spills before brewing is done, if you want; all the caffeine comes out in the first 15 seconds of brewing so you can really shaft your co-workers or family members if you choose to use this feature.  I really like this carafe.  I don't get why the bottom of it unscrews; there's a glob of adhesive under there and when I saw that I regretted unscrewing it.The silicone showerhead is supposed to catch all chalk deposits and evenly distribute water over the grounds.  It definitely showers the grounds evenly.  Extraction and flavor was perfect - they really got that right.  I didn't use this long enough for chalk to build up; I can see that the silicone rubber (polysiloxanes) is easy to remove and would be easy to clean and replace.  It amuses me that there is plastic in the steam path, right after the tempered glass pipe that is advertised as being plastic-free, and right before the silicone showerhead.  All the plastic appears to me to be ABS, which is totally nonreactive at coffeemaker temperatures, so it's fine with me, but for the price of this coffeemaker they ought to hire someone to verify the marketing claims.I don't agree that this looks or feels cheap.  It looks goofy because it is explicitly designed and has a bunch of built-in design cues.  There is a difference.There are two things wrong with this coffeemaker, and one is a real deal-breaker.  There is no carafe warmer.  The coffee comes out of the filter holder into the carafe, and it will never gain warmth again.  It hits the cold carafe, and loses heat as it warms up the carafe.  You then pour coffee into your cup, and it loses heat there too.  By the time the coffee hits my lips it is barely, barely hot enough to drink, and 30 seconds later as it loses heat to the cup and the air, it is lukewarm.  I experimented, and found that this is less of a problem if you brew 10 cups at a time, but I don't; I usually brew 4.  It is also less of a problem if you heat your cup, either by microwaving a cup of water or running hot water into the cup - but who wants to do that?I don't want lukewarm coffee, ever, and so this was frustrating.  The carafe is great - it holds the coffee at temperature perfectly for hours - but that temperature is not hot enough.The other problem is that this coffeemaker is huge.  I have a pretty big kitchen, but counter space is always at a premium; and coffeemakers require a lot of space because you need somewhere to put the beans, grinder, cup when you're pouring, etc.  This thing takes up like 3 times the space of my Zojirushi Zutto and 4 times the space of my little Braun cheapie.So yeah, at this price it's good but not great, and I think that people who love (hot) coffee more than they love showing off their innovative Euro Design collection would be advised to look elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NBRJA2SKHLET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OQL6P8#wasThisHelpful","R1NBRJA2SKHLET","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not a soap connoisseur here. Just a guy who has some skin trouble, is tired of every synthetic thing under the sun, wanted to try something tried and true.This soap smells great, feels great, lathers well, and the giant block lasts a long time. It is a touch drying, but despite that my skin loves it. I was not expecting this soap to be anywhere near as good as it is. Ingredients are 72% olive oil and some coconut oil, saponified with vegetable-ash lye; sea salt; and water. I don't know why it smells so good - none of the things I mentioned seem like they ought to have this light, soapy fragrance - but it really does.I will buy another block in a few months, when this one is finally done.EDIT: I am updating this review to reflect my increasing pleasure and joy in using this soap. I already gave the product 5 stars; I wish I could give it 6. I had originally just been using it as a kitchen hand soap, but I took it into the shower a few days ago, though I worried it might dry my skin out. Nope - it works perfectly well as a body soap, conditioner, and shampoo. It is gentle on all the exposed mucous membranes of the body - it does sting if you get it in your eyes. However, it rinses off easily and quickly and leaves hair and skin supple and soft, not stripped of natural oils. I have occasionally used olive oil as a skin moisturizer and this soap leaves my skin feeling the same way.Another reviewer endorsed this soap because she didn't want to be applying ""someone's chemistry experiment"" to her skin. I have come along to feeling the same way. I didn't even know about this soap; I wouldn't know about it, except that I visited central Spain a few months ago, and that area is famous for Castile soap, which as a physician, I know is one of the few things safe for use as an enema. So I was interested in learning about Castile soap, and that Wikipedia article led me to Marseille soap, and that led me here.You ever get the feeling that we're off track as a civilization, inventing ever newer and fancier ways to screw ourselves up, when the old tried and true standbys languish, available but abandoned on the march to ever more relentless consumer capitalism? No? OK, just me then. Get some of this soap anyway. It's totally excellent.EDIT 2:  I've learned that Marseille soap made by Marius Fabre comes in two recipes.  One is 72% olive oil, like this one; a light green color; beautiful fragrance; and says ""72% Extra Pur"" stamped into the block of soap.  The other kind has palm oil (sodium palmate is the ingredient on the label), does not say 72% extra pur, is tan colored, and smells different, not as nice.  The palm oil soap is also more drying on the skin and I can't use it - Fabre themselves recommend it as a laundry soap.  As far as I can tell, in France the palm oil stuff is cheaper.I've gotten the palm oil soap at least once when what I ordered was the olive oil soap; so, buyer beware!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLFT2J7HA8VYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012GHQBM#wasThisHelpful","RLFT2J7HA8VYH","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a Vine guy, but I bought this set of pans with my own money.  I like the Emeril name and I already had an Emeril 'chef's pan' that I bought at Bed, Bath and Beyond a few years ago; I've always enjoyed using that pan, which is vaguely wok-like, and I thought I'd see if I liked this set as much.  I love to cook and have been doing so regularly for 20 years; I've used cast iron, QVC stainless steel, 80's style Corning Visions glass cookware, 60's style Club brand pure thick aluminum pots, crummy aluminum lightweight backcountry camping cookware, Le Creuset and Staub enamelware, cheap Teflon nonstick, middle-of-the-road nonstick, and the very best Anolon Advanced nonstick.  I've fondled a lot of All-Clad - never cooked with any - and  I've even used pure bright-copper pots and skillets, though goodness knows a set costs more than a car these days.I like to write a long review and I've been using these pans exclusively for about 2 months as I thought about what folks might want to know about this set.  I like this set pretty well for what it's good at; I feel the same way about a lot of different kinds of cookware and so I will talk about appearance, quality, ease of use/ergonomics, cooking performance, cleanup, and how different parts of the set stack up to other things I like to use.First off: appearance.  The first week out of the box I had every piece out on my rangetop and counter.  It's gorgeous.  This is good chrome steel with a nice mirror finish on the outside and a nice satin finish on the inside.  I expect it to develop a nice patina - indeed some of the pans are already headed that way - and if you like a nice looking set of cookware you won't go wrong here.  The lids are glass - I like to see through my lids, that's just me - and the long handles are shiny and nicely bulbous, no edges.  (The small handles that are made of bent bar stock are dull-finished and have edges, which makes them not very nice to hold while they are hot, one of many ways this set falls short of the All-Clad name it bears.)  Handles are riveted in with small rivets but the joints are solid enough that they conduct heat readily.The stockpot is smaller than I thought it'd be from the Amazon photo.  It's 10 quarts.  Works great - eating chicken soup from it today - but not big enough to, say, brew the wort for a 5 gallon batch of beer.  I complained to my mother about this, which was a mistake, maybe, because she went into her garage and got me a 14 quart Anolon clad steel stockpot she has had stored away for 20 years, still in the original box.  Mom's awesome.  She was once a professional chef and probably has enough cookware in the garage to stock 10 homes; most of the stuff I've cooked on was hers.Quality:  No aluminum is visible.  The sides of these pots, skillets and pans are very thin walled, maybe 2 mm, where an All-clad pot is closer to 6mm.  The bases of these pots are thicker, maybe 4 mm.  The two pieces of steel make a 'sandwich' where the inside third layer is aluminum - at least I assume so.  They certainly spread and conduct heat lightning quick, much faster than steel usually would.  These are the lightest-weight (apart the camping gear) and quickest and most evenly heating pans I've ever used, more on that later.  I feel like they're light enough that I might dent them with a hammer, or if I ran my kitchen like one of Emeril's rowdy restaurant kitchens, but I can't see that happening in my quiet little house.The volume gradations on the inside of the pots is a neat idea and actually was a motivator for me to get these pots.  I am sorry to report they are printed on, the same way Henckels and Global knives print on their knife blades; I expect they'll last a year, no longer.  I was hoping - kind of thought - they would be stamped in and actually permanent.  Nope.Ease of use: there is this new techology that's available, lots of reviewers haven't heard of it yet.  It's called potholders.  You're going to need a few to use these pots - no option - because there has been no effort made to stop any handle from getting hot.  The handles get very hot.  They will burn you badly if you do not use a potholder.  You must have a potholder.  Some of the handles get as hot as the cooking surface, which I regard as questionable design.  I love that the pots are light, which makes them much less likely to slip out of my glove / potholder; I can swish or flip food with a flick of my wrist, like you see big thick-armed Mario Batali types do on Iron Chef.  I can't do that with cast iron, though I'm pretty sure Mario has no problem with it.  (I've been to 3 of Emeril's restaurants, one with an open kitchen; looks to me like all his chefs use cast iron pans and steel pots, not these.)  I like the way the long handles fit my hand, which is 7.5 size; I do not like the lid handles or the stockpot handles, they feel sharp-edged - not knife-sharp, but unpleasant to bear weight on the fingers - and I feel like my fingers are a little too fat for the narrow space those handles leave for them.  Since I'm usually using a potholder it's not a real problem.Cooking performance:  For simmering and medium temperature saucing and soupmaking, these are ideal.  Heat transfer is swift, immediate, and super efficient - these pots probably save natural gas, all the heat goes to the food; and they're light enough to easily move around the kitchen with no fear of droppy/burny accidents.  (Cork mats, friend - put one everywhere a pot might want to be.)  However, these are the easiest tasks and most pots perform well at them.  These pots clean up OK afterwards, much better than copper or cast iron, nowhere near as easily as nonstick (although I hate simmering things in plastic, it just doesn't sit well with me.)Now let's talk about higher heat.  Say, like sauteing, or stir fry, or even a sear.  These pans *transfer* heat super evenly and super efficiently.  But they are light and have no way to *retain* heat.  They are a poor *reservoir* of heat energy.  What that means is they heat up lightning quick - often way, way hotter than you wanted them to; and then when you put the food in, or your deglaze, they suddenly drop 300-500 degrees and suddenly now you're not sauteing or deglazing, even though just 3 seconds ago your pot was hot enough to melt Tina Turner's vinyl miniskirt.  Sitting there trying to re-warm a pot full of soggy pork bits and boozy cognac is a sorry excuse for a deglaze and it never really tasted quite right yet; I don't think i'm going to be able to get it right.  The other problem, though, is that when you do get the pan that hot - especially if you're trying to, say, sear a hangar steak or something - your steel's not stainless any more.  The first time I used a sauteed-kale recipe that I'd been doing in a thicker clad stainless pan for years - lightly brown diced garlic in olive oil; add chopped kale and a touch of salt and red pepper; saute lightly 2 minutes, then wilt, covered, for 5 minutes more - the pan discolored as soon as the kale hit it; and then the kale wouldn't saute; I had to heat it up another minute to get it warm again.  Then when I covered it it heated up to insane temperatures on the lowest heat my range would do.  It ended up soggier than usual and the pan surface was permanently stained - even after an SOS pad.  (I don't like using Barkeeper's Friend or SOS, but you'll need something like them if you don't want the skillet pans getting downright ugly inside.)What about very low heat, like omelet?  Forget about it; you simply cannot get precise enough due to the high temp fluctuations of these pans.  Your omelet will be scorched and runny.  (The best omelet pans I've found are nonstick, the only thing I like using nonstick for; the thicker the base, and the lower the heat, the better.)  You could maybe scramble an egg tough without burning it in these pans, but forget about over easy.  (The whole world already has forgotten over easy, the most challenging egg; I haven't gotten real over easy in a diner for more than a decade.  So I *have* to be able to make it myself.)Cleanup:  These are totally OK in the dishwasher, although if you let the mirror surface rub, it'll scratch and develop patina.  I use the dishwasher and I am hoping eventually to acquire a good old 18/10 style sweet glowy patina, but the inside of these pans is starting to show permanent black and brown stains, like the crappy 18/0 Oneida flatware I bought last year thinking it was the same as my old 18/8 flatware.  (It wasn't; it looks worse now than the 15 year old stuff it was supposed to replace.)This set is better to clean than cast iron by a long shot, better than anodized - much tougher; simply, however, not in the same league as even cheap nonstick.  Food will stick and stains may need abrasive scrub and some stains won't scrub out.  It used to be that use of metal utensils distinguished steel as superior to nonstick in cooking or cleaning; nowadays the best nonstick can take a fork poke without scratching, so steel lost that advantage.Summary: I honestly think this set is designed to look like All-clad, but it costs less than a single piece of All-Clad cookware would.  The pots are fine; it might make sense to buy this set just for them and then get one decent All-Clad skillet for higher-temperature work.  Another option, which I didn't realize until after I bought, is that the Emeril chef pan I liked, the one with a 5mm thick chunk of copper clad into the base, is a Bed, Bath and Beyond exclusive.  That pan *does* retain heat in its base and doesn't cause the problem I talked about above.  But you can't buy those pans anywhere but BBBY - believe me, I looked; I'd forgotten that I got that pan at BBBY many years ago.  Lately I learned they still carry that Emeril line; and that line's set, while I think with one fewer pot and one fewer lid, is price-competitive with this set.  I might have bought that set instead if I'd realized that it was still being made.  However for value, looks, and light weight I don't think this set can be beat!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HQKJ5TYHGRPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085C96DC#wasThisHelpful","R2HQKJ5TYHGRPL","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a Krups combination espresso and regular coffee maker.I wouldn't recommend anyone buy it, but I wrote most of the review before I tried to pull a shot of espresso, so read on if you want the full review.The espresso pot holds two long shots.  The coffee pot is what is called a 10-cup and takes a #4 cone filter (book says #3, but Amazon doesn't sell unbleached #3's, only 2's and 4's; I actually used #2s for this review); no filter is included.  There is a steam wand for frothing milk, but no milk pitcher is included (a steel pitcher is recommended to get the best froth.)  This machine has no grinder and includes a clock and a program setting which will activate the coffee-side of the machine once at a specified time not more than 24 hours in the future.  There is no cup warmer and a measuring scoop with a flattened bottom does double duty as a tamper, though you are told not to tamp grounds tight.I am comparing it to my current setup, which is a very basic Braun 4-cup coffee maker and a 1988 Krups Espresso Novo.  Whole beans, highest quality and drenched in oils; and RO water are used; I grind at brew time with Braun blade and La Pavoni burr grinders.  I probably drank 5 times my usual daily intake while writing this review, so if I go overboard, please blame the caffeine.Unboxing was easy, not too much waste, and it would be easy to repack the unit.  On inspection, it's a handsome piece of equipment, all black plastic, except the drip plate under the espresso portafilter, which is gray plastic.  I liked the manual cord winder beneath the unit so you don't have extra cord all over your counter.  Water is loaded into the espresso boiler from the top; inspection reveals some sharp edges in the cast aluminum boiler.  The portafilter is narrower and deeper than usual, suggesting to me that pressures and extractions might be on the dicey side.  The steam wand swings out to the user's left, requiring left-handed frothing and at least a good 6-8 inches of free space on the left of the unit.On the coffee side, the filter holder swings out, requiring about 6-8 inches free space on the right of the unit.  The filter holder is ridged black plastic, nothing unusual here.  The carafe is glass and a very odd shape: its fat base narrows down considerably to fit onto the 4-inch-wide heating element.  (My Braun and Zojirushi 4-cups each have a 5-inch-wide element; the Krups carafe is 6 inches wide just above this weird base.)Java, first cup:  the coffee brewed quickly, quietly and, sadly, with little aroma.  I had music playing and my usual sonic cue that the coffee was done was not audible.  A red light indicating brewing comes on, then goes off; a green light comes on indicating ready; I am 5'10"" and had to back 8 feet off to be able to see either of these lights in my bright kitchen because they are recessed too far into the panel.  About 25% of the water was lost in the brewing process, same as my little cheapie.  The carafe poured easily and did not spill everywhere when I wanted to pour swiftly, a major problem with some carafes.  Flavor was bright, bitter and clear and the coffee was much hotter than I am used to: altogether a superior extraction.  I like to use coffee machines for years and hand-clean them; this was, of course, missing that flavor, but the oily bitterness of a nice complete extraction more than made up for it.  Cleanup was swift and easy.Espresso:  This thing doesn't make espresso.  I compared it side by side, identical conditions, to my 25 year old Krups Espresso Novo.  Now a purist would scoff at that machine, but after looking at the price tags on La Pavoni Europiccolas for the last decade, I've never managed to pull the trigger and buy one, so I think it'll probably be my home-espresso standard for the immediate future.  My standards are at least 8mm of crema; a nutty, buttery, just-baked-bread aroma, sweet caramel flavor notes, and a super oily texture on a ristretto; tongue-burning hotness in a prewarmed demi-tasse; total destruction of that fishy smell that is common and appropriate to true freshly-roasted full-city beans; and no burnt/sour/bitter after-coat on the tongue. I shot one just before trying the machine under review and it was as usual - better than usual, actually, because I bought some really nice beans for this review.First I tried filling up the boiler on this machine.  (Meanwhile I set down the filled portafilter, which promptly tipped over and spilled.)  I pressed the button, thinking it would heat and build up a head of steam - my old machine took 124 seconds to be ready.  This machine did nothing for 15 minutes.  I then read the manual and found out that you have to pre-load the boiler with the exact amount of water you want in the carafe, and then just let it go through at its own pace.  Since the options are two demi-tasses and four demi-tasses, you can't shoot straight into your prewarmed cup - you must use the carafe.Already I was skeptical - espresso is made by swiftly forcing a cylinder of overpressure steam through a tamped grounds cake with no headspace - but I did what the manual suggested.  In about 2 minutes I had a carafe full to the '2' mark.  There were 2 mm of listless crema which did not come through in the pour from the carafe into my demi-tasse.  The coffee was about 110 degrees at that point.  The taste was ashes, bitter cinchona bark, fresh-beans fishiness, and a tongue-coating burnt bitterness that lingered foully.  The difference between this and my old machine was night and day and I spat this machine's product into the sink.Inspection of the portafilter was revealing.  Larger bits of grind had clearly FLOATED in the headspace.  There was no disturbance of the surface of the cake by jets of steam, something I like to look for in an espresso maker.  The cake was tamped tight, suggesting that some overpressure had taken place, and when I knocked it in the trash it came out in one piece.  The plastic filter-lock also popped off its hinges, though, so the filter and filter lock also fell into the trash, and the side of my index finger that was holding the filter lock on, slid up the handle to the metal filter holder and got burned - second degree, too, nice blister.  (I swear that's not why I'm giving this machine 1 star, though - could've happened to anyone on any machine on any given day.)After this, I actually took the time to fire up the steam wand.  Surprisingly, perhaps, it was almost as good as the old machine.  The wand wouldn't reach the bottom of my standard issue Krups 20 oz. steel pitcher.  Really getting stiff foam with a home machine like this takes some practice - it's nothing like using a commercial 6 atm machine - and this was complicated by the fact that my practice has all been done using my dominant right hand.  I used my right hand for this, too, but it was the wrong side of the machine - lefties should love this wand - and it was awkward.  Foam was decent, not super, certainly didn't form peaks or serve as a surface for mocha art.  There was also an extra step; after I was done foaming, I shut the steam off and then the manual instructs me that I have to let all the steam out into a vessel of cold water.  That took like another 30 seconds.Seriously, Krups?  I don't shoot espresso into a carafe.  The left side of this machine is a small drip coffeemaker.  Don't try to sell it to me as an espresso machine.  As part of this review I went to BB&B (needed a steel pitcher, couldn't find mine) and noticed a few Breville machines - one with a built in grinder - and actually one Krups machine as well - that look like they'd build up 15 bar and do it more or less right.  All of these were metal, had super thick groupheads and portafilters - yeah, I am the kind of guy who uses the word grouphead, live with it - and were priced about three times as much as this model.Summary:  Right side works just as well as a lot of $30 coffee makers with clock on the market - and better than some, though I prefer my Zojirushi Zutto.  Left side is worthless unless you want to make hot chocolate.  Therefore, one star.  Consider moving up into the higher pricepoints; getting a dedicated 15 bar espresso-only unit; or buying a used Espresso Novo #964 in the usual places (if you do, make sure its steam wand has a black rubber tip with a steel snorkel, and that the snorkel has the little black plastic doohickey on its top end.)","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CF2ATEGWFMI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EYP5HC#wasThisHelpful","R2CF2ATEGWFMI8","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just got done installing this lamp.  It is and it isn't what I expected; I'll summarize.The dimensions here on the Amazon website are accurate, and the colors are too, I think, with the exception of the base, which looks brass here in the picture.  It's not brass; it is indeed the 'antique bronze' as advertised, although it is one or two shades lighter than all the other oil-rubbed bronze fixtures that I have nearby.It is super light, which made it nice to install; I easily did it by myself in about 15 minutes on a stepladder without even straining my arms, and I'm no muscleman.  It came on and stayed on the first try, so I guess I would call it 'easy' to install correctly.The flip side of that is that it is super flimsy.  It feels cheap.  The glass is so thin that at first I thought it was plastic; it's not, it's just thin glass.  I have it installed with a dimmer switch; I've owned other, better art glass - QVC, go figure - and that thick, heavy glass oozed saturated color as the light washed through it, casting a beautiful glow.  This fixture doesn't do that; it looks like plastic.  In addition, this particular style depends on straight, even lead-lines to make the rows and grid of the pattern.  To call this shade hand-made as another reviewer did is strictly charitable; it looks like it came out of the workshop of a retarded monkey.To add insult to this injury, the glass shade came coated in a really repulsive smelling oil.  A few scrubs with a dish sponge and lemon Joy in a sink, followed by drying with paper towels, took much of this off; not all of it, but enough to stop it spreading the smell through the whole room.The other lamp I was looking at cost five hundred and fifty dollars; it is a Restoration Hardware flushmount.  I figured this would be prettier and less expensive; now I regret the purchase because it looks like a twenty dollar plastic lamp.  And I wish I'd known that before I bought it; which is why I wrote this review for you.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H1BBSGJYY9K4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MRBILG#wasThisHelpful","R3H1BBSGJYY9K4","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I reviewed this lamp along with its partner, the 10W 36 degree 3000K ""Vivid"" indoor lamp.  Apart from slightly more robust heat sinks, the two lamps were pretty much indistinguishable.  I don't have a 12V rail outdoors so I pointed my hanging lamp fixture out the door to check out back-patio performance. Foliage and the lawn were rendered vividly and the light was very attractive on some Cornish hens that just came off the grill; the lighting was bright and vivid without being stark or washed out.I'm thinking about putting a 12V system in my back deck now to replace the current LED strand lighting I have on the pergola.

"This LED makes a nice replacement for halogen on your 12V rail system.  It says 3000K, but that is a color temperature associated with incandescent and fluorescent lamps; this lamp delivers a full spectrum that I felt was slightly colder than a usual halogen but still quite warm and very pleasing and easy to the eye - I preferred it to the halogen it replaced.

"I run a small business that has been growing exponentially since it was founded.  I'm the President, CEO and bookkeeper; and I use a very good accountant; but, in the last year I have felt that the numbers were 'getting away from me.'  I've never had any formal business training!People like me are really whom this book is for.  Of course it's for students taking a class - but the principles in it, of how to get a handle on numbers in a way that can be used to make decisions - are incredibly useful.  I am a leader - I know my goals - and I am a bookkeeper - I know how to make the numbers reconcile at the end of the month.  Everything that goes between those two roles is in this book.I enjoyed the humorous style as well.  It's hard to make a topic like this interesting but the author manages it.  I have this book on my desk and will be paging through it frequently in the next year, I think; and I 'd recommend it for others in my situation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5QAHOVPRK3K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118116429#wasThisHelpful","R5QAHOVPRK3K7","A6ZPLVAUQ6695","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6ZPLVAUQ6695?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We just got the diagnosis for our 3mo old that he has eczema...the splotchy, itchy, red and bumpy clumps all over his body and face that everyone (including a pediatrician) told us was ""normal baby acne.""The diagnosing doctor educated me about the importance of keeping the skin moisturized.  I used this cream along with a small dab of OTC 1% hydrocortizone cream immediately after the baby's bath (pat dry then apply hc cream then this cream all within 3 minutes, according to the National Eczema Foundation pamphlet from the dr's office).I did this and it made a HUGE difference in my baby's skin.  Being new to the eczema world, I didn't realize how his eczema affected so much else, like sleep!Usually, the baby wakes up early and as soon as he's unswaddled, he digs his sharp little nails into his face, body and scalp.The last couple of nights, we've been leaving him unswaddled and I was surprised that he slept from 8PM to 10AM (quick diaper changes and feedings within that time).  When I woke him up he did not dig into his scalp. I think having this thick cream on made a really big difference in moisturizing his poor skin.I'm positive the hydrocortizone took the redness and inflammation down but I also credit this cream for making his skin so much softer and taking away the peeling, dryness.Unlike another reviewer who complained about the smell, I don't think this cream has any smell at all.It goes on thick and greasy but the greasiness goes away.  I did not see any damage to the baby's clothes even tho I dressed him as soon as I lubed him up.The consistency also makes it easy for me to use it on his mostly bald head to control the dryness and cradle cap.This 1lb (16oz) tub is sold with or without the pump.  If it's your first order, I would highly recommend getting the pump because it makes it so much easier when dealing with a squirmy little baby.Lastly, for other newbie parents finding out about eczema, I was told to keep my son in light cotton long-sleeves and pants even during the summer to help control the flare-ups.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F97VLO4EIOD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NWGCZ2#wasThisHelpful","R2F97VLO4EIOD3","A1Y1L56592H2ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y1L56592H2ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know, you may be wondering what moron needs this, right?I take super hot showers and don't even realize they're hot.  I only know they're hot because I turn bright red afterwards and if my husband's jumping in after me, he screams.So before our baby was born 7 weeks ago, I ordered this to finish off my baby registry (no one bought it for us probably thinking this was a needless gadget.)But they were sooooo wrong!This is an awesome baby bathtime invention!!!  What I really love is that the whole gadget is automatic.  I don't have to turn anything on or off.  I don't have to push buttons or calibrate anything.  All you do is put it into the tub and listen for the beeps or read the temperature.HOW IT WORKS:It automatically turns on when it hits the water... and automatically turns off when you take it out of the water (GENIUS!!)It beeps the first time to let you know it's on.After that, it beeps if the water falls outside the range of 90-100 degrees.My only complaint is that it's slightly bigger than I thought.  I'm using it in the Fisher-Price Whale of a Playtub and it fits into the bottom bigger portion without any problems (even with the baby in the tub).Besides using it to fill the tub initially, I also use it when I'm getting ready to rinse off the baby.  I put it in the bigger part of the whale tub and before I pour the water on him, I know it's a perfect temp.  This set also includes a cute little cup that slowly sprinkles just the right amount of water to either rinse off baby or keep him warm during the bath.Even though the baby books and websites tell you to test the water temp on the inside of your arm, it's tough to know if it's too cold or too hot for baby.  The reason I like having the exact temp is because I figure baby is 98.6... so if I make the water close to that temp, I know it will be perfect.  The first time I bathed the baby, I didn't use this because I was already overwhelmed with the baby and I think he was cold.  But I now rely on this gadget and he's been a happy bather ever since.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD39T4KUCOQIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HIP38Y#wasThisHelpful","RD39T4KUCOQIM","A1Y1L56592H2ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y1L56592H2ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this set to finish off my baby registry thinking all the components will ""grow with baby.""Since my baby is only 7 weeks old, I've only actually used the finger tip brush.  I would give this a big thumbs down because it's sooo BIG.  I can barely fit it into my infant's mouth and as soon as I put just a portion in, he started screaming madly.  I'm not sure he wouldn't have screamed with anything else but this brush really isn't practical.  And by the way, I have a small hand/fingers and the brush barely fit over my pointing finger.  I know, I want a smaller brush but am complaining about it being too small right?  As a new mom, I would think they could make a smaller one for say the pinky finger... or have the brush part sort of strap onto the finger so you don't end up bulking up the finger.  Sort of like a finger-tip brush ring.While I haven't used the other brushes yet, I really do like the little stand that holds the brushes upright.  Overall, I think it's a good value but pass on it if you're specifically looking for something to use on a newborn/infant.Lastly, the pouch that comes with it is a super cheap plastic thing.  I almost accidentally threw it away because it was folded up in the back of the box.  Not sure why they even include it because it really wouldn't be useful for anything other than maybe packing away 1 brush ?","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQKZVA27UR4UE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019QJP0U#wasThisHelpful","RQKZVA27UR4UE","A1Y1L56592H2ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y1L56592H2ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I can taste the strawberry but the banana was nowhere to be found.I like that all the ingredients are understandable with apple juice being the first on the list.As for caffeine, an 8.4 oz can has slightly less than a Starbucks tall mocha (80 vs 95).If energy drinks are your thing, I would opt for this natural version...if you don't mind the slight off flavor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XO8RKGHUXE20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004K0630M#wasThisHelpful","R1XO8RKGHUXE20","A1Y1L56592H2ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y1L56592H2ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this for my Cameleon and like everything else in life, there are pros and cons.PROS:  fits the Bugaboo well. The velcro sides can be pulled very tightly but unfortunately, it's a little extra long so you have leftover. Not a big deal.  I like that the outer pocket (there are 3, 2 small and 1 medium) fits my iphone perfectly in the medium slot.  I also like the zipped center to carry a few granola bars on my walks.  It's also nice having a double drink slot...which btw, have a mesh bottom so if you spill, you won't get a yucky pool of liquid.CONS:  Ugh, wish it didn't have the brand name on the middle zippered pocket so prominently.  It also won't install in a way where the drink holder is level...so it's ideal for carrying only bottled items.  This means a travel coffee mug or Starbucks cup won't fit well:(  Even if it's only half full, you'll get spillage.  In fairness, the instructions say not to use it for any hot beverages.  Lastly, you won't be able to flip your handle over (so the stroller faces the other way) without having to redo the whole thing.Overall, it's a good buy and I would recommend it as one of the better options for the Bugaboo (unless you want to pay $25 just for the cupholder {eye roll}.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16S4VJR2TJQD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JQ4B3C#wasThisHelpful","R16S4VJR2TJQD5","A1Y1L56592H2ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y1L56592H2ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to try from the Amazon Vine program and thought it would be handy for small needs around the house.  But after trying it out, I have mixed feelings.First, the package states the fasteners will stick on plastic well.  But the drawback to this is that the sticky side is packaged on a plastic sheet, making it tough to peel off (sometimes, the gluey part of the back would not peel off smoothly).The dots are about the size of your thumbnail.  I tried to use it to fasten a baby toy to the car seat handle but that didn't work too well because the toy is a fabric.  So it won't work well on fabric.  But to be fair, the package doesn't claim to.I also used it to attach my garage door opener to a baby stroller handle.  The opener is plastic and the handle is aluminum and both stuck great.I do like that it peels off without leaving the glue behind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVI7Q0MT6KPD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M27EOW#wasThisHelpful","RVI7Q0MT6KPD3","A1Y1L56592H2ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y1L56592H2ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cream is amazing.  I wouldn't have believed it if it weren't for what my son & I just went through.My 5 week old infant developed a horrible red rash all over his face.  The rash oozed and started drying over in a thick, yellow crust. I'm not sure which was worse, the crustiness and redness all over his (mostly bald) head or his face and ears!  It was extremely distressing to see this.  The pediatrician said the red bumps were ""normal"" but it continued to spread and get worse day by day.  I bought this cream as a last ditch effort.The package does not make outlandish promises.  But what got my attention was a small phrase stating this was good for ezcema (I didn't even know what that was) and ""mystery rashes.""  I thought I had little to lose by trying it.I saw a difference within hours!!!  The cream seemed to have calmed the angry red rash on his face.Then I used it as part of a three-prong approach to his horrible cradle cap.First I used a gauze and baby oil to massage and rub the crusty bits on his scalp.  The baby must enjoy having his head massaged because he was content during this whole process.Then I washed his hair with Mustela Foam Shampoo for Newborns - 5.07 oz..  Then I brushed out any remaining flakes with a soft-bristled baby brush... finishing it up by applying this Calendula cream all over his head.RESULTS:For his face, I saw results within hours but within 24 hours was a remarkable healing!  I'm guessing he has ezcema and must be allergic to baby lotion (I had used Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion, 18-Fluid Ounces Bottles (Pack of 3) and Johnson's Head-to-toe Baby Lotion, 27-Ounce (Pack of 2)).  This cream got rid of the redness, crustiness, oozing and the bumps.  Now 48 hours later, his ears are almost back to normal and his cheeks are showing small bits of flaky dry skin...which I'm assuming is the dead skin peeling off for the renewed skin underneath.  I applied this cream with clean hands -- every time I nursed him.  I only used small amounts on which ever side was facing me.  It has a subtle spa-like scent and absorbs easily...not greasy at all.The results on his head are just as remarkable.  The crusty cradle cap is virtually all gone!!!! So are the tiny red bumps on his head.  Now, he has a bit flaking which I take to be a positive sign that the skin is healing.  I have never been so grateful for a product but after my experience, I'm a huge fan of the California Baby Calendula Cream.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYVYN65LD9FJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010Z4N8E#wasThisHelpful","RYVYN65LD9FJI","A1Y1L56592H2ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y1L56592H2ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without any baby experience, I stocked up on 3 different types of NB diapers.  A fourth type was given to us by the hospital.The Huggies Little Snugglers were the brand used by our hospital and we were given a package of 40 when we left the hospital.I had stocked up on Pampers Swaddlers, Pampers Dry Max and Seventh Generation.HUGGIES -- This was my favorite overall.  This one has a good cutout for the umbilical cord.  My husband & I also really like the stripe on the outside that changes color when the diaper is soiled.  As first-time parents we really liked having this because even though we change our baby at every 3-hour feedings, we like to change him in between if he needs it.  Since we don't really know what a soiled diaper should feel like, this little detail made it very easy for us.  The only caveat is that this is the only brand that would leave little ""crystal""-like substances in the diaper.  At first I was alarmed thinking these were from the baby's urine but after a quick google, it seems some diapers can create these.  Out of the 4 types we used, only the Huggies left this.  The Huggies also held in the poops well.  The size seems like it grows with the baby for the first month without any problems.Seventh Generation Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Diapers, Newborn (Up to 10 Lbs), 40 Count (Pack of 4)-- This was my 2nd favorite.  Again, there are pros and cons.  The pros, besides the fact they are chlorine-free, is they held in the watery poops well.  But I don't like that it's difficult to tell when the diaper has been peed in.  You can't feel wetness so you kind of have to look at the heaviness in the front.  This is a slight pain especially if you're a first timer and aren't sure what a wet diaper feels like.  I know this sounds stupid but if a newborn is only outputting one ounce and you want to change the diaper, it's tough to tell.  I do like the minor detail that it doesn't have silly characters or designs on the diaper.  This fit our long but lean son well for the first month.  This does not have an umbilical cord cutout but it didn't ride up high like the Pampers.Pampers Swaddlers Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max Diapers, Size N, 84 Count-- Despite the claim that it has an umbilical cord cutout, I couldn't tell.  I still had to sort of fold over the top so it wouldn't rub against it.  It has no wetness indicator as I guess like a previous version.  It did hold in the poops well.  My 3rd favorite.Pampers Baby Dry Pampers Baby Dry Diapers, Newborn, 124 Count-- I didn't like these at all.  The fit was much more snug even though my son is slim. This was also the only brand that leaked out poop.  When it didn't leak, you can see the yellow through the diaper.  This was also the ""stiffest"" diaper of all the ones we used.  This didn't have an umbilical cord cutout either.  I also didn't care for the Sesame Street characters on the diaper even though this obviously does not affect the performance of the diapers.For any other expecting first time parents, I had stocked up on NB size diapers (more than 400 when you son was born at 8lbs+.  We also went through multiple diapers at each diaper changing session because as we would go to close the diaper, the baby would either pee or poo so we would start all over again.  This would happen as many as 4 or 5 times.  Yes, that means going through 5 or 6 new diapers at one session because small amounts would soil the diaper.  If I had it to do again, I would order one case at a time since the Amazon Mom/Prime shipping gets the diapers to your door in 2 days.  You might also save money by buying a smaller package at a brick and mortar store as your baby grows out of a size instead of having a huge case of leftovers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO94TGJ5HJF0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002C74J7Y#wasThisHelpful","RO94TGJ5HJF0I","A1Y1L56592H2ZX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Y1L56592H2ZX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mark your calendar for 11 August for the release of Julia Heaberlin‚Äôs newest psychological suspense novel, Black-Eyed Susans, which is not to be missed.  Heaberlin has crafted a brilliantly executed psychological thriller that this reader was unable to set down.  When Tessa Cartwright was sixteen, she was found barely alive, being the only known survivor of a serial killer whose victims were dubbed the Black-Eyed Susans; it is Tessa‚Äôs testimony that places the serial killer on death row.  Two decades later Tessa discovers Black-Eyed Susans outside her bedroom window and fears the worst, is it possible she placed the wrong man is on death row and the serial killer is on the loose, who could be leaving her these clues and what do they mean, if anything.  Meanwhile forensics are still working on identifying the bones found with Tessa as lawyers work frantically to exonerate the man her testimony put on death row, hoping Tessa will be willing to undergo hypnosis in a desperate attempt to retrieve her lost memories.  A killer may or may not be on the loose, an innocent man may be facing the death penalty, Lydia her childhood friend disappeared without a trace, and the only known living witness has built a fortress of secrets to protect herself and her teenaged daughter.  Heaberlin is a gifted storyteller and has crafted a complex, multilayered story alternating between the past and present continually keeping the reader guessing and questioning what is real and what is imagined.  The characters are richly developed, the story lines are atmospheric and suspenseful, and Heaberlin leaves the reader questioning memory, truth, and closure.  I highly recommend The Back-Eyed Susans to all fans of psychological suspense thrillers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R107MX549XRCUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804177996#wasThisHelpful","R107MX549XRCUH","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Freedom‚Äôs Child by Jax Miller is a very difficult book to review without getting into too many spoilers. Miller has created a very multi-layered story with an exceptionally unique cast of characters, for better or worse, which make the story work.  Freedom Oliver is a very complex character, she is working at a biker bar, she is loud, brash, and usually drunk, she is also not really Freedom Oliver, she is in witness protection, and in her past she made a deal with the Feds, she put her two children up for adoption, and she was arrested for murdering her husband twenty years ago.  Freedom learns her daughter, whom was adopted years ago is missing and she chooses to leave witness protection to find her daughter.  As Freedom heads back to Kentucky her past begins to catch up with her.  Miller has created a very intense, fast-paced thriller, filled with complex and mainly unlikeable characters with very unique backstories which intertwine and somehow through Miller‚Äôs talented writing work.  Freedom‚Äôs Child is indeed a thriller, however, it is also about a woman haunted by a past she cannot forget and the desire to right many of the wrongs that have been done.  Miller‚Äôs writing is definitely distinctive and I would have rated the book higher had there not been so many scenes of intense violence.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R114UPF1HJNART/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804186804#wasThisHelpful","R114UPF1HJNART","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was rather excited to read The Fixer by Joseph Finder as I have heard rather good things about Finder‚Äôs suspense novels and it is a genre I immensely enjoy, unfortunately I did not enjoy this book as much as I had hoped, however, Finder has written numerous books and I will definitely give him another chance.  The Fixer centers around Rick Hoffman, a former investigative journalist who loses everything and moves into his father‚Äôs vacant home. Rick‚Äôs father, attorney Leonard Hoffman suffered a stroke almost two decades ago and has been in a nursing facility ever since.  Rick decides to renovate the neglected house with the help of his neighbor Jeff when he stumbles across over three million dollars hidden in the walls.  The money brings more problems into Rick‚Äôs life as his easy gain suddenly turns to paranoia, fear, and the need to figure out just who his father was prior to his stroke.  Finder has crafted some intriguing storylines, with Rick being a rather unlikeable man for the majority of the book and his father a rather intriguing man without the ability to speak, yet possibly not quite as helpless as one might think.  I found the father son dynamics to be of some interest, yet not enough to make me not want to set the book down now and again.  The Fixer is truly an interesting premise and it is quite possible the book would not unfold as well if Rick was not so obnoxious, the reader would be unable to see his transformation, and while I do not need to enjoy the protagonist to enjoy a well written book, I just did not care about Rick, yet I was fascinated by his father‚Äôs life, which is what kept me reading this book.  Overall, I would recommend The Fixer to fans of well-written mystery and suspense novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVTOTMDP1TV77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525954619#wasThisHelpful","RVTOTMDP1TV77","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"And Sometimes I Wonder About You by Walter Mosley is the fifth Leonid McGill novel in the series and one I was unable to put down, just as I was unable to put down his previous four books in the series.  Mosley‚Äôs characters are fully developed, multidimensional, and utterly fascinating, Leonid McGill is one of my all time favorite Private Investigators.  Leonid‚Äôs personal life is still in chaos, much as it was in the previous book, All I Did Was Shoot My Man, his father is still missing and his wife‚Äôs slow recovery in the sanitarium is making things rather difficult for him and Aura.  To further complicate matters Twill is busy working is own case helping Fortune and spending time with his girlfriend Liza.  When Leonid is approached by Hiram Stent to locate his cousin Celia, who is about to inherit millions, he decline the case that is until his office is broken into and Hiram is found dead.  McGill masterfully crafts a multi-storied PI mystery where Leonid finds himself in the seedy underbelly of Celia‚Äôs family, helping Twill, locating his father, attempting reconciliation with his wife and his girlfriend, and in his spare time, attending Gordo‚Äôs wedding.  While this brief synopsis may sound chaotic and like spoilers, Mosley‚Äôs gift of storytelling makes sense of what appears chaotic and thankfully his writing allows me to give this much information without spoilers.  Mosley‚Äôs writing is pure genius and reminds me of Mickey Spillane‚Äôs books, my first foray into PI stories.  I highly recommend this book and Mosley‚Äôs previous books in this series to anyone who enjoys exceedingly well written, multi-directional storylines with complex characters and the feel of ‚Äúold fashioned‚Äù PI stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QMMR404ATVVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539185#wasThisHelpful","R2QMMR404ATVVS","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Theft of Memory: Losing My Father One Day At A Time by Jonathan Kozol is an extraordinary memoir, heart-felt, intellectual, factual, and personal account of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  Kozol writes about his father, Dr. Harry L. Kozol, who helped establish the fields of forensic psychiatry and neuropsychiatry and was a well known neurologist and clinician. Dr. Kozol‚Äôs expertise led him to treat famous artists and intellectuals such as Eugene O'Neill as well as infamous criminals such as Albert DeSalvo, the Boston Strangler and Patty Hearst and finally to diagnosing himself with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  The Theft of Memory is a moving a loving tribute to the life of Kozol‚Äôs father, a detailed look into the decline of one‚Äôs life as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease takes over, and above all, the relationship between father and son and how the relationship shifts and changes throughout life.  Kozol has written a beautiful memoir of love and loss and I would not hesitate to recommend this book to all readers and discussion groups.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36S4ZWSU1LXUM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140979#wasThisHelpful","R36S4ZWSU1LXUM","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Life and Death of Sophie Stark by Anna North is one of the most thought-provoking and uniquely written novels I have read in recent memory, narrated by those who knew Sophie best.  Sophie‚Äôs career as a filmmaker is on a rapid slope upward, leaving her with little left for those that are close to her.  In her career‚Äôs rise to critical acclaim, she stops at nothing to feed her artistic creativity, which at times puts her at odds with those she loves.  While the true-to-life films that she creates reveal her passions and talent for filmmaking, Sophie learns, perhaps too late, that there is a price to pay for her obsession with her career.  This is my first experience reading North, and her writing in The Life and Death of Sophie Stark has left me wanting to read the other works by this talented author.

"The Ambassador‚Äôs Wife by Jennifer Steil is the story of Miranda, wife of a British Ambassador, who faces challenges beyond her worst nightmares when she is abducted by terrorists.  Her life in the Middle East, while enviable to many, had its drawbacks:  surrounded by staff and bodyguards wherever she ventured, her autonomy was sacrificed, challenging her very sense of being.  In a twist of irony, the life that she so longed to lead was swept away by kidnappers who would stop at nothing to fulfill their agenda.  Steil, through her carefully crafted and atmospheric writing, effortlessly draws readers into this suspenseful story about relationships and the ultimate challenges faced by one woman. Steil further solidifies her place in the genre with this thought provoking, high-tension, and, at times, heartrending novel.  The Ambassador‚Äôs Wife is an excellent choice for those who enjoy well written, thought provoking suspense novels and it would make an excellent book discussion group pick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MGHILP69DJQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385539029#wasThisHelpful","R3MGHILP69DJQ5","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lovers on All Saints‚Äô Day by Juan Gabriel V√°squez is a collection of seven short stories all of which take place in Europe, where the only connection between the stories is the emotional tone of deep longing.  As I have come to expect, V√°squez‚Äôs prose is beautiful, however this collection of stories is deep, intense, and dark.  The collection of stories are neither uplifting nor necessarily redemptive, however, they show humanity as it is, V√°squez does not hold back, and while the stories are short they are intense, emotionally packed, and convey the life of the characters in a rather short space of time.  Each story is brilliantly written, filled with love affairs, betrayals, revenge and troubled pasts.  Lovers on All Saints‚Äô Day is a beautiful collection of short stories, each of which is a small example of society, yet these stories are often intense and dark, V√°squez is able to show the reader a more keen understanding of the human experience and the complexities of relationships and love.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IOCQ295IJBJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594634262#wasThisHelpful","R1IOCQ295IJBJ9","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Due to be released 30 June 2015, The Mask by Taylor Stevens is the fifth book in her Vanessa Michael Munroe series and I think this may be my favorite of the series thus far.  As I have stated in my reviews of the previous four books, they can be read independently, however, I think the reader will be missing a lot of back story as the characters are quite complex and ever evolving and Vanessa Michael Monroe is truly a fascinating character with a rather unique past.  In The Mask readers will be happy to see Munroe reunited with Bradford and unlike previous novels, this one deals with industrial espionage.  Miles Bradford accepts a job as a security consultant in Japan and after what happened to Munroe in the previous novel, no spoilers for those who have not read The Catch, Munroe needs a well deserved rest, however when Bradford is arrested for murder, Monroe‚Äôs predator instincts and loyalties are tested as they have never been tested before; how far will Munroe go to save someone who by all appearances has betrayed her.  The Mask is extremely fast-paced, filled with multidimensional, complex characters, action packed, atmospheric, and the intertwining plot lines are written with an expert hand.  Stevens is indeed a master storyteller and for those who enjoy suspense thrillers, The Mask by Taylor Stevens is not to be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REPG1JN1WPD2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348967#wasThisHelpful","REPG1JN1WPD2G","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In a Dark, Dark Wood by Ruth Ware is a book I was expecting to devour in one sitting and rather found myself not enjoying the book, however it helped passed the time.  Ware is a lovely writer and her story sounded as though it had such potential for a suspenseful psychological thriller and yet I just did not feel that as I read the story.  On the upside it is a rather fast read, if one accepts the odd choices at face value and slogs on.  Leonora a.k.a. Lee a.k.a. Nora, depending on whom is speaking to her is a recluse and a crime writer.  Leonora prefers to not leave her home unless absolutely necessary, and yet decides to accept an invite from a friend she has not spoken to for over a decade to spend the weekend with Clare in a rather secluded house with along with Flo, Nora, Nina, and Tom.  Even when Leonora makes her way to glass house in the woods she wonders why she accepted the Hen party invite, especially considering she was not invited to the actual wedding, and yet she goes.  After much chatting or complaining, this is open to interpretation, I found the whole group rather annoying, forty-eight hour pass and Lenore (Lee? Nora?) wakes in a hospital bed only knowing that she is alive and someone is dead and she must tease out the answer.  In my opinion In a Dark, Dark, Wood held the promise of a superb psychological thriller, however I never found the story line plausible, by the end of the book I think many fans of suspense thrillers will neither be surprised by the ending nor pleased by the ending.  In a Dark, Dark Wood holds a lot of promise and simply because I did not get out of it what I had hoped does not mean others will not enjoy this book immensely, my best advise is to ignore the book synopsis and read other reviews before deciding if this is the book for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA9VWI5DD9B1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501112317#wasThisHelpful","RA9VWI5DD9B1D","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being of Czech decent, I was thrilled to be able to read Innocence; or Murder on Steep Street by Heda Margolius Kov√°ly a powerfully written novel, which nearly did not exist due to censorship.  Kov√°ly introduces the reader to the early days of Communist Czechoslovakia via life in Prague during the 1950s, a city filled with loyalist Party members, corruption, tyranny, and constant surveillance, for one could never know if a family member or a neighbor will turn them in, these are considered ‚Äúsmall terrors‚Äù.  Kov√°ly adds in a ‚Äúbig terror‚Äù with the case of a young boy murdered in a cinema and as the investigation unfolds, the lives of the female ushers come under intense scrutiny, each of whom harbors a secret of her own.  What one must remember throughout this fantastic book is that Kov√°ly is portraying history, life under a Communist regime, one must remember this is during the Cold War and written shortly after the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat, which put the communists (KSƒå) into complete power.  If one goes into this book expecting a simple murder mystery, one will most likely be disappointed, as Kov√°ly is providing the reader insight into what it was like for average citizens during this very oppressive time in history.  Communism happens to be my area of expertise and Kov√°ly does not disappoint, rather she managed to craft together an exceptional atmospheric work of historical fiction and I am very grateful the censors did not destroy this historical literary masterpiece.  I would recommend Innocence; or Murder on Steep Street to readers who enjoy historical fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HEI50DO9W2TY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616954965#wasThisHelpful","R2HEI50DO9W2TY","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Villa America by Liza Klaussmann is based on the actual home on the French Riviera used by Sara and Gerald Murphy as a refuge in the 1920s, the Murphy‚Äôs also happen to be the inspiration for Fitzgerald‚Äôs, Tender Is The Night, which is why I chose to read this book to begin with, I am quite a fan of Fitzgerald‚Äôs literary works.  Klaussmann has created a beautifully atmospheric novel set in the 1920s with a rather eclectic group of expats who appear to be carefree with their numerous parties and at least on the surface, their utterly carefree lifestyles.  However, underneath the opulence and apparent lack of concerns lies a group rife with secrets and flaws.  Villa America is a detailed exploration into the ‚Äúlost generation‚Äù and of the golden age of the 20s that was unable to last forever. Fortunately for the reader Klaussmann deftly portrays the lives of some very famous people, and for this reader, some of my favorite authors of the time period.  For readers not overly interested in the authors of this time period, this book may come off as more historical and slower paced.  I for one would have liked to have learned even more and felt the pacing of the story was quite masterfully done and well researched.  I would recommend Villa American to those who enjoy reading about ‚Äúthe lost generation‚Äù and the power couple who inspired authors and helped make the French Riviera the place for the rich and famous.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHS1Y7O77LUTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316211362#wasThisHelpful","RHS1Y7O77LUTM","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This may be the best book I have read thus far in 2015, and I have read some rather wonderful works of literature.  I Saw A Man by Owen Sheers is an expertly written work of literary fiction, and if that is not enough, Sheers expertly weaves together the stories and histories of two separate protagonists and the events, which bring them together in this absolutely brilliant book.  I happen to enjoy non-linear stories, for some it is a deal breaker, fair warning, Sheers‚Äô writing unfolds through going back and forth from one central tragic moment to slowly and deftly allowing the book unfold.  In I Saw A Man the readers meet Michael Turner who has recently relocated to London after the death of his wife Caroline, Michael soon becomes friendly with his neighbors Josh and Samantha Nelson and their two little girls, a family which on the surface reminds Michael of all he shall never have.  As Michael attempts to make sense of his wife‚Äôs death and put his life back together tragedy strikes, no spoilers here, which changes the lives of the central characters forever.  In one expertly crafted story, Sheers manages to reach down and tug the heartstrings of the reader drawing the reader deeper and deeper into the emotions of the story, many of which are rather unpleasant emotions, and yet so well written in such a beautiful prose, one cannot help but want to know what will happen next.  Personally I was unable to set this book down and I cannot imagine not recommending it to everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TMFPWF79Q6R4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385529074#wasThisHelpful","R3TMFPWF79Q6R4","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Typically I would not choose to read a coming of age story, however there are usually some exceptions to my genre preferences and Sara Noviƒá‚Äòs Girl at War is the exception.  Due to be released 12 May 2015, I highly recommend this book be added to readers‚Äô lists. Noviƒá‚Äôs writing is richly detailed, atmospheric, intense, and exceptionally beautiful, especially considering some of the subject matter.  The reader is taken to Zagreb in the summer of 1991 and in introduced to 10-year-old Ana Juric, her family, and her best friend Luka.  Soon civil war breaks out across Yugoslavia and Ana is not spared from bearing witness to unspeakable horrors and tragedies, finding the strength to do what it takes to survive and find her way to New York where she must try to adapt from a child who has witnessed far more that what most people could imagine to being a ‚Äútypical‚Äù American student.  Ana‚Äôs past is constantly with her, this is most evident when she speaks to her American friends, for whom she alters what she says about her childhood and her home.  Finally Ana makes the decision to return to Croatia to encounter her past in order for her to be able to move forward.  Girl At War is a book that is not to be missed; Noviƒá has captured the essence of a girl who came of age in the midst of a civil war, who survived, but at what cost to herself.  Highly charged and atmospheric, Noviƒá‚Äòs gentle yet beautiful prose captures the reader from the very beginning and does not let go.  I cannot praise this book highly enough and recommend it to all readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M5Y63NV3M308/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812996348#wasThisHelpful","R2M5Y63NV3M308","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rose Hotel: A Memoir of Secrets, Loss, and Love From Iran to America by Rahimeh Andalibian is an exceptionally beautiful memoir and which captures all of the minute details of life alongside the overpowering events and shows how family is shaped, the bonds forged out of pain, grief, struggles, and well as immense love and forgiveness.  In Andalibian‚Äôs memoir she tries to make sense of her father avenging a rape as well as dealing with her brother being accused of murder, and in her journey to make sense of these two brutal acts, Andalibian takes the reader back through her life which began in Mashhad, Iran, as she and her brothers spend their youth living in the Rose Hotel, then the revolution in 1979 which eventually forces the family to relocate to one-room flat in London, and eventually to California, where the family quickly learns one cannot out run one‚Äôs troubles.  The Rose Hotel is deeply atmospheric and the reader is transported into the life of this family and it is quite easy to become lost in Andalibian‚Äôs life and struggles.  I read the book in one siting and find myself now still reflecting on what I have read.  I would not hesitate to recommend The Rose Hotel to al readers who enjoy memoirs, literary fiction, and especially to book discussion groups.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31JK3MGBH5Z1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426214790#wasThisHelpful","R31JK3MGBH5Z1R","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I‚Äôd Walk With My Friends If I Could Find Them by Jesse Goolsby is literary work of astonishing depth and beauty, and yet one that is deeply heart-wrenchingly sad and at the same time hopeful.  The story surrounds the lives of three American soldiers, Wintric, Dax, and Torres, each of whom struggles in their own ways, and while each man‚Äôs story is told, the book focuses most on the struggles that occur after the men‚Äôs deployments in Afghanistan.  What I really enjoyed and some readers may not enjoy as much as I, is how Goolsby tells the three men‚Äôs stories in a non linear manner, I felt this brought the story to life and made the characters all the more realistic.  I‚Äôd Walk With My Friends If I Could Find Them reads a lot like a memoir and yet it is a work of gut-wrenching literary fiction.

"Ghost Fleet by P.W. Singer and August Cole is a detailed techno-thriller about an imaginary, yet plausible look into what a near future war would be from several perspectives, each which aid in not only developing a suspense filled plot, but also in enabling the reader insight into those involved or affected by such a global war.  In Ghost Fleet a new form of the cold war starts up but this time outer space and cyber space are also included alongside the more traditional land, sea, and air forms of fighting used in previous wars.  From advanced drone strikes, cyber-warfare, teenaged hackers, and the old naval warships named the ‚Äúghost fleet‚Äù, tensions run high as the United States is attacked by China, leaving the US to struggle to combine  ‚Äúlow tech‚Äù veteran insurgents with modern day and futuristic technologies on both sides of the war.  While I am not typically a fan of sci-fi novels, Ghost Fleet shows just how plausible and not too far off this sort of fighting could indeed be, which made this book more of an action packed thriller for me than a sci-fi thriller.  I personally look forward to reading more works by authors P.W. Singer and August Cole, both of whom are leading experts on cutting edge national security, a topic I do enjoy reading and as an added bonus their combined expertise makes Ghost Fleet read as though this scenario is far closer than one may imagine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9ZLC7O5P62L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544142845#wasThisHelpful","R1Z9ZLC7O5P62L","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not set to be release until 15 September 2015, Did you Ever Have A Family by Bill Clegg is definitely a book to add to any reading list.  Did You Ever Have A Family is a story about family, those we are born into and those we create, and the celebration of life and family while beginning with a tragedy.  Clegg‚Äôs fictional debut is expertly written, filled with depth of characters, deep and expansive emotions, and is told from various viewpoints which adds to the beautiful structure and depth of this book.  The night before June Reid‚Äôs daughter is to be married a horrific tragedy unfolds taking the lives of everyone in June‚Äôs family, except June.  While June‚Äôs small community in Connecticut attempts to come to terms with the devastating loss to their community, June begins her journey alone and directionless driving heartbroken across the country until she settles in at motel on the Pacific Ocean, where June falls into a state of mere existence, and yet the after affects of so many dead in such a horrific manner causes ripple effects which lead to secrets becoming unburied, truths being discovered, and slowly life returns as a wonderful and eclectic cast of characters find solace.  Did You Ever Have A Family is a beautiful story of family, love, hope, and a view of humanity at its finest.  I highly recommend Did You Ever Have A Family to anyone who enjoys well-written works of fiction and anyone in a book discussion group.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRLTB5E1IPAJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476798176#wasThisHelpful","RRLTB5E1IPAJ7","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Revenge of the Kremlin by G√©rard de Villiers is a tightly woven story of suspense and espionage surrounding the suspicious death of exiled oligarch Boris Berezovsky.  MI-5 opens the case after it is believed Berezovsky‚Äôs death was not a suicide, however no sooner does MI-5 begin poking around when PM Cameron shuts down the official investigation, an act which alarms the CIA, as the fear of old KGB tactics and the new and closer ties between Britain and Russia are formed.  The CIA sends Malko Linge to investigate not only Berezovsky‚Äôs death but also the alleged cover-up to his death and to search for any involvement the Kremlin may have had in the entire affair.  G√©rard de Villiers has crafted a taught and action packed book filled with espionage, distrust, assassins, government official and agencies including; Putin, PM Cameron, Mossad, the CIA, MI-5, and the American government, no one is free from scrutiny.  Revenge of the Kremlin immediately draws the reader into the ever evolving and twisting plot of murder, mystery, intrigue, agencies distrusting other agencies, countries distrusting each other, and loyalties being tested.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and admit I literally read it from cover to cover.

"Due to be released on 26 May, 2015, Secrets of the State by Matthew Palmer is an intense suspense thriller that will take the reader on a taut journey to the brink of war between India and Pakistan, this is a must read for all who enjoy suspense thrillers.  Sam Trainor was the top South Asia expert in the State Department‚Äôs Bureau of Intelligence & Research, but has decided to work outside the government for a Beltway Bandit consulting firm, twice the pay for the same work, at Argus Systems, which will allow him more freedom and he will still be proving key intel to the federal government.  It does not take Sam long to discover the vast differences in motivations between the public and private sector, and while trying to adjust he stumbles across intel that could not possibly be true, but could be catastrophic to the delicate balance between India and Pakistan.  The more Sam digs into the phony intel the more dangerous the situation becomes.  Palmer is quite gifted at crafting political suspense thrillers and Secrets of the State just well may be my favorite to date.  Secrets of the State is superbly written, the plot lines are well constructed and intertwine in unexpected ways, which keeps the reader eagerly turning the pages, his characters are well defined and the story is atmospheric enough for the reader to feel as though they are there with Sam.  Palmer‚Äôs knowledge of international relations and politics creates for a wonderful and realistic story as well as a taut suspenseful thriller and one I highly recommend to readers who enjoy this genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3COLPYGN7P92I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399165711#wasThisHelpful","R3COLPYGN7P92I","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Migratory Animals is a beautiful and profound debut by Mary Helen Specht whose own life may or may not be mirrored in the main character Flannery.  Flannery has been studying in Nigeria when she finds out her sister Molly has been diagnosed with Huntington's Disease, the same disease that killed their mother, and so she makes the difficult decision to leave the research she loves and her fianc√© and return to Austin, Texas, to help Molly.  Through beautiful prose Specht brings the readers into the lives of Flan and Molly and their close knit group of friends and the struggles and rather serious life changing decisions that must be made by these 30-something women.  While older than the women depicted in this group, I did not have difficulty identifying with each of them or their various problems, each trying to find their own footing in the world.  Migratory Animals is brilliantly told through shifting viewpoints allowing the reader to become fully immersed in the characters lives, so much so that when the book ended I still wanted to know more.  Migratory Animals is an exceptional debut about what one owes to not only oneself, but also one's family, of finding out where one belongs, were one calls home.  Migratory Animals would be an excellent book discussion group choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WPIAN4KCD15T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062346032#wasThisHelpful","R2WPIAN4KCD15T","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the Doves Disappeared is an exceptional work of literary and historical fiction by Finnish-Estonian author Sofi Oksanen.  While the book covers topics of tragedy, treachery, occupation, and resistance, it also offers up hope, love, and honor, all of which is covered in Oksanen‚Äôs beautiful prose.  On a personal level, I enjoyed this book not only for the well-crafted storylines, but also because Soviet foreign policy is my area of expertise.  The book takes place in communist controlled Estonia in 1941 and 1963.  In 1941 we meet Roland and Edgar, both fleeing the Red Army, and Roland goes into hiding while his cousin Edgar abandons his wife Juudit and becomes a loyal supporter of the Nazi regime.  Moving forward to 1963, Estonia is firmly under Soviet control and Edgar has shifted alliance to become a Soviet apparatchik, however will his secrets stay safe as long as Roland and Juudit do not uncover the truth?  While this may sound confusing, or at least crammed with information, it is best not to give to much away, I prefer books to unfold as the author intended and When the Doves Disappeared is definitely one where a little information is all that is needed.  Oksanen is a masterful storyteller and her deft writing and detailed historical accounts make this an excellent work of deception and heroism in the worst of circumstances.  The three main characters tie the storylines together and bring these crucial moments in Estonian history to light, through three completely different viewpoints, which intertwine deftly to show the humanistic viewpoints of the collaboration in Eastern Europe.  I would recommend When the Doves Disappeared to those who enjoy historical fiction and beautiful works of literature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24AVTYRZM75SU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385350171#wasThisHelpful","R24AVTYRZM75SU","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Due to be released 14 April 2015, Where They Found Her by Kimberly McCreight is a book to be added to the lists of readers who enjoy taught psychological suspense.  The story takes place in Ridgedale, New Jersey, where at the end of a long winter the body of an infant is discovered in the woods near the town‚Äôs prestigious college, and while the identity of the baby is unknown, there are a lot of opinions flying around.  McCreight tells her story through the eyes of freelance journalist Molly Anderson, who recently lost her own baby and is struggling with depression, Sandy who dropped out of high school and is searching for her missing mother, and Barbara the PTA president whose son is suddenly having difficulties, in addition we also have the psychiatric notes and a diary for additional information.  Molly unearths some of the town‚Äôs deepest and darkest secrets, some dating back two decades, and as Molly, Barbara, and Sandy continue to tell their stories the more the three lives become intertwined in this wonderfully executed tense psychological suspense novel.  Where They Found Her is well planned out, the storylines are probable and the numerous characters tend to hit all the major emotions for the reader from compassion to utter disdain and they mystery surrounding the infant is quite intriguing.

"A Dangerous Place by Jacqueline Winspear is the eleventh book in her Maisie Dobbs series, and also, in my opinion, the most different from the others.  Yes there is a mystery and plenty of historical fiction, however the reader learns more about Maisie and the inner turmoil she is going through in this book.  It has been four years since Maisie has left England and she longs to head back to India for solitude and healing peace when she is summoned back to England by her stepmother.  While Maisie is on a ship headed back to England and her aging father, she realizes she is not at all ready to return and ignoring all warnings disembarks early in Gibraltar.  Gibraltar in 1937 is filled with refugees escaping the Spanish Civil War and things are not just dangerous in Spain, as Maisie quickly discovers as she becomes apart of a murder investigation of Sebastian Babayoff, an investigation that catches the eye of the British Secret Service, all the while Maisie herself, much like Gibraltar, is at a dangerous crossroads.  Having enjoyed previous Maisie Dobbs books, I must say this one is my favorite.  I liked the deep political and historical details, the new characters, and the very serious decisions that weigh heavily on Maisie.  Winspear, in my opinion, has outdone herself with providing historical and political background, as well as creating an intense atmosphere, adding fabulous supporting cast members and reminding the readers just how far Maisie has come and what is has cost her to do so.  For those new to the series or long time fans, I highly recommend A Dangerous Place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z6NO0XPBEPYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062220551#wasThisHelpful","R1Z6NO0XPBEPYY","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Omron's Alvita Ultimate Pedometer (HJ-325), is small, lightweight, and fits into a protective holder to clip on, can be used with the optional strap, or can be slipped into a pocket or bag.  I have used Omron‚Äôs products in the past and the quality is what I expect from Omron.  Right out of the package it is extremely easy to set up, and then all that is left is to track one‚Äôs movements.  The Omron Alvita Ultimate Pedometer keeps track of steps every 12 hours and differentiates between walking steps and aerobic steps, a function I truly appreciate.  The device allows the user to press one button to display steps, aerobic steps, distance walked and calories burned.  As an added bonus this pedometer stores a week‚Äôs worth of data for a quick look to see how one progressed over the week.  The display monitor is quite easy to read, the instruction manual is short and to the point, and within 5 minutes of opening the box I was set.  I would highly recommend the Omron HJ325 Alvita Ultimate Pedometer for those who like to add cardio in during their day and also want to count their walking, as it truly does an excellent job at determining which is which.

However, Helen is faced with more than she originally bargains for, the first of which is her brother‚Äôs roommate, Jake, has also signed up for the survival course and begs a ride to Wyoming with Helen.  Center does a superb job and writing each of her characters, they are well thought out and quite easy to relate to.  In addition, having personally lived in Wyoming, I loved the descriptions and found them to be rather accurate and had little difficulty imaging the remote wilderness of the mountain range, and felt quite nostalgic; the mountains in Wyoming are indeed beautiful.  Center‚Äôs main plot for finding happiness again is a unique one and it works beautifully with the other characters in this well crafted story.  Happiness for beginners teaches some valuable lessons about happiness and just how happiness can be obtained, yet not in a self-help sort of manner, but rather through well developed characters and plot lines.  I would not hesitate to recommend Happiness for Beginners to anyone who enjoys well-written works of literary fiction and to book discussion groups.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM8TAVXOXKKA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250047307#wasThisHelpful","RM8TAVXOXKKA2","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I Go by Colleen Oakley is a deeply poignant debut which reminds readers that life is not only short, but precious, and we should let those around us know just how much they mean to us before it is too late.  Daisy is twenty-seven years old and approaching her three-year ‚ÄúCancerversary‚Äù when she is dealt with a devastating blow, her cancer has returned and has spread; she has approximately six months to live.  Whilst it is difficult to know what one would do if one was given a death sentence, I am not certain Daisy‚Äôs choice would be mine, then again, thankfully I am not in Daisy‚Äôs position.  Daisy has decided her husband cannot care for himself properly and she makes it her mission to find a suitable wife for Jack after she is gone.  Oakley has taken a very depressing topic and created an interesting, and yes, melancholy debut novel that easily kept this reader‚Äôs attention.  I found Daisy‚Äôs obsession with finding her husband a new wife deeply depressing, and while the book synopsis, in my opinion, gives way too much of the story away, I shall not.  Needless to say, things do not go as Jake or Daisy plan and Oakley deftly weaves together a beautiful, at times heart-wrenching tale of a family trying to come to terms with a terminal diagnosis.  Before I Go is a beautiful story and a perfect choice for book discussion groups as there is a wealth of information to be discussed and debated.  I highly recommend Before I Go to book discussion groups and those who enjoy works of literary fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QWNQYMAKH8D5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476761663#wasThisHelpful","R3QWNQYMAKH8D5","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Signature Kill by David Levien in the fourth in his Frank Behr series and the first I have read, but it will not be my last, as I plan start the series from the beginning, nothing is better than discovering a new masterful suspense/thriller author.  Frank Behr is down on his luck and close to broke, and is working a no-win missing persons case when a young women is discovered murdered and hideously arranged on a side street in Indianapolis.  Behr believes the two cases may be connected, however he has almost no friends left on the police force he was once apart of.  As the body count increases, it is clear there is a serial killer on the loose and Behr relentlessly pursues the cases, but this time his greatest strength could prove devastating.  Levien has crafted a powerful suspense thriller with a strong plot and unexpected twists and turns.  His main character is well drawn out and while I could not put the book down, I kept wishing I had read the previous books; I personally wanted more insight into Behr‚Äôs life.  Signature Kill definitely can be read as a standalone, I think the reader would benefit even more from reading the previous books, however Levien‚Äôs writing style and deeply suspenseful atmosphere with unexpected twists will keep readers new to his works riveted to the story.  I highly recommend Signature Kill to readers who enjoy exceptional suspense thrillers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WV5V911HAFBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385532555#wasThisHelpful","R2WV5V911HAFBU","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Compulsion by Allison Brennan is the second book in her Max Revere series and in my opinion even better than the first book, Notorious, which I enjoyed.  I typically shy away from romantic suspense novels as many tend to lean more toward the romance side, a genre I personally do not care for, however, I have not found this a problem in the Max Revere series, Brennan has a wonderful balance and creates an atmosphere of suspense that kept me fully engaged throughout the book.  Compulsion is centered on a missing persons case Max has been investigating which leads her to, Adam Bachman a psychopath who is on trial for five New York City Murders, however Max is convinced, there are more victims still unaccounted for.  Max is allowed a pre-trial interview with Bachman, which only makes her even more certain that Bachman, is responsible for a missing retired couple and he is not working alone.  Unfortunately, Max does not have any real evidence and the Distract Attorney wants nothing to do with Max‚Äôs theory, so in true Max form she intends to dissect Bachman‚Äôs past to find the truth, a path, which is far deadlier than Max can fathom, and one that could very well lead her straight to a meticulous sociopath.  Compulsion is a fast paced suspense thriller that will keep the reader guessing and turning the pages long into the night.  The characters are fairly well developed and hopefully will keep developing as the series progresses, and while Max rubbed me the wrong way in the first book, Notorious, I have come to appreciate this no nonsense lady in a way I did not think I would.  The plot lines twist and turn and intersect in delightfully unexpected ways, which helps to keep the suspense ratcheted up.  I will definitely be waiting for more books by Allison Brennan.  I would recommend Compulsion to anyone who enjoys romantic suspense and suspense novels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23SEQK6BARMF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250035023#wasThisHelpful","R23SEQK6BARMF1","A35YEXS1E1PYSN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YEXS1E1PYSN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an amazing product -very easy to use and once on, doesn't require a set time. I have a black leather Brookstone backpack that had a wear hole in the back and also part of the synthetic piping had worn through and the plastic was starting to stick out of the corner. I was able to take this circular patch, cut it to size (cuts easily), and use it to repair two areas.  I was a little skeptical that the corner repair would be next to impossible, but the adhesive is really strong, the patch is thin enough and matches the sheen on the leather so it's not as noticeable as I thought it might be, with the exception of the embossed pattern of course.  It does seem a little expensive, but it's really quite effective, and it's an instant fix, so is a good deal in the long run. If the company that makes these could make little dots or things for smaller holes, it would be nice to have more options, but I found a way around it, so no big deal.If it proves otherwise, I'll update.Am ordering the pirate patch, that one will be used just for decorating the same bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10OCHAGL9R1H2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009F7AMUC#wasThisHelpful","R10OCHAGL9R1H2","A3PKTO0UJJJ8BS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PKTO0UJJJ8BS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My 9 year old daughter loves to swim and takes swimming lessons too. She's just started to have the unenviable problem of swimmer's ear -hasn't gotten the actual infection, but water gets trapped in her ear canal and she can't seem to figure out how to get it out herself, no matter how many times she tries to shake her head to get the water out.I used ear drops, but it made her gag and really upset her to feel the drops going into her ear. This was the last resort. I bought these so she wouldn't have bright orange plugs in her ear and separated one plug in half for two milky white youth-sized plugs. Getting them on her ear wasn't so hard. I just took each half and balled it up a little bit, then I gently pushed it into a disc shape into her ear. Getting used to them took a minute, but after a swim lesson, she realized they're well worth it. I was getting a little nervous there for a minute, because I had just signed her up for a month's worth of summer swim lessons!!!Thanks to Mack's, she (and I) won't have to worry about the issue of swimmer's ear!!!

"This is a good drain opener. That said, it shouldn't cost the $115 + shipping as shown at time of review. This stuff costs about $12 or so in the hardware stores, so don't pay much more than that.I had the unfortunate experience of dealing with a clogged drain -the water wasn't backing up -yet- but I could smell the unmistakeable scent of dank water and knew one was gonna cause the washer pipe to overflow all over the garage. So I poured the recommended amount into the drain after removing the hose and waited 15 minutes. I also cleaned out the kitchen sink drain as well, since it's the same pipe system.First off, this stuff is thick and black and it stinks like you wouldn't believe, straight from the bottle. That's due to what it is- acid‚Ä¶when it comes in contact with bio-waste, the smell is even worse so I really recommend opening up every window in the house, or putting a box fan into the window blowing out and another window open to vent out the room/house. The garage wasn't so hard, but the kitchen‚Ä¶phew! Stinky-stinky!  It does say to make sure there's water in the pipes, but how besides running some water in there, I don't know so can't comment more on that. I used an old paint bucket on top of the kitchen drain and a take-out plastic cup on top of the washer drain to keep the fumes in -it won't help much, but it's recommended.As I was flushing out the drain in the garage, I started to feel a bit like I was gonna pass out, so I stopped for a minute and then came back.

"I used this on a pair of UGG Bailey bow boots that had salt damage on them. Some of the salt damaged areas were stiff and discolored. I used a toothbrush to gently scrub at them while flexing the wet suede in a cold bath of this wash for a few minutes, rinsed them, changed the water (I was using a 5 gallon bucket), and gave them another go, in case there was still salt in the water. Being that they are blue, some of the dye came off in the water.  That wasn't surprising to me, and it wasn't too bad. But they did come out nicely‚Ä¶they look (and smell) a lot better, too. I actually submerged the boots completely into the solution -some websites advise against doing that, but I did anyway, since the shearling needed refreshing too.  Remember to use an old piece of towel or washcloths in the toe of the boots when you're drying. It helps to retain the shape of the boots. I have a drying rack that allowed me to turn them upside down and let the water drip out of the boots. I dried them in the garage so the water could drip off of them and kept them out of the heat and sun, which won't be good for them. Take the toweling out of the boot toe after about a day and let that part air dry.My photos are before and after washing (if they're not on here, I'll post them soon).I also used this on a pair of Coach signature laceless sneakers. It worked on those as well. Again, I completely submerged them. I don't have photos for them, but the water was DIRTY after giving them a good dip, and they really cleaned up.It does say that ""rinsing is optional"" on the bottle. However, I partly rinsed the Ugg boots out so that there wasn't a lot of soap residue on the inside of the boots, since my daughter wears them barefoot. I like the lanolin smell of this stuff and it seems to condition the leather, so will definitely use it (and highly recommend it) for Ugg boot/shoe care.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26W4NT17XFWO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007CQ6UE#wasThisHelpful","R26W4NT17XFWO0","A3PKTO0UJJJ8BS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PKTO0UJJJ8BS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love this basket. Had a wicker basket that used to slip and point downwards, was flimsy and didn't last very long. Glad I found this replacement‚Ä¶it's cool-looking, sturdy and the hardware anchors it so it doesn't fall forward.

"My honest opinion: Was on the fence about returning these.First off, the pair I received is a watery Swiss blue. They're pretty in their own right, but they're NOT a medium blue by a long shot. Had they been the stormy London Blue, I would have been a lot more pleased with their appearance, because that's what's shown in the photo.Secondly, the box is OK, but the earrings are in plastic bags (one has ""Made in Thailand"" printed on it) in a blue satin bag and I honestly wasn't quite sure how to present them, as the box's interior doesn't have post holes and they'd just be rolling around in there. Others may not have an issue with it, but I found it fairly tacky, presentation-wise.I ended up using a completely new and generic jewelry gift box of my own and pairing these with a sterling necklace, and they looked great in it. I threw out the original box and kept the pouch to store a stray ring that I had.I was on the fence for a day or so as to whether I wanted to gift these.

"Wow this stuff is magic!I've used a lot of leather cleaner and lotion on my bags and this is probably one of the best I've tried.Used this on three purses and a pair of boots.The boots had spots on them and were dull and faded. The straight cleaner seemed to fade the stains to nearly gone and the moisturizer blended them in and added a lustrous glow.  After I buffed the leather, they had a nice, mellow shine.One purse had major body/hand oils on the handle, which turns out is not a good thing for leather. Using the straight cleaner lightened it up a shade and lightened some of the stains on the body of the purse a bit. The other purses weren't in bad shape, so I didn't use the cleaner on them, only the moisturizing lotion. They did benefit greatly from the lotion, and again, it gave them a nice, mellow sheen.Comes with an applicator pad (fabric and foam, like a car wax pad, but nicer).It's a good idea not to use too much of the conditioner‚Ä¶just as much as you need and then maybe 2-3 times a year, or as needed.The odor of the lotion is wonderful.

"...the heading (and quote from the movie) says it all.Bad acting.Unintentionally funny.Has a slight homosexual vibe to it that I wasn't banking on (not that there's anything wrong with that), due to the bizarre attention from Daniel-San's (many) male antagonists, who seem to have nothing else to do but completely fixate on him.  It's evil that's nearly orgasmic to the villains and cartoonish in its depiction, which makes this movie somewhat squirm-worthy to watch.The Karate Kid is easily pushing 30 and has gained a noticeable amount of weight since the first movies.  He pleads, whines, runs around in a tizzy, blows his top, apologizes frantically, or seems to be always in an otherwise loud and overacted state of heightened anxiety for much of the movie. I saw somewhere that Ralph Macchio didn't want any romantic scenes with his ""girlfriend"" so his wife didn't get jealous...maybe the tension caused him to nearly explode from the stress?Mr. Miyagi is the rock of the film, but is sort of a strange presence, glancing in a concerned way at Daniel and is antics, etc. In contrast to Daniel, he's Mr. Cool.Terry Silver, the ascot-wearing Steven Seagal ripoff, and billionaire predator, hisses with laughter and casts many an evil glance as his clever, diabolical scheme unfolds!The karate moves are geriatric in motion, scripted and stiff.A sad ending to the Karate Kid franchise, which seemed to get it right with the first two flicks.

"Wow, this is an awesome camera case. It's just what I was hoping I'd find and I did, with the help of a Canon message board.I have a Canon Powershot 16 and was looking for a case that would be low-profile, easy access and would safely house my camera. I searched online and at camera supply stores.The case has more than enough room for my camera, and the sides open to reveal pockets that are large enough for a small wallet, memory cards, and the battery charger that came with my camera.I love the opening to retrieve the camera. It's dual zippers, one on each side, and a quick tug on the nylon strap opens both sides at the same time for easy and quick access. Perfect for someone like me who wants to get that quick shot without a lot of fussing or pockets. I can whip out my camera in an instant if I need to.The tether strap (note that there's also a wrist strap too). I'm not too keen on it, because it screws in where the tripod mount is a weak point in the design -since the camera will get used and twisted/turned around a lot, it's more likely to unscrew itself.I bought the BlackRapid RPB-1BB Snapr 20 (Black) kit (overpriced for what it is, but necessary), but found that it didn't work with the G16 because my camera has a recessed strap attachment and had to return it.I decided to work the smallest of the strap attachments around the recessed strap hardware on my camera and it's now tethered to it securely.The tether is really short. It requires some pulling of the strap in order to get the camera towards your face, as shown in the picture. It takes some getting used to, but I would definitely recommend giving this a try. It doesn't even bother me any more after months of use.One other thing -I actually had my camera in this and my daughter got sick and barfed on me (yes, kids do that). It was all over the case and I was wondering if it was salvageable. I ran it through a front-loading washer twice and air dried it. Can't even tell/smell that anything happened.

"My advice: don't bother. I put this in and it doesn't do anything for algae. Over four days, one is supposed to put 1/4 of the additive in during the first four days, and the filter is only good for seven -basically after seven days this is supposed to be tossed out.  The additive didn't do anything, nor did the filter for the algae in my Biorb.I think that it's better off to spend your money on a regular filter.

"OK, let me say first off just how bummed out I am that these didn't fit. I have a green/black leopard print dress and a green/black witch hat with feathers that I was SO LOOKING FORWARD to pairing these shoes with.I received them today and took them out of the box. The jet black patent is shiny and looks to be much better quality than the price reflects. The style is AWESOME. Very cartoony, vampy and has sass with the shiny, evil sort of pointy toe, exaggerated heel and brass-tone web-patterned buckle. There's enough grip on the bottom of the sole that these wouldn't slip. I also like the heel because it's sturdy and allows for some stability instead of a pointy, thin heel.Anyhow, completely fine out of the box. Stunning and perfect.Alas -then I put my foot in (with a clean, thin footie sock or ""ped"") and my foot didn't fit!!! I wear a 10-10.5 (some shoes require an 11) and I had ordered a 12, figuring how small could it be. I'd say that the shoe that I received (and I did check to make sure that it was marked 12 and it was) was sized more like an 8 or even close to a 9!!! Just putting the shoe on to see if it fit made my two little toes practically scream with pain! They hurt a good 10 minutes after.The problem is the pointed toe. The point of the toe isn't designed past the point of the foot, like it should be so the sizing is from the very pointed tip to the heel and the whole balance of fit is off because of it.I've never had to buy a 12 and that size is usually a good 1"" larger than my foot!!!So I'm boxing up these awesome shoes and sending them back for inappropriate sizing. I'll have to find another option for my Halloween costume. Too bad!!!

"There's no doubt about it. Michael Jackson was one of the greatest (and most controversial) showmen on Earth.There WERE other videos that could have been on here, such as ""Leave Me Alone"" and ""Scream"" -two videos that I always found visually arresting (the songs weren't up to par with his other hits, but his music was hardly ever horrible).I won't list the songs, because you can see for yourself on the description what they are and it's redundant to do so.Of course, since most of these are back in the 70s/80s, MJ can be seen as ""altered"" slightly and then towards the end he's pretty much a unisex Peter Pan with a black fro-let. I admit that I had some difficulty staggering through my explanation of that to my 8 year old daughter, who likes Michael Jackson but doesn't understand why he ""changed"" so much.A few notables:""Thriller"". Back when this first came out, I was in Jr. High school and MTV was IT...of course, I had to get the DVD just to see Thriller on TV, even though I could watch it on YouTube on TV. It's better on DVD in my opinion. It's just an astonishing 13 minute mini-movie. I still can't believe the genius of it, even to this day.""Billie Jean"" -brilliant. Somewhat elegant in it's simplicity as a video.""Beat It"" -great song, dance moves and a great message.I love ""Black or White"" but the beginning of the video is just weird with Macaulay Culkin and his ""parents"". Seeing the neighborhood kids on a stoop with MJ wasn't exactly comfortable for me but I try to watch it without thinking of what MJ was accused of and what we all know from his trials. The rest of the video, especially with the morphing of the faces from one ethnicity/sex to the other is always visually arresting though and was flawlessly done.This is a good video investment and a nice selection for the cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BBGUK316Z71W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000TB014#wasThisHelpful","R1BBGUK316Z71W","A3PKTO0UJJJ8BS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PKTO0UJJJ8BS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bigger than I thought. The size is buried in the product details and the photos don't show much with anything to put it's size in perspective. I was surprised how big it was, and it's a decent size. It is also a substantial weight and well designed. I guess I was thinking it was just going to be a novelty burlap bag that looked cool with the graphics, but it's a lot more. It's a serious storage product. The burlap weight is heavy duty. The inside liner is thick and can be removed for washing, which is a good thing sometimes, like when you leave vegetables untouched too long and they go rotten. The cinch string closes securely. I'm hanging it off a hook instead of laying it on the floor of our pantry. I'm guessing a dozen or so onions would fit nicely.

"All the look, feel and performance of a precision designed, high quality product. It's hard to imagine any of these 3 tools could be made any better. The scissors close easy and smooth yet you can feel the blades just touching all the way up and down the length of the blades, making a nice, clean cut. The slightly curved scissor tips allow you to get into tight spots cut what you target. The nail file has a stiff blade with evenly dispersed metal ""sand"" with the perfect density of coarseness. Doesn't look like it will ever wear down. The tweezers are that rare find that seem to be able to grab even the smallest nub of hair and be able to firmly grip it as you pull it out. I don't know why it's included in what appears to be a nail grooming kit, but it's the one thing I needed most.The black case is thick enough to last forever and has a nice, smooth black low cut felt lining. The black crystal badge is nothing special, but if it's a gift, I guess adds to the effect. Is it worth the cost? Well, they definitely are the best tools you can find, and if there's someone on your list that already has everything, and you can afford it, it might be a nice addition to their collection.

"One of the key issues we've had with Lighting cables is the lack of protection where the wire meets the phone connector. Perhaps by Apple requirements, it seem like all Lighting cables have insufficient reinforcements at the point that takes all the moving force and, over time, the plastic sheathing wears through and exposes the metal wire. While these AmazonBasics still have less reinforcement that most non-Apple cables, it is still better than most. It looks to me like these wires will last longer than some others.The wire flexibility and length is good for our needs. My wife is the only one with an iPhone in our house. We have 3 Android phones that use regular USB cables. What she likes about the AmazonBasics cable is that it has their logo on the phone end, so she knows if she sees a white cable with the logo on it, among the several other non-Apple white USB cables bunched near the charging station, she knows it's hers.So far, so good.

Otherwise, I believe this is as good a product as exists for it's intended use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE9FB1V3H0RJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSX9IS8#wasThisHelpful","RE9FB1V3H0RJ0","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Professional weight, materials and construction. Built to last. Looks like something you'd find in a medical office. Super heavy base plate. Large area glass and excellent magnification strength. Even lighting with a nice range of brightness levels that make it useful as a desk lamp. Looks like B+D just puts their name on this product, but I can see why they'd want it in their line up for DIY repairers. The main issues dropping it to 4 stars have to do with range of motion. It does not swing towards and away from you (horizontal motion), and the vertical arc it travels from the base is limited. I wish it had more flexibility. In addition, while you will get used to using the on/off and light level mechanism, it's placement is easy to accidentally hit when you go to move the magnifier end.Overall, a solidly built light that could use a few more design improvements to make it a near perfect lighted magnifier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EBTXPOALOGQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW75FY#wasThisHelpful","R2EBTXPOALOGQM","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really soft, meaning the sides and back are not rigid, but that's ok with me. Makes them very comfortable. They are just a tiny bit larger than expected but that's ok for this time of year, meaning as fall approaches I will begin wearing socks, so the tiny bit of extra size will accommodate my socks better. If it's summer and/or you plan not to wear them with socks, it would be a very close call. Without socks they are a bit loose but they stay on my feet with no problem. I probably would not risk going a size smaller, but if you prefer them feeling more secure on your foot, you may go a half size smaller. Really close call.I owned a Fryre brand driving shoe before this and the construction held up well. These appear to have the same quality of construction, so I hope they hold up, as well. The design is a classic loafer/boat shoe. I could probably do without the specks in the rubber sole, but I guess they needed to make it look different somehow.

"The main thing I noticed is how light the razor is. I haven't owned one in a while but I recall them being heavier. Battery technology must have come a long way. The other thing I like is the design. Seems to be perfectly proportioned, balanced and curved. Blade strength and vibration is fast and strong. Seems solidly built. Battery lasts a long time. The trimmer is great for a lot of things.Electric shavers are best used everyday; they can't mow down a growth of several days very well. The closeness and smoothness of this razor is as good as any I have used in the past. I don't know if much more can be done with electric razor technology to make them any closer or smoother.

"Simple and effective. While it does seem somewhat ""cheap"" (lightweight plastic), it none the less performs as advertised. I like the uniform water coverage. The regular spray works fine for me, but the more intense mode is not as strong as some ""massager"" modes found on other shower heads. I assume it has something to do with lower water usage. I say assume because I found no print materials in the box I received, which isn't unusual for Vine (free to review) products. The Amazon product page title says it is water saving, but that's it (the seller should clarify the water usage specs on this product). Still, I'm satisfied. One option to direct more water on you is to turn the head 90 degrees so the water comes out more vertically over you.

"The main difference in this product versus before is the attachment clip. Otherwise, the fabric and quality of the elastic band itself is the same high quality product we are used to. The clip replaces the metal, sharp pointed clips known by generations of Ace bandage users. An advantage is there is only one clip. A disadvantage is there is only one clip, meaning if you lose it, you have nothing to hold the bandage together with, unlike the 2 metal clips, where if you lose one (and who hasn't?) you still have one to secure the bandage.The ""Ace Clip"" uses 1/3 of the width of this 4"" bandage. It seems disproportionately large and doesn't curve with the bandage, awkwardly sticking out a bit, possibly getting snagged on something. You sandwich the end piece of the bandage fabric between the clip ""tongue"" and the clip frame. Since the clip tongue is just a tad longer than the clip frame, it requires force to power the tongue (and fabric) past the frame and get ""stuck"" on the other side. It does hold securely, but it is really hard to hold the clip and get the leverage you need to perform this procedure, especially with one hand. So, if you are applying the bandage yourself, you're going to end trying to get the thing fastened using 2 hands, and end up wishing you had some easy to use, old fashioned metal clips.The other end of the Ace Clip, the end that gets stretched and placed in a position on top of the bandage fabric to hold the bandage tight, is made of a strip of velcro-style gripping material, and holds onto the fabric just fine. Now, I'm no engineer, but it seems to me a more user friendly, and just as workable, solution would have been to make both ends out of the familiar, easy to use velcro-style gripping material. The Ace Clip is not intuitive to understand, bulky, awkward, hard to apply with one hand (and not much easier with 2) and requires more force than some people are going to like. Seems like an over engineered solution, but if this is what they are going to make us use, I guess in a couple of generations we'll get used to it (or find a supplier of metal clips).","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG9LKEHSUO8R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLI9OD4#wasThisHelpful","RG9LKEHSUO8R5","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm impressed! I actually have a newly planted lawn growing (from seed) and there are weeds growing among the grass. I had tried selectively dabbing weed killer on them, but that takes forever and you can also kill surrounding grass. I tried this product on the weeds one day, and they next day you could clearly see the weeds wilting. The next day they were turning brown, and the surrounding grass is fine. This is especially good since the grass is still young and some ""grass friendly"" weed killers say not to apply to new grass.One ding I will give the product is its package.

"This is my first experience with home cinema and I'm glad I did it. I almost didn't go for this. I tried to cancel my request for this product, but they sent it anyway. Now, the reason I tried to cancel it is because, not having a home cinema before, or knowing anyone who did, after I clicked to order it, I started to realize I would need a bunch of other products to go with it in order for it work. I also wasn't sure how it connected to my AV system. After I got delivery of it, I then went and spent a couple of hundred dollars for a QualGear QG-PM-002-BLK Universal Projector Ceiling Mount, 50 foot KabelDirekt (40 feet) HDMI Cable and a VonHaus 100"" 16:9 Widescreen Manual Projection Screen.Setting it all up was time consuming but did not require any special skills. Hanging the manual pull down screen (I now wish I bought a motorized one) from my ceiling with hooks was easier for me because I have a wood ceiling. The ceiling mount wasn't too bad once you know which parts you need, and running the HDMI cable wasn't too hard either, especially using Command Round Cord Clips.Once I figured out how to set my AV receiver so that it used the Epson, and I figured out how to rotate the picture orientation on the Epson (because the unit hangs from the ceiling upside down), it worked pretty much right out of the box. I just had to make a few adjustments to center the picture, and there it was! I was thinking there would be no way a projected image was going to look better than on my plasma tv big screen, but I was really shocked to see just how good the screen projected image was. The screen area is probably 2.5 times bigger than my 50"" tv screen, and the level of detail, sharpness, and color accuracy is amazing. It is nearly as good as my plasma, but you'd have to consciously look for the difference (like looking at a pure white image section, you could make out some screen material graininess and wrinkles). I am really blown away by the image quality!The machine itself is pretty simple to use. There are not a lot of top level settings to go through, but you can dig deeper and find a lot of detailed settings if you really know your stuff. I found the remote to be pretty intuitive to use. The machine does have a fan, but it is fairly soft and easily overtaken by the sound system. It does take a few minutes to warm up. One thing I was concerned about but then pleasantly surprised by was that it uses 350 watts; my plasma tv uses 690! It also does not display the screen text from my AV receiver, so I cannot see things like sound volume level or effect settings (I'm not sure, but that may be a characteristic of my AV receiver). However, what I did was set my AV receiver to send the signal to both the plasma and Epson so I can turn on the plasma if I want to see the AV receiver settings. I also need to keep the plasma tv available for daytime viewing because the Epson is terrible in daylight. I also don't always want to watch such a huge image. I have this in my living room, viewing from about 12 to 14 feet, and it sometimes seems like I'm sitting in the front row at the movie theater. Still, for big budget action movies, connected to my 7.1 AV system, the experience is awesome! My only wish is that the machine casing was black, not white. It's too visible hanging from my ceiling.Again, I have never owned a home theater protection system before or have much to compare it to. Maybe other, lower priced projectors would have had the effect on me. All I know is the the specs on this machine seem to be way up there, and even though the price tag seems big, if you compare it to a high end TV, it's reasonable (but you'll still need the TV for daytime). My final conclusion is I am glad I took the plunge and got this thing. It's a whole new viewing and entertainment experience now in my home. I'm also looking forward to outdoor movie night come summer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGNI7C68XB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5HZYKI#wasThisHelpful","RGNI7C68XB","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My uses are mostly indoor and as a means to get better sound into my camcorder and movies on my DSLR camera. It provides a much better sound quality in my camcorder by replacing the camcorder's mic with my own setup. I can see this is built to be used on the move, as the only power is from the batteries. In my home use of it, I have not had any battery issues. I am using Amazon Basics 2000mAh rechargeables and they have lasted me quite well. Mounting the unit for use under a camera worked fine for me. I have used all the inputs and outputs a different times. It took me a little reading to figure out the various stereo/mono record modes, but once understood I know what to do. The mixer only has left/right and balance, no reverb. Having the preamp built in saves me from having to use the one I have and I absolutely love the fact it asks me first if I want to turn on the phantom power (I sometimes use a ribbon mic and it just scares me the possibility I forget or someone else turns it on). The Quick button makes access to often used features (gain, EQ, et al). The sound quality is great and I have not had any issues with unwanted outside noises creeping in. Kind of weird to see Tascam still uses the old USB connector size and not the near ubiquitous micro size. As a mobile unit, I can see where it might be worth the price. However, I also own a Tascam DP-008EX, which costs less and can also serve my purposes. But, it doesn't have a pre amp, it's a more complicated to figure out (it has more features and capabilities), and the way the DR-60DmkII mounts on a tripod is very convenient. The DR-60mkII is a simpler device. It's extra cost, I assume, is because of its mounting feature and a feature set dedicated to video camera work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7EMA7UMK4S3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIXFBL0#wasThisHelpful","R7EMA7UMK4S3Z","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you were going to drop almost $1,000 on a vacuum, this would be a pretty good choice. The German design and manufacture (yes, it's made in Germany) is top notch. Solid materials, heavy duty construction, built to last, for sure. Thought through pretty well.Pros:1) Really good materials. The metal tube is thick and heavy, but no so much it's hard to move around. Plastic parts are thick and substantial. You can tell it's going to last a few lifetimes2) Good sized buttons, knobs and grips. No skimping on the things you use all the time3) Very strong suction. You can feel it sucking down deep into the carpet. It has electronic buttons for multiple suction strength settings (which, to be honest, could be just as easily achieved manually. I owned an old Electrolux that had a sliding plastic ring on the suction tube that could let air in a varying number of holes to weaken the suction, but for this price point, Miele's going to turn that ability into a electronically controlled one, I guess). When set to high, it noticeably sucks up all fur stuck on a low pile rug. On the lowest setting, I can clean crumbs off a table cloth easily4) Nice attachment selection. There are 3 on board smaller attachments for crevice, dusting and hard surfaces. The Parquet Twister attachment sounds like just a fancy marketing term for a hard floor head attachment, but it does slide really smoothly, twists and turns nicely, and picks up a lot of fur in the brushes. It fits nicely under furniture, too. Well thought through. The only thing included that lives up to the ""Cat and Dog"" labeling (and this appears to be the only feature they, themselves, highlight as it having any special abilities to clean up after your dog and cat) is the Mini Turbo Brush attachment. I love these things for cleaning fur off of upholstery. I previously wrote about the usefulness of these types of tools (it's not unique to Miele) when I reviewed the $140 BISSELL CleanView Complete Pet Rewind. Of course, the $950 Miele version is far superior5) The main spinning brush head is big and effective. It has 1 foot operated up and down adjustments (keep pushing and the height level cycles through each position, up and down, endlessly) and 1 foot operated pedal the unlock the handle from standing up (and it stays upright pretty stable when you park it). One feature I discovered, that I have never seen before, is the brush automatically stops spinning if you accidentally suck up something that jams it (anyone remember belt driven models that would start to smoke?)6) Rolls over different floor levels easily7) Very quiet. The motor unit is nearly silent. Most of the noise comes from the suction heads8) Uses bags. One characteristic with bagless vacuums is they are VERY messy to clean and hard keep clean. They also spread dust back into the air when you empty them. Bags are way cleaner and easier to useCons:1) Price. I will say this, however: with Miele, what you are paying for is more the product quality and performance than a trendy name, like Dyson products, which are made in Asia. You can be assured that a German made product is made to last. In fact, their sales points say they are made to last 20 years (though, for some reason, the warranty only runs 1 year overall, and 7 and 10 years for certain parts)2) Some people say the flexible tubing is too short. I'm ok with it, but I can see how some might think so3) Uses bags. One thing I quickly noticed with a bagless vacuum (with a see-through canister) is just how quickly pet fur accumulates. Because of this, you can imagine you'll go through bags quicker. I am still on my first one, but I can see it is filling up quickly. I already bought Miele replacement bags, which (brace yourself) run almost $5 a piece! To be fair, these are really high quality bags, with extra filtration features, and you get 2 other filters used by the machine along with the bags. I bought the Miele brand first, but I have a feeling I'm going to switch to the much cheaper 3M Filtrete version, which don't have all the features of the Miele, but will do the trick.I did not touch on all the various filtration features this machine (and bag) has, which I'm sure works well, because that is not a major concern with our household. I'm sure other reviewers can provide insights.Overall, I am very pleased with the quality and performance of this product. I did, however, get it for free to review. You will have to consider if the price is worth it, but I can assure you that the quality and performance of this product will not disappoint.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32UHHIHQU8BO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R43I490#wasThisHelpful","R32UHHIHQU8BO0","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my first screen, so I can't compare it to anything else. Heavy, solid, appears well made, extremely well packaged. Screen hangs nicely, though it has a few waves in the middle that are hard to detect when in use. As far as the quality of the picture, to me it looks great, but, again, I have nothing to compare it to.The main complaints are going to be the smell, which takes a few days left open to get rid of, and the difficulty getting it to roll back up. The secret to getting it to roll is you have to lift up on it as it rebounds, so that there is no weight at all pulling down on the screen. You have to, in effect, ""push"" it back in. Of course, if it's hanging from the ceiling, like mine, the best way to do it is to get a chair or stool and as it starts to roll up, keep ""ahead"" of it by lifting it faster than it is rolling back in.

"Any time you can get a range extender with a pass though outlet, it's good, but this has a couple of caveats. One, it's a 3 pronged plug. You could use an adapter on your 2 prong outlet, but since this thing is 2"" from wall by itself, so you may end up sticking way out there.  Second, if you plug it in the bottom outlet the top of this thing doesn't cover any part of the top outlet, but it does encroach right up to it, so a big plug on the top outlet will probably get blocked out.I set it up as described, linking it directly to my main router. The WPS matching worked fine and the signal worked nicely. When you match up to your router, the wireless connection you see when you scan is the same name as the router. What I ended up do was placing it further away in my house, where the signal to my router was weak. The extender could connect to it, but it was still a weak signal. So, what I did was match the extender up with a repeater I use in the middle of the house. The repeater does a good job, but the signal where I placed this extender wasn't full strength. When I matched up the extender to the repeater, I got a very strong signal and now I can enjoy faster speeds through it.This extender also has a port for an ethernet connection, which also works fine. But, what I discovered was, this extender is not a powerline adapter. I happen to have my home connected using all TPLink brand powerline adapters, as well, and when I tried matching this extender up to the powerline adapter network, it wasn't possible. So if that is something you thought this could do, it can't.So, what this is is a pretty good wireless extender with the convenience of a pass through power outlet, but it is not powerline capable. I have tried many brands of wireless and powerline products and TPLink is the brand I have consolidated around.

"I guess you need direct current to get the ability to smoothly ramp up and down between low and high speeds, and be able to select any speed you want in between. It's a really neat ability and bound to be a welcome feature for those who like their fan speed ""just right."" In terms quietness, it's probably as quiet as a 7"" fan can get. I don't think it's possible to be really quiet with such small blades, but I don't think you can say this is a loud fan. it's probably about what you would expect. Air flow is pretty good, for its size.This fan can be set on a flat surface and they provide a metal mounting bracket for the wall. When folded ""closed,"" it is designed so that there is room for the air to get into the back of the fan, unobstructed. This allows it to be a floor fan, pointing straight up. The various positions the fan can ""unfold"" are in a 90 degree range. They securely click into one of 5 positions. You can move it with your hand; no buttons to push.In the previous version of my review, I wrote that I was disappointed the wall mount ability was designed so that the fan ""unfolded"" so that it pointed only downward in varying degrees, and I wanted to wall mount it so that it ""unfolded"" upward. Well, taking a closer look, I discovered that the base of the fan actually rotates 360 degrees, clicking in place at 12 evenly spaced stops, which, then, does allow me to use the wall mount and be able to position the fan pointing upwards. This ability is not mentioned in the instructions I got in the box. It also means you can point the fan left or right, or at a 45 degree angle, or just about anywhere you want.So, I can now see that between the fan angling ability and the sliding fan speed ability, this is a very flexible fan than can serve a lot of purposes and be able to direct air from, perhaps, odd locations.I only have 1 issue which may or may not be important to you. Since it uses an ac adapter plug, you have the adapter part at the end that plugs into the outlet. Some are designed to fit neatly into an strip outlet, with the adapter part extending away from the outlet strip. This one, however, is designed so that it covers an outlet or two next to the one you plug in. Hate that.I am sure I will give this fan a lot of use in the summer, in my office, and in the winter, in my house distributing heat. Seems pretty well made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UEK6H4YJUG53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQ1X830#wasThisHelpful","R2UEK6H4YJUG53","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tested this on my drums and compared it to a Shure SM57. It's not a direct match with the ATM650 because the ATM650 is hypercardioid and the SM57 is cardioid. When I tested recording sound walking 360 degrees around, the ATM650 is noticeably better at not picking up the sounds from the rear and sides. I tested recording with the mic over my drums and the differences there are also quite noticeable. The SM57 delivers a much more even and realistic sound. The ATM650 picks up the high end much stronger. The cymbals and snare seem much louder and in your face. I'm not saying this is bad. It may be a matter of preference.

But, the large and small forks are the same thickness. The fork tines are sharper than my last set, but not a problem. The width of the knife is a bit thinner than I'd like, but the serrated edge cuts better than most butter knifes. They are balanced and the thumb rests nicely on the handle. As a side note, the packaging or product gives no indication of where they were made.Overall, I like the set, especially since I got it on a deal of day sale, and it does match fairly close with my older, depleted set, I just wish they were heavier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23EQ2NCYSYSPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R58LSRY#wasThisHelpful","R23EQ2NCYSYSPV","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While we don't have a PlayStation, I thought these might be better for gaming. My son reports that the fit is tight and because the ear pads do not go around the ear, they press on the ear, it leaves his ears bashed down in his head after wearing them a while. But, the mic works good and the sound is decent. Not his favorites. He also has a pair of Sony MDR-7506s. I took some time to test and compare them. I used the audio tools on my desktop and 7.1 sound tests on YouTube to compare. The Sony's deliver much better top and middle sounds; sharp, crisp and clear. While the PlayStations sound muddled on the high end, definitely lacking crispness. The 7.1 tests I did delivered pretty much the same spatial effects replicating the 7.1 speaker sounds and positions. The Sonys feel lighter and are a true over ear design, not pressing on your ears. This also allows them to noticeably better keep outside sound out. The Sony cord is coiled and thicker while the PlayStation is thinner, straight and not as long. The Sonys also look and feel much higher quality. I definitely prefer the Sonys, and so does my son.  However, the Sony's cost twice as much as the PlayStations, but they also sound almost twice as good.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EG8NWP8QTGQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NE5D4SS#wasThisHelpful","R2EG8NWP8QTGQK","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 4th Grind-and-Brew model I have bought over the last 14 years. The last model was the sloped back front style Cuisinart DGB-550BK, bought close to 5 years ago. It didn't stop working, but after years of daily use it started to show its age, and I started hearing funny noises when grinding. This model has the exact same guts as the sloped back model. Same pot, too. While they still sell the Cuisinart DGB-550BK, I guess I was just looking for a change.I've been using it a while and I'm glad I switched to this style. One difference I have noticed is that it is quieter. The difference with this design versus the sloped back design is that there is a more room in the grinder department inside. This makes it quieter because the sound sort of ""gets trapped"" inside the larger compartment, making it sound muffled. Also, it seems to not grind as long. So, I am happy that it is less noisy and still brews the same great cup of coffee. I do not, however, think the design is nicer looking, but I will gladly accept that for less noise.I always thought the grind noise was too loud and long, and it might wake people up. I have my clock set to go off a bit earlier, so I always hear it. But, I had visitors recently who got up earlier than me and used the grinder, and I slept right through it. So, maybe the noise isn't an issue for some, anyway.In general I highly recommend the Grind-And-Brew line for nice, fresh coffee in the morning. If noise is an issue, this model is a bit quieter. Otherwise, the sloped back design works just as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH4ELLJJ71D43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G8Y2X6#wasThisHelpful","RH4ELLJJ71D43","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing you think when you see this thing is, Wow! Compared to the typical shower head products you find in stores, this thing is truly a FIXTURE. Heavy, solid, apparently really well built, and built to last, you have to approach it like you are building a new shower and this is the main thing everything is built around. In fact, it is probably best to wait until you remodel and have it custom installed professionally then. I didn't quite know what I was getting into. The instructions do not really make it clear, but I figured it; you still need to have an existing on/off mechanism. The bottom part that attaches to the wall is a dummy base; no water goes in there, only at the top and none of the Grohe valve positions are for on/off. You need a way to turn on/off the water. This means either the existing on/off valve needs to be used or you need to get some plumbing done to accommodate it. If you have one of this bath tubs where the shower is turned on from a lever on the bath tub faucet, that is best. My existing Moen on/off lever, however, was right in line with the what would be the middle of the Gohe fixture, and it isn't flat enough against the wall to fit behind it. Also, make sure you note the measurements of this thing and how much room it needs. It looks huge in my shower! Short story is, had to pay a plumber to move around some pipes to make it fit.Once installed, I am happy with it. The water flow is good and the spray options numerous enough. I'm not a big fan of the rainfall option, but my family likes it. Still, know what you are getting into first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R118U3F85L0DOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7RS0K8#wasThisHelpful","R118U3F85L0DOI","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter has Boo, so I thought this would be a nice companion gift. The construction, itself, is of typical Gund high quality. The main way Buddy is designed to be Boo's counter part is that Boo is all face and Buddy is all body. They sort of balance each other out. This makes Buddy, with a body of fluffy long fur and a bigger tail, a better plush toy for hugging.The only thing I knocked a star off for was the packaging. **The way I got it may be because of the Vine program.** I'm not sure. Maybe the manufacturer will clarify somewhere, but Buddy came in an Amazon box, wrapped in a suffocation warning-labeled plastic bag and nothing but a 2"" x 2.5"" tag attached to its ear. Not exactly excitement inducing packaging if given as a gift. If that's the way it is shipped to everyone, though, be prepared to re-wrap it if you want a better gift presentation.So, Buddy is nice as a companion gift for someone who already has a Boo. However, if you got Buddy for someone who doesn't have a Boo, you are probably setting yourself up for a future Boo purchase (marketing plan working!)","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UKTMQCQZQ0ZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTNVUJG#wasThisHelpful","R2UKTMQCQZQ0ZR","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife had been using a Magic Bullet NutriBullet (NB), but it had become unusable, so when this came up on the Vine program, it fit our needs perfectly. My review compares the 2 products.Pros:1) Smaller size, more powerful than NB. The power rating is a bit higher, but, to her, seems even higher. Since she tends to cut up a lot of different fruits and vegetables, this is a nice upgrade. Having the motor unit smaller helps, too, since we tend to keep it out on the counter top and it takes up less space than the NB2) The NB  did not have a handled, large size cutting container, which she says she will use primarily over the drinking glass size containers. The handled container has a nice rubber footing that helps keep it from moving. Overall, nice assortment of tools and containers3) Easier to clean than NB. One difference is that the Ninja containers are designed so that the rubber seal ring is on the outside of the lid versus on the inside for the NB. This makes it easier to remove so that all food particles can get cleaned out4)  In general, all of the components have a sturdier, more heavy duty feel to them. My wife says she was a bit scared sometimes using the NB, which seemed, to her, a bit more unstable. She has more confidence using the NinjaCons:1) No cover for the motor unit (the NB comes with one). While it may be hard to turn on with your hands, a cover helps keep the motor unit clean and looks better when sitting on the counter2) This design may have the same issue as the NB: on the motor units, you need to push down (or also up with the Ninja) with the mixing container in order to get the blades to turn. The NB requires the containers to be upside down over the motor unit, while the Ninja 2-in-1 works 2 ways, with the some mixing containers on top or bottom. With frequent use of the NB, one way or the other, food or liquid dripped onto the push buttons on the motor unit. With the NB, the pulverized food got stuck in the button cracks making it hard to clean. But the real problem was the food that got inside dried up and froze some of the buttons in place. My wife had to use a screw driver to un-stick them, and just before we got the Ninja, the NB unit pretty much froze in place, making it inoperable. My wife is concerned the same thing may happen with the Ninja, however, she plans on using the handled container most of the time and, since the motor unit goes on the top, there would be no opportunity for food to drip down onto it.Other than that, my wife would like the ability to have a button to turn the unit on rather than having it automatically start once it is in place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JNUOYOIICVMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGV40HO#wasThisHelpful","R3JNUOYOIICVMC","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product solves a big issue I have had. I was using a programmable thermostat for many years, however, one thing I hated was when the unit would turn on, when we were out of home, when I didn't want it to. I even left for vacation once forgetting to turn the unit off, and wasted electricity cooling the house with no one there. I really wished I had a way to turn it off, or on, remotely. Now I do. After set up, I tested the smartphone app and it works as advertised. I really like the ability to control my heat pump remotely.One big piece of advice for those setting this up: take a clear picture of your current wiring first. Even though I thought I was sure I had the wires identified and labeled correctly, I could not get the new controls to turn on the heat and I couldn't remember which wires went where on the old thermostat so I could check my work. This led to a lot of internet research to learn what the wire colors mean and how they are wired a little differently for some brands. I did call tech support, and I did get through to them quickly, and they were knowledgeable. Still I had to a lot of research and experimenting before I discovered one wire was either not previously connected, or it came loose when I removed the old thermostat from the wall. It took me a couple of hours before i got it all figured out and working.I do like the ability to keep the back light on. This provides a night light for my hallway. I wish it had cooler looking graphics, but for the price, it looks good. I also like the humidity gauge option.So, despite some issues with my particular situation with the wiring, it appears to work as advertised and solves one problem I have been looking foe a solution to.Update 12/26/14: I have been using this a while and I find it regulates better than my previous programmable thermostat. This one appears to detect temperature changes faster and my heat pump now turns on and off more often, whereas my previous thermostat tended to stay on constantly, seemingly never reaching my set temperature. I did notice that this one does not turn off very quickly when it reaches the set temperature. I didn't wait around to see how long it took; I simply set my intended target heat temperature one degree lower.One wish I have for the manufacturer: since this thing is online, I wish I could save data that I can later analyze. I think I could get a better idea of what temperature is ideal if I knew how often and long it is working each day. Maybe I'm a data junkie, but I really wish I could have the data to plot out and see if there is something I could be doing to be more efficient. At minimum, it's a shame to be wasting all the data it collects. If I had the option to send it to one of my cloud accounts, that would be great.Update 09/01/15: About 2 months ago, it malfunctioned. Over a course of several weeks I patiently tried every possible wire combination, researched everything I could online and spent hours on the phone with tech support before I gave up and called in an expert to evaluate it. Sure enough, they found one of the wire terminals stopped connecting for some reason. I was able to get it replaced easily and the replacement did, indeed, work. Their customer service is great for this product, but it took forever to eliminate all other possibilities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGNFM67H4DQON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHE60CE#wasThisHelpful","RGNFM67H4DQON","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Apparently, I got a bad copy and it did not work properly. I set it up according to the quick instructions and used the Genie app for any configurations. From the git-go, it had many issues. One computer is connected directly to the router while I use powerline adapters for 2 other computers. The same pattern occurred on all: it started out connecting to the internet at top speeds, but with each click of the mouse it progressively deteriorated in speed until unusable. Then I had to reset, re-pair and turn on/off one thing or the other, or all of them, then the same pattern would repeat. I was also never able to connect directly to the wi-fi channels, even though the signal strength indicators showed 5 bars. Somehow, though, I was able to get some connectivity, with the same speed deteriorating issues, when connected via my Amped signal extender.I tried my best to get it to work for 5 days. I called tech support, but they told me the product was already registered to someone else and they couldn't help me (my belief is the product they sent me was a returned product that they did not erase the original registration for). Tech support had no clue what the Vine program was and was completely at a loss what to tell me. After expressing considerable frustration, they provided me with the e-mail address for the development team (I believe). They were helpful but the only way they could help me was to have me go through a significant amount of manual tinkering, which I had no time to do. They also pointed me to some new software version they claimed would help, but by that time the router had completely stopped working and I couldn't even download it to try it. I couldn't take it anymore and removed their product and re-installed my previous router. Now, all is working again. They are sending me a pre-paid shipping label so they can examine the unit.I read another reviewer's bad review and they said it may have had something to do with the Dynamic QoS they were using. But when I checked the Advanced settings through the URL control panel (which you do not see via the Genie app I was using), I found the Dynamic QoS was not turned on (I tried it turned on and it didn't change the behavior). In general, though, I think this product may have been rushed to market. The software versions are still in the 1.0.0 level and it appears to me the development team is currently working a lot on this product.Other people appear to have had good experiences. My only advice if you buy this, make sure you install it on a slow week in case you run into trouble. Also, before you call tech support, register the product or they will refuse to help (protocol, you know).","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AWF14KWOUNZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRVJY5C#wasThisHelpful","R2AWF14KWOUNZF","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You need to understand this product's capabilities and limitations before you buy it, but it may be the perfect solution for your needs. I have had a lot of opportunity to review security cameras through the Vine program, but this one is different. For me, though, it fits a need I have perfectly.Before I begin, you must understand that when this product says ""wireless,"" it is not over your wireless network. The only way this product works wirelessly is between the cameras and the viewing device that comes with it. You cannot see it on your computer or smartphone.Pros:1) Works right out of the box. I was quite surprised to see a video image on the screen as soon as I plugged in the camera. I didn't have to do anything with the settings. It just worked2) Probably one of the better motion sensing software features I have seen yet. By default, it records any time it senses movement. I did not touch any settings and I found recordings that fairly accurately showed when cars and people entered the cameras' viewing area. Night viewing is a little more difficult; I found it came on when bugs or birds flew in front of the camera. You can test different camera sensitivity levels to improve that, but I don't think you can eliminate false starts completely. I have owned several security cameras and I always ended up turning the motion sensing feature off because either it was too sensitive or missed too much. So far, I am impressed with this one's accuracy3) Easy set up. I will not give it bad marks because it may take a few trial and errors before you figure everything out. There is not an overabundance of settings and the ones included are fairly intuitive or can eventually be figured out. Most of the other cameras I have tried said they were easy, but under a thin veneer of user friendliness was a dashboard of settings only a security professional could love, and understand. This one is not designed for professionals and the settings that are included are probably the only ones the average person needs4) Good wireless reach (for me). The directions prominently warn you that if you live in a brick walled house or there are steel structures around, the signal could be significantly shortened. My house is constructed of masonry blocks and steel beams, so I was expecting the worst. I am using this mainly from my office behind my garage. The furthest camera is about 60 feet and the closest is about 25 feet, but on the same side of the house my office is on (signal doesn't have to travel through the house, but it does through the garage). The signal strength, to my surprise, is strong. No problem getting images for me5) The ability to keep a separate video monitor running constantly. Unlike network cameras that require you to view through your computer monitor, the separate viewing monitor for this product can be set up on your desk and provide a quick and easy way to keep an eye on things6) Good night vision. I originally judged it to be poor or at least on par with other so-called night vision cameras, but over the last few nights of recordings, I have come to conclusion that this camera does provide a decent night vision view. You can make things out pretty good, in the entire field of view, which goes as far as day vision. Some cameras' night vision I have seen either have good vision only for 5' to 10' or only show the brightest objects, and ghostly, at that. This won't give you detail, but I am impressed with the overall night view qualityCons1) Poor battery life on the portable viewer. You basically need to keep it plugged in when you use it. When it is plugged in and being used, the most I have seen the battery bars go up to is 3 out of 4 bars. When unplugged and being used, after 4 hours the battery bars disappear (I haven't run it until it dies). This gives it little usefulness2) Poor audio. The sound only comes through when, on screen, you are viewing a single camera, and it's pretty poor. In addition to a tinny sounding speaker, there is a constant buzzing on the further camera3) Incident record time settings not flexible enough. When the cameras detect motion, they start recording from the first motion detection only for the amount of time you set. However, the only options are 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes. I wish they either included more minute options between 1 and 5, allowed a customized setting time, or recorded for all the time motion is detected. For example, 1 minute was too little to catch an entire package delivery between when the camera detects motion until they leave. Yes, it starts recording a new file again after the first time out because motion is still going on, but 35 seconds were lost in the transition. I'd like a 2 minute option, at least.4) Day image quality. It will do the job as far as monitoring what's going on and making out what you see, but it is not high definition (to be fair, they are not making any claims the image is high quality). When you view one camera taking up the full 7"" monitor screen, you can detect pixelation. Colors are decent, but the only camera controls available are for brightness. I have seen some cameras marketed as high definition provide much better day images, with better colors, but for the purpose of surveillance cameras, I think the quality this product provides is par for the course5) Be advised that the only place it records is on the monitor device, while it is on. I did not take stars off for this because that is how it was designed to work. But for those looking for a higher security application, this one does not record to a separate recorder locked away in another room, or to the cloud. Again, if that is your need, don't buy this6) Mounting bracket does not allow it to be hung from a ceiling or overhang. This seems odd since security cameras are often mounted from a ceilingThis product is not going to be right for someone who wants to monitor a home or business from a distant location on their phone or computer, so if that's what you need, don't get this one. But, if, like me, you've been looking for a basic solution that allows you to keep constant tabs on a couple of locations around your immediate vicinity, this product is perfect for that, and that is the context in which I rated it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q2DG4C95EJKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJF1UWK#wasThisHelpful","R3Q2DG4C95EJKM","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't so much a chair as it is a cushion holder. I was really hoping to be able to say it looks better in person than in the photo, but I can't. I believe the comfort of this chair is going to depend on your height. I'm 5' 6"" and, for me, the chair is not a good fit. I will say that the cushion itself is extremely soft and comfortable, but I don't think it works well as a chair.Pros:1) Very soft and comfortable cushion2) Easy to assemble3) High quality materialsCons:1) The proportions of chair do not look well designed. The back of the chair is unnecessarily tall and wide. You look at it and wonder why it flares out like it does: there's no rhyme or reason for it. I live in a mid-century modern home, where form follows function. The chair's over-sized back does not serve a function. I thought this would look good in my home, but it doesn't. Ikea makes better looking modern design chairs. This one does not look like it was designed by a high end design firm. Again, it looks like a cushion holder, related more to a futon couch frame than a piece of furniture2) It's too high off the ground. If you want a comfortable chair, you need to fall into it and be able to lean back. Again, this might be different for people of different height, but for me, sitting on it like you normally would a chair is not comfortable. My feet cannot lay flat on the ground, my legs are pinched inward between the 2 front arms, and I am sitting in an upright position. The only way to feel comfortable is to straddle your legs between one of the front arms and dangle your legs over. My kids are small enough for them to curl up inside it (my dog may end up getting this chair as his bed) and they like that waySolutions:At this point, I doubt I will leave it in my living room. It may end up in our bedroom (lots of cushion space to throw clothes over!). My daughter now takes the cushion off the chair and lays it on the floor, propped up against the couch. I think this is how it started out; as a big floor cushion. That may end up how we use it.Here is what I have done, or thought about doing, so far trying to make it useful:1) I reversed the cushion position. It is supposed to have the huge part on top and smaller part as the seat. However, by reversing it, to me, it is more comfortable. The back is lower and actually looks like a properly proportioned chair back. With the bottom longer, it supports my legs better and I feel like I am sunk back into it, in a laid back position. It is more comfortable, BUT, it doesn't look like a well designed chair this way, either2) I am thinking about cutting through the top, back cushion pockets that the rear arms slide into to let the cushion slide down lower, so the back doesn't look so freakishly large and it sits lower to the ground. However, I suspect this will not work. I may end up with my butt resting on the frame below it and the frame may not be able to stretch wide enough if I slide them down further3) When you think about, this chair is just an interpretation of a butterfly chair. I happened to have an old, folding butterfly chair in my closet, so I took the cover off of it and put it on the Puff chair. It fit and it looks good. The only problem is that my butt just touches the frame underneath. I'm trying to see if I can find a smaller butterfly chair cover that may lift me up a couple of inches. If I can find one that works, then I will keep the chair in my living room with a butterfly cover and use the cushion as a floor cushion. With a butterfly chair cover on it, It actually looks like a modern chair (it really does look good). I'm hoping to make that workAgain, everything I discovered may be a function of your body size. Taller or shorter people may not have the same issues with it as I do. I really wished I could say I like the chair, but it just doesn't work for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VUJAPP763K9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4S2A1O#wasThisHelpful","R2VUJAPP763K9D","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sometimes I like to just have a way to mark the places on the table when everyone is going to eat. These serve that purpose nicely. What they are not is an absorbent place mat, which is something people need sometimes. The material is heavy enough and woven in such a way that it has substance when placed on the table. It's flexible, lies flat and won't blow away easily. They are big enough to mark your ""spot"" and protect the table from possible scratches from plates and utensils. If you spill something on it, the liquid does soak through slowly, but the material and weave are such that a lot of liquid also remains on top, so if you were to spill something, at least not all of it soaks through.It's got a nice geometric, shiny pattern that can be reversed and look the same. Easy to clean off.

"This thing has become sort of a favorite around our house, I even use it on my old skin. It's a simple idea, a spinning brush, but it does the job. You can believe it cleans far more effectively than hand washing (10 times more, though?). The spinning brush on your face makes a pin-like feeling, I assume because of the ""sonic pulses."" Must be the effect of a micro jolt that makes fairly soft bristles feel like they are standing up, digging down a little bit into your skin to loosen up oil and dirt. There are 2 brushes: one regular, with all bristles the same, and the other has a strip in the middle with what I assume are stiffer bristles. To be honest, I don't notice much of a difference, though.The device has 3, 20 second cycles so you can focus on 3 zones on your face. I find this amount of time to be about right. One thing I was concerned about was if the brush would retain enough soap by the time I got to the 3rd zone. It does. The soapiness doesn't go away. I think the density of the brush head holds the soap effectively.The only knock I may mention is the fact it needs to be placed in a charging stand (though not often). I am concerned placing it anywhere near the sink, so I keep it in another location and charge it as needed, away from the sink.So, nice little tool to have. Quick, easy, makes you face feel clean. Everyone likes using it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9ELJS09T2Z5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVGET3C#wasThisHelpful","R9ELJS09T2Z5O","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good sized, stylish fryer. Electronic controls are accurate and easy to read. The top covers the entire machine, giving it a clean look, and the lid can be easily washed in the dishwasher. The cord is just a bit longer than other fryers I've had, and that is appreciated. I don't really get the ""dual zone"" feature; seems like a marketing stunt to me. I didn't see any difference in the frying performance. While the top does have a nice sized filter, steam still escaped from around the lid when you first put food in. The odor was controlled just fine, but I have had other fryers that performed as well.The main benefits I see from this product is the food capacity and heating strength. I was using a T-fal FR7008002, which I truly liked for the convenience of being able to simply filter and drain the oil into a self contained storage bin beneath the unit. However, this was accommodated by reducing the food capacity. While I do not like having to store a separate oil container, I think I like the DeLonghi's food capacity enough to put up with it. The other appreciated thing I noticed is that this machine recovered from a drop in temperature when first adding food a lot quicker than the T-fal. The only knock I can give it is that the top handle is so close to where the steam comes through the filter that you do feel the heat on your knuckles. The lid is also rather large, so you need to find a big spot to set it when you take food in and out.Overall, the food I cooked cooked faster and more evenly. I like the food capacity and the speed which it comes back up to temperature. It is a stylish design, but it may take up a bit more space. The odor control is on par with most other modern fryers and the electronic controls are clear and accurate. Most parts can be machine washed. A good choice for a fryer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMMRCADG095G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00489QJUE#wasThisHelpful","RMMRCADG095G","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice addition to my amateur video making efforts. I happen to have a large tile floor area to roll around on, and that adds the ability to make videos that have that flowing action to them you normally see from professional work. The product seems well constructed and the wheels are a nice quality. The tripod anchor points adjust to fit your tripod and the tripod feet locks work well. I like the locking wheel feature: it's a cool effect to lock one wheel and then you can pivot around your subject for a 180 degree continuous shot.Not great on bumpy surfaces and the wheel sound does get into your camera mic if you move fast or on a bumpy surface (not an issue if you are dubbing a separate audio track in). Having this low priced version makes me want to get a high end, expensive one, but really don't need to do that for my purposes. It's just fun to use for some pro effects that makes your video look more interesting. Even if you don't use it for flowing videos, the rolling base is useful just for moving your camera around to where you want it; you can lock all wheels to create a stationary base.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H8OUEERR3JYA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YB862E#wasThisHelpful","R3H8OUEERR3JYA","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using this mainly in my office, mostly for the charging stand feature. The plug can be configured to hold a USB or any Apple plug, so it is versatile. One little annoyance, though, is that the connector leans back too far and I have to wiggle and wedge the bottom of my SIII before it slides in, but otherwise, it holds the phone securely.The radio reception seems weak from the times I tried using it. The antenna doesn't help much. I think it's effectiveness is going to depend on your location. The box has all the usual radio features (no bass and treble, though), and it also functions as kind of an all-in-one device port via bluetooth, which is used for the telephone feature and music playing. The phone mic/speaker feature works fine; people said I sound clear. The music sounds pretty balanced for such a small speaker.The only other knock I have is that in the back, where you can wrap the power cord and phone connection cord, it is too close to where the phone charger cord comes out and if you have to use a long cord (they don't supply an Apple cord), it gets blocked.Overall, a nice little device to have as a do-all, little, versatile desktop audio workhorse.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REPHJ2DJ9WQ3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNO81WK#wasThisHelpful","REPHJ2DJ9WQ3L","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My kids got a kick out of the seemingly endless list of things it says it can do on the container, but it appears to be pretty much true. These towels are for when you need an extra agent to clean a tougher mess. I have been using them in my kitchen, mostly to clean our granite tops. The trick to these things working, and removing some pretty tough stains or dried on goop, is to give them some time. If you work over the area you want to clean long enough, the chemicals in the towels will eventually loosen up or remove pretty much everything they say they will. Just need to let the fluids soak in enough. I was surprised I was able to remove pen ink and even sharpie marks.The towel size is handy, but I could work with something smaller for my needs. The material is more plastic-like than soft cloth. It isn't designed so much to soak things up, but to deliver a cleaning agent. So, for example, they doesn't pick up crumbs very effectively. Still, as a way of cleaning off a build up of tough stuff on your counter top, they work very nicely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R365WPBSMYOJI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00022W4ZU#wasThisHelpful","R365WPBSMYOJI6","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My corgi sheds a lot. I try to wash him as often as possible, but often that may mean a month or more between washes. So when I had the chance to try this product, I was definitely interested. I've used it twice and I believe it makes a difference. I think it is getting more fur off him during the wash because I do not see as much loose fur coming off him afterwards. It definitely leaves a nice smell that does appear to last at least 2 weeks, like it says. His fur seems softer, too.So, if you have a dog that sheds heavily, and you're like me, you will want to try anything to get more fur off each time you wash. I believe this does help.

"This is the 4th Network AV receiver I've used the last 4 years. This is also the highest specs/most featured one. Previously I was using a Denon AVR-X100, before that an Onkyo TX-NR515 and before that a Harman Kardon AVR 2600.Pros:1) 7.2 ability - I believe my Harman Kardon had 7.1, but I didn't have the speakers for it. Now I do and I love 7.2 sound. My set up uses 2 high and wide speakers up front. For movies and shows created to use 7.1, the effect is epic. I wasn't sure if it would make a difference, but it did and it's nice to have. The "".2"" means you can add 2 subwoofers, which I'm beginning to really get curious about......2) Easy set up and network connectivity - This is something that has been improving with each new receiver. Lately it seems like I just have to connect to the network and everything just shows up. I think DNLA enabled devices are the easiest to use. It just seems like everything that can be used is easily found with no extra tinkering. Wireless and bluetooth work fine, too3) Good internet streaming source list - Good list and includes Slacker, my favorite. The Denon had the fewest choices4) Auto speaker set up software - This is something my last 2 receivers had and I really like it. You use an included microphone to get the best sound adjustments. This model of Onkyo uses their own version of software but it is unclear if it is a version of Audyessy. While I like it, read on in the Cons about it5) Lots of connectivity options - I think this is what you get the more you pay. This one has plenty of HDMI in and 2 out. I know my Denon did not have an input for our Wii, which used RCA connectors, but this one does.6) Zone 2 - This would be an important feature for me because I also have outdoor speakers I use as Zone 2, but I am now using my old Onkyo as a dedicated outdoor amp. This Onkyo has a powered Zone 2 feature (important if you don't have a separate outdoor amp). I haven't tried Zone 2 on this amp, but the previous Onkyo remote had a Zone 2 controls I never did get down. There does appear to be some changes to this Onkyo's remote, so maybe they made Zone controls easier (maybe other reviewers can touch on this)7) Good sound - I am not an audiophile, so I can't go into the technical aspects of this receiver. All I know is that the thing is powerful and it sounds great. It helps to have a bunch of good speakers, though. I think if you just need a really competent AV receiver, this level of specs/features has just about everything you need. They claim it is future proof because it supports 4K video, 21:9 display format, HDCP 2.2 and a bunch of other stuff I'm not really up on. But, I guess if I get them in the future, I'm ready8) Workable smartphone app - I actually prefer using it to the remote sometimes. It also impresses your friends at parties the first time they see you use it9) UPDATED 1/6/15 - Watched a few movies with Dolby Atmos and it sounds awesome!Cons:1) Auto sound settings software - In my review of the Denon, I praised the ability of the Audyssey MultiEQ XT. Onkyo has been a client of Audyessy for a while, but now they are using either a completely new software of their own or a modified version of an Audyessy product, AccuEQ (the fact they use ""EQ"" in the name hints it might be an Audyessy product). I do like the AccuEQ, but not nearly as much as the MultiEQ XT. It lacks the ""3D"" effect of sound seemingly coming out of nowhere, filling the entire space from all directions. I miss that. AccuEQ is good, especially handling 7.2 speakers, but it just doesn't have the same sonic effect on my ears. I will continue to tinker with it, but it is a let down (of course, if you never used Audyessy before, this will still seem like a big improvement) UPDATE - 1/6/15 - Dolby Atmos provides an awesome ""3D"" effect, but not all movies have Atmos, yet.2) Lack of ability to display anything but music from network sources - This is an odd inability. It took me forever to confirm it wasn't built to do it. My last 3 AV receivers could do it. I expect a network AV receiver to display images (though none display video from network sources, which also seems odd for an Audio Video receiver). To add to the confusion, when searching network sources, it lists audio, images and video categories, and search results will show (and take time to download in the list) image and video files, but if you click on one, it doesn't work. I really think this stinks, especially for the level of model it is. I can still get images, but not video, to display, but I have to go to a connected device (Roku, in my case) to do it. I really can't believe this inability from this receiver3) Poor user interface - This is really an industry wide issue. I have yet to see a truly easy to use and understand user interface. It's take a long time to figure out where everything is, how to get there, what it does and how to use it. In addition, there is inconsistency in the graphic design. Why can't any AV receiver manufacturer create a user interface that is easy to use and looks cool?4) An issue with the volume button - Perhaps it has something to do with the mix of components I'm using, but if I don't turn on the TV, DirecTV box and receiver in a certain order, the volume button doesn't work right. It ""flickers"" between mute and volume. I figured out that I need to turn on the receiver, then TV then DirecTV box in order for it to work. I can remember it, but it's hard for others in the house to do itBottom line is, if you are set to upgrade your system and spend some money on a good network AV receiver and want it to last a long time, being compatible with new technology as you add it in the future, this is a very good receiver to buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TOGZ2D122333/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQ0SE22#wasThisHelpful","R2TOGZ2D122333","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I don't necessarily need an audible beep, so, to me, this is not a big feature. This kit included 4 batteries, but they were 1400 mAh, which are relatively weak. I don't know if they were just being cheap about it, or they wanted to make the charger look faster when you charged these, but it would have been nice if they included some stronger batteries (standard Eneloops are 1800 mAh), especially at its price.I want to mention I was fooled at first by the lights.

"I have been using a Hoover Spin Sweep for years (on my second one) so when this came up, I thought it would be a good product to review. My review is going to mainly be as a comparison with the Hoover model.Karcher better than Hoover1) Cleaner pick up. The Karcher uses a single round broom in the back to scoop up debris and deposit it in the bin. It does a much better job of cleaning up what you roll over. The Hoover relies on the front 2 brushes to sweep debris into the bin and tends to leave a small line of debris from where the 2 brushes come together2) Better front spinning brushes. The secret of the Karcher front brushes is they are geared to spin slower than the Hoover's. This results in a gentler sweeping action that does not fling debris to the left and right like the Hoover does, especially the faster you walk. The bristles are softer and do a good job a simply moving debris under the sweeper to be swept up by the back brush3) Dust bin easier to empty. It just sits in place and you do not need to push a button to get it out or press down to click it back in place. The problem with the Hoover over the years is the bin lock can break because you are pushing down in the same spot to lock it back in placeHoover better than Karcher:1) Easier to push. The Karcher seems to have a lot of gears to turn and it is noticeably harder to push than the Hoover, which feels featherweight in comparison2) Better with large debris. The Karcher has a ""twig catcher"" in the form of plastic fins that are supposed to keep large objects out of the bin, but it tends to get clogged up. Since I have a lot of little twigs to sweep up, this has been something I have to avoid with the Karcher. The Hoover seems to be able to swallow everything.3) Brush bumpers. The Hoover has bumpers with wheels on the outer part of the machine that do an excellent job of guiding the sweeper around walls and corners so the brushes keep spinning. The Karcher's brushes are unprotected and you can easily jam them to a stop against walls4) Steering. The Hoover steers easily and goes in a straight line. The Karcher seems to have a mind of its own and you are constantly adjusting it to stay in a straight line5) Reach. The Hoover uses the front brushes in a single step to sweep debris up at the front of the sweeper, so you can usually get anything the brushes touch into the box, but the Karcher uses a 2 step approach and you have to travel the length of the sweeper before the debris get lifted into the bin. Imagine trying to clean up under a table. The Hoover would get everything as far as you can push, but the Karcher would need more room to travel to get the same debris.6) Containment. This is something perhaps particular to my situation. I have to move the sweeper up a step to cover the area I sweep. Picking the Hoover up with the handles angles the front up as I move it. It also angles the Karcher the same way. But when you tilt the Karcher backwards, some of the debris in the bin falls back out, onto the rear brush and gets stuck in there and ends up being redistributed all over the ground as you move it, You have do extra sweeping to get it all up. The Hoover bin stays contained and even helps, because as the bin gets almost full, it can start coming out the front. The Hoover has a bigger bin, too. Another annoying issue with the Karcher is if you roll it backwards, it actually can pull debris out if the bin is full enough for the back brush to catch it.At first I thought the Karcher was much worse than the Hoover, but as I used it more, I've come to realize it may be better for some jobs than others. It does a better job on driveway debris, for example. I really wanted to give it 3.5 stars.In the end, I would say use the Karcher if you have a lot of flat area with a lack of big twigs to pick up and you want a clean sweep (a garage floor would be good). But if you want an easier to push and guide sweeper that can pick up bigger and more debris, but not do it as cleanly, the Hoover might be better. I'm lucky to have both, so I can switch between the two depending on the job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK73UHP7BHVD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ORYO4W#wasThisHelpful","RK73UHP7BHVD7","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 7.1 system and have been using these as my front 2. I am really impressed with the bass response and the separation of highs, mids and lows (ok, I'm not an audiophile). This is the third set of speakers I've had in the front position. My original Klipsch Synergy B-20s did a fine job (they are now my ""height"" speakers in the 7.1 configuration), then my Polk TSx220Bs did a better job (though not a huge jump) and now the JBLs are doing the best job.The thing about the Klipschs and Polks was they didn't have the ""oomp"" for the bass I would have wanted (lack of rear port hole on the Polks might have been part of it). The JBLs do, but it doesn't compete with the mid and high range notes. The thing that really caught my ear was when I was listening to music using just stereo, i.e., the JBLs only, and I could have swore the sub woofer was on. It wasn't. The JBLs were producing a sub woofer effect all by themselves, yet it wasn't blending with the other sounds, muddling the sound. I couldn't believe it.I can clearly hear low, mids and highs. They do a confident job filling in the front position in a 7.1 configuration and perform even more admirably alone.The only negative I have is I am not wild about using a piano black finish because of the dust, but I'm not complaining.I wasn't sure I would hear a difference but I guess once you get up in price it does start making a difference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG15FS3ZBJRW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJXSWZW#wasThisHelpful","RG15FS3ZBJRW6","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've actually owned 2 of these before and they didn't last more than 2 seasons. Still, the idea of being able to get a wireless read of your pool temperature is enough of a benefit to make it worth trying.Pros:1) Temperature reading is the same as the liquid tube type thermometer I have in the pool. Not sure if either is absolutely accurate, but you get used to the relative readings to know how warm the water is2) Floats around harmlessly in the pool, rarely getting stuck in one spot3) Nice to be able to read the pool temperature from inside your houseCons:1) Stops working or loses signal occasionally. Sometimes it's just hidden from a direct line view. Other times I've had to open the floating part and check the batteries (which were fine, but started working afterwards). It sometimes loses signal but starts working again on its own. My experience has been this is the way it is2) Incredibly hard to open the floating part. It is necessarily a tight fit to create a waterproof seal, however, there is nothing to grip onto to turn it. You can hold the blue top ok (but it is wide), but the bottom is tapered and smooth and you need a significant amount of force to open the thing. I have had to resort to placing mine in a vice (gouging the bottom part) and using an oil filter clamp to turn it. Maybe it's just mine? Also, the direction the arrows indicate to turn are not clear and you could easily find yourself turning it the wrong wayI don't really care about the inside temperature readings or the 24 hour high or lows, so I haven't spent time testing if they are accurate.The bottom line is, there are not a lot of options to get a wireless pool temperature reading and having that ability is useful. So, it is worth a shot to get one of these and hope for the best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HL9DL5QCQ9TB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HTMSYZU#wasThisHelpful","R3HL9DL5QCQ9TB","A1LAGS8H4A2DR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LAGS8H4A2DR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have no idea why this book is so entrancing, but it is. Animals count juggling balls up to ten. The text is very simple, and is a great reader for kids in K and first grade. The pics are bright, with soft pastels complementing them. I like how the numbers are shown in blue circus type, and then highlighted in blue when presented in the small rhymes in their word form (e.g.""six""). I love the fact that on one page you can see a pic of a cat named ""Gi-Gi"" on a wall in a donkey's dwelling, and that Oliver the octopus wears a shirt proclaiming him as the world champion of juggling. All numbers are shown together on the last page. I loved this book when I was small, and read it to my kid constantly when she was small. She loved it. She is now twelve and knows how to count.

"A book that gets overlooked, despite the fact that Trina Schart Hyman illustrated it. Owen is some kind of Christian warrior. I am pretty sure that Hyman was a Jewish one. Tells the story of a grapefruit's journey, from infant to oldster. And, hey, once you're picked and sold, that's it, baby. Owen wrote this book so that kids would appreciate the wonder of nature and hard work, either seen from a follower of God's point of view, or a follower of Pan's if you skip page fifteen. So, yes- you will find the word ""God"" on that page, and her message at the end of the book clearly shows her devotion to God. Hyman illustrated it beautifully. I love her touches of detail that complement her homey visions of life. In the grocery store, she displayed many brand names of her own creation, including a cigarette ad! I get a kick out of that. (I am mentioning that fact for sensitive types.) She added a countryside train, which appeals to kids of either sex and all ages. Kids will enjoy the pics, but not the prose.

"I love trying new bizarre fabric softeners that my mom pays for. I was surprised to dicover that this stuff adds scent, but not softness. Fabric softener does eventually degrade fabric, so that is a plus if you do not want softness. It is very strong- so strong that it gave my daughter a rash and made the laundry room caustic with its astringent scent. It is the strongest scent I have ever experienced. I added some to a load of towels, and while they came out of the washer strongly scented, the scent had dissipated when the towels were removed form the dryer. For some reason, I can smell it on clothing...said air-dryed clothing did get a higher dose, but I do find it strange that the aforementioned towels had no scent whatsoever. No boost here.Update on 8/11/15: O.K., so I did other batch of towels with the same amount of ""Fireworks"", and this time they did smell good a few days later. (That whole ""fresh for weeks"" thing I will report on later.) However, I was picking up not only a hint of must, but also another scent that I can only describe as smelling of vomit. By total coincidence, I was reading reviews a few weeks ago on the ""new"" detergent, ""Persil"". Some people were reporting these same scents on their clothes after using Percil, so I am wondering if Fireworks contains some of the same ingredients as Percil, despite the fact that is not a detergent. The Fireworks bottle gives few clues; same for my quick Wikipedia search.

Taste was very subdued- more like vanilla with a hint of blue raspberry, and had a strange staleness to it. No idea how; I am just reporting my experience.

"Nothing like a simple, solid book that brings out the fanatics. Those type are my favorite! I mean the books. Kidding aside for a moment, it is shocking to me that anyone could have a beef with it. This book is a guide on how to handle death with honesty, gentleness, and learning that life is a cycle. My dog just died, and I read this book to my kid to let her know that she is not alone in her pain. It is everyday life with a cat funeral, cookies, bedside talks, gardening, and love. It's told in the first person from a young boy, and that combined with small details of a home make small listeners feel connected. Simple pen illustrations by Erik Blegvad add to the straighforwardness of this book. The afterlife conversation is quick and to the point, so I am not sure what the fuss is about. The dad in this book tells the neighbor kid, Annie, that we, as collective humans, are not sure if heaven exists after she refutes the fact that Barney is in the ground. Should he have lied in front of his son and agreed with her to placate her? Would the narrator have had a nervous breakdown, wondering how reality was bent so that Barney was not in the ground even though he witnessed the whole deal? We all know that burying the dead and the later decomposition is a proven process. Heaven, on the other hand, is not. Messin' around with untruths and kids is a future catastrophe played out in a comfy chair with this book on a coffee table in a therapist's office. This book deals with life and death. Why can't we?I hope the narrator invites Annie over to watch ""Pet Sematary"" while munching on pretzel sticks.Copyright 1971.*Includes statements and review title, more or less.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8GTOX6UEHGOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689712030#wasThisHelpful","R8GTOX6UEHGOZ","A2WS6FMF750EI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WS6FMF750EI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"O.K., sometimes I purchase items despite their cons- the great looking but brainless husband, the fluffy yet ugly towels on sale, and this book. I love the fact that the font is huge and that makes it easier for beginning readers and their moms who hate fetching their glasses, but the rest is passable. Nothing grabs you- neither text nor the illustrations. It is akin to a preteen's effort. Basically, some animals want to change their looks, and decide to travel to gain different colors to effect that change. They use natural color sources to do so. A colorful parrot helps them see the light with a few uninspired words, they clean up, and they go home. That's the plot. Dragged out and enlightened by a creature related to prehistoric lizards. Three-year-olds will love it, but anyone older will be bored. I can't figure out how this book became part of the ""Weekly Reader Children's Book Club"", a club from the late seventies that I could not get into, or why big font impresses me so much that I throw caution to the wind. I will try to air out the thrift shop mildew scent and then send it on a trip to find a different owner.

"I agree- what a sweet book. Encourages shy kids to reach out- or at least say ""Hello!"". Vanessa's mom tells her to take a risk and to try to make friends by just saying two syllables to her fellow critters.

"Despite a good amount of prior reviews, I figured I would chime in. While these readers are not ""Dick and Jane""- it's that famous repitition that made great readers - I liked the fact that my slow-to-blossom reader was not overwhelmed with many sentences/paragraphs on one page. This made her reading sessions more enjoyable. There are some odd words here and there, but not enough to give up. Let's face it- some words cannot be sounded out, but have to be memorized. Constant exposure to those difficult words will hopefully help, so constant reading is where it's at. The bright, cheery pics help, too. Affordable price doesn't hurt. I compared these readers to ""Bob Books"", and, as you can see, went with this set.Here are some extra tips:-Wait a long time if you have to for the kid to read a word. I learned this from a speech therapist with a Ph.D.-Use the strategies that teachers provide- ""chunking"", looking at pics, coming back later.-Some kids' brains do not ""awaken"" at the end of K like most kid's brains do. My kid woke up just now (end of first grade).-If you are worried, tell the teacher. My kid is still reversing some letters, and is using caps and lowercase letters in strange places, or together in one word (e.g.""aPpLe""). She is also still reading aloud ""no"" as ""on"". I plan on telling her second-grade teacher these facts, even though she was already tested for reading problems and found not to have any.(They did discover that she needed a speech therapist, so it can't hurt to request testing. Reversals can happen up to second grade, but after that it is something that should be looked into.)Examples from the books:Longer sentences: ""At the playground, I get around!"", ""I have a hat that is tall.""Obscure-to-kids words: Donuts, pasta, crawls, grilled, gull, acorn, half-circle.Words that can be figured out from pics: ribbon, stickers, scissors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T25GHK0F80SG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545231493#wasThisHelpful","R3T25GHK0F80SG","A2WS6FMF750EI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WS6FMF750EI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our vet gave us this clay ""disc"" with May's print already on it. To be frank, she had already passed on when they got the print, so I am guessing that the task was easy. Just keep that in mind. We followed the instructions exactly, and the clay baked perfectly. The instructions call for the clay disc to be baked for a certain amount of time if it is 3/8 of an inch, and ours was already that thickness. We do not have an oven thermometer, so we were not sure of the exact temp, but it turned out fine. Our oven is about two and a half years old, and we did it for the maximum twenty minutes. If your clay is thinner or thicker than 3/8 of an inch, then you might have to adjust baking time, so measuring it first is a good idea. You can decorate it beforehand or after baking. I loved the fact that a few of May's hairs were baked right into the clay. It just adds to the holiness of it and makes the memento that much sweeter. Plus, the set is put together by people with developmental issues, and that means a lot to me...my daughter is on the autistic spectrum.

I have fed stray cats for years, and this stuff has protected me so far from picking up any strange maladies from them. More importantly, my daughter's kidneys failed last spring.

I am terrible at explaining scents- I like it a lot, and while I am sure glass found on the beach is unscented, I do smell a tropical fruit combined with lily-of-the-valley. It smells great in the jar, is not overwhelming, but, oddly enough, when burnt it is not strong enough to conquer questionable air. Standard YCs usually do a good job at scenting rooms. This candle burns pretty quick. What concerns me the most is that burning- the wide, wooden wick crackled a lot at first, then dwindled its noise factor after more use, then transformed into a torch.

"Finally, a past affordable ""Jackson""- you had to be in a certain store at the right time to find him...before Xmas of 2014; ___mart. Shoes stay on, but come off with ease. Same for outfit. Has two cuffs- one will stay on as long as the hand does, the other can fall off easily. Do not remove clear band that keeps cuffs on, in that case. Has permanent eyebrow ring. Glasses are sturdy enough for older gals, but not for fourish ones. Yellow streak in hair; coifed very nicely. Bends at knee and elbow. Love the fact that he has never been to Malibu. Included matching bracelet for kid is a sweet touch. The included flyer with Frankie's (Frankenstein gal that he has a crush on) pic is very small and not durable at all- it is glossy paper.

"We take care of two stray cats and their cronies, so I depend on bleach to disinfect anything that comes in possible contact with said cats. The other day, a towel that my dog lays on got mixed in somehow with people towels, and this dog towel touched my face when I smelled it trying to figure out the problem (i.e.why a certain towel that seemed to smell funny was with other towels).  At that moment, with dog tush on my pores, I was glad bleach was on hand. Not to mention the human towels that have embraced certain tight spots on us humans. And, last but not least, we once had c. diff hangin' around, and bleach knocks it dead. So, I depend on it for other things as well. Spashless bleach sounds great, because if you are a doof like me, it is not flying around the laundry room bleaching your favorite shirt that is air-drying. However, splashless bleach is not dependable. Today, after I washed shoes that had been affected by dog poop, I finally decided to look at the label to read the directions. I saw in very, very, very, small writing: ""Does not sanitize or disinfect"". Imagine that horror. Imagine me horrifically imagining writing this review.

"This thing works great. While I am still getting over the demise of ""Plug-Ins"", I know that I have to move on. This was on sale, so we went for it. It is very easy to get the fragrance refill in. There are three settings for you to choose from, and even the lowest setting does a great job of giving off scent in any size room. Don't ask- for some reason, it does great no matter what the square footage is. So well that I have to unplug it sometimes so I do not get a headache. And that's on the lowest setting. Just getting that out there for sensitive people. Can even fit sideways electrical sockets with just a twist. I chose the ""Beach Walk"" scent with my set (in a mall), and I discovered that I am not crazy about that scent.

"I got a set of this stuff for my older daughter years ago, and she never wanted to use it. So, I saved it for my younger daughter, who is newly seven. Well, the older kid freaked and would not let us use it; insisting that she would use it. Mind you, it sat in a closet for a few years. So, I went ahead and got this set. A bit pricey for what you get and for the time it takes to make these creations, but I wanted my younger daughter to be happy. Once you engage the use of the ""Whipple"", you have to use it right away, so the fun lasts for about half an hour. Basically, you are piping false frosting. Instructions are included on how to make different ""shapes"", but I just let my kid have fun. I do wish it came with a bit more bling, but you do get the cool leaf and cherry beads. I would have also loved to see at least two smaller bags of different colored frosting for variety. You can also add your own beads and bling, as we did. Do not get wet. Comes with three chains to make keychains. Depending on how you make them, some will be more delicate. Donuts are soft plastic. Biggest one is two inches across. Set includes: the chains, three donuts, three cookies, pink frosting, thirteen rhinestones, twelve beads, four pearls, and instructions.

You get a good amount of everything to make stuff- beads, barrettes, hoops, adhesive dots, elastic string which I think we had trouble tying, and eight pencils in bright colors.

"So my eleven-year-old wanted the ""Bedhead"" brand of wavers. Problem is, the price for that one is high and my kid is young with small hands. Heck, my hands are small. I knew I would be the one doing the grunt work anyway, so I decided to get this Conair mini waver. So glad I did! The price is right, and it is the perfect size for hobbits. I read the reviews on this critter a few times before purchase, and decided that people will never agree on waving vs. crimping. Crimping is very tight and geometrical- check out the pic at ""Wikipedia""- while waves are loose and curl-like. Like, well, waves. The tools are entirely different as well- a crimper has triangular plates, while a waver has curved plates. Whether or not you want to say if certain waves are beachy or not is up to you...I think it depends on the humidity and a person's hair. I have had minor waves and major waves after beach trips of about the same length, so it can definitely vary. I did my younger daughter's fine hair, and my own tougher hair, and ended up with the same results. Waves do not depend on a time factor- less or more heat time gives the same results as well. For some reason, my waves were gone in the morning, while my kid's were still present. Waves even lasted a week on my older daughter's locks. Anyway, anyone younger than thirteen will probably get burnt using this waver. Gets hot quick and stays hot. Does not turn off by itself. Has cord and on/off switch. If pics do not help, let me know. Can redo. What you see is what you get. Go get pretty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36N5GL59UINJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UKT228#wasThisHelpful","R36N5GL59UINJ0","A2WS6FMF750EI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WS6FMF750EI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughter acquired c. diff last spring of 2014, and our doc told us to get probiotics. The brand she suggested was not at ""Whole Foods""; this brand was suggested by an employee. Fantastic. Knocked c. diff out within one month. Once a day, I open the capsule and dump it in a beverage. I have added it to milk, juice, and root beer. I investigated if carbonation affects the probiotic; we also got a brand recently that stated on the label not to add (the) probiotic to acidic stuff, but I have added it to both types of these bevs, and like I said- the c. diff is gone (still not sure about the carbonation thing; we had to get a different brand due to unavailability of above probiotic once). Has to be kept cold. Can travel for six hours in cool car on ice until you get to fridge, but that's it. Can be frozen. Still taking it for general health support. This stuff changed our life. Get it.Extra stuff:-Take after a meal.-Do not take two different probiotics at the same time.-If you miss a few days, it is O.K.-If you have to switch over to a different probiotic, that is O.K. to do.Update on 8/28/15: Hi! I contacted Udo's and asked them two things:1.""Can you take a probiotic every other day?""2.""Do acidic and carbonated beverages affect the probiotic's potency when the probiotic is added to these beverages?"".The answers:1. According to Udo's, no. They suggest you to take it even three times a day! There was a lot of talk about probiotics in general that I did not understand. I am going to ask my pediatrician so I can try to save money. If you want more details, just ask me.2. No. Feel free to add the probiotic to these drinks.Updated Answer to Question 1: Yes.

"Gorgeous, huh? This is the one that my daughter craved, so we fulfilled her wishes, not ours. I not only write reviews, I read 'em. I told my kid that this bag is beautiful, but not durable. Several college gals stated this in reviews, and when you investigate used ones, they are always worn in some, same way (bottom wear, stains, jacked handle) which makes purchasing a generally used one undesirable. Ones barely used but in excellent condition are priced far too high by greedy sellers. Onwards- lo and behold my daughter had to bring home a huge book- two pounds, 2"" thick, 8.25"" wide, and 10.25"" in length. Could she carry it in this bag? No. Did I assess the situation in order to see if said book could go into bag and decide that it could? No. No kidding- I was scared to put this book into the bag. I felt that the book would weaken the bag and hasten its throes. I am even afraid to put it on the floor, so it has its own chair. My kid carries very light stuff in this bag right now, but I will update this review if that ever changes...if her teachers hand out hardbound text books suddenly. I will say that it has a lot of mostly great pockets and comfy straps. I also want to say that I will get a used but hopefully intact and non-pricey one for myself because I cannot find an adult packpack that does not scream ""sporty"" or ""juvenile"". I just cannot scream, ""Wow!"".Pros:-Easy on the eyes.-Prints appeal to adults.-Tough, smooth-moving zippers.-Comfy, adjustable straps.-Back padded laptop pocket with special protection pad held in place with Velcro, general middle pocket, small front pocket with storage compartments (zip pocket, 2 ID/card pockets, 4 pencil pockets, non-zip pocket).-Washable.Cons:-External, side waterbottle pockets are too narrow (standard bottles cannot fit).-Not rain proof. (Does have an inner liner, but not sure if it is functional. It is very light. Will update this review if it performs wonderfully.)-Not stain proof.-Cannot hold heavy stuff.-Not durable.(i.e.All above cons equal one unrealistic, unusuable bag for everyday use.)Update on 8/27/15: My daughter's backpack is lookin' great. However, she has even more to carry this year. Getting it all to school was a hassle, as getting even one three-ring binder (not sure if it was 1"" or 1.5""; it was borrowed) was tough. There was only new folders, a few standard spirals, a pencil case/bag, and a softbound, thick book alraedy in her bag when I had to place the binder in. Other binders she had to carry by hand one day, with her pencil bag to boot.

"I've been lifting for years, but due to my frame (long, small frame upper body & long, medium frame lower) I've never been able to do one bodyweight pull-up or chin-up. I've done countless lat pulldowns, and used a stool to perform modified pull-ups and chin-ups, as well as the assisted chin-up machine at the gym. I recently discovered many women were using the bands to help them build up strength more rapidly. I can already tell that this should help me work up to bodyweight pull-ups because even with the band, they're very challenging compared to the machine at the gym and modification with a stool/chair. Looking forward to building some muscle on my upper body. I bought the green band since it had the widest range. Once I get my reps up to 15-20, I plan to attempt a bodyweight pull-up. If I can't achieve that at that point, I will order a band with a lower range to further help me toward my goal.

"Recently I got fed up with the feeling that I constantly needed to use chapstick. In the wintertime I keep one in every jacket I might wear, as well as at my desk at work and by my bedside. Then I read an article which explained how some ingredients in various lip moisturizer products might feel good temporarily, but are actually making it so you need *more* of the product as time passes. So I looked over the various ones I had from names like Chapstick, Blistex, and Lip Medex -- and threw away most of them.It took some digging to find options like this Neutrogena one that have all the ""good"" ingredients (natural oils, sunscreen) and none of the ""bad"" (camphor, phenol, menthol, salicylic acid). It only took a few days for my lips to get over their addiction to the bad products and get used to the better ones. Now, instead of feeling like I need to apply lip moisturizer many times a day, I only need to every few days or so -- and we're still in cold, windy winter weather here.Burt's Bees lip moisturizers are also a good alternative, but I settled on this one because it does not have any fancy ""flavors"" or smells -- it is just a simple ""clean"" smell that is hardly noticeable. So far the Neutrogena ones have weathered well in my coat pockets, and continue to apply smoothly. (Some competitors' products have partly ""melted"", which can be messy.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K0UZTAPI2VDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OX9SGCI#wasThisHelpful","R3K0UZTAPI2VDO","AASACKX93RMG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AASACKX93RMG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had pretty high expectations of the MeccaNoid G15 KS and they were only partly met. It can be a lot of fun to build and play with, but the novelty wears off pretty quickly because there are a limited number of things that the G15 KS can do. Before I jump into a list of pros and cons I wanted to mention that building the G15 KS is quite a bit of work and prospective buyers should enjoy assembling and building things since I found that to be half of the fun. If you don't like assembling furniture, Meccano, Lego, etc then don't even consider the MeccaNoid G15 KS.Pros+ Straightforward build: relatively clear directions, limited variety of fasteners makes it easy to figure out which screw and nuts to use, tools are included. Overall one of the best build experiences ever for something of this complexity.+ Voice recognition for commands is pretty cool and it works most of the time. Some novel commands like ""Walk with me"" will absolutely thrill the younger kids.+ Rechargeable battery included which sure beats having to bring your own batteries (like in the G15 - the smaller MeccaNoid).+ Impressive height!Cons- Some of the diagrams don't make it clear enough which parts to use and how to orient them. In some cases, the 3-D parts are not drawn well enough to show orientation.- Although you're supposed to be able to reassemble it into other robot forms I can't imagine where to start without directions- iOS app is primitive and directions on how to use it are limited. Plus you need an older phone without the case or it won't fit into the holder- Build is too tedious for younger kids (less than 10) and requires quite a bit of dexterity since the screws and nuts are quite small- You can record and playback actions but only for the arms- Fingers cannot grab or hold anything so the bottom line is that it can move it's armed and move and talk. That's about it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25G3AK9JHH29I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY40ERW#wasThisHelpful","R25G3AK9JHH29I","A28UMA3GW9L124","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28UMA3GW9L124?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have mixed feelings about the MIXIT Belkin Dock. It's attractive and affordable and fits a variety of iOS devices that use the lightning connector: anything from an iPhone 5 to an iPad ! So lot's of flexibility with the side-to-side width of a device or front-to-back thickness. Unfortunately it won't fit any of my devices with cases because the connector needs a large opening at the bottom to accommodate it and the base of the connector. It seems that many have modified their cases to make them work but I am not willing to do that nor do I think it should be necessary. My other complaint has to do with the weight of the dock. It's pretty lightweight so it's not really practical to use with heavier devices or when you want something to stay put.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ5B7O3CTV9FV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SW06GVW#wasThisHelpful","RQ5B7O3CTV9FV","A28UMA3GW9L124","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28UMA3GW9L124?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been through a half-dozen beard trimmers over the last decade or so. They've all felt pretty cheap and I had no expectations of them lasting very long. One of them even had a laser guide for making sure your sideburns are straight! I really like the Panasonic ER-GB60. It's relatively quiet and works wet or dry and is very easy to clean (just put it under some running water!) There's a large range of trim settings (1-20mm) although you need to switch trimming attachments to get access to the whole range. It's sharp and works with one pass. It comes with a case, charging cable, a little bottle of oil for the blades, and a brush as well as the two attachments. This is not a gadget but a utilitarian beard trimmer that is easy to clean and works very well.

"As a long-time user of both UPSs and portable batteries I was intrigued by the APC BGE50ML Back-UPS Connect and welcomed the opportunity  to try it out and write a review. As with most APC products that I've tried, it's well-built and pretty straightforward. With the battery connected you get a light-weight UPS with a couple of rotating receptacles and three USB charge ports (one is high power). With the battery removed you get a pretty basic surge arrester and a portable battery that can be used to recharge your devices on the go. The battery is 11,400 mAh so it's on the higher end as far as portable batteries go. The high power USB charge port is also located on the battery.The reason I'm not rating it higher is that for the price you can get a regular UPS + portable battery (11,000 mAh and up) so I don't really see the value or purpose of a product like this. A regular UPS will always give you battery backup - not just when the battery is connected.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18YBTMZ2O1GQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JHYQNC#wasThisHelpful","R18YBTMZ2O1GQL","A28UMA3GW9L124","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28UMA3GW9L124?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Contigo Autospout Gizmo Flip is a decent kids water bottle with some nice little features. I think the Sapphire design is attractive: bright and fun for kids but not garish or too boyish/girlish. Unlike other bottles, the straw is tethered which is a nice touch but on occasion I've found it hard to seat and it's come loose causing leaks. Other reviewers have mentioned that the mouth spout is not removable and, therefore,‚Äã a bit harder to clean so I'll share my cleaning secret for these bottles: I just use denture cleaner.

It is a bit low so it's not very useful as a chair for regular table but kids have short legs anyway so a that's a limitation of it being a children's product.

"The JBL Voyager Portable Bluetooth speaker looks stunning in white and is a refreshing change from many of its boxy competitors. The subwoofer itself needs to be plugged in but the speaker can run off the built-in battery.

"May 25, 2015 Update-----------------------------After almost a year with this little battery pack I feel the need to update my review. I've tried at least a dozen different portable battery packs over the years and I've settled on this one as a clear favorite. It's got the capacity to charge my iPhone 6 at least twice from almost no charge and it's still going strong after a year of constant use. Other models I've tried have lost their capacity over time. I originally complained about the short cables but after continuous use it's really not a problem and I've become accustomed to it.Original Review---------------------This is a very handy charger because it includes the two cables that many folks will need: a lightning cable and a micro USB cable. They're permanently connected to the unit and hide away when not in use. Capacity is great - I can charge my iPhone 5s 2-3 times. A couple of minor complaints: the cords are short so it's tough to use the device while charging and there's no way to add another cord in case you want say a 30-pin Apple connector. The ends on the connectors are also fairly large and may not fit if you use a case. For example the Apple 5s case needs to be removed since the connector won't fit through the case.Overall a good effort but short of being perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31O4SY8RJUF09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXMAQIK#wasThisHelpful","R31O4SY8RJUF09","A28UMA3GW9L124","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28UMA3GW9L124?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Play-Doh Sweet Shoppe Cake Mountain Playset looks like it's going to be a lot of fun. It's big and impressive. But unfortunately it doesn't quite deliver.

"These sweet and hot jalapenos are absolutely delicious. Not sure where the 'Krisp' in the name comes from because these are by no means krisp or hard and that doesn't make them any less delicious. The first flavor that hits you is the sweetness and then it's followed by fire. They are by no means for the faint or delicate of palate.

I was going to write a list of pros and cons but for the life of me I have nothing at all to complain about:+ Batteries charge very quickly+ Comes with two batteries+ Relatively lightweight and compact+ Built-in light+ A pleasure to use and hold.

"As you would expect, the 'Pencil by FiftyThree' is a great looking stylus. It's comfortable and just feels right while gliding smoothly over my iPad's surface. When combined with Paper by FiftyThree it really shines by adding two new features: automatic palm rejection (since it 'knows' that the surface of the pen is in contact or no) and the built-in eraser.It's a bit gimmicky and in my opinion unnecessarily complicated. While palm rejection and erasing are nice I haven't really felt the need for them. I'm also not an exclusive Paper user so the extra cost of this stylus isn't that easy to justify.It is nice that the extra tools in Paper are unlocked and free when using Pencil but I think it would have been more reasonable to just unlock them for free when users purchased Pencil.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LEQKVCB1U7D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JP12170#wasThisHelpful","R2LEQKVCB1U7D4","A28UMA3GW9L124","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28UMA3GW9L124?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For starters this came packaged in saran wrap, in bubble wrap, inside a cardboard box, that was than placed in an amazon box. Needless to say my shadows arrived intact, and in pristine condition. As for the shadows themselves, there are many neutral colors, some darker tones, jewel tones, and mattes. None with glitter in them. There is two blues in this palette, the lighter of the two didn't show up very well, I used some mac fix plus to help and it worked, but its just so light that its difficult. Most of the shadows are buttery soft, and not chalky, with very little fall out, or clumps. The lighter shadows need some fix plus to help with pigmentation, other than that, most shadows applied very well with great pigmentation without any help. All swatches shown are just with a finger, nothing added and no primer. I do suggest a primer when wearing these shadows, they blend pretty well. Overall I am quite impressed with this palette and it's quality, it's not the greatest, but it is far from the worst.

It comes with lens covers, a hand strap and mine even came with the tripod. As well as a convenient carrying case. It works great at night too, with crisp clear viewing.  I did test this in the rain, and the lenses stayed fog free, and it is waterproof as noted in their description.Sample provided","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GYN4GQAAWV6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012512856#wasThisHelpful","R1GYN4GQAAWV6V","A2F8X61SB7F73B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2F8X61SB7F73B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great Mascara, big tube with a triangular top. The ONLY downside I have to this mascara is that it is not in fact smudge proof, nor waterproof. I have blonde eyelashes, that are very full and long, so when I wear black mascara I tend to look like I have falsies on.  I want a mascara that is going to stay put, and make them look even fuller. This mascara is perfect with that, it's a smaller wand making it easier to apply. Only 1 coat is needed for a dark, full looking set of eyelashes.

This is convenient to store until needed or to take out of the box and use immediately. It works just as well with non Dell systems as well.

"This movie was just awful. I don‚Äôt understand all the four and five star ratings for it, unless those  reviews are from people who enjoy watching animal cruelty and suffering, plus watching little kids get upset because the movie makes it look like the neverbeast dies at the end.The neverbeast is basically like a big cat and is put through one physically hurtful thing after another. The movie becomes a masochism tango as the fairies join in by drugging him, chasing him down with weapons and restraining him. Along the way viewers are made to think fairies are dead as the neverbeast is shown in agony as lightning strikes him and he grows horns and wings. At the end he goes to sleep for a thousand years and there is a funeral procession.This is too much for little kids.The Tinkerbell movies used to be good. They were never intense, they taught good values and you knew a kid could watch it. This was a big fat piece of crap and the older kids knew it. The younger ones cried and told me they never wanted to see it again. I can‚Äôt say as how I blame them. I‚Äôm never going to trust Disney again, and I‚Äôm going to pre-screen their junk just like I do everything else.I‚Äôm 44 years old. People my age have a tendency to drop dead for no apparent reason. I don‚Äôt have time or money to waste on scary movies for my nieces and nephews that will scare them and make them cry. There is maybe 5 minutes of Tinkerbell in it, only one male character and we never get to see how the Pixie Hollow Defense Force works. Add to that the animal cruelty and making the kids cry, and it‚Äôs hard to understand how anyone could like this movie.People who say this movie is good HAVE to be lying‚Äîthere‚Äôs no other explanation. Supposedly this is the last Tinkerbell movie. If they ever do another one, they had better stay away from the heavy hitting subject matter.

"This Monster High circus playset comes with ""gargoyle"" doll Rochelle and some interesting play items. There's a funhouse mirror, a tightrope, a swing and a photo cutout. It comes with standard monster High branded accessories as well as little things specifically for a circus.Rochelle herself wears a clown-inspired dress without any horrid over the top clown makeup. If you haven't seen any of the MH gargoyle dolls yet, just be aware that their skin looks and feels rough. They are inspired by real-life statues of gargoyles on older buildings, and their skin is supposed to resemble that concrete and stone.This set could have been improved by including a cardboard backdrop, more photo cutouts, and other paintings for the picture frame on the ""iron"" gate.

"Space: You're going to need more of it when you get this out of the box and put it together. This playset is 4 feet tall at the clock tower and 5 feet wide at the base, but you don't really have an appreciation for that until you've got this thing out and assembled. The good news is that it folds up for storage. The height stays the same, but you can save on the floor space in the closet or wherever you plan on keeping it.At this price point, the plastic could have been more durable and the backgrounds could have been better than just thin printed pieces. It's tempting to scan the printed stuff and print it on more durable paper or to laminate it. You may want to reinforce some of the connecting parts with model glue or tape. This is more of a backdrop or diorama than a playhouse. I think both kids and collectors will need a couple of extra sets of furniture to be able to get gull enjoyment out of it.The most terrifying part of this is putting it together. the pieces are badly packed and the instructions aren't very clear. My husband is an architect and I'm lucky that he has a kind of gut instinct about little projects like this. Some of you may need to enlist the Army Corps of Engineers for help, or possibly bribe an older sibling. Don't leave it to the little kids; they will not be able to do it.On the up side, with all the doll clips and built-in clips, you can display up to 25 dolls on it. If you add in dolls on stands in front of it, you can display quite a bit of your de-boxed collection with this playset. Of course, you'll have to dust it.This playset could have been better without affecting the cost. More durable plastic would have gone a long way toward quality and stability of the structure. I'm not sure why they dedicated a space to a radio station without including a cheap mini-speaker to plug into an iPod or phone for music. I would have made that something different altogether. The clock tower only serves to make the structure obnoxiously tall, and ought to be detachable for storage.4 stars because this will display a lot of dolls for me and any kid who gets one will love it. Minus one because it could have been better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E4JILYXYJ804/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03U04Y#wasThisHelpful","R1E4JILYXYJ804","A1PL7QILVQV3IF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL7QILVQV3IF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was bullied heinously in a small town public school for 10 years, right up to the day I graduated, and they even managed to get in a final slap in the face in the yearbooks the following fall. I watched this on another service, and I couldn't believe how bad it was. I don't think anyone who worked on this movie knew anything about bullying in general, let alone cyberbullying, and it just turned out to be dumb.Bullies don't have good intentions. Most of the time, they don't even have any intentions. They're bored, they're in the moment, and they see you as their entertainment to pass the time until an adult comes along who can make them stop. There is no logical or rational explanation for their behavior. Whoever added the logical explanation for the bully's behavior was trying to engage the part of the adult audience that always howls that ""THERE MUST BE SOME REASON FOR THIS!"" A kid will tell you it's because their parents are divorcing or because of this or that, because that's what you want to hear, that there was a REASON, but the fact is that they do it for kicks.The bullying itself was very tame stuff, and it didn't reflect real-life harshness and intensity at all. Bullying is a blood sport and it is absolutely brutal. It doesn't stop with name calling and spreading rumors about STDs. They spit on you, shove you into lockers and walls, and won't let you have a seat at lunch or on the bus. You can be the ball in locker foosball if you show up at the wrong time-- that's where they line up in between lockers and shove you from one side into the other until they run out of time. And they don't just restrict harassment for one class or the bathroom. They do it to you everywhere. There's no peace for you on a bike ride or at the local shops. If you're an acceptable target, no one will ever intervene for you.~SPOILERS~ (If that's even possible with such a badly written script)The characters are incredibly naive and stupid. The mother allowed her to have unfettered access to the internet, not really understanding how any of it works. She kept telling the daughter to delete the social media page but never followed up. She got upset that her daughter called someone a b****, but she seemed just fine with everyone ganging up on her daughter until after the suicide attempt. Then after one run-in with a parent who was a bully lawyer, she didn't confront any of the other people who had done it. People are shocked, SHOCKED I SAY, that someone was catfishing using a made-up identity. Nobody knew about IP addresses or how to look one up. They only found out who did it because she confessed to it. The daughter had to go to therapy, because SHE was the one with a problem now, not the bullying jerks. Everybody in that group had the IQ of a sheet of bubblewrap and it focused on how victims need to adjust their behavior to avoid bullying, not on defending yourself. And of course, it had to end with everyone forgiving each other, and passing a law that most likely is unconstitutional, but everyone will support because it's ""for the CHILDREN!""Not to mention this girl never would have been targeted in the first place. She was pretty, blonde, and had a circle of friends. Bullies pick on people who don't have friends and have trouble socializing. They'll focus on any visible physical flaw, but they prefer the loners. Loners don't have anyone to defend them. Even a loner's parent tells them it's their fault because they don't have any friends.The casting was good, but the diversity was awful--- it always is in these kinds of productions. The one black friend splits at the first sign of trouble and is clearly there so that they will have someone black in the movie-- same with the principal. It seems that dark skinned black girls and Hispanic kids are only good for being tertiary characters and redshirts.You can watch it if you want to see how bad it is, how not to write a movie, or play a drinking game every time a character does something dumb. That's really all this movie is good for. If you want to stop bullying, you need to raise your kids right. You have to talk to them and teach them right from wrong. When your kid says someone is hurting them, listen to them. It's nothing like this movie, and it's not going to end the way the movie did, either.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4690OK6QIBM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00652U72S#wasThisHelpful","R4690OK6QIBM2","A1PL7QILVQV3IF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL7QILVQV3IF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The main pendant is half the size of a dime with none of the thickness, and you can't see the hearts or the engraved ""taken"" without a magnifying glass.

"I don't like to switch deodorants, but I've been curious about these clinical strength deodorants for a while now. I'm ""clinically curious,"" I guess.

I can't say I've used it long enough to notice whether the appearance of my arm pits has changed, but at least I'm not allergic to it. Just judging it as an antiperspirant/deodorant, however, this is the best. It really gives much better protection against sweat and odor, and yes, you can skip a day. I tried it. You have to put it on at night, so if you like to shower in the morning, this is going to present something of a problem. I'm not sprouting pit hair like Chewbacca or anything, but I like to do my shaving in the morning. I don't know if it works the same way if you wash twice and re-apply it.

"Words cannot express what a waste of money this package is. The spatula, replacement blades and the scoring tool shown in the case are the only useful things in this package. I think that my problem with this kit is that it's marketed as ""Cricut Essentials Kit for Cricut Cutting Machines,"" but that's not true. The mats are useless because you can't use them with the Cricut Expression or the Expression 2, which are the newer machines that everyone is buying. The ruler is too small to be useful. I don't know what those hooks and things are-- possibly dental instruments gone wrong, but I have done lots of cutting on my Expression and I have never had a use for them. The blades on the scissors and on the paper trimmer work fine through about 10 sheets of paper, then they start to get dull, and catch and rip your projects. The paper that comes with it is ugly and not in any color that I would ever use in a project. If I hadn't used a sheet to do practice cuts I would send this item back to Amazon. Do NOT buy this kit.

The heads are plastic that will last a long time as long as you use the pad. I use this to accent scrapbook pages, cards and in other paper crafting projects. Practice on scrap paper first so you'll get an idea of how to keep a straight line, or get a curvy one if that's your thing.

"Toilet paper-- unless you have a bidet everywhere you go when you need to go, you'll have to use it sooner or later.

They stand up to just about any mess. As a nice side benefit, I think that the durability also keeps it from leaving lint behind. My husband is always the first to complain about low quality toilet paper, but he's been quiet since we got these-- apparently it's doing the job! I am surprised at how long these rolls lasted at this house, and how strong it is without being rough on skin.

"I don't really scrapbook. I might start after this, but making artsy layouts of personal photos (half of which were taken against my will) is just not how I would like to spend my time. I collect dolls, mostly Barbie, and I like to make little dioramas and backgrounds for them with various props and scrapbooking elements. (Yes, I'm one of *those* people.) I mostly wanted this for the Disney classics images and decided to get this to see if I liked it before I jumped into a Silhouette Cameo Starter Kit Bundle Cutter. Unless you are dead set on using specific licensed images, many of which are only available on the secondary market at inflated prices, you may just want to go straight to the Cameo instead.Whoever tagged this as a throwback to printers and tech in the 1980s was spot on. The display and the cartridges make this thing look like some kind of dot matrix printer/Atari hybrid. A good systems analyst probably has all the parts to make one of these things stuffed somewhere up in his attic. They have a more advanced LCD touch screen on the Expression 2, but I read too many reviews citing screens spontaneously dying to risk it--especially with so many customer service horror stories.I think this is meant for people who are not very computer-savvy. The promos and descriptions seem to emphasize its use as a stand-alone product. What gets me is that if you can keep track of what you've printed and where it's going to go on the mat, you should be able to figure out the Cricut Craft Room software. I suppose the up side of this is that if you're taking it with you, you wouldn't necessarily have to lug around your laptop as well. However I bet I could run the whole kit & caboodle on a tablet or a Dell Mini 9 with little or no hacking, maybe even wirelessly.That said, the more they overtake the plumbing, the easier it is to stop up the drain. I tried using it without the computer, but it was slow and it still doesn't make efficient use of paper. I'm comfortable enough with computers and have no plans to start schlepping this machine all over the place for show and tell, so I'm using a Windows 7 PC. Craft Room software (available from the website) will be a breeze for most people to learn, even those not technically inclined. To me, having the layout in front of me on screen is much easier than trying to remember what I've input into the keypad, which shape is where, or what color I should load next.Draconian DRM: I knew about this going in, and it's been discussed already in other reviews, but it bears mentioning again. Not only can you not unlink cartridges, but you can't import your own images. I see where this has already ticked off a lot of business owners who bought one of these to make their own logos and signs. When I've gotten tired of the same Disney images and generic shapes that everyone else has, and chasing after retired cartridges in the hundreds of dollars, a different machine and parting of ways seems inevitable.The secondary market on some of the retired cartridges is kind of puzzling. I can understand this when there is absolutely no other way to get an image set you want, but Cricut sells digital versions of some of their retired cartridges at a fraction of what linked and non-linked physical cartridges go for on auction sites. When you buy a digital copy instead of a cartridge, you're tethered to a computer and you must have an internet connection. None of that bothers me, but I guess it bothers the people who want to use this computer-free, or who aren't comfortable with purchasing digital files. Even brand new, cartridges are heinously expensive. I expect to pay more for Disney, Hello Kitty and other licensed images, but for generic stuff they scanned out of a Dover catalog, they should not be gouging people like that.Like other bugs, some Cricuts just need to be stomped. Just opening the box, it was easy to understand why some people hate this company so much. They included a power cord, and that was about it, besides a couple of cartridges that no one wants anyway. There are instructions too, but I don't know how they expect technically challenged people to be able to figure it out. They skimped on everything else, and I do mean everything. They didn't even include a cable for the computer, and that ought to come standard. I mean, I didn't expect wireless, but that's inexcusable whether they're pushing this on the computer-impaired or not.If you already do a lot of scrapbooking and paper projects, chances are you already have extra tools to get started. If not, and if you get nothing else, get a paper cutter and a spatula. The spatula helps you get paper off the cutting mat. A paper cutter is useful for splitting sheets into halves so that you don't have to cut an entire sheet at once.Because all I had was a pair of scissors, and because I saved so much by getting an Amazon Warehouse Deal, I got a Cricut Essentials Kit. This kit is overpriced and should have been included with the Cricut. The box set of tools kind of resembles a medieval torture kit and I'm not sure how to use some of them. I have to wonder if they took them from a dentist's office. I didn't realize the 6x12 mats were not for use with the Expression, and the 6x12 paper included in the kit is lackluster to say the least. A lot of paper crafters will find it redundant and probably already have better quality stuff. I am going to take a thorough look at all of it, but I have a feeling that I may send it back in favor of buying better tools or just getting individual pieces. Get the machine with the starter tool kit bundle if you really want to make cuts the minute you de-box it.A couple of extra 12x12 mats will come in handy for getting more paper ready to go while one sheet is cutting, but I don't think I would get any more than 2 spares. They try to DRM you with these mats, too. If you use spray adhesive on them to get more use out of them, it voids the warranty. (Apparently just owning the Cricut voids the warranty.) Well, according to a lot of what I've read here, they don't stand behind their warranty anyway, so what's stopping you? I say once you've passed the 30 day return window with Amazon, if you're loving it, get a can of spray adhesive and cut those shapes till the blues go away. You'll spend enough money on replacement blades without sending these mats to the landfill every single time.I guess the big question is, does it cut? Yes it does, and it does it well. I got great shapes on my first try on scrap paper, and I was quickly making shapes to keep. This is the sharp, precise stuff you would expect to find in a package of cutouts at the store. I will probably have all the Disney classics shapes that I want and few resources to keep buying cartridges for other things. In a few days, I'm going to be bored, and it appears that Cricut likes it that way.Through litigation with extreme prejudice, Cricut has managed to crush third party software that allows you to make your own images or use anything that you didn't buy from Cricut. They can forget about cottage industries that would have made crafters happy and ultimately contributed to their own bottom line. Rude responses, stupid answers and avoiding warranty obligations are all over the place, and there are too many of the same kinds of complaints for it not to have some basis in fact. They want you to use all of their products, but they take none of the responsibility when something goes wrong. I keep seeing rumors of imminent bankruptcy, and it's not hard to believe.Finally, I bought this as an Amazon Warehouse deal. The description said that the outer package might have some damage. It looked to me like the original Cricut seal had been broken, but everything inside had remained untouched. It worked just fine and you can return it within 30 days. Amazon is a 5 star retailer-- it's such a shame that this product is not.Overall, I am happy with what I set out to do, but it leaves me wanting too much more. I cannot recommend this machine in good conscience. Unless you have your heart set on images you can't get anywhere else, do not buy this machine. Check out the Cameo, and if you do buy this, know what you are getting into. They don't back the quality of their work and they have business practices that would make Bernie Madoff blush with shame. They should call this machine the Suck Cut, because it sucks as it cuts--- mostly from your wallet, but especially from your creative spirit.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UIB4HN18NLL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WOV83M#wasThisHelpful","R1UIB4HN18NLL4","A1PL7QILVQV3IF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL7QILVQV3IF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know the target audience for this show-- I suppose it's for people who like the Tudors, and may be interested in the upcoming DaVinci's Demons. As someone interested in the Catholic church, and a fan of Mario Puzo who supposedly found his inspiration in this family, I found it intriguing. The series is mostly quiet, with a lot of plotting in hushed voices, then someone gets a throat slashed or gets poisoned. Battles are either thwarted or mostly fought off screen, though individual murders happen all the time. I think there is enough sex, story and eye candy for most people.A lot of people complain how the show deviates from history, just like the vocal Game of Thrones fanbase is locked in an eternal struggle between book fans and TV show fans. If you have doubts, I think Showtime has the full season 2 premiere free to watch on their website. The episode can stand enough on its own that you can understand what is going on and get a feel for whether or not you will like it.SPOILER ALERTThere are a few stand out parts for me. We finally find out more about Micheletto the assassin when he travels to his home town with Cesare. The scenes with his mother are hilarious, and we find out why he doesn't ever seem to be preoccupied with a girl or brothels.Lucrezia, the Pope's current mistress, and the mother of his children set out to make sure church funds go to the poor where they are supposed to go. It seems that all the women the Pope sleeps with ultimately become agents of his, doing favors for him like this. One is placed in charge of finding cannons when the French army approaches again. Lucrezia is in charge of the Vatican when the Pope has to go on a journey.The tension between Juan and his two siblings, Cesare and Lucrezia, builds to a fever pitch upon his return to Rome after a hiatus in Spain. Juan kind of gets what he deserves, and Cesare more put him out of his misery than murders him. The scene where the Pope/Rodrigo Borgia buries his son Juan intermixed with scenes of Lucrezia's wedding was very well done. I hope the music score for the second season will be released, because it helped make that moment all the more poignant.Cesare has longed to stop being a cardinal and to be a soldier in the Papal army since the beginning, and this season he dons a mask to avenge his dead lover and to steal gold in an effort to get the Pope to release him. I don't know if his costume was supposed to be true to the period or not, or if they intended it, but the scenes where he puts on his mask and runs about in his armor are hysterical. By day, he's a cardinal, by night, he's Batman! With Micheletto as Robin, and a band of outlaws and no-goods as their Merry Men, the Batman tortures, kills and steals to set right what once was wrong! The mask looks so bad that I couldn't stop laughing.There are really no extras on the blu ray to speak of. The special features that do exist all seem to be on BD live, and you have to have an internet connection for that. I can't tell you how incredibly annoying that is. There are 2 episodes of Californication and 2 episodes of House of Lies that you can access through the BD live, but neither of these shows interest me in the least. They would have been better off including a couple of key episodes of the Tudors if they needed filler-- at least it would be a related genre. I really resent paying for the discs and then having to go online to ask permission to watch the extras. There aren't even any episodes with commentary as far as I can tell.This show could benefit greatly form a slightly larger budget, and perhaps one or two more episodes per season to keep a better pace. If you're preoccupied by the problems in the modern Catholic church, if you're easily offended by most things that come out of an HBO or Showtime series, if you're an historical nitpicker, or if you're expecting the show to wow you on all levels, don't watch it. It is a solid 4 stars, not even coming close to 5, but it is entertaining and for me a worthwhile watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SASG16HG4G0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060MYKTY#wasThisHelpful","R1SASG16HG4G0T","A1PL7QILVQV3IF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL7QILVQV3IF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mom recently gave me a bag of papers, report cards and mementos from my school days. She meant it to be a nice thing for me to have in adulthood to remember my school days. People who want me to put the past behind me seem to also be the same people who won't let me forget it. I had to stuff that bag in the closet. I can't look at it without crying. Why were they so mean to me? Why was I such a bad person? Why did they hate me so much? I graduated high school in 1989, and the bullying I endured still hurts.If you're an adult survivor of the kind of heinous treatment the kids in this movie endure, it may trigger a PTSD episode. If it never happened to you, you will be absolutely stunned at what goes on. They don't sugar-coat anything. Some of the footage is raw and disturbing. These kids know that the cameras are there;  they've been recorded since before they were born. They know they are being watched, and they still behave like animals. It makes you really wonder what they do when they know no one is looking.It is kind of limited in scope. They never interview the bullies, so we never know why they think it's OK to treat other kids that way. It doesn't get much into cyber bullying. All of the stories are from small towns. I don't think they intentionally tried to smear small town America, but having one story from a major metropolitan school system would have been helpful. Where are school administrators who fight bullying? They're certainly not in this film, and after I watched it, I'm convinced they don't even exist.Alex stands out because they followed him around the most, yet they neglected to mention that he has Asperger Syndrome. With Kelby they mentioned she was gay almost every chance they had, but  Alex's autism was never mentioned.  Autistic people across the spectrum run a very high risk of being bullied, taken advantage of and being victim to criminal activity. Keeping autism cloaked in this movie was a horrendous disservice to Alex and to autistic people everywhere.Everyone is giving Alex a hard time. The kids literally pummel him with fists and words. The school administrators insist that he must have some part in how the other kids are treating him. He must have done something to provoke them. Even Alex's own parents blame him for not doing something about it, but they never explain WHAT he is supposed to do. Their only concern seems to be that his younger sister not be teased for having him as a brother. Alex is treated as a sub-standard human, as though he is less than anyone else, and it's sickening to watch.You'll be outraged at the other cases, too. Ja'Meya was bullied so much that she brought a gun on her school bus. The sheriff gets some kind of sick pleasure out of stacking as many felonies onto a bullied black girl as he can. I can only speculate what unspeakable things a man like this does in his patrol car back seat while flashing his emergency lights and watching re-runs of Beretta.Kids in a mini-van ran over Kelby because she is gay, and they call it bullying.  She's not welcome at church, and her teachers openly participate in the bullying and hate. She wanted to stay and try to make a difference and change the status quo, but even the strongest among us have their limits. After another humiliating incident, Kelby can't take any more, and decides it's time to go to another school.The film also discusses two boys who were bullied so badly they killed themselves. It's gut-wrenching to watch those parents grieve. The movie tries to end on a hopeful note, but it's really not enough. Letting balloons go into the sky won't stop bullying or cure the incompetence of the adults who are supposed to protect these kids. This movie's website doesn't do much, either. They sell DVDs, ""educator toolkits"" and ask visitors to take pledges against bullying. We are encouraged to throw money at the problem rather than solve it, because it's the American way. Everyone needs to see it, but thanks to the way they're distributing it, not everyone will. The bullied kids not just in this film but everywhere deserve better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ECDQ7VEAVQTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A4TMLKE#wasThisHelpful","R2ECDQ7VEAVQTD","A1PL7QILVQV3IF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL7QILVQV3IF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tecnu is is a great first aid gel for cuts and scrapes. It is everything Staphaseptic was. I can't be happier that it was just a name change, and it wasn't discontinued. In addition to regular first aid, I have found that it's also useful for cystic acne. Acne cysts will leave swelling and redness on me for months. Using the gel two or three times a day when I first feel one of these nasty ones forming can keep it from ever even surfacing. If I don't manage to catch it in time, it's also great for speeding healing of cystic acne along. The only complaint I have about it is that the childproof cap seems to break easily. You can cut the outer cap off and the inner cap will still keep the gel fresh; just remember to store it away from little ones. The gel will dry with a sticky surface, so it won't be any good under makeup. Over makeup I have found that it not only works, but you can use it on top of makeup without anyone knowing it's there. Even with its flaws, I give Tecnu five stars for performing so well. For the impact it has on my occasional cystic acne alone, I would buy it. Having as a first aid gel as well is a great bonus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R293Q2D91T16ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QBTOXA#wasThisHelpful","R293Q2D91T16ID","A1PL7QILVQV3IF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL7QILVQV3IF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic beginner set for someone just starting their own household, or someone who is just getting into cooking. I'm not familiar with the brand, and as one of the Cooking Impaired, I probably won't see flaws that an experienced cook might find with this set. The handles stay cool, and I can't get anything to stick to them. NOTHING sticks to this cookware. I defy anyone to get something stuck to these pots and pans! I don't have a dishwasher, but apparently these don't stand up well in one. The good news is that regular handwashing will take food off, and without scrubbing. The individual pieces are not heavy, but you can tell that they are quality when you're handling them. You can even put them in the oven up to 350 degrees. They heat evenly and quickly, without any sliding all over the stove. The best part is that you don't have to hide your metal utensils to keep the non-stick surfaces. No more smacking hubby's hands with the metal spatula for ruining a non-stick pan. This set looks and feels like it will last a long time. I can't find anything wrong with it, and I think you'll be very pleased with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19L73JFK17FOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0093FWX7G#wasThisHelpful","R19L73JFK17FOJ","A1PL7QILVQV3IF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL7QILVQV3IF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had the opportunity to try several Bissell products, and most of them were pretty good. I have a German shepherd almost a year old, and a cream-point Himalayan cat. There is no shortage of pet hair in this house, and most Bissell products have dealt with the hair effectively. So I was taken aback when the vacuum that was supposed to be for pet hair did not pick up pet hair. It's an otherwise good vacuum for everyday use, it has a nice, long cord, but it simply does not pick up pet hair, especially on furniture with attachments. Assembly instructions were complicated, and even the power button isn't where it should be. If this was not specifically advertised for pet hair, it would be an OK vacuum. 3 stars for otherwise good functionality, minus 2 for not performing the main function as advertised.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GCVL2HMDRW5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H1RM6I#wasThisHelpful","R3GCVL2HMDRW5J","A1PL7QILVQV3IF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL7QILVQV3IF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a data hoarder, and I need all the space I can get. We took this one to work, added it to our network of backup drives, and it works great. I also tested it at home manually, and everything went smoothly. Data transfer seemed a little slow, but there are a million things that might have affected speed of backup. I've got a lot of cheap cables at home, and most of my backup drives have to download data through a USB expansion. I don't like to use the software that comes with these things because it's always cumbersome & I don't like adding more bloatware to my computer when I can just drag and drop what I want to back up.

"This steam mop is fantastic for cleaning tiles and floors. I'm a little suspicious of products that claim to kill bacteria. There's really no way for me to tell if the floors are getting THAT clean. There is no water filter on this, so you'll want to go with the company's recommendation of using distilled water only in the mop. Some other models have expensive filters that have to be replaced. If you can add a gallon of distilled water to your shopping list every couple of months or so, I think it will be worth it. This one comes with scent inserts that you can use if you like to add scent without using harsh chemicals. You don't have to use them if you don't want to, and the mop heads are washable. There won't be a lot you have to regularly replace on this mop to have clean floors. 5 stars for effectiveness and low maintenance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RH1ZAD7QCD1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091YYUAM#wasThisHelpful","R1RH1ZAD7QCD1O","A1PL7QILVQV3IF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL7QILVQV3IF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like to keep a toothbrush around at work and on the go just because if I have garlic or something for lunch, I don't want to knock people over with my breath. I also don't like to have food sticking to my teeth. This doesn't have the power I would like for my morning and night time brushing, but it's so great to have a power toothbrush for in between meals. It's easy enough to find AAA battery replacements, and you don't have to worry about charging it. However, replacement brush heads seem very expensive, and they may be hard to find. In spite of this chink in the armor, I do like having the confidence to eat anything while I'm out knowing that I can brush of needed. 4 stars for the overall product, minus one for cost of replacement heads.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPOHFX4W8Z3DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090JS6XU#wasThisHelpful","RPOHFX4W8Z3DN","A1PL7QILVQV3IF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL7QILVQV3IF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The description says that this doll comes with a display stand, but it doesn't. Mattel stopped including display stands with the Holiday Barbies last year supposedly because most collectors were leaving them in the box anyway. I didn't like being herded into a certain type of collecting then, and I don't like it now. By this logic, the doll shouldn't have shoes either, since you can't see them, but there is a pair tucked behind the dress toward the bottom. I can see how some people might miss them altogether if they didn't take her out of the box.This is one of the classier holiday dolls. The last few years have truly been a golden age for the holiday Barbies, with modern ballgowns that people might really wear, rather than tacky craft ribbon explosions of years past. You can't go wrong buying this as a toy, gift or as a 3-dimensional greeting card. Since they are trying to force people into the NRFB (Never Removed From Box) mentality, I think I would prefer a box with a clear plastic window on top that would allow light to come through-- particularly multi-colored Christmas lights-- how neat would that be?The fabric is also better than in previous years. In the box, it's held in place with cardboard, but I think if you took her out to display (remember you'll need to get a stand) the dress would drape nicely and not be artificially stiff. One caveat I think bears mentioning is that red fades quickly. It's the nature of the pigment, so keep this one away from sunny windows if you want her red dress to retain its vibrant color.  I think that there's a velcro closure in the back of the dress, so if you like to do a little Frankendolling like I do, it will be easy to swap out the dress with another doll. I wish the jewelry could have been real metal with rhinestones instead of solid plastic, but you can't have everything and stay at this price point.As a Barbie collector, I am thrilled to add her to my Barbie room. You won't be disappointed unless you wanted to put her on a stand, and extra stands are not hard to find. She is definitely one of the best Holiday Barbie dolls ever.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHJGJL67N5N1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006O6EIWK#wasThisHelpful","RHJGJL67N5N1C","A1PL7QILVQV3IF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL7QILVQV3IF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A review is hardly a place to be dumping your emotions, but I think you need to understand what drove me to try this product or anything like it in the first place. We are through the looking-glass with bizarre technology here, folks. Run a search for Victorian medical devices and you'll see why I was leery of this thing. I have had acne for a long time, and I have tried everything from common rubbing alcohol to calling a televangelist for prayer, and nothing works. The only time that this mess ever cleared up was for a couple of years when I had a thyroid infection, and I had a raging case of thyroid hormone overproduction. That cleared up and the acne came back with a vengeance.I want to make sure you understand that no matter how much you think you can help by clicking the comment button and copying/pasting your magical home remedy, or your spam website, or whatever it is you think you can throw at me and knock this out, it doesn't work. I've had temporary luck here and there where a treatment works at first, then I develop a resistance to it. That's as good as it gets.Having acne--real acne, not a lone zit once or twice a year-- is kind of like being obese. Everyone can see it, and they make assumptions about you. They think it's your fault, even that you're doing it on purpose, or that you've somehow been negligent because you don't care. They think you have poor hygiene, you're lazy, or that you're eating the wrong foods, and these assumptions can have absolutely disastrous consequences.Acne is a serious problem. Whether you want to admit it or not, this is a looks-based society and we judge a book by its cover. You will be passed over for promotions, or not get jobs in the first place, people won't go on dates with you based on it, people won't want to help you when you need it-- they won't want to even sit next to you. Strangers say things to you that they wouldn't say to anyone else. Adults mock other adults for it behind their backs and to their faces. It's not just kids acting this way. I have gone from a retail clerk to upper corporate positions and it happens everywhere. It happens in section 8 housing and it happens to high-level executives. I have seen it, and no amount of denial or trivialization can change it. Acne hits every segment of humanity, and no one likes having it.There is no home remedy, drug or voodoo magic that I don't know about, but people are relentless in their pursuit of giving me unsolicited advice (after they've mocked me and refused to give me a raise, of course). This extends to informing me that I have a problem in the first place, as if I didn't notice the redness, inflammation, and bumps ON MY FACE IN A SOCIETY FULL OF MIRRORS. I know they think they're being helpful, but do people with clear skin just never get tired of the sound of their own voice?I suppose this shouldn't surprise me in America, where everyone becomes an expert ready for punditry on cable news whenever they think they see a problem. People see the rash on your face, and suddenly everyone's a dermatologist who has the precise solution--if you've tried their way and it didn't work, it's because you didn't follow their exact regimen. It's like Borger King: Have it Their way--your way is irrelevant! Their way always consists of some variation on some lame over the counter thing that everyone knows doesn't work, usually something involving benzoyl peroxide and sandpaper. They think there is a one zit fits all solution for what can be a highly individualized problem, and nothing you have ever done before their advice counts. You are as lazy and ignorant as you were five minutes ago before they met you.(This is where the acne/obesity thing crosses streams-- everyone watches what you're eating, and whatever you're eating is WRONG, no matter what it is. I think you can begin to see what's been itching me here.)The flip side of trying everything (aside from draining you mentally and financially) is that when you take an interest in bettering your looks, people then decide that you are vain. People have told me that I am vain, that I am self-obsessed, looks-obsessed, shallow, and a snob because I pursue clear skin. I'm arrogant and I think I'm better than other people because I use makeup and want to feel attractive. I'm supposed to just sit here with oozing red lumps of infection on my face, I'm supposed to settle for scarring and tell everyone ""That's alright; I don't mind."" Even as they point out all your flaws, other people will berate you for trying to fix them.They have to make sure that you don't get better than them as the result of advice they gave you to feel better about themselves. They're not interested in making you better; they're interested in making THEM better. They want to feel better about themselves, whether it's by feeling smarter or feeling more knowledgeable than YOU. It's not YOU, it's THEM.Chances are you probably ARE superior to them. Personally, I'm tired of acting like I'm not worth it so that everyone else can be OK with themselves. Why should I have to lower my standards? Why shouldn't they have to raise theirs? This isn't just about acne. This is about my right to the pursuit of happiness, and the society of mediocrity that tells me I should settle for less and lower my expectations. TELL YOUR CONGRESSMAN AMERICA IS ABOUT FREEDOM--Alright, that's enough. If you've stuck with it this far, you understand my frustration. You know that I'm in it to win it and failure is not an option. You are ready to go where no one has gone before and sit for 30+ minutes at a time with a flashlight on your face, and I'm ready to tell you what happened with this stupid light wand.This thing is pretty self-explanatory as far as assembly and charging go. Let it charge for 12 hours before you use it, and whatever you do, don't drop the little screw that holds the battery compartment closed. You will never find the screw again if you drop it, but you can tape the cover in place if you do. Assuming you don't die of boredom or frustration during use, you may want more than tape holding the battery in place. The indicator light may go off, but that doesn't mean it isn't still charging. Let it go the full 12 hours.You will probably lose at least the first one of your 600 uses trying to figure out how to hold it on your skin evenly. The whole head has to be in contact with your skin to activate, and it seems to be very sensitive. 600 uses may sound like a lot, but it's 600-3 minute sessions. Divide your face the way they recommend, then add in places they don't count, like your neck or chest, and every time you put it on your skin, that's a 3 minute session. I can easily see doing 12 sessions on my face and jawline alone. If you commit to this, you can see how it will eat away at your time and your wallet at $35 + shipping & tax for replacement heads.The head on this is small enough that you have to use multiple sessions to cover your face and maybe one other area, but large enough that you can't get it into corners like around your nose, or on some areas like your temple, or on contoured areas like your jawline. If you break out around your nose, good luck making the light stay on long enough to do any good. It might be a good idea to get a small light for the little corners and use this one for larger areas, but that's assuming this thing actually works, and we are not done agonizing through this just yet.Keep the manual on hand because you will get strange messages on the display. HP does not mean that Harry Potter has arrived to zap your acne. It means the device is in Heat Protection mode--you need to allow a device designed to generate heat to cool off. It can also be too cold to operate. This thing puts the mental in temperamental. People are wiping the head down with rubbing alcohol between uses. I don't get it. This thing kills germs on my skin, but it allows stuff to prosper on the very area which claims to kill the bacteria? None of this makes any sense.592 uses left, and I still haven't reached my forehead. I have hit HP twice and the battery ran low once. The max I seem to be able to get is 3 sessions before it goes into HP mode. I want to make Verilux eat this, but they probably all live in Kenya and are already eating exotic food products with President Obama's cousins (WOOF!). I'm too tired to swim across the ocean and you should not submerse the device in water. Why am I bothering at this point? Oh yeah, it cost way too much to just use as a flashlight and I have these unspeakable breakouts. Is it working? It's too soon to tell, and in corners, like the number of licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop, the world may never know.Well no one said it would be cheap, easy or endurable. It certainly isn't refundable, at least not through Amazon. So we must plod forward even in the face of certain doom. While we wait for results, let's go back to the Victorian medical device analogy. Did you run a search for them like I told you? This kind of malarkey is what I thought of when I first looked at LED skin lights. Most Victorian medical stuff did not have any science to back it up. It was a dark and smelly time, and there was no internet. A lot of it would be considered torture devices by today's standards (I think I saw a copper-plated waterboard in there someplace) and most of it didn't even begin to live up to outrageous claims. Of course these people believed in the regular use of opioids as a soft drink flavor, so we can't completely write off everything they did.We have no idea what the long term effects of this thing will be. In 10 years, if you are reading a review I am writing whilst in the midst of a brave battle with skin cancer or Arnegram-Clark syndrome, refer back to this review. Of course we don't know the long term effects of staring at a computer monitor on eyes desperately seeking an acne treatment that works, either, so I think it evens out. It is FDA approved, but these are the same people who approved a lot of stinkers too, so keep that in mind.I have a Thermaclear, and it works on those nasty huge ones that sit on your face for 6 months, hurt, and they leave a mark that lasts forever. There also does seem to be research that backs up the claim that this blue LED light will kill acne bacteria. The red claims to reduce wrinkles and jowls and stuff like that. I'll try a red if I can ever get this thing to work, but it sure won't be from this brand. I am getting this sneaking suspicion that I should have just bitten the bullet and bought the Quasar.This thing did make an immediate dent in the acne, especially the stubborn patches on my jawline. New ones are not emerging, ones already swollen appear to have stopped in their tracks, and the red patches seem to have gotten a healing boost. The problem is that this is the short term. Will light therapy stand the test of time, or will I move on to other voodoo products? It's kind of hard to tell when this thing keeps choking on its own heating sensors and uses a battery that has ADD. Will it work on my forehead? I'll certainly report back if I can ever get this thing to stay on long enough.The economy is tanking. I can't afford to waste money like this, and neither can anyone else. I will update on results with this thing as events warrant. LET IT BE KNOWN that I will not hesitate to amend this review and shred this product if I do not get better results than this. I reviewed a vacuum cleaner by this company and was similarly unimpressed. Maybe they should stick with just making lights and let someone who actually knows what they are doing create devices that use the lights. I'm going to stick with using this wand (at least until the fascist head tells me I have no more uses left).I think if you are on the fence about a light therapy skin device, you should take the plunge, but not with this product. Ansr is next on my list, and after that, I may go on to MIT for experimental radioactive treatment that will make me have babies with nine heads, or possibly to a good old-fashioned snake oil salesman. At least snake oil salesmen knew when to sit down and shut up, and I can't say that for all the jerks who have been putting their 2 cents in on my skin all these years, and there's something to be said for that.11/17/2012 EDIT THE FIRST: After a good, full two weeks of use, I can confirm that this thing is doing what it's supposed to do. Blue LEDs have stopped my acne dead in its tracks. I have not had a single new breakout in any area of treatment. I only have the pre-existing areas that are healing. Not one new red splotch, bump or cyst. The two biggest problems with this product are cost of replacement heads, and it goes into heat protection mode every 3rd or 4th session. This makes it even more cost-prohibitive than, and as tedious as, the Quasar Baby Blue. I think a better alternative is the BrightPad BT-L84 Acne Light, especially if you want to also try red light for its healing and anti-aging properties. Wear the goggles with whatever device you use. Do not trust these people who claim it's safe for your eyes, because the fact is we don't know. Better safe than sorry. My doctor said LEDs used this way are OK. Yours may disagree. If it can affect people taking thyroid medication, that tells me this light is going more than skin deep. More edits to follow, but I am going to get a different device when I run out of uses on this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HA3MT5HY85LR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XGYWL0#wasThisHelpful","R3HA3MT5HY85LR","A1PL7QILVQV3IF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL7QILVQV3IF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cannot. Tell you. How much. I love this axe.  As a short woman, splitting mauls are usually too heavy and too unwieldy when splitting logs.  This axe?  No problem.  I can chop through wood just as easily as a big guy can with one of those huge mauls.  Partly because I can get a faster swing with better accuracy.  I see a natural crack in the log?  I can aim and get it nearly every time. Three whacks, all on the very same spot.  And that's usually enough to split *any* size dry wood log.  Wet and green wood is a bit harder, but doable too.  Knots and limbs growing inside still give me trouble, but as I understand, that gives everyone trouble.The handle being the way it is has probably saved my hands a few times.  Every now and then, you get tired, you miscalculate and miss and hit the wood with the handle.  OW.  It's still an ow, but now, it's not a break of the handle, or the head flying off, or breaking anything for that matter.  Yay!  I love that from a safety aspect.  Nothing like ducking and hoping the head doesn't land on you or on a person or animal that could be 40 feet away when that old axe finally gives without warning.  Fun times.  No longer an issue with this axe.So, in short, it's not a maul, but not sharp enough to really be a true ""axe"".  But for splitting logs?  It's amazing.  It's the best of all worlds, and has actually made chopping wood productive, and dare I say, fun?  I much prefer this chore to stacking the wood or even taking out the trash.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S1E172XLMTVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M3BAQE#wasThisHelpful","R1S1E172XLMTVN","A2YXSMAP0A5TH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXSMAP0A5TH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simple machine that works great.  We've smoked pork a couple times, the Thanksgiving Turkey (a big bird), and a duck so far.  All of them excellent.  This smoker is fairly easy to clean, even after some major drippings, although I had to take some oven cleaner to the racks one time after some particularly messy meat. Looks like the burner element will be easy to replace if we need to down the road (think old school electric oven).  I like that the cord is removable to keep it out of the weather (the cord is like the ones that plug into a hot plate.  Actually, it's exactly like a hotplate cord that has the dial on it).  The walls and doors are fairly insulated, so once you get to your temperature, keeping it there is A LOT easier than with those budget propane models.  I wonder why we didn't do this earlier! Electric wins this battle.  Tip:  Line your pans with foil, and your wood pan with foil on the top, too.  That way, drippings won't permanently stain and mar the pans and it makes cleanup very easy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R64EXG7LEBXJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034VXAY0#wasThisHelpful","R64EXG7LEBXJN","A2YXSMAP0A5TH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXSMAP0A5TH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had high hopes for these treads.  After all, I have bought the kiddie ones in animal shapes before, and every time, they have been great.  Clean the tub, rinse the tub, rub rubbing alcohol and thoroughly dry the tub.  Stick, and they stay.  Awesome.  Except these.  Same process, left the tub unused for 18+ hours, and upon first use, at least 3 of the pieces came up immediately.  It was a hard decision to give it 3 stars, honestly.  The rest seem to be sticking (so far), but my confidence in them is very low, and it keeps me wary.  When we first moved, I busted my leg pretty bad slipping in the tub and I don't desire a repeat performance.  I'm not cconfident any more that these will prevent that :(  Come on SlipX... your kid stuff works!  I really just don't want adorable lobsters on the bottom of the master bath.*Edit*  Since I posted this, a company spokesperson contacted me to try and figure out what might have gone wrong with their product.  They sent complimentary replacements with an apology.  Life has been hectic, so I haven't had time to scrub and properly prep the tub for the new ones (and find time when no one will take a shower in it for at least 17-24 hours), but I do appreciate a company who tries to fix things.  So.. upgraded to 4 stars until I can try the new ones, and see how they do.

"When I got this pan, I fell in love with it.  It is insanely non-stick and non-staining.  Love, love, love it.  I've had it one month now, and have used it a hand full of times. I'm very careful with using only plastic or wood, and aside from one dish washer trip, I handwash with a sponge (it's so non-stick, why waste the dishwasher. seriously, it's that awesome),Tonight, upon washing it, I found *3* nicks in the porcelain at the bottom of the pan.  One month... finish already chipping?  Not cool.  I have contacted the company as of tonight to ask what their warranty is.  I will update this review for either good or bad based on how this all turns out.  Perhaps I got a lemon.  Stay tuned!Update!  3/13/14Okay.. About 2 weeks after I emailed them asking about their warranty, and telling them about the chipping, I got a phone call and email back from Vinaroz about the pot.  They asked for some photos of what happened, along with all my info.  I provided it all.  They sent me a new pot that arrived like a week later.  No instructions on returning the old one, etc.  Just a new pot on my doorstep.  Same color and everything.

"This shelf pack is awesome :)  They weren't too hard to put up.1. Find your studs and decide on your bracket spacing (very flexible there)2. make a line using a level, marking where you want the self,3. hold up a bracket and mark the holes,4. pre-drill holes,5. use included heavy lag bolts to install,6. pop on the wire shelving,  and7. install the plugs along the back to make sure it stays put.Sooo simple. :) You really could do it with one person, but two people make it go faster and keeps materials together and reduces trips up and down a ladder.  The metal on this is pretty heavy duty.  We bought the Hyloft hooks that work with this shelving, and they hold bikes and tools really well.  I can't foresee ever straining or maxing out this shelf with the usual stuff a household uses!  It's pretty heavy duty.  We have a bike carrying hitch on one, and it's like there's nothing on the shelf.  It will really hold what it says it will (and possibly then some.. there was a warning sticker inside that said they take no responsibility for their product if you put 400 lbs on the rack.  400lbs?? What on earth could you put on a shelf to exceed stability like that?  Lead bricks??)We love the design, the quality, and easy install so much, we're already looking at putting up more!!  We have our carport back from the clutter!! :DWill update if anything comes up as far as rust/quality issues down the road.

"Okay... Here goes.I wasn't going to get this tree up just yet, but other reviewers concerns got me to open the box and check it out.First off, like others recently, I got a box from ""Galvas - Noel"".  Apparently, somewhere from Italy (which makes sense, as the instructions are in Italian).  The model number that matches the online searches for Kurt S. Adler trees is a label put over whatever was originally written on the box.  Hmm.  Suspicious.  There was a shipping label on my box from a Kurt S. Adler location, however, so that made me feel a bit better.  It could very well be an arrangement between Adler and an Italian reseller, and when they went belly up, they had all these Italian boxed trees to get rid of.  Entirely possible, but I cant tell you for certain either way.  I will have photos of the box and contents up here right after this goes live.Okay... so we don't know if it's name brand.  I paid 99 dollars I think, and Kurt S Adler trees can go for hundreds.  Fair enough.  As long as it's a good tree with a replaceable metal stand, I'll be happy regardless.  That's all I really wanted, anyway.  So.. let's go into the tree:It has the metal stand, and It does seem to be the right style.  Maybe not so super bright green as my pc shows it, but the tips needles taper at the ends just like the photo.  And there are *a lot* of tips.  This tree is in 3 pieces, where the branches are attached and swing down.  It still needs some random fluffing of the tree, but it looks sooo much easier and fuller than my old artificial tree!  No more A-Z tier lettering!  Woohoo!Anyway, back to the tips.  On the top third, the top of the tree, there must be at least 50+ tips that are along the top that are not on branches.  Seriously... I quickly counted 20 and it just. kept. going.  So, minimum 50.  On the branches of said third, there were  at least 119 tips.  So.. for the top third, 150 tips+, conservatively.  Again, I did not want to drag everything out and set it up, but I checked the bottom most branch of the tree.  This thing has 20 tips.  On one branch.  And there were an awful lot of branches down there. If the rest of the tree is any indication of how full the top looks, I am gonna be one happy momma.  I can see this being legitimately 1000 tips as advertised.Last time I looked at Walmart, their cheapy trees were going for 70-90 dollars.  So, for 99 dollars, it was worth a shot.  So far, I am pleased, but I will update again once it's up and fulled (very likely with photos).UPDATE 11/26:  I just put up the tree to figure out where to place it before decorating.  WOW!  This is a very full artificial tree!  Usually, when you get a budget tree, you really have to work the limbs in all directions, and sadly, you wind up taking the ""wall"" side and pushing those limbs towards the front to make up the fullness.  This tree?  No way. I don't think you could even if you tried.  The space is awful tight.  This year, I don't think I will really have a wall, and I certainly wouldn't need one! I'm actually just a little worried on how difficult it will be to get the lights in!  LOL.  It is WAY full and beautiful, and I am really happy with this purchase.  The ONLY reason I don't give it a full 5 stars at this point is that we will never know if it really is, indeed, a true Kurt Adler tree as advertised.  But I am incredibly happy with how much I paid for this tree, and its quality.  It does seem a little darker in person than the photo (again, monitor settings vs indoor lighting and all), but it looks pretty spot on to the photo otherwise once up!Just an FYI... as far as it being 7ft... they're counting that very top limb.  You know the one.  So, I would say this is a *true* 6.5' tree, 7, possibly 7'2""+ once you get the star up.  So if you have 8' ceilings, you should be okay :)Update 12/4:  Still very happy :)  ULing a pic now of what it looks like fulled and with ornaments.  Also.. a pick of one of our heaviest ornaments, looped on two branches.  Pretty impressive.  It's at least 8oz of solid ceramic.  Tree has withstood small child and a very large dog trying to go through it.

"If taken symbolically, the title suggests old age and death. This film isn't really about those things. At 3 hours, 16 minutes, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I can't say I'm disappointed. With virtually no plot, ""Winter Sleep "" (kis uykusu) is an endless series of dialogue driven set pieces among a small group of characters with differing sensibilities. None of these scenes are boring, and the thought-provoking script maintains interest without over-kill. Subjects like self-deception, futility of poverty, hypocrisy, good intentions, pride, and one's relevance in the general scheme of life are addressed, some at great length.There's no musical score, except a little at the end. The setting in Cappadocia is beautifully photographed, though most everything happens indoors. I was curious to see the film that won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and I'm not disappointed. My only problem with the Blu I watched is that there are no chapter selections, and, with an episodic film this long, that could be an issue for some. Luckily, the subtitles are very easy to read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NBOMEQ8XQVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1T4ALA#wasThisHelpful","R2NBOMEQ8XQVI","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for an entertainment that didn't require too much thought, and opted to rent  Elvira's latest. It was all I expected, and, in some ways, more. The extras explain that the studio didn't want a sequel (to Elvira, Mistress of the Dark), so Ms Peterson and company decided to make an Indie film of their own. It was made for $1M, and filmed in Romania.Cassandra and director, Sam Irvin, wanted to to an homage/parody of their favorite director, Roger Corman, and the result is loads of smarmy fun. I can't dislike anything about it, knowing the trials of getting it produced, but even if I didn't, the film lives up to the Elvira legacy.The whole cast buys in to the silliness, especially Mary Jo Smith, as Zou Zou, her hapless servant. Gabi Andronache didn't speak a word of English, but was so good for the role, they dubbed his lines (the Steve Reeves/Hercules effect). Along for the ride is Richard O'Brien (Rocky Horror Picture Show). The silly Pit & Pendulum subplot is reason to give Elvira some trashy lines and insane banter.If you want to have some mindless fun and a few laughs, check it out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D88PEVMIWEBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DEUETU#wasThisHelpful","R2D88PEVMIWEBS","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent film on all counts. Good characters, great music, lots of tension among characters, lots of good and bad decisions.There's no question that Simmons deserved the Oscar, but Miles Teller met him on every level. Here we have two REAL characters, showing acting chops to be envied by the veterans. And, the direction of Damien Chazelle (autobiographical) is nothing short of magnificent, expanding on an earlier short film (also starring Simmons, included on the Blu).As a musician, I know the humility required, as well as the humiliation endured to make it in the biz. I know the drive and vision of the artist. It rarely survives in a satisfactory manner. Chazelle shows this honestly and brutally, and, in a Blu extra, explains why he got out of it and went into film.This is indeed a GREAT film, and will leave you exhausted, thanks in part to the Oscar-winning editing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UGF0BODZQXJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PT3AUYO#wasThisHelpful","R3UGF0BODZQXJI","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mr. Koontz felt it necessary to end his involvement with Odd Thomas, so, interestingly, he wrote it after his Odd Thomas film was released. I really enjoyed the film, and understand that certain elements of a book need to be modified in a film adaptation.In Saint Odd, it seemed that Dean felt a need to qualify certain elements of the film, left out of the original book, to make it coherent. That wasn't necessary. Saint Odd is a good story without the extras. As a culmination of Odd's travels, I thought more of the characters that figured importantly in his travels might all come together and create lots of fun. Mrs. Fischer, the most interesting character in ""Deeply Odd"" hardly figured in, and the history of Annamaria is never fully explained.Still, there's a lot of excitement. You KNOW Koontz loves this character, and Odd shows heroics more bravura than in the earlier episodes.Knowing this was the final Odd book led to the ultimate sensible end, and even if it was another 50 pages, I would've liked a little more resolve.  That's just me. I'll miss Odd a lot.Koontz almost had an Odd-type character in ""The City"". Maybe we'll see more of him, or the sweet, misunderstood guy in ""Innocence"".Regardless, Koontz is my go-to guy and I have EVERYTHING he's written that's available.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R549NRVJ8CM1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545877#wasThisHelpful","R549NRVJ8CM1D","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is no way that anyone will not enjoy this enigmatic film. I saw it when it came out 25 years ago, and thought it was cute, profound, touching and powerful. Now, at 66 years old, I'm in love with every one of those old dolls.What would you do if you were stuck with a bunch of strangers, your contemporaries, in a somewhat confined setting? Doesn't sound like something I'd encourage, but when you're in the middle of a glorious Canadian countryside, with nature all around you, and an uncertain outcome, it's prudent to overlook the immediate bleak situation and finally take a good look at how beautiful this world...and life...really is.Each of the girls reflects on their lives, all non-professional actresses, talking about real stuff, and discovering that the most important element in life is understanding, to listen and learn how completely alike we all are. It's not at all unrealistic, under the guidance of director Cynthia Scott, who searched at length to find the oddest assortment of women and throw them together. The result is pure magic, and, though memories can be sad, the saddest part is at the end when they're rescued (no spoiler) and may never see each other again, in this lifetime. The commeraderie has been solid, each woman having a memory of the situation that is lasting.The DVD I have, by Modern Day Classics, has some background info on the actresses involved. All champions, in my book, and I wish I could give Cissy a huge hug. Each woman in the cast has a very personal agenda, but it seems like Cissy had the hardest life, and is the most consistently cheerful. It's encouraging to know that unlike backgrounds can have so much in common.This is the ultimate feel good film for me. Ya gotta love 'em.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROQM3X9LZIMVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000296R6#wasThisHelpful","ROQM3X9LZIMVT","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have no end of admiration for Jean-Luc Godard, regarding his earlier career, but he seems, of late, trying to challenge the imagination and intelligence of his viewer. ""Filme Socialisme"" was a borefest, and I thought the sweet man was descending into some abyss of esoterica that would either challenge the most compulsive film freak to challenge his own sensibility, or to just love the man for whom he is.It was with trepidation that I watched ""Goodbye to Language"", a somewhat more sensible ""narrative"", but has been said in simpler ways. As the title implies, it's about man's incapability to successfully communicate. In this case, it's about a man and woman at odds with various relationships. The abysmal setting of the whole thing didn't work for me. Sorry. ""Blue Valentine"" said pretty much the same thing. Sad, but more powerful.The fact that it was in 3-D was interesting, though I didn't watch it that way. The Blu transfer was good.What remains is an experimental film that, quite simply, wasn't entertaining. The extras, including an extensive interview with with the maestro Godard. There was so much more to pay attention to than in ""Filme Socialisme"", where a 10 minute scene of a tied-up donkey got really tired, really fast...and so slow.I'm so bored lately when people say ""for the discriminating viewer"". That's crap.Film should enlighten, and entertain. Those days of esoteric thoughts, hippie-esque attitude, and thoughts of this-world or other, were explored ad nauseum in the 60's. Now, Godard wants to re-live that. It's simply not necessary.The interview with Godard was sweet but not so much enlightening.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RYS74LIT3OKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZLEN2M#wasThisHelpful","R1RYS74LIT3OKA","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Though the first was wrought with genius and focus, the second is still fun, with clever lines, and the unmistakeably endearing chemistry of Willis-Malkovich-Parker. Helen Mirren is back with kick-ass sass, and  I had just about as much fun as with the first.You could do a lot worse.

"Koontz is back ! After a somewhat dry spell, Koontz' last few books have been enjoyable and interesting. With ""The City"", he somewhat veers away from the fantasy element he's known for, and presents a sweet story about a young boy finding himself amidst the horrors of the real world. The story is told by the boy's middle-aged self, a reflection of life growing up in the 60's (something I know personally). Like in most Koontz stories, the good guys are really good and the bad guys are really bad, with little grey area in between. Young Jonah is a hero that I really cared about, and Mr. Koontz puts him through some not unbelievable ordeals, real life-changing, as well as life-affirming, experiences.I read some of the less favorable reviews, and I'm sure they expected outrageous behavior; most were either bored or disappointed. I was neither. I'm a slow sporadic reader, usually a few chapters before I go to sleep. Chapters were short, and Koontz' usual (often boring) revelations on life were more well-incorporated into Jonah's journey. One negative review referred to ""too many chapters""; obviously that reader never read James Patterson. With the Odd Thomas series at an end, I wouldn't mind reading more about Jonah. Koontz hit on some of my most important elements of life: family, friendship, love of music, and our never-ending fascination with this thing called LIFE, and the enigma of making the rightdecisions.I still haven't read ""Saint Odd"", but ""Deeply Odd"" was very good, and ""Innocence"" was excellent. Koontz, after a minor slump a few years ago, is back with aplomb, and I'm very glad my favorite ""Bard"" is back, letting me know there are still surprises in his style. I enjoyed ""The City"" very much. I didn't want it to end. It's almost a softer, gentler Dean, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZT71ADU1G0CE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545931#wasThisHelpful","R1ZT71ADU1G0CE","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wasn't sure what to expect, but this film is one of Nicholas Winding Refn's lighter efforts. There is humor in almost every scene, and Bronson, despite his violent tendencies, is presented as a guy who just wants to make light of his situation. Tom Hardy buffed up for the role, and his insight into the man is as good as it gets. He knows they expect the worst from him, so he'll strip naked, cover himself in grease, and create a scene, so the guards can't get a grip on him.Bronson never killed anyone, and, despite a botched robbery in his youth, can't be accused of anything but bi-polar stress. The mental institutions didn't want to deal with him, so he went back in the prison system. While paroled, he looked confused, and eventually did something stupid that put him back in prison. It's actually a simple story about a misunderstood person.The facts may have been sugar-coated, and I admit I don't really know the man, but Bronson, as presented in this film, it almost adorable. Tom Hardy, easily one of our finest actors, gives 100% into this guy, and I was completely taken in. The cunning and behavior were given purpose, and his humanity is left intact. In extras, Hardy had met with Bronson, and said he'd present an honest character.Regardless of any factual accuracy, Refn's film is actually delightful and intelligent, maybe as seen through the eyes of Bronson, as he sees himself. Despite how others watch this film, it's not the downer you might expect. A very courageous, varied and unflinching performance from Tom Hardy. I'm VERY impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26Y0KV0HRA88R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XTXFU8#wasThisHelpful","R26Y0KV0HRA88R","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my 5 favorite films of all time, I gave up my 3-disc DVD boxed set to get this concise version. I'm not disappointed. Disc 1 has all 3 versions, and Disc 2 has all the same extras as the 30th Anniv version.Roy Neary's going into the ship in the '80 version was a studio decision that Spielberg was dead-set against, but his clout in Hollywood wasn't as strong back then. The studio executives thought it's what the audience wanted. His ""Director's Cut"" is the REAL Spielberg version. I must agree; the extra effects in the '80 version diminished the awe of Neary's adventure, a sort of anti-climax.It's truly an awesome film achievement, nominated for 8 Oscars, but not Best Picture. I have no end of admiration for Spielberg's film, in any of its incarnations. Dreyfuss won the Best Actor Oscar, deservedly, for ""The Goodbye Girl"" in '77, but I'm sure the strength of his performance in ""Close Encounters"" was considered.  A class act, and a courageous performance, in both cases.I love this film, on so many levels.

"Koontz had a slow period a few years ago, and some focus was missing. ""Odd Apocalypse"" was horribly unfocused, and I was concerned, because I like Koontz, in general, and have always been a fan. I didn't give up on him, as some may have.""Odd Interlude"" was a sort of a way for Koontz to get back to the Odd we've come to love and admire. Koontz' humor is probably cute to some, but is often annoying to me. ""Apocalypse"" had very little humor, as I recall, but ""Interlude"" had the relaxed Odd I enjoy, nerdy and sincere.It was  short, fun and reasonably logical. That's the Odd I enjoy. Government experiments gone wrong have gotten tired, in the realm of recent prose.

"I'm not sure why I like this film so much. Macon Blair plays a very complicated character, a bit schitzoid but with an idea.  The idea is slow-moving but very intense, and very well played out. I can't say I was bored for a minute.""Blue Ruin"" was lauded at a lot of Indie competitions, which put it on my radar. I was impressed at great performances from all involved. No big time actors, but all impressive. (Eve Plumb from ""The Brady Bunch"" has a small role, but not as sweet).The film is filled with flawed people, some evil and some not-so-much, but all compelling. It's not a happy film, but there's a side of life that is there, and most choose to ignore. It's an element of life that shouldn't happen, but could.Hard to describe, but I was never bored for a minute, mostly because of Blair's totally involved performance. He's no leading man-type, neither handsome or with any discernable personality, but driven with passion and determination. Most impressive.I liked this character study very much.

"I'd heard it was a great film, and I had to find out why it was ignored at Oscar time. I don't understand.""Life Itself"" is a film about an icon of film. The man is passionate, and the doc lets you know about his beginnings, failures, achievements,and the road to success, and ultimate medical trials that led to his demise. It's also an unflinching love story, one of ultimate devotion and respect.I grew up watching Siskel & Ebert on TV, and their bickering was always entertaining. ""Life Itself"" lets you know how they initially disliked each other, didn't wanna do the show, but, as time went by, developed a profound respect and love. I never would've known how much fun ""Night of the Comet"" was if they didn't give it ""2 Thumbs Up"".Siskel & Ebert are truly an American institution. The film is terrific, and thoroughly enjoyable.

"It wasn't until ""St Vincent"" that I had any admiration for Bill Murray. His smarmy, snotty attitude toward people at large has almost always annoyed me. He didn't try to copy FDR, which is to his credit, but an essential part of the character was missing in this film. A bold casting choice, indeed.The character of this enigmatic American icon was displayed as bland and downright uninteresting.Laura Linney is one of my favorite actresses, having proved herself repeatedly, but she's not given a lot to work with, here. It's a vapid and boring character, and even Ms Linney's great gifts couldn't transcend the script and her character as written.The whole idea of this film screams comedy, but there's little. If it wasn't for the appearance of the King of England and his wife, the film would've been a bust. Indeed, Olivia Colman as Elizabeth, was the most energetic character, though not written as such. THAT is acting.There was too much attention made to caricature and period detail, there was no room for true creativity among the cast members; writing was pedestrian.

"This is really a compelling film from the beginning, showing the love and friendship, but situations result in the temporary separation of these two men who are devoted. The fact that they are totally devoted is never in doubt.  John Lithgow is always endearing, but it's Alfred Molina who really has the lead role. They are wonderful and completely believable. The very reliable Marisa Tomei is on hand, as well as a terrific ensemble cast,It really tells the story of moving in with people who don't really want you around.This film was never labeled as a comedy, and despite some humorous moments regarding simple human foibles, it is a sad, melancholic tale of an older couple in love, faced with a family dilemma. I haven't seen a film lately about so many loving characters that was so depressing.The sweetness of Lithgow and Molina shines through, but I didn't get enough of that.

"Is this just another graphic novel put to film? Not at all!  Certainly, the premise is somewhat absurd, but so are most sci-fi plots. Director Bong Joon Ho has constructed a methodical, well-layered plot suggesting that forgotten people can make a difference. Unfortunately, violence ensues.The surprise here is that the ensemble cast, good writing and high production values create a world of its own, claustrophobic and uncomfortable, in a seemingly impossible situation.The acting is above average, with Chris Evans and Jamie Bell providing the good guy buddies who attempt to find their redemption, with generous support from Octavia Spencer, John Hurt, Ko Asing, Song Kang Ho and an impressive ensemble of ""heroes"" who will claim their place in the new world. Ed Harris has been somewhat type-cast as a crazy person, and it almost works here.The setting is bleak, yet has some of the best Art Direction/Production Design I've seen in a long time.First and foremost, this film is worthy for the performance of Tilda Swinton, a bizarre combination of Nurse Ratched and Josef Goebbels, simply amazing. Her moments on the screen are priceless.It looks stunning on Blu, and I'm happy to have it in my collection. Suspend disbelief, and let yourself be taken in. The last scene says it all, regarding man's place on this planet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12P38ODAASZN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7D824O#wasThisHelpful","R12P38ODAASZN6","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"William Castle's first directorial effort scared the pants off me when I first saw it. We've come a long way since then.Castle always had his gimmicks, and his films were mostly satisfying. He's left a legacy of horror that is to be commended: House on Haunted Hill, The Tingler, Homicidal, Mr. Sardonicus, Strait-Jacket, etc.""Macabre"" hasn't survived the test of time, and it's suspense element has been decimated by subsequent films. Still, the DVD transfer isn't bad, and the story holds some interest. What was missing were the scares. Maybe this would be a good film to show kids on Hallowe'en. It's not offensive, and is certainly milder than most of what's on TV today. Mr. Castle certainly knows how to create suspense, and most of that comes from his regular use of Von Dexter's always satisfying and creepy music score.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WF8PSYP647O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047DKLE6#wasThisHelpful","R1WF8PSYP647O4","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always been fascinated by China, its landscapes, history and culture. A Westerner like myself can only imagine the wealth of knowledge and experience the Pyle brothers were privy to. And here it is, a documented trip to the most remote parts of this enigmatic country, rife with regular people like you and me, and happily living a life of their choice.It was gratifying to see the remote areas, and to know that hospitality is so generous. Kids will be kids, and they are no different there than here. Seeing the end of the Great Wall was fascinating, and the trip into Manchuria (and the North Korean border) might've been more substantial, but bad weather prevented that. If you want to see Heavenly Lake, you'll have to go online.It looks like it was possibly filmed as a TV reality show, but, regardless, it was as riveting as any ""home video"" adventure I've seen. The Pyle brothers are to be commended on many levels, mostly for the courage they displayed as they endured some pretty rough set-backs. Anyone could say they did such a trip, but having it documented in such a no-frills way was courageous and impressive.I just can't say enough about how much I truly appreciated the endeavor.  Anyone remotely interested in the mystery of China, the REAL China, would be hard pressed to find a more thorough, fascinating and detailed account. BRAVO to all involved!

"Perhaps a half-star more than it deserves, but I'm thrilled that someone finally put a face to Odd Thomas. I've been a fan of the book series since its inception,  and director/screenwriter Stephen Sommers has presented a comprehensive version of Odd's story, as complete as it needs to be to create a scenario that is concise and literate.I can't stand it when people compare books to their movies, and I won't do that here. I prefer to review the film achievement, and I'm pleased with the result. Anton Yelchin is a fine Odd, lovable and, well, odd, and endearing to all who know him. Willem Dafoe seems to show up a lot lately, and he handles the role of the Police Chief well.  In a supporting role, the very fine English actress, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, plays the role with a very good American accent. Patton Oswalt has high billing, but it's really a cameo.The very important role of Stormy Llewellyn is played by newcomer Addison Timlin, which could make or break the whole story. More could have been made of her chemistry with Yelchin, but, in the end, it all works out fine.I'm hoping this will be the beginning of a film series. Oddie is a great character. His adventures are interesting and never dull.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROI98Q8XV8S2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHYF59S#wasThisHelpful","ROI98Q8XV8S2J","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a die-hard fan of Dean Koontz, and especially like the Odd Thomas series. However, I wasn't impressed with ""Odd Apocalype""; I thought it was unfocused and rambling. His other writing wasn't impressing me very much, either, during that period. After reading the excellent ""Innocence"", I thought I'd give Koontz and Odd Thomas another try.""Deeply Odd"" is very good, which makes me think my go-to guy Dean is solidly back on track. Certainly, Oddie is unusual and manages to get himself into situations that seem insurmountable, and this one is no different. The addition of enigmatic Edie Fischer adds a whole new realm of interest (and entertainment), a character I'm sure anyone would love to meet. As in Apocalypse, Odd discovers an alternate plane of being, and uses his wiles to maneuver it.There's the expected supernatural experiences, ghost friends (including the requisite Koontz dog), and lots of really bad guys and other various sociopaths, and Oddie goes about his quest with customary trepidation, and lots of encouragement from Mrs. Fischer. All in all, there's more flow and focus and I'm really glad I read ""Deeply Odd"". It's a fun ride, and it didn't end abruptly, which is a criticism, of late, of Mr. Koontz.It's all here. Picture Betty White as Edie Fischer, and you'll have a ball.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GT68TERFTYEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DIL3UUU#wasThisHelpful","R2GT68TERFTYEL","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There isn't much that offends me, except for the way our country has abandoned the promises of our Constitution. I'm a product of the 60's cultural revolution, and there isn't a lot I haven't seen nor read. The arts are to be respected for the intentions of the artist, subjective for sure.Lars von Trier has presented some brilliant work, most brilliant must be ""Breaking the Waves"", introducing the world to the brilliant Emily Watson. He did ""Dancer in the Dark"", featuring an impeccable performance from first-timer Bjork. He did ""Dogville"", featuring the magnificent Nicole Kidman, reminding us why she's an A-List actress. Then he did his ""Depression"" trilogy (where Kirsten Dunst won Best Actress at Cannes for ""Melancholia""). The trilogy featured Charlotte Gainsbourg in all three, the others being ""Antichrist"" and ""Nymphomaniac"".Lars von Trier LOVES actresses, and never fails to bring out their best.""Nymphomaniac"" is a character study, not unlike a discussion between best friends, with flashbacks. Charlotte Gainsbourg, as Joe, goes through a complete history of who she is and how she got there. It is, literally, a complete performance, wrought with passion, sincerity and unabashed honesty (which may be why awards committees have ignored the film). Stellan Skarsgaard is the older guy who hears her story, with compassion and genuine concern, a scholar with issues of his own.The version I watched has Part I at 2 hours and Part II at 2 hours, 4 minutes. I understand a longer version is coming available, but, in my experience, there is not a wasted moment. It's riveting at all times. It's episodic, and each episode makes its mark with profundity and plot, edited in a way that kept things flowing quickly. I wasn't bored for a minute, unlike the previous two films, though Gainsbourg shines in all three.Von Trier has a definite feel for the subject matter, sympathetic without sugar-coating the more ""honest"" flow of events. There are courageous performances from all, eschewing any preconceived personae: Shia LeBoeuf, Christian Slater, Uma Thurman and Jamie Bell, as well as powerful appearances from Willem Dafoe and Udo Kier.  Much admiration for Stacy Martin as Joe's younger self, setting the scene for a scenario that will blow you away. I have no end of admiration for Von Trier's film. He's not a happy man, but, instead of being depressed all the time, he's put his life on film, often in ways that baffle and confuse and create fear, but it's who he is.Other directors do this in an artsy-fartsy way that challenges the viewer to guess what's going on. Von Trier's done that a few times. But ""Nymphomaniac"" is a straight-forward narrative that had me intrigued at every moment.The sex scenes were performed mostly by porn actors, and in the long run, it's not so much about the sex act as it is about how it's overcome our attitude toward love, trust and understanding.Despite all the bad press, etc., there are a few others who saw the film in a positive light. Von Trier finished his trilogy and shoved it in your face. I wish him well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D0QQDTGWGDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVIYMG2#wasThisHelpful","R1D0QQDTGWGDI","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was worried that my old reliable fave, Mr. Koontz, was in a rut. I have every book available that he's written, and he's had his winners (Shadowfires, Dark Rivers of the Heart) and his clunkers (Cold Fire, Dragon Tears). Well, I couldn't be more pleased than to announce that my go-to guy is back on track with a true winner, Innocence. Rarely has he written a character with so much humanity, compassion and dignity as Addison, who, like Odd Thomas, reluctantly finds himself in a joint effort to save the world. The difference is that Addison, due to unfortunate circumstances, has been somewhat of a hermit for most of his 26 years, and facing the world at large is daunting. He knows only too well that evil exists, and has spent his life avoiding it. Along comes the seemingly carefree (and very independent) Gwyneth, who has her own demons to cope with, and a bond is formed.Koontz often goes off on philosophical tangents that neither add to nor enhance the goings-on, but he keeps that at a minimum here, and has created a compelling and fast read. I'm a very sporadic reader (usually a chapter a night before I sleep), but I had trouble putting the book down.  Good guys are very good, and bad guys are very bad, but there are a few characters that keep you guessing on which side they fall.

"Gregg Araki is always interesting, and most of the time I didn't know where he was going with ""Kaboom"". At times I thought he was writing it as he went, but then I'd notice references to previous stuff and before I knew it, I was totally engrossed in the goings-on. I won't deny that there are certain continuity issues, but nothing major enough to keep me from liking the loveable character of Smith (Dekker), and the journey he's destined to take. Smith's character is written so well, slowly coming to terms with the events of his life, and relying so much on the support of his friends (and those, on him). It's a tight circle, and there are twists and turns and frustrations, culminating in the only logical ending.I enjoyed ""Kaboom"" on many levels. I was never bored for a minute. I knew Araki would involve me in his roller coaster ride, and I wasn't disappointed. As weird as it got, the straight-forward enthusiasm of the fine cast never let up, and I was pleased with the film as a whole. I haven't had so much fun in a long time.

"I saw the film because of it's award recognition, but I can't say I enjoyed it. The claim that ""art is subjective"" certainly applies here, as it does in other films that I absolutely adored (Alain Resnais' ""Last Year at Marienbad"", John Frankenheimer's ""Seconds"" and others). I was younger then, and was less subjective about what entertained me.I think the hallucinogenic approach to the goings-on left me quite flat, though Amy Seimetz' unflinching performance was nothing short of brilliant.The Blu-Ray I watched offered no extras or commentary that may have shed light on Shane Carruth's vision or purpose. That was disappointing. Maybe I'm jaded in my old age (65), but I had no end of enjoyment and admiration for ""Cloud Atlas"".Without being cruel, someone tell me what I missed.

"I, too, was given a free copy in exchange for an honest review. I told Mr. Dalton outright that I wasn't a sci-fi fan, but he talked me into reading it. I did. I also decided to read the other reviews, and agree with some, not others.Some of the advanced terminology left me empty and a bit lost. Some of the forced humor sounded ""cutesy"", especially some of Ranyk's outbursts (nonetheless, enjoyable). Why couldn't he just keep his big mouth shut!?It's a popular ploy of authors to build up a bunch of suspense, and then end a book with no resolve, so that others will buy the next one in the series. Of course I wanted to know what happened to the characters, and I guess I'll just have to wait.One thing that was annoying was that the 3 main aliens (Ranyk, Sckiik, Dr Perinath) weren't described very well, so it was difficult to envision them in my mind. Exoskeleton? Were they insects? I could only envision Dr Perinath as some incarnation of Maleficent with spikes and scales. Those characters are important, but I had trouble 'seeing' them.Dr Perinath came off as manipulative and evil, and then I started seeing good, solid qualities about her that made me genuinely care.No one else mentioned Sean, who I thought was a terrific character and quite likeable. I think my favorite character was the misunderstood, abused and much-maligned Gill. Why did Sckiik and Ranyk hate him so much? At the end of ""Houses of Common"", he came off to me as being a hero. He was so bullied, and it made me like him even more.To Mr Dalton's credit, I was given a scenario of great suspense and intrigue, and after 370 pages of ""set-up"", I'm ready for more. As complicated as it is, I didn't have too much trouble following the basic narrative, and I thank Mr Dalton for that. Good job.

"A magnificent new world is, once again, created by magician Wes Anderson. This film had me from the start, with Anderson's usual display of controlled insanity, and this MUST be his best achievement. Anderson has his own regular crew of stock performers (Murray, Balaban, Schwartzman, Swinton, Keitel, etc). Add to this the lead character, Gustav, impeccably and totally portrayed by the masterful Ralph Fiennes. I haven't been as impressed in many years.Special mention should go to Tony Revolori, perhaps the best straight-man, while holding his own.Anderson's manic narrative is never slow, and some of his stock characteristics are ever-present. I haven't had such a good ride in years, not to mention the downhill sled-ride.Brilliantly written, edited and executed, not to mention excellent tongue-in-cheek performances from all of the supporting characters, this is my favorite film of the last few years.Unfortunately, it was released too early in the year to be given serious Oscar contention, but, awards aside, I can't recommend this film highly enough.

"This is a review about the achievement of Steven Soderbergh and excellent acting from the ensemble cast.Liberace was a narcissistic and manipulative celebrity who used (and paid) everyone around him to satisfy his own extreme indulgences. Scott Thorson was as much to blame for his own selfish indulgences, though he may be forgiven due to Liberace's promises of success and grandeur.Who's to blame, here?BEHIND THE CANDELABRA is based on Thorson's own account of the events, a somewhat sugar-coated narrative of a poor guy trying to find a level of success in a world of deception.Sexuality aside, this is a story about a relationship founded on manipulation and promises...many promises. Liberace wanted Scott to look like him, convincing him to have plastic surgery. This alone makes me think Thorson was more involved in the relationship than may be thought.There aren't many things about Thorson that are pretty (besides him) and his big-money foray into drugs is well explored.Were the drugs the reason why Liberace dumped him? Was Liberace tired of him, looking for ""fresh meat""?All of these events are well portrayed in BEHIND THE CANDELABRA, as realized by screenwriter Richard LaGravanese, and very well presented by Steven Soderbergh. It's pretty much of a no-holds-barred expose, with two unflinching performances from Michael Douglas and, especially, Matt Damon. Douglas handles the role well, free of too-much caricature but with most of the flamboyance that WAS Liberace. Damon was the best, with a lot more change of attitude and character as the film progressed. Douglas won all the acting awards, but Damon had a tougher (and bigger) role.There's no nudity, and a lot of reference to gay sex preferences, but at the end, it's the story about a serious relationship that wasn't meant to be. Whose fault? Decide for yourself.Excellent support from Scott Bakula, Dan Aykroyd, Rob Lowe and (unrecognizable) Debbie Reynolds added to the sincerity of the narrative being presented, and the sets and costumes were all you would expect from a film about the excessive Liberace.Not for the prudish, I would recommend this film to anyone who thinks they might make it in Hollywood, unscathed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q9EE8UVPCJRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2CYV9E#wasThisHelpful","R3Q9EE8UVPCJRY","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Excellent suspense, thanks to Andy Muschietti, a disciple of del Toro. It's a great first directorial effort. Jessica Chastain is the hero, almost unrecognizable in her black wig, but as full of vim and vinegar as ever. Nicolai Coster-Waldau is beautiful as ever in a dual role.

"Ship of Fools was the reason I bought this; the Oscar-nommed cinematography (black & white) is stunning on Blu. It's a great film,with terrific acting and great direction by the master, Stanley Kramer. Nommed for Best Picture and many others.Vivien Leigh's last great role.Lilith was OK, an early performance from a young Warren Beatty and Jean Seberg. Not very interesting or exciting; Robert Rossen directed, but missed something essential to make it as riveting as it might be. Beatty tries, but is miscast.

There was something wrong, maybe with the script, or direction, but I simply wasn't riveted; I wanted to be blown away, but it didn't happen.

"The horrific murders of 500K Indonesian citizens is well examined in this very upsetting doc, which uses interviews with the murderers. The only reason these people aren't in front of war trials, is because those murderers won in the takeover of the government. They were given free reign over the developments, and the depiction is outrageous, cruel and unsettling.These moments must be exposed, and hopefully cruelty and the complete absence of humanity will be brought to surface.Indonesia is a very Islamic country. None of the murders were due to religious reasons. The power given the militants was simply out of control.

"I don't know if BluRay adds to the simplicity of the profound film achievement, but I'm so glad to have it in my collection.Brilliant acting, superb editing, carrying the multi-plot devices that Altman is known for, and a somewhat improvised screenplay by Joan Tewkesbury, all add up to one of my absolute favorite films. If I had to pick favorite actors, they would be Keenan Wynn and Barbara Harris. It's also notable that Keith Carradine's Oscar-winning song, ""I'm Easy"", plays an integral part of the drama. Most Oscar songs are simply ""thrown in"", or played over credits. Carradine's song has a tension and power that most don't realize.The beauty and poetry of Altman's direction is how he can find dozens of characters and, somehow, make all their lives interact. He brought this idea to perfection in the brilliant ""Short Cuts"".I LOVE this film, and the great Altman.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G8SB0BNL7AKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F98FOI6#wasThisHelpful","R2G8SB0BNL7AKG","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Upon the demise of the wonderful Robin Williams, I realized I have very few of his films. Of course, I have ""Garp"", but it's a horribly edited version of the original, which I saw in the theater; there's no ""real"" version of it on DVD. I ordered this Blu, and am completely happy with it. The insanity of it all looks terrific on Blu, and I'm amazed it didn't get an Oscar nom for Visual Effects.Kirsten Dunst was fresh off her auspicious debut in ""Interview with a Vampire"", and is a natural. All of the kid actors are good. Jonathan Hyde is also impressive, playing a dual role (a psychological subtext).I always thought director Joe Johnston was under-rated. He handles the very complicated material in a way clear enough to be easily understood. I recommend this film, to show how Williams brilliantly combined manic and serious in a most enjoyable entertainment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWXD8FJ4769D5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VRK3ZU#wasThisHelpful","RWXD8FJ4769D5","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a remarkable film from Kenneth Branagh (star and director). He was married to Emma Thompson at the time, and the chemistry was terrific. I bought it because I remembered the (unbilled) performance of the late, great Robin Williams. Excellent support also from Andy Garcia and Derek Jacobi.It's one of the most complicated, intricate plots I can recall, and all is handled beautifully thanks to fine direction and excellent editing.There are red herrings, plot switches, flashbacks, and gender-bending, all kept together by Branagh, creating an exciting and riveting narrative. It's also the first (as I recall) serious dramatic performance from Robin Williams, perhaps channeling inner demons, and it's a knock-out performance, unbilled when released.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S864MWQJUJYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6305882525#wasThisHelpful","R1S864MWQJUJYQ","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a huge fan of 50's schlock horror. In the 60's the schlock was a little over the top, and by 1970, that schlock I loved so much really went down the toilet. The Drive-Ins were hurting, and some last ditch efforts to revive them didn't help with films like ""Carnival of Blood"", one of those sad trashy exploitation films that signaled the end of an era. The whole idea isn't new, and has been done so much better. The photography is tacky, and the acting is more laughable than anything from the 50's. A slight moment of inspiration comes from Earl Edgerton, in a flashback scene. Memorable is the performance of Bert Young, an Oscar nominee for ""Rocky"" in '76, after he changed his name from John Harris, probably to remove himself from any connection to this overly dismal attempt at entertainment. No surprise that director Leonard Kirtman never made it; Ed Wood had a lot more style.The reason I bought the collection is for ""The Undertaker and his Pals"", a silly, campy film I remember seeing at the drive-in. It's tacky, yet somewhat clever, and lots of fun. Director T.L.P. Swicegood seemed to have more sense of direction regarding the flow of events. It's apparent that all involved were having nothing but fun. The DVD transfer was also far superior to that of ""Carnival"" (though, if I did drugs, ""Carnival"" might've looked ""cool""). The bottom line is that ""Carnival"" was boring, and ""Undertaker"" held my interest.The price is right, and I'm glad to have ""Undertaker"" in my collection.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4AAEF7HIXK2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P6R9DK#wasThisHelpful","R4AAEF7HIXK2S","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was amazed at how important this film really is. Body-image seems to be so prevalent today, and plastic surgeons are cleaning up. Patrick Moote has laid it all out, courageously, to discover the answer to the age-old question, ""Does Size Matter?"". There's no clear answer, though any thinking human would know that substance of a person is most important.The subject is one that, I'm sure, is of interest to many men, to beware of quick-fixes, pills, and witch doctors...as well as implants. This info is equally important to women. It's a $5-billion industry preying on innocent, good people. Patrick Moote compares his penis to a female with an A-cup. He goes all-out to find out how he can correct this, and travels the world to get opinions. Some of it's amusing, other parts are actually frightening.The DVD is wonderful, and the extras are great, especially an interview with Dr. Dunas, and an extended interview with Dan Savage.Anyone with a body-image problem should see this film. It's straight-forward, honest and to the point. Little is left to speculation, with no nudity. A few graphic scenes, but most are blurred out. The film is presented with honesty, sincerity and great information about being who you are, and not whom you think you might be. Just be yourself, and be the best person you can with what you have.Mr. Moote is endearing, and quite adorable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP8SLZ4000EA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F7K5Q3O#wasThisHelpful","RP8SLZ4000EA1","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a huge fan of science fiction, but Mark Henrikson's ""Origins"" is so original and well-written, that I couldn't put it down. As outrageous as the plot may seem, Henrikson creates believable characters doing unbelievable things. What if aliens built the pyramids? And how did they do it? With that age-old premise, Henrikson runs with it. His interpretation of the plagues of Egypt and the role Moses played are also explored in a very entertaining, non-Biblical way. This is the first of a series, and tied up just enough loose ends to leave the reader craving more.

"I'm a fan of Friedkin's groundbreaking film ""Cruising"", and was satisfied with the way the film was presented, as a good murder mystery. Apparently, the ever-adventurous Franco and Mathews thought that the 40 missing minutes would be of interest for those looking for sensationalistic gratification, and thought, even more, that anyone would really care.  What the producers attempted to do is quite lost in its resolution. Those 40 minutes may have been segments, bits and pieces, that Friedkin left out to secure an ""R"" ratings.Franco and Mathews decided it was all porn stuff, and created a documentary about, well, porn.The leather bar scenes in Friedkin's film were as complete as they needed to be. This film was a boring attempt to recreate something that may or may not have happened.

"This is a ground-breaking, multi-Oscared film that is fun and innovative. Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump) somewhat perfected the art of animation mixed with live action, though ""Mary Poppins"" did it as well (20+ years earlier). Having seen it's initial release, I thought I should have this in my collection. Certainly, it's clever and cute and fun, and Bob Hoskins' performance is outstanding, but if it was a live action film, it would only be mildly amusing. There are some clever lines, and Kathleen Turner's Jessica Rabbit is spot-on, but it didn't blow me away.I know I'm in a minority in my opinion.

"So many documentaries are serious and give feelings of dread and angst, and then there's this uplifting story about undiscovered wonderfulness.  I was immediately taken by the pace and presentation, wondering what would happen next. I didn't have to wait too long. The presentation, led by interviews with family, created an enigma right to the actual introduction to the wonderful Rodriguez.Is America the land of opportunity? According to Rodriguez, it is. He was led to all kinds of promises, only to be let down by the powers that be. He was never fazed by it, rather used his talents to create a life of peace and happiness.What the big-shots didn't count on, was the overseas market, and Rodriguez was an idol in South Africa (long thought deceased). Imagine HIS surpriseThe rest is history. A wonderful and terrific story about an American hero, after the fact.This is, quite simply, one of the great feel-good movies I've seen in a while.

"I was given a preview copy to review, so I'll not mention the spelling and grammatical errors; hopefully, this was corrected in subsequent editions. Mr. Garza has a writing style that is quite attractive and committed, with descriptions that were clear and exciting. It's apparent that he was writing with purpose, and loved his material.The book is only 200 pages, and a quick read, broken down into 3 sections. The first (and longest) section sets the scene and introduces us to John, Angela and little Alex.  I was hoping for a little more background as to why John loved Angela so much, as she came off (to me) as an unstable and totally unpleasant harpee, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. At the same time, John came off as an insecure, subservient (read: whipped) wimp who didn't seem to have an original thought of his own. Those first 100 pages got a little tired after a while, and John was annoying me quite a bit.The second section suddenly has John stuck in the city, trying to get back home. Suddenly, he's Rambo, showing clever heroics and meeting some almost cool characters (though there was no real development for these characters). I was hoping he would become someone to admire, but, unfortunately, he went back home and succumbed to the domineering Angela (the third section).As I said, Mr Garza's writing style is intense and interesting, and the plot was a little more original than most zombie stories, but it was hard for me to care about any of our lead characters. By the end, I really didn't care what happened to them, though the twist ending was interesting.I will read more by Mr Garza. I'm sorry to say that this effort was lacking in character continuity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31N85RQSK6BM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1925047199#wasThisHelpful","R31N85RQSK6BM3","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a huge baseball fan, but this coming-of-age tale about a boy and his dreams is so loaded with passion and drive (and a little pathos), that I can't imagine anyone emerging from this experience unmoved. Seen through the eyes of a little Hispanic kid, he confronts issues like racism, bullying, rivalry, the importance of family, and, most of all, a kid's natural curiosity revolving around his hero and idol, who happens to live across the street. Our kid's no slouch, and he's smart enough to let the ugly attitudes of the privileged roll off his back, as he focuses on his one passion: baseball. Mr. Hazelgrove well examines the resiliency of kids, and the necessity to focus on what's important, as Ricky learns his life lessons. Excellent characters throughout, from his feisty and independent mom to his baseball idol, now a grizzled and cranky old man. I won't give any more away than that, but I recommend this book highly. It's an easy and fast read, loaded with humanity and an innate joy of life. Another great achievement from the talented Mr. Hazelgrove.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HWU7XIFWWNOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938467590#wasThisHelpful","R2HWU7XIFWWNOA","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr McNally had a good thing going, from the first page. Interesting (and very original) turns of events made my think that I'd be introduced to a ""new"" neo-folklore, as the first readers of Frankenstein or Dracula were introduced to. The folklore is what I craved and was quite riveted by the turns of events...and then Mr McNally copped out. Aliens and military conspiracies? Really? Aw c'mon...After a satisfying build-up, I was so very disappointed that McNally took the ""easy way out"". The evil spirits were in place, the oddities were groundwork for all kinds of ancient curses (or whatever)and McNally had a wealth of options to keep this tale in the realm of a new folklore. Instead, he took the easy way out, and opted for a tidy, albeit trite, solution. It might've even been a good old-fashioned ghost story.I also got this book in the mail for free, seeking a positive review, and that's why I'm giving it one more star than it deserves. I liked the characters, and wasn't upset when major characters were killed off early on (as others were), thinking it would all resolve as interesting as everything that went before. Descriptions of the bleak surroundings were well conveyed, there were likeable characters and the book had just about everything going for it, til the last few chapters.The chapters were short, making it a fast read for a sporadic reader like myself. I finished it in record time (for me). Mr McNally has it in him to create ghostly worlds, and his grasp of the supernatural seemed so natural and so very original. After so much good stuff, I was sorely disappointed that he didn't show more originality at the end that was so prevalent at the outset.McNally is a good writer, and I will watch for his next endeavor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26DWT56XO28Q1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZDVZLI#wasThisHelpful","R26DWT56XO28Q1","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise sounded interesting, and after I started reading, it was difficult to put down. Certainly, this book may be guilty of TOO much plot, but Mr Krisch methodically and carefully laced together all the seemingly loose ends to create a cohesive whole. I admit I had trouble remembering the many characters, and trying to keep them straight (mostly the random townspeople) but the good guys were well portrayed (I would've liked more of Greta).Without giving too much away, the juxtaposition of the Underground Railway and the Great Depression showed many parallels, a history lesson of sorts, about man's inhumanity toward man. I enjoy the supernatural elements a lot, and it was enhanced by the profound displays of good vs evil. The unpleasantness of it all was also well explored, which got a bit disconcerting at times, especially when innocents met their demise.Mr Krisch has a style that is straight-forward and not the least bit pretentious. Other reviewers complained that it was too brutal, but I thought of it more as being realistic; nothing was sugar-coated. Those were cruel and desperate times, and Mr Krisch had a terrific handle on the subject matter being presented, not to mention the very original central plot regarding the underground. I was riveted from beginning to end. I will definitely be reading more by Glen Krisch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJYN2OI7JO848/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481082833#wasThisHelpful","RJYN2OI7JO848","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mario van Peebles is to be commended for making this tribute to his father, Melvin, a pioneer who tried to get away from the Balxploitation trend of the 70's. I never saw the film in question, but Mario did a fine job of exploring the obstacles of producing an Indie film with a new idea. Melvin attempted to give the Black man dignity, after all the craziness of the period, and the Sweetback film was difficult to get out there. This film is fun and frustrating and funny...Mario did a great job. Melvin's film is a cult classic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB41HZD750UDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002JZT50#wasThisHelpful","RB41HZD750UDS","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit, Heneke likes to create confusing scenarios that keep the viewer watching, and then he doesn't deliver. Thank God, it wasn't longer than it was. It's a lovely relationship, but doesn't really show the power of their love, which, after all, is right there in the title. Emmanuelle Riva won awards for her performance, probably because she's old, has a fairly good body of film performances, was nude at 86 and puked on herself. Jean-Louis Trintignant has even a more impressive film resume (at least in the US), and carried the entire film. Everything was from his viewpoint. He was wonderful, but not recognized by any critics' groups, even a nomination!You would think a film about old piano teachers would have some music, but there was none besides some lovely Schubert moments. Isabelle Huppert, the gorgeous sex siren of yore (Death Becomes Her) is very fine as the concerned daughter.Certainly, the husband's descent into madness, as Haneke interprets, wasn't as complete as it might've been. His final decision didn't make a lot of sense. He had love all around him, from family and friends.

"I've seen lots of films about the Jewish Holocaust, and am always in awe regarding the profound display of man's inhumanity toward man. I just now watched James Moll's 1998 Oscar Winner, and was quite taken by the individual witnesses' accounts of their own personal tragedies. This is one of the best, quite personal and riveting. It centers on the plight of Hungarian Jews, which hasn't been focused in previous docs.I read a few 1-star reviews by those who deny the Holocaust, and I'm saddened by the fact that, with all the physical evidence, such an idea could perpetuate itself. ""The Last Days"" is definitely worth a look.

"I wasn't sure what to expect, but Adam Scott carries this film to unexplored heights. I haven't seen a display of devastated love so completely realized. I've been there. Mr Scott is one of those guys who annoys mercilessly, worse than a mosquito, yet has levels of intensity that settle into mild comfort and, eventually, genuine normalness, becoming loveable. The script is so well layered that you don't know whether to laugh, cry or cringe. There are only really 4 characters, and all are good; Brittany Snow, Alex Frost are wonderful, and J.K. Simmons is outstanding as the father, endearing, with issues of his own.It isn't hard to get into this film, as it's so well written, acted and edited. The somewhat generous DVD extras will entertain. Check it out. A bittersweet love story, that has no answers...just like life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRMX5W5ICHWV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZSUET2#wasThisHelpful","RRMX5W5ICHWV3","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This VERY low budget Indie by Sean Baker won the prestigious Altman Award for 2012. I was compelled to find out what the fuss was about.Imagine my surprise; a well-written, well-crafted, simple story about integrity, good intentions and issues of the elderly. I won't give away some of the more sensational plot-points, but the plentiful DVD extras explain that first impressions should not make one judgmental regarding the true make up of a person. The talented Mr Baker lets you know these people before adding an interesting element that may shock some (I found it mildly amusing).Dree Hemingway is remarkable as Jane, a girl new to the San Fernando Valley, staying with friends while she establishes herself. She buys a thermos from a cranky old lady at a yard sale (the magnificent Besedka Johnson), later to find out there's $10K inside. This makes Jane uncomfortable, and she attempts to find out if the old lady might really need that money, a guilt-complex that results in an adventure of stalking, friendship, fondness, understanding and genuine love.At age 85, it was Johnson's first film role, and she handles it like a pro. It's Jane's integrity and perseverance to know this old woman that is the gist of the film, a sweetness that can't help but move the viewer. It's a beautifully controlled relationship starting with suspicion, mutual interests, leading to genuine caring. I was totally taken in. The film still resonates with me, though I saw it over a week ago.I won't give away the other plot points, but there are terrific supporting players; Stella Maeve as Jane's stoner best friend, Melissa, and James Ransone, great as Melissa's manic, stoner boyfriend.It is to Mr Baker's credit that he let you know the sweetness of Jane before he drops the ""bomb"", about one-third into the film. A great lesson to not judge people before you know how good they can be.It's ""Not Rated"", so be prepared for some surprises. A delightful film, in many ways, and a landmark film in pacing and development.I admire ""Starlet"" very much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IY1YE6L3F2X9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWQEJPE#wasThisHelpful","R3IY1YE6L3F2X9","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If only being duped by The American Dream was this amusing! Our hero, Dale Hammer, is an Everyman, knocking himself out to create a better life for his family. His musings on the simplest things are genuine and from the heart.There's really not a plot; rather, Dale's first person narrative explains how he got into the mess he's in, and hasn't a clue how to get out of it. Nothing is sugar-coated, though his spot-on metaphors are quite amusing. He has to figure his outcome by himself; his father has been a poor role model, his brother is an over-reactive liberal, his wife is tired of his ambivalence, and he's surrounded by impossibly clueless suburbanites, with few exceptions.I don't want to give away the story, but I'm a slow reader and finished this one in record time. I was taken in completely, and enjoyed the ride.

"Mr Herzog admits at the beginning that he's against the death penalty. Many people are. This is probably the only time he's given a personal societal opinion in all of his excellent documentaries. Even in ""Grizzly Man"" he never said the protagonist was the ignorant idealist that he was.""Into the Abyss"" is well made and well presented, and I was riveted at all times at the careful procedure that Herzog used to present the grisly subject. Guilt is not the question; rather the events leading up to it allow the viewer to make his own decision. The film ultimately is about the death penalty, though Herzog allows a lot of room for speculation.It's a good film and an important one, and we need people like Mr Herzog to show us the unpleasantness of life, in his honest attempt to show life as it is (or as it might be).Herzog had 2 fine films in 2012, the other being ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"", quite fine. I admit ""Grizzly Man"" annoyed me for its subject, but I beg anyone to say ""Encounters at the End of the World"" wasn't intriguing.Herzog is good at what he does, and I will look forward to his next endeavor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPXU43QO0V747/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006Z7Z3JA#wasThisHelpful","RPXU43QO0V747","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How refreshing that this film comes from a land rife with strife. The jokes are at the expense of the academic hypocrisy and the situation is amusing. No reference to political situations are brought to light, which was gratifying to me. What's here is the eternal nonsense of the academic effort to achieve honor over reputation.

"I'm so glad I was put in touch with The Three Doors. From the first page, I was drawn in to a world of intrigue that wouldn't let up.I am a slow, sporadic reader, but I found myself enthralled by what might happen next, and finished it in record time (for me). At 500+ pages, I must admit that there were very few slow moments. Mr Holland has created a world, well thought out, with multiple characters adding their own very individual motives. In a nutshell, it's a story about good vs evil, and there's little question about who's what. Both sides get a working over, and I was convinced that the good guys' plan wasn't well established, but when time is of the essence, our crew did what they had to do. On many occasions, just when I thought everything might work out, there was another glitch and further excitement was in store.Another reviewer suggested that this was a ""Christian"" book, though that might be a misnomer. Though there's an effort made by Christian people to combat evil, it's really an effort of a bunch of good people doing what they have to do, more of a moral dilemma than a religious one.Our gifted hero, Jared, is quite endearing. One would think he's got it made, but he's very aware of his vulnerability. Indeed, the power of true evil has him a bit shaken throughout, but he's a young man of conviction and purpose. Most impressive. I liked the way all of the many characters were given their own, solid identity. Albi was especially good, though I would like to know more about Iris, and what made her so profoundly desirable. She almost seemed vapid at first, but eventually proved to be a good catalyst to Jared's motivation.For such a big book, I'm amazed at how quickly I got through it. A solid beginning, an eventful middle, and an ending that left few questions, make me think The Three Doors is one of the most enjoyable rides I've taken in a long time. I repeat, never a dull moment. Highly recommended.I will make an effort to read more by the talented Brian D Holland.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ETWZZ4VUF78N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988498413#wasThisHelpful","R2ETWZZ4VUF78N","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Nazis will never come to Holland, right? Wrong. This astonishing film by Ben Sombogaart depicts how powerful is the work of evil. Twin sisters, separated at birth, are convinced that they will be together again, though the ultimate get-together doesn't seem to happen. There are secrets, deceptions, heartbreaks and everything imaginable to bring this wonderful film to an unnerving climax.This is not your usual Holocaust film, a surprise Oscar nominee. It's a film about hope. Ugliness abounds, and the hopeless feelings of shame and helplessness are so perfectly portrayed, that I found myself liking most of these characters, very well written.Acting is exceptional from all, and Sombogaart draws us in slowly and perfectly, creating a canvas that isn't pretty, but perfectly compelling.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZANCR2H9G02L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009X75S8#wasThisHelpful","R1ZANCR2H9G02L","A12X2J7AVZ04IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admire director Marc Forster a lot, especially after the brilliant ""Finding Neverland"". He seems to long for the appreciation of misunderstood persons, and is usually successful. His James Bond effort left me a little baffled, but ""Machine Gun Preacher"", despite its crazy title, just didn't work for me. I'm thinking the main problem was Gerard Butler, who was either hot or sweet, and there wasn't much grey area. Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon were reliable in their respective roles, but our protagonist was never really convincing as a good person.The plight of the poor kids was the most interesting element, but everything else about the film left me wanting more. Mr Childers may be a fine man, but standing beside a church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a field makes you a farmer. Childers' transformation was superficial, at best, and needed more explanation to make this viable to a thinking person.I saw a film about a confused, misdirected guy who was looking for his next rush.

It fits great in the bust and a little big in the waist area, but that's the style of the dress. I am a 36C, 5'8"" tall, 170 lbs or so. I was worried it would be a bit short on me but not at all.

"The dress is poorly made as another reviewer commented. The seam under the bust also came apart - before I even tried it on. The colors are more muted than what are shown here, more dusty grey purple. The fabric is soft. The length of the dress hit just above my knees, I am 5'8"". There was too much fabric under the arm area, and where the empire seam is, so the size I ordered was too big. Depending on the brand I wear a medium or a large. After seeing the dress with the seem apart at the same place as the other reviewer mentioned she had in her dress, I cannot recommend this dress, even for the sale price I paid on amazon prime day of $22.

"At first I was skeptical, but this really works for me. Don't expect it to work like a Dremel tool. If your callouses are thick, the Amope Pedi will seem like it isn't working, as it takes a small layer off at a time. I would use a really coarse emery board (100 grit) and do it by hand first. Then use the Amope Pedi once a day to keep the callouses down. I really like this. My husband likes to use it once in a while, but mostly he uses the Dremel. And sometimes I can hear him cuss when the Dremel works too well. I will stick to using the Amope Pedi, much more delicate and less likely to injure yourself. I needed to replace the batteries that came with the unit after about 3 weeks of almost daily use. The original roller is still good.

"This jacket is great for my NW weather. I love this jacket! I bought the dark raspberry color, it's beautiful and super soft, better than I expected. I also bought a size larger so I could wear layers if needed. I have the shorter version of this jacket and I love the omni-heat and knew to buy an xl. My usual size is L, I am 5'8""/165 lbs size 10/12, and the sleeve length is plenty long.  It is a very light weight jacket that is perfect for packing in a suitcase. It provides plenty of warmth. I wore it in 24 degree weather with a light shirt and mid weight sweater underneath the jacket and was plenty warm enough. I still had plenty of room for more layers if needed. Sometimes a two way zipper is tricky to use, but not this one (I have a Columbia trench coat that is).

"This is my favorite workout video (I do it 3x week). When I first started, the warm-up was enough intensity. After a week I was able to add a few minutes of the low impact. Every week I could add a few minutes more. Now I can do the warm-up, low-impact and hi-lo sections back to back. I like the cardio blast section too - I am working up to doing the whole section still. I have done the step section and it's a great workout, but my knee doesn't like it so much. I do modify a couple of the exercises. Cathe is a great motivator. The choreography is spot on, the music is good and there is an option for vocals only which I use so I can listen to my own playlists. I appreciate that there is no idle chit chat with the workout crew, this is a serious workout with many options to suit your individual tastes or needs.

"The Saucony Hurricane 16 fit true to size for me. I have been wearing Saucony shoes since the 80's and this is another great fitting shoe. My foot is on the wide side and these shoes are plenty wide in the normal width. Saucony's are known for a wide toe box. I always buy a 9 in athletic shoes (heels I wear between an 8-8.5, and a European size 38 in sandals and 39 in closed shoes). The size 9 in this shoe fits like my Hurricane 14 and 15 Saucony running shoes. This shoe has plenty of cushion. My calves and balls of my feet love the 8mm heal to toe drop so much better than the 12mm.Sometimes I have slight heel slippage and I fixed that with proper lacing for heel slippage (see below).IF YOUR HEEL SLIDES UP AND DOWN.(Create a more secure fit around the ankle without tightening the entire shoe).Technique:Lace as normal until one eyelet remains on each side. Draw the lace straight up on the outside of the shoe and bring it through the last eyelet. This will create a loop. Repeat on the other side. Cross each lace over the tongue, thread it through the opposite loop, and tie. The loops help to cinch in the material around your ankle to prevent your heel from slipping without making the rest of your shoe any tighter.IF YOUR TOES FEEL CRAMPED.(Reduce forefoot constriction by using four shoelaces instead of two).Technique:Remove the laces and measure them. Buy two sets (four laces) half that length. On both shoes, use one lace for the bottom three eyelets and a second lace for the upper three eyelets. The end result will be two bows on each shoe, allowing you to tie the bottom laces looser to accommodate your wider forefoot.YOUR SHOE IS TOO TIGHT ALONG THE TOP OF YOUR FOOT.(Use parallel lacing to secure your foot without putting pressure on the top).Technique:Lace the first two eyelets on the big-toe side of the tongue (not the first eyelet on either side of the tongue like you normally would). Bring the lace from the first eyelet straight across to the first eyelet on the other side of the tongue and push it through. Pull it straight up the side, skipping one eyelet, and thread it through the third eyelet. Pull it straight across the tongue, and push it through the third eyelet on the opposite side. Repeat until all eyelets are laced and tied.YOUR SHOE RUBS ONE SPOT ON THE TOP OF YOUR FOOT.(Eliminate pressure on a ""hot spot"" by lacing around it, not directly over it).Technique:Place a lipstick smear on your hot spot. Slide your bare foot into your shoe and take it out. The mark on the underside of the tongue tells you which set(s) of eyelets to skip. Lace your shoe until you reach the eyelet before the spot. Take the lace back under and pull it up through the next eyelet on the same side. Take the lace across and continue to lace. Repeat this on the other side. You'll have an empty spot on the tongue where no laces cross it, which should eliminate your pressure point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVY12FK7GUDNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BDZCWC#wasThisHelpful","RVY12FK7GUDNC","A1VB2MAKBKVZHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VB2MAKBKVZHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About 30% less power in this new Kitchenaid than my older version I bought around 2003. I used it almost everyday and I think using it in hot soup was detrimental to the unit, so now I cool the hot pot of soup in a bigger pot of cold water before I blend it. I like the attachment blade for batter, it makes really fluffy pancakes! We use the S shape blade for soups and smoothies. The chopper unit works really good for nuts, but I generally don't reach for it and just use a knife for chopping vegies etc.Overall I am happy with the immersion blender but wish it was as powerful as my old one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DG8PPOIJ4KX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005QIYJA8#wasThisHelpful","R2DG8PPOIJ4KX9","A1VB2MAKBKVZHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VB2MAKBKVZHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Moving Comforts new Chic Hoodie is just as soft as their two styles from last year (the Mock Turtleneck and Gotta Love It Tunic). According to the Moving Comfort size chart I am a medium, but the L in last years styles are very fitted (which I love). This new Chic Hoodie run a half size larger than last years.

"The bands I received have NO writing on them at all, so either I need to memorize the color strengths or go by the feel of the thickness (the thicker the band the more resistance it has). They were not individually wrapped but arrived all together (with some powder to keep them from sticking to each other) in a small box that looked a bit banged up. The label on the box had the color and resistance for each band.It would be more helpful if it was written on the bands like in the photo/description here.These bands seem thick/strong enough that they won't break anytime soon. Even though they are 3"" wide, they can still fold/scrunch up like the 2"" ones. Mostly I use one (blue) going around both knees when I do dumbbell squats for more stability in my knees. I have to spend at least 20-30 seconds fiddling with them to get them to lay flat going all the way around. If it takes longer than that I use them scrunchy which hurts just like the 2"" bands. So far they work for what I bought them for. I was using a long 6"" band that was not looped but I knotted together to make one long piece. I was nervous that was going to come apart on me so I bought these. I also did a few hamstring curls with the bands and they had enough stretch and resistance for that exercise.Overall, I am satisfied with the bands after using them a few times this week. I will update my review if I encounter any issues with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EXWJO8YTEUW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JI7PO16#wasThisHelpful","R1EXWJO8YTEUW7","A1VB2MAKBKVZHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VB2MAKBKVZHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE:  The metal edge of the curler that pushes your eyelashes against the rubber pad is super sharp and has created a cut all the way across the pad. Luckily I saw this before it was too late and it cut my eyelashes off. I threw out the curler. I only saw this because I had on my reading glasses, I am sure that my eyelashes would have been cut off soon, the cut was deep.I have been using Shiseido's eyelash curler. This is an amazing curler. It costs around $20 at the department store. Spend a few dollars more and get a high end curler.***************The curler feels sturdier than my old Revlon curler. I really like the padded handles, it's much nicer on your fingers when squeezing and holding the curler for 10-30 seconds. The curve of the devise is perfect for my eyes, all my lashes fit into the curler. It did not pinch, I can get really close to the base of my eyelashes. My eyelashes are more curled with the Bella curler than my old one (my eyelashes are not hard to curl). The curl lasted most of the day without using mascara. On a day I apply mascara, (Lancome Difincils-my absolute favorite!) my eyelashes are less curled after the mascara is applied, so after it dries I will use the curler again and that sets the curl for the rest of the day. My eyelashes actually touch my skin under my brow they are so long and curled. I don't know it's this is the best curler made, but it's the best I have used. I've been using drugstore curlers for 40 years.I would have like an extra pad for the curler. The company says the pad will last the lifetime of your curler if taken properly care of. But what if it falls out into the toilet or you lose it? It's not like you can buy a replacement pad at the store or even from Bella. I would like to see Bella make available extra pads to purchase or at least include an extra pad with your purchase.You will get two follow up emails from Bella after your purchase, the first one is thanking you. Then another email asking if you received the curler and how to properly use it. And, if you love your curler would you please leave feedback. Also, you will be offered a discount on any other product they have, which at this time looks to be one other product.Bottom line, I love this curler. It is a five star curler for me!  But minus one star for not offering replacement pads to purchase or at least give you an extra one at the time of purchase.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33NNJ3ELPH7CY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNI1DZQ#wasThisHelpful","R33NNJ3ELPH7CY","A1VB2MAKBKVZHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VB2MAKBKVZHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my disks had a bubble under the fabric which was really annoying when I put my foot down on it, it made popping noises. So, I stuck it with a a pin and pushed the air out, now it's great. They are made in Taiwan. Also, there is a warning on the box that says ""This product contains one or more chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm"". So, good thing I don't live in California :)The gliding discs work perfectly on my cheapo carpeting and linoleum flooring. You will scratch your flooring if you have dirt/grit on the floor while using discs though. This presents an added bonus of burning a few more calories as you can use it as a warm up and clean your floor first, or just use it on your carpet!  These disks are smaller than the big name brand one in which you have to buy 1 set for your floor and another set for carpet ($40 for each set!). My gym has these and I find that the Gold's Gym sliders and just as good. Yes they are smaller, but you only place the balls of your feet on the sliders so your heels can be used for stability and braking.The dvd was an added bonus. There are a few exercises that are safe for newbie exercisers or people new to the gliders. A few of the routines are for more advanced in-shape people who have used the sliders for a while. I have used sliders in my gym class 2x a week for 10 months now and there are exercises on this video that I can't do yet, and a few that I won't do because I know I will hurt something. At 56 years old injuries take longer to heal than when I was 40, so I try to be careful. I also lift weights 3x week, and do a couple other cardio things.The gliders are great for cross training. I have gained a lot of core strength using gliders. My legs are so much stronger too, I can feel and see the muscles now. I have also gained strength in my back/shoulders and arms from using gliders with different plank exercises.These are awesome gliders on my carpet and flooring, I highly recommend them (unless you have expensive Berber type carpet, other reviewers said they don't work on that).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZYFBMZH1ZUSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ET9D8T8#wasThisHelpful","R2ZYFBMZH1ZUSJ","A1VB2MAKBKVZHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VB2MAKBKVZHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this top. I bought the blue glass in a size L. Sometimes I wear a medium or a large. The L is very fitted. The sleeves could be a bit longer, I am 5'8"". The fabric is super soft and not as sheer as I thought it would be (a plus). I don't need to wear another layer under the blue glass pattern. It does cover your bum or you could bunch it up at the hips, it looks really cute because of the shirring at the hips. Great top that runs a half size small. If you are in between sizes definitely size up or if you don't want the top fitted but more semi-fitted, size up too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M05G4XPW2E63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DT0BPKC#wasThisHelpful","R3M05G4XPW2E63","A1VB2MAKBKVZHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VB2MAKBKVZHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this in the plum color, size L. I usually wear a L in prAna (a medium once in a while) and I find this top to be very tight in the upper arms. I am 5'8"" and the sleeves are barely long enough (just at my wrists). I wish they were as long as shown on the models, that would be 'cozy'. The fabric is not as soft as I was expecting. Overall it is a cute top though, on the thin side but I was expecting that. My black/gray tattoos show under the fabric.

The fabric is not quite as soft as I expected it to be. It did not shrink after washing and drying. The black color is not really black, but a charcoal grey.

"I bought both the brown and the cream sweater coats. They are a mid to heavy weight and will be great for wearing for 3 seasons for me. I love the style of this sweater, stylish and fun. A reviewer said that it is a slim fit, so I bought the L/XL instead of the M/L. The cream color is a perfect fit and the brown one is about 1/2 size bigger - maybe it will shrink a bit after being washed since it is cotton. The sleeves are long enough for me at 5'8"" 162 lbs, so I think if I bought a size down, the sleeves might have been a bit short.

"The fabric is soft and hangs nicely. I am 5'8"" and the sleeves are the perfect length, it hits about top of mid thigh area. I think that it runs a bit large for the size L, but then that leaves room for other layers underneath when the weather gets colder. The buttons are large but that adds pizzazz to the jacket. It is a mid-weight fabric, not a summer weight so I can pretty much wear this for 3 seasons. It looks great with my black fedora.

I put my android in the outside pocket and there is plenty of room left if I want to slide my eyeglasses in there too. There is another small pocket on the other side that I keep hairbands/panty liners in.

"I purchased the Mobee Technology Magic Charger online at the Apple store for my new Magic Mouse.  The mouse works perfectly with normal AA batteries, but when using the Magic Charger the Bluetooth disconnects from the mouse frequently.

I have submitted a request for a replacement.  I will report the response of the manufacturer.  I am regretting the purchase, because the regular AA batteries last for a long time with normal use.UPDATED 08/12/2015:I received a prompt response from Mobee Tech and a new battery was shipped to me in a few days.

"Ravelli APGL4 Tripod and Pistol Grip Head  Tall and stable tripod will handle DSLR with heavier lenses.What initially brought me to this tripod is the maximum height of 70 inches.  I am 6 feet tall and hate assuming a stooped posture for extended periods.  I own a few light weight travel tripods.  I needed a heavier tripod for those shots that require heavier camera lenses.  I immediately took the Ravelli tripod out for a spin mounted to a heavy lens and camera while enduring costal breezes for a good field test.  As expected, this medium weight tripod kept everything from moving for shake free images.The current Ravelli APGL4 tripod bundle includes:  tripod, pistol grip head, carry bag, allen wrenches, and wiping clothes.  The price dropped significantly to sixty dollars - cheaper is better!PROS:- The pistol grip head is very stable in all positions even with a long lens mounted.  It is very easy to adjust.- The tripod is very very stable.- Large rubber feet.- The ability to mount a camera under the center column for super low shots.- Built to last.- The Ravelli provides a 10 year warranty on their products.Copied from website support page:  ""Your Ravelli purchase includes a 10 year warranty for manufacturer defects when purchased new from an authorized retailer. We stand behind our products and will gladly help resolve any issue that may arise with your purchase.""CONS:- It can be a little difficult to make fine height adjustments with the center column when heavy photo equipment is mounted.  A geared center column with crank would be a nice touch.P.S.The package was shipped directly from Amazon and arrived in the form of a very large crushed open box.  There was no padding, no bubble wrap, nothing.  There were a couple of other smaller items in the same shipping box which could have easily fell out of the open box.  This was not one of Amazon's better attempts at packaging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YHWUTXITI0AZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003SQEAY0#wasThisHelpful","R1YHWUTXITI0AZ","A18U05IGMK1FVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U05IGMK1FVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased this ring as a coupling between a Celestron Ultima 80 spotting scope and a Canon 7d.  The T-Ring seems to be well made, but it arrived with an oily substance on the threads that found its way to the optic.  The images taken are much worse then what is seen with  the naked eye - very fuzzy.  I am disappointed.  This combination may work for fuzzy moon shots, but that is about it.  Very disappointed.

"Products:Celestron 52250 Ultima 80mm Spotting Scope andCelestron 93419 T-Ring for Canon EOS cameraReview of Scope:I purchased the Celestron Ultima 80mm Spotting Scope to use as my first terrestrial telescope.  I live near the ocean and wanted an inexpensive telescope to monitor passing cruise ships and see what is happening on the other end of the island.  Initially, I was a little surprised at the size and weight of the Celestron Ultima.  Feeling the heft of a nearly four pound 18 inch telescope with a 80mm objective lens is a little different then reading the specifications.  Fortunately, this scope will stay indoors mounted to a tripod and used occasionally when the mood strikes.The visual range of a 20x-60x zoom lens on a scope can be very impressive to a first time user.  The scope is simple to operate.  It has a single focusing knob which needs a finer adjustment setting.  The finder sight tube will get you in the ballpark of your target, but that is about it.  Using the scope, you will see a narrow visible ring around the inner perimeter of the lens.  Depending on the lighting conditions, that perimeter ring color will vary in color from clear to a blue-violet in brighter light. When you are dealing with zoom optics there is always a quality compromise - especially on the lower price models.  I am not surprised by the color ring on this bargain priced scope.  The ring of color will bother some more than others.  The focus ring and the zoom eyepiece turn smoothly when changing settings.  The heavy nylon case is well made, but not padded.  The scope build quality is heavy duty - it should take a few knocks.  I purchased the scope from Amazon for approximately one hundred sixty dollars.  The price includes the basic scope, zoom 20x-60x angled eyepiece, and cases for both pieces.  The rubber cup that mounts on the eyepiece needs to fit a lot snugger.Review of T-Ring Adapter:I ordered the Celestron T-Ring adapter to mount my Canon EOS 7d.  This scope is not a good choice for those wishing to capture quality photos with camera.  The images with naked eye are acceptable, but coupling the Celestron T-ring adapter and a Canon 7d produces a very grainy image.  If you need a scope to capture clear photos, this is not the one.  The image through the scope's lenses is not grainy using the naked eye.  If all you want to shoot are pictures of the moon it should be fine, but bird photographers will be a little more critical of this scope and T-ring combination.  The best images will occur using the smallest setting 20x.  You will get much better pictures using the camera lenses you already own on your DSLR and enhancing the size of the image.  There are good examples of the scope's photographic abilities on YouTube - judge for yourself.Summary:The Celestron Ultima 80 lens has some aberrations and some color issues around the ring, but that is to be expected with any zoom lens near this low price range.  Forget about taking clear photos with this scope.Side Note:If you wear glasses there may be additional challenges.  I can see clearer images through the scope when wearing my computer glasses vs my regular glasses.  Being physically closer to the eyepiece does not necessarily give a sharper view.Every scope you see on the internet is rated very highly.  Most people are amazed to see something that is miles away for the first time.  Weight your needs for quality carefully and do not over spend.  Everyone does not need $3k scope.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XH9W2LQBGH61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002CTZ70#wasThisHelpful","R2XH9W2LQBGH61","A18U05IGMK1FVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U05IGMK1FVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this product the Magnesium Fire Starter and the Light My Fire Swedish Fire Steel 2.0 Army.  I will give you my experience testing both products.Magnesium Fire Starter:I had problems with this product initially, because there is a very thick protective coating covering the flint rod.  It took a little effort to scrape off the coating.  You will not get any sparks until this coating is completely removed.  Using the included striker/saw, I was able to produce a reasonable amount of sparks.  Surprisingly, I was able to generate a greater volume of sparks using the striker included with the Light My Fire Swedish Fire Steel 2.0.  The Magnesium Fire Starter requires a little preparation and practice to be reliable.Light My Fire Swedish Fire Steel 2.0 Army:The Swedish Fire Steel is ready to go right out of the package.  It generates a shower of hot potent sparks with little effort.  If you need to get a fire started in a hurry this is the better choice when good tender is available.  It cost a little more, but it creates a much hotter shower of sparks and makes quick work of starting a fire.Test Conditions:My test consisted of starting a fire from material available on a beach in Florida.  I gathered relatively dry tender that had fallen from palm trees.  The tender was a little thicker then I would prefer, but that is what was available at the time.  I tried both products and neither would create a fire from the thick tender with sparks alone.  Then I created a few magnesium shavings on the palm tender with the Magnesium Fire Starter.  The spark from the Magnesium Fire Starter was hot enough to ignite the magnesium shavings, but did not ignite the palm tender.  The hotter spark from the Light My Fire Swedish Fire Steel ignited the magnesium shavings and ignited the palm tender resulting in combustion very quickly.Conclusion:I prefer the Light My Fire Swedish Fire Steel 2.0 Army for most applications - 99% of the time.  If you need to start a fire with damp tender, the Magnesium Fire Starter will be a handy addition to the party.  Being able to create magnesium shavings with the saw is a handy feature in extreme situations.  Others have stated, ideally you will want both products in a survival situation. Even with the magnesium shavings the hotter spark from the Light My Fire Swedish Fire Steel will get the fire going a lot quicker.P.S.The flint can be shaved and works even better, but that is the source of your spark with the Magnesium Fire Starter - when it is all gone - no more sparks.http://www.amazon.com/Light-Fire-Swedish-FireSteel-Emergency/dp/B004412IHE/ref=pd_sim_sg_7?ie=UTF8&refRID=1E4WWD7SEVMP9EEV3MTA","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZKW1O0W2QITG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010O748Q#wasThisHelpful","RZKW1O0W2QITG","A18U05IGMK1FVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U05IGMK1FVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little rascal works very well. Be careful it produces a shower of very hot sparks with little effort. One of the Amazon reviewers suggested using dryer lint to start a fire. I decided to test this product by putting a ball of dryer lint in the kitchen sink to see whether the sparks could be coaxed into at least starting the lint to smolder. On the first strike a shower of hot sparks were produced and the ball of lint immediately burst into flames. Fortunately it was in the sink. I quickly turned on the water to extinguish the fire. It totally caught me off guard. I had no idea a fire could be produced so quickly. It does not take much lint to start a fire.

"I normally shave my face and head daily using the Gillette Fusion (5 blade) system with the lather supplied by a mixture of shaving cream and shaving soap whipped to a thick lather with a badger brush.  The Dorco Pace 6 (6 blade) system seemed to be a possible cheaper alternative to the Gillette Fusion system.  I purchased the Dorco system directly from the Dorco website which had the best discounted prices for their products.  The following is my experience with the product which looks very manly and has good heft.Day One:  I was very excited to try my new Dorco Pace 6 razor system.  I created a good hot shaving lather and commenced to shave my face.  I immediately noticed the strip of rubber at the bottom of the Dorco cartridge was creating excess drag.  After several passes with the new blade there was still a lot of stubble on my face.  The Gillette Fusion removes all hair in the first pass.  I moved on to my head, but the rubber that is supposed to make the hairs stand up was creating an extreme amount of drag on the top of my head.  The razor was actually bouncing across my head.  Again short jagged stubble was left on my head.  I used a 3 week old Gillette Fusion cartridge to clean up the sharp stubble left behind by the new Dorco razor.Day Two:  I installed a fresh Dorco cartridge hoping the first experience was a fluke caused by a bad cartridge.  The shaving experience was the same as day one.  I had to clean up the stubble with my 3 week old Gillette Fusion cartridge.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.I am back to using my Gillette Fusion system.  I have no use for a shaving system that creates sharp stubble.  I am better off not shaving then using the Dorco Pace 6 system.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MABS38H1UC7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EEDVF6#wasThisHelpful","R3MABS38H1UC7L","A18U05IGMK1FVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U05IGMK1FVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for a cheap monopod to shoot a carnival and parade.  While looking at my monopod options, I realized a monopod head would be a necessity.  I am shaking my head while calculating the total cost.  I saw this light weight beauty and wondered if it could be used as a monopod.  I drop one leg and started shooting.  I carried this ultra light tripod by it's handle which is very comfortable.  The tripod is light enough to leave attached to my Canon 7d while slinging the camera strap over my shoulder.  I have 3 other tripods and a monopod at another site, but this is a true ultralight.  It is the only tripod I do not mind carrying all day.  Changing and locking the camera into various positions is very fast with this tripod - due to the innovative design of the head and handle.End of Day:I wore through one of the foot pads on the first day exposing the metal.  The design of the handle and head are a good idea, but the foot pads wear out very quickly.  The head, handle, and leg supports are made of plastic and may not last.I returned the product for a refund.  The foot pads are made of inferior rubber.

"I consider the Etymotic Research HF5 earphones a very good value for the price on Amazon.  What makes or breaks the audio quality of any earphone is the fit of the earplugs.  The most frequent complaints are:  not enough volume and not enough bass.  The reason for those complaints?  Most ear plugs do not provide a good seal against the out side noise.  The same is true of these earphones until you get a good fitting ear plug, the thumping bass and high volume will be slightly out of reach.  It is extremely hard to generalize about the fit of earplugs.  Everyone's ear canals are a different shape.None of the earplugs included with the HF5 earphones were a good tight fit for me.  I purchased a pair of Etymotic ER-6's many years ago and the earplugs were a very good fit for me.  Etymotic Research no longer makes those earplugs, but I found some earplugs that are identical to them on AMAZON (B007X8LGV4 at a very low price.  So, I was happy until going to the gym and working out next to a couple of heavy people running on treadmills.  The earplug seal was not tight enough to block their noise, even at the highest volume.  Unfortunately, this is a common problem at the gym.Fortunately, Etymotic Research will make custom earplugs from ear casts made by your Audiologist.  I spend a lot of time at the gym so it was a no brainer for me.  I got the custom earplugs.  My ear canals are fairly typical, the audiologist told me.  The difference in the volume and bass is difficult to describe.  Before the custom earplugs, I would turn the volume up to the highest level.  Using the custom earplugs, anything above 70% of volume on my tablet is very uncomfortable.  The bass is truly thumping with the help of an equalizer app/ bass booster.  Now, I hear nothing, but music at the gym.  It is all about getting a good seal and the best seal is with the Etymotic Research custom earplugs which will require a trip to your local Audiologist.  If the price of the custom earplugs is uncomfortable, I highly suggest the cheaper earplugs mentioned earlier in the review.P.S.Those of you that own the custom ER Musicians Earplugs (audio attenuators)  and want to know whether the  HF5's are compatible.  The answer is NO.  Sorry, you will have to get special earplugs for the HF5's which fit the ER-4's too.  If you have a very recent ear casting, just send it to ER and save yourself the cost of the Audiologist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11FWYJVZMCAMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XP8DJC#wasThisHelpful","R11FWYJVZMCAMR","A18U05IGMK1FVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U05IGMK1FVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just what I wanted.  These are very similar to the ear cushions that came with the old Etymotic ER-6 earphones.  I was not happy with any of the cushions that came with my new Etymotic HF5 earphones.  These cushions are comfy and provide a good seal once you get them positioned properly.

"Going into this purchase, I suspected the weakest link would be the FM transmission between the Roadster 2 and my car's stereo system.  Since Motorola pioneered radio and two-way communication, my hopes were very high.  I only invested a day determining the usability of the Roadster 2.On the plus side, pairing two android devices to the Roadster 2 was very easy.  The speaker on the Roadster 2 is very good considering the small size.  The Roadster 2 recognizes the names of the contacts then calls the correct phone number when selecting address entries by voice command.  The buttons are large and easily identified - consider it user friendly.  The best way to use this product is with the built in speaker.  It functions very better on it's own.On the negative side, FM transmission to the car's radio fluctuates, it is sometimes very good and other times very bad.  An FM channel that is clear initially may have static a few blocks down the road as you approach a stronger competing FM radio signal.  When streaming music to the FM radio the audio quality will not approach that of a factory installed integrated hands-free system.  The only flaw in this product is the use of the FM frequency for transmitting to the car stereo.  The Roadster 2 scans for strongest available channels which is exactly what it should not do - duh.  It should look for unused channels!  The best way to use this product is with the built in speaker which is clearer.Heck, I can get better sound quality by connecting the phone via standard audio cable which by the way works great for speaking on the phone too.  But, taking the audio cable approach, I still have to fumble with the cellphone buttons and that is dangerous while driving.If you do a lot of talking while driving, the Roadster 2 is safer than using the cellphone alone.  The Roadster 2's built in speaker is very clear and the buttons are easy to find.  The Roadster 2 provides easy to access buttons and vocal commands.  It is a useable product when not going through the FM car radio.  This product can not be compared to the integrated hands-free bluetooth radio systems that come installed on vehicles, today.  But, for the price it is as good or better than other FM frequency products.  I have paid a lot more for Bluetooth earpieces that do not have anywhere near functionality of this speakerphone.Bottom line:  If you are looking for a dedicated car speakerphone that supports voice commands, has a user friendly interface, and you are not concerned about a high quality stereo connection the Roadster 2 is a good choice.  I have come to the conclusion the FM frequency is always the weakest link.  The commercial FM radio broad cast signals are too strong.  The Roadster 2 seems to look for the channels used by the commercial stations.  Yea, I returned it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LV3CKOPGL13C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0099SFGF8#wasThisHelpful","R3LV3CKOPGL13C","A18U05IGMK1FVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U05IGMK1FVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well made bag that is a true value purchase.  I can not complain, when compared to other bags costing twice as much.  It will fit most SLR cameras with a standard zoom lens attached.  Some of the Telephoto lens maybe bit much for this bag - I am talking to you Canon owners.  Measure your equipment carefully before ordering.  The bag is an excellent bargain.  The only thing about this bag is being satisfied with carrying one lens.  It is hard to pick just one lens for the entire day.  Keep in mind there is no room for an external flash unit.  The pockets are small.  The larger front pocket will hold at most my Canon battery charger with spare battery and a couple spare storage cards.  The side pockets are very tight and suitable for only a storage card or USB stick.Summary:  I don't love this bag, but it is a bargain and something to protect a single camera and lens from dents and scratches.  Every camera bag I own is a compromise.  I will be satisfied the day there is an assistant to carry all my gear for me : )","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36OS7SEDH379L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MWBY6W#wasThisHelpful","R36OS7SEDH379L","A18U05IGMK1FVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U05IGMK1FVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Simply lift the flap and you have access to all your photographic gear without having to move things around.  Considering what others are asking for their camera bags this is quit a bargain.

"I had this split running down a ridge in the middle of my left thumb nail for several years.  It seemed like it would never heal.  I asked my doctor what to do about it.  He showed me his identical 4 year old split thumb nail and told me to live with it.  I did not want to live it.  I spent a lot of money on manicures, but nothing seemed to help.  The manicurists tried the glues, the wraps, the oils, and the super polish, but none of them had any effect on the split.  At times the split would almost heal itself, but never quite make it.  It would always split farther during a final attempt to clip the last of it.I purchased this clipper as a luxury not thinking it would actually help with the split nail.  I was totally bewildered when the Seki fingernail clipper removed the last of the split during the second clipping.  I lost sleep thinking about this.  What had changed?  I had purchased probably six different drugstore nail clippers over past year alone, but they were all relatively dull.  I tried three different manicurists over the years with no improvement with the split.  I came to the conclusion, the drugstore clippers and the manicurists professional nail nippers were dull and kept the split from healing by bending and contorting the nail during the cutting process.  The Seki clipper being extremely sharp there was very little bending of the nail which avoided additional stress on the nail and split.  The sharper edge allowed it to cut using less pressure.I am kicking all the manicurists to the curb for taking my money without solving the problem.  The seven year old split is finally healed.  The Seki clipper is truly a fine instrument and the company has made this new customer a believer.  I just order the Seki toenail clipper.I want to thank Seki for making an outstanding product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRL2SJ0ZUG9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F35R00#wasThisHelpful","R1XRL2SJ0ZUG9H","A18U05IGMK1FVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U05IGMK1FVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is assuring to know you have a fresh product before opening the package.  I keep a container of prepared brown rice stored in the refrigerator for use as a side dish or a filler ingredient.

"I have had the Manta Ray in my free weight collection for many years.  I would never attempt squats again without it.  It keeps the pain away from my shoulders.

"I was drawn to this book after watching the videos Forks Over Knives and the followup video Forks Over Knives the Extended Interviews.  Amazon carries both of the videos.  Dr. Esselstyn describes his research on cardiovascular disease and the impact it could have on our future health.  His research indicates that given a chance over time the human body can stop the progress and sometimes reverse cardiovascular disease.  He believes it is a disease that thrives in this country, because of the Standard American Diet.  Dr. Esselstyn has called cardiovascular disease a paper tiger that can be eliminated for most people by their choice of foods.  Who knew erectile dysfunction was an early symptom of cardiovascular disease?  I will never eat another cheese burger again.I have counted calories all my life without success.  I removed all fat/oils from the refrigerator and pantry.  I have a green smoothie every morning for breakfast/brunch.  I eat whole grains for lunch.  I eat all sorts of cooked veggies (including potatoes) and grains for dinner.  I have lost 30 pounds in less than two months.  Yea, I am at the gym a lot more, but it is amazing to see the weight fall off so fast.  It took a couple of weeks for my taste buds to adjust to the food not having oil.

"I am more than a little disappointed in this book created in the name of a person I truly respect.The source of my disappointment is not the quality of the recipes, but the ingredients.  My definition of meatless is no animal products - that includes dairy and eggs.  Cheese, butter, and eggs are condensed forms of everything I want to avoid in a meatless diet.  I expected to find outstanding plant based recipes with healthy substitutions for cheese, butter, and eggs.  Apparently, that is not the goal of this book.  This is not a book for people attempting to avoid dairy products and eggs.  There are precious few recipes in the book Meatless that are free of dairy products and eggs.  The recipes may be a good starting point, but you will have to find substitutes for the oils, dairy, and eggs on your own.  I do not have anything against eating meat.  If you are writing a cook book with the title Meatless then it should have recipes that are plant based without animal products.I am sure a number of people will appreciate this book as a transitional tool while moving toward a diet with fewer fried pork chops and greasy baby back ribs.  The book Meatless is for people that are searching for slightly healthier recipes.

"The Etymotic MC5's are hard to beat in the sub hundred dollar category.  After enjoying the Etymotic ER6's at the office for years, I decided to get the Etymotic MC5 earphones for my gym bag and have not been disappointed.FIRST USE:  The MC5's come with the smaller 3 flange ear tip attached.  If you have very small ear canals they may work for you.  I consider my ear canals average diameter and immediately switched to the standard size 3 flange ear tips which are included in the box.  The standard size is very similar in diameter to the old Etymotic 2 flange ear tips.  It is important to massage a drop of water into the flanged silicon ear tips during the initial use - think of it as ear lubricant.  You will probably only need to moisten the ear tips a few times.  They seem to stay lubricated after a couple uses.GREAT EARPLUGS:  The Etymotics are great for blocking unwanted noise like that screaming baby on the air plane or your noisy co-worker in the next cubicle.  These are best study aids on the market for students - wonderful silence in any environment.  They serve as excellent ear plugs.  Etymotics helped me survive a several hour flight from Puerto Rico with 4 sets of twin babies onboard screaming their lungs out during the entire flight.  My poor suffering travel companion's nerves were shot by the time we landed at Fort Lauderdale.  I was well rested having slept through most of the flight.ANDROID/ITUNES APP:  Etymotic has a free app called AWARENESS that will allow you to listen to your music and hear what is going on around you at the same time.  It is very useful at the airport listening for the boarding announcements and music at the same time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG5M2C0TVY21J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003S3RFIQ#wasThisHelpful","RG5M2C0TVY21J","A18U05IGMK1FVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U05IGMK1FVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am accustom to better ear buds.  These buds are a joke.  The sound is muffled, but it does have bass - muffled sounding bass.  Do not waste your money.The build quality is terrible.  The cables are made of the cheapest materials.  Sony should be ashamed of producing this junk.  I would say these buds are worth about ten dollars.

"I have used the Chicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition line of knives for years.  In my opinion they were some of the best inexpensive stamped knives around.  I still have a set of them purchased twenty years ago.Unfortunately, the entire Chicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition line is not what it used to be.  Now they are just cheap knives.  The walnut handles are about a full inch shorter these days.  Only people with very small hands will feel comfortable with the new handles.  I guess the price of walnut wood is going up.  I recently purchased a couple of other Walnut Tradition knives and all of them had the new smaller handles.  You could still do a lot worse for the price.If you elect to purchase any of the knives in the Walnut Tradition line, I would strongly suggest you take the following steps.1.  Dip the handles in hot mineral oil once per year.  This helps seal and  protect the wood handles from water damage.  It will make them more comfortable - smoother surface.2.  When the blades appear to be dull realign the edge with a sharpening steel.  You will find the proper technique and angle (20 degrees) on their web site.  Never sharpen a stamped knife blade with a regular knife sharpener.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TTIT9AKRSQR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000BYEJ4#wasThisHelpful","R3TTIT9AKRSQR0","A18U05IGMK1FVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U05IGMK1FVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you need a scratch resistant case for the Nexus 7, this one is ok for the price.  Nice finish and fits the Nexus 7 perfectly.  It turns on and off the tablet when opened and closed.  The price is acceptable at about fifteen dollars.  Having said all those wonderful things, I believe the Nexus 7 is tough enough to with stand normal use without a case.  If you want one, this is a good choice for carrying the Nexus in hand.  I use the case as a stand when watching videos while traveling.UPDATE 12/27/2012:While on vacation, I knocked my Nexus 7 (enclosed in case) off the nightstand and it fell onto a wooden floor landing on the bottom left edge.

"FINAL EDIT & SUMMARY - October 27, 2012:I have been using the Nexus 7 for a few months.  Overall, I am very happy with it.  The 4 quad processor is very quick, the apps open and close instantly.  There appears to be a good selection of apps for the Jelly Bean version of Android.  I am still waiting for a version of the Amazon app that will work with this tablet.  The device is made with high quality materials.  Normally, I use screen protectors and a protective case for my mobile devices.  I prefer to use the Nexus 7 uncovered.  The synthetic material on the back of the tablet makes it easy to hold and it would be a shame to cover that beautiful screen.  It appears to be a very sturdy tablet.  My only quibble, the packaging was so tight, I had to rip a part the box to remove the Nexus 7.  Good thing I like it, because returning the tablet without the original packaging would have been a major issue.I discovered the auto-rotate switch in the settings area.  It controls the visual orientation of books and things displayed on the screen.  It's default setting is ""OFF"".  When set to ""ON"" the display will always be positioned properly whether the tablet is positioned for landscape or portrait viewing.I considered returning the Nexus 7 when Amazon introduced the new Kindle Fire HD, but after serious thought decided to keep the faster and more powerful Nexus 7.  A few weeks ago, my lady friend purchased the 7 inch Kindle Fire HD.  It does not feel as responsive as the Nexus 7.  I am now a totally happy camper and raising the rating to 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJ82WWSCVGVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008M04V1E#wasThisHelpful","R3RJ82WWSCVGVO","A18U05IGMK1FVV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18U05IGMK1FVV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you need a EF-S lens in the ultra-wide focal length, this is Canon's answer.  Be forewarned it has a very cheap plastic body.

I am looking at a minimum of one hundred and fifty dollars and possibly more for repair and return shipment.Bottom line:  I like the optics, but really can not recommend this lens because of the ultra-cheap body.  When traveling, you need to store this lens in a rigid case.** Canon if you are listening, I would pay more for the same optics in a durable body.UPDATE:The lens is repaired and working like new again.

"Looking at the glowing reviews, I must have gotten one of the bad ones.  The turntable was built like a tank, but the platform was mounted severely off center and it had a horrible wobble.  I sent it back to Amazon.  There must be a bad batch of them with wobbly platforms that slipped past quality control.The design is fairly simple.  The cake stand has a heavy cast iron base.  The platform is made of aluminum which is mounted to a steel post that rotates in the base - bare metal to bare metal.  There are no ball bearings and it appears to need a good glob of grease type lubricant on the post to help it turn easier.I am going to try the Fat Daddio's turntable rather then risk getting another Ateco stand that wobbles.

"All my life, I have avoided canned anchovies, because they taste horrible.  I  read some wonderful things about this sauce on the internet, but it is made from anchovies.  I considered it a real gamble to order a bottle of the Red Boat Fish Sauce.WOW!  This stuff is tasty and the flavor is so intense.  I do not know anything about Asian cooking, but this sauce is truly nectar of the gods.  A few drops of the fish sauce will add a truck load of flavor to your seafood dishes.  I use it to reinforce the flavor of fish with a milder taste.  I am finding it to be a very versatile flavor enhancer.  Yesterday, I composed a dressing for a green salad.  A few drops of fish sauce whipped into a little olive oil and rice vinegar produces a nice savory dressing.As a another reviewer noted, this is a finishing sauce.  I add it after the food is cooked.  I believe the quality of the sea salt in this product makes a huge difference.

"A mostly enjoyable take on the vampire mythos. Certainly more old school than most modern incarnations. Still it has some interesting new twists philosophically such as St. Thomas Aquinas's speculations on Jesus's body post resurrection. Also introduced is kind of a D&D alignment which affect vampires. So there are evil vampires and saintly ones. Mostly this works plot wise and there is not the Buffy predestination towards evil character flaw.Mostly I enjoyed the story and the characters and it plays out as a solid action novel with both a bent towards humor and philosophy. There is a running gag mocking vampires from Twilight. The whole premise is interesting enough to want to see where the story goes in possible future novels.About two thirds through the book a new character is introduced and there is a bit of a transition story-wise that could have flowed a little better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXUT3ZEA1J7F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01494XYVO#wasThisHelpful","RXUT3ZEA1J7F4","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are some things when I run across them in a novel, movie, or even religious discussion immediately set off alarm bells for me. One of them is anything involving the Nephalem. It just never turns out well and most often very silly. Another is Constantine. Constantine gets blamed for a lot by a lot of different groups. At least with the Nephalem, it is something rather mysterious with little scriptural reference. When it comes to Constantine we actually have a wealth of historical information from Christian and Pagan sources. Still Constantine is often used to pointed to as a corruptor of ‚Äúpure‚Äù Christianity and the cause of the great apostasy. From Dan Brown to starters of new religions the start was not from history, but as a required plot line to justify what goes after.I was naturally delighted when I first found out Rod Bennett was releasing a new book called The Apostasy That Wasn‚Äôt: The Extraordinary Story of the Unbreakable Early Church. A semi-sequel to his wonderful Four Witnesses: The Early Church in Her Own Words. The appellation that somebody ‚Äúmade history come alive‚Äù is probably overused. Often I found that the author had made history interesting, but not fully alive to my intellect. Rod Bennett does make history come intellectually alive for me with his deft use of storytelling, historical writings, and the fruit of his research.The introduction starts with a stroll to a period while he was still a Protestant and coming across a place in Tennessee called ‚ÄúFields of the Wood‚Äù built up by a Preacher scandalized by the divisions in Christianity. Who was bringing back the ‚Äútrue church‚Äù and started a new congregation. This struck regarding how often this pattern has occurred. The person scandalized by the divisions who promptly create yet another division. The Bullwinkle-syndrome where the optimist church reformer says ‚ÄúThis time for sure!‚Äù as he pulls another church out of his hat.Rod Bennett describes the history of Preacher Tomlinson and this preachers own version of the Great Apostasy. This same pattern can be seen with the Latter-Day Saints, Jehovah Witnesses, Islam, and really most of Protestantism. Rod Bennett‚Äôs thinking about this preacher‚Äôs history led him to realize ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt I have, when it comes right down to it, a ‚ÄòGreat Apostasy‚Äô theory of my own?‚Äù This insight led him to studying church history and the reading of the Church Fathers. I think at this point it is mandatory to insert the Blessed John Newman quote ‚ÄúTo be deep in history is to cease to be Protestant.‚Äù Otherwise I could lose my Catholic blogger license.I was not unfamiliar with this tumultuous and exciting period of Church history. Warren H. Carroll covers this period quite well in one of his volumes of ‚ÄúA History of Christendom.‚Äù Still I found it contextualized better and I especially appreciated the lead up in history to Constantine and the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. The state of the Church and how between waves of persecution it was out in the open with various levels of toleration. Even with Diocletian there was originally some toleration before the worst of the persecutions began. It was all much more complicated than the incorrectly simplified history of Constantine being the first to grant such toleration. Especially the erroneous idea that he made Catholicism the official religion of the empire.He also paints the state of the empire with Rome depopulated and great cities like Alexandria lapsing from their Catholic faith. This historical backdrop sets the stage for such a fascinating piece of Church history. The rise of the Arian heresy by the priest Arius, the calling of the council, and the whole wonderful story of St. Athanasius. The story of Athanasius came so alive for me along with the conjecture that he had gotten involved with St Antony and the Desert Monks at a rather early period of his life. I often felt like I was reading a novel as this history played out. The real story is so odd and seemingly implausible that it only works as history.Rod Bennett really is a master storyteller and fully employs his skills in describing this period of history along with presenting the actual texts that we have. This is certainly a period of history with many surviving texts from those involved along with of course the Councilar texts. His subtitle is ‚ÄúThe Extraordinary Story of the Unbreakable Early Church‚Äù and this certainly fits the billing. The Arians had all the power on their side. They had most of the episcopacy of the Eastern bishops and the ear of the Emperors. The figure of Athanasius was unimpressive, but his mark on history wasn‚Äôt.I totally loved this book. So much so that no doubt it also goes on my re-read list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQ0GV5WH6G8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015I3J4VO#wasThisHelpful","R3IQ0GV5WH6G8D","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For fairly low price headphones I found these to be pretty good with a mix of music and podcasts.

But since they are a bit longer laying on a pillow using these headphones is not as comfortable as some other in-ear phones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8F75C9SPKW92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMVLY7C#wasThisHelpful","R8F75C9SPKW92","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product comes with a couple of components.1. Agility Shell: This is the case for the iPad Air 2 with the magnetic mount on the back to attach the the variety of Otter agility products. As you would expect from Otter this is a very solid case with a raised lip around the display. Access points to the lighting port and audio ports have enough gap that connecting should never be a problem. Baffles are placed in the raised lip to project the audio. If anything they seem to project the audio better.  The circular magnetic dock on the back doesn't really distract from the aesthetics of the case. The round hole reveals the Apple logo.Overall the shell by itself is a very good protective case with a non-slippery surface.2. Keyboard portfolio: This is a wrap around case that provides screen protection along with keyboard. This lightweight case with closing flap looks very nice. The agility magnetic dock makes it very easy to place or remove the iPad in the shell. This is the best system I have seen for doing this that both provides a strong connection to the case and is easily removable. In most cases I want to use the iPad free of the portfolio and dock it for travel or keyboarding. This allows me to do this with no problem. When closing the case a magnetic flap secures it.The weakest part of the portfolio case is that opening the case and folding for use.  There is a pull up flap that provides the foot rest for the iPad so that it does not slide further forward. This just does not feel that solid and interacting with the screen can move the iPad around. Also the viewing angle for the iPad is really not adjustable and I would prefer a shorter angle.A cardboard insert included placed on the portfolio shows that you can mount the iPad for portrait and landscape mode. While it is easy to do this with the magnetic dock to change orientation I found no way that portrait mode could actually be used with the keyboard. Other documentation does not reference this ability.The keyboard is fairly usable, or at list as usable as other iPad compact keyboards. I found it fairly easy to adapt to and there is solid travel on the keys. Works well with the new iOS 9 keyboard shortcuts and the Command key along with providing a home key. Function key provides media functionally along with cut/copy/paste.  Bluetooth setup uses the keyboard with the Fn key and a bluetooth key (9). There is also a dedicated power button along with using a standard micro usb port for charging.3. Wall mount: The wall mount comes with two pieces.  A mounting plate where you can either use the taped strips to mount on a wall or the two screw mounts. The magnetic dock slides over this plate for use. This provides a very secure mount and would look fine mounted in a kitchen or elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W63SF40VMZQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y09F5QG#wasThisHelpful","R2W63SF40VMZQZ","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to books on the Early Church Fathers there seems to be an increasing wealth of good books on the subject. One of my favorite books in this area is Rod Bennett‚Äôs ‚ÄúFour Witnesses: The Early Church in Her Own Words‚Äù. The reason I so loved this book is that Rod Bennett is a natural storyteller along with being a good historical researcher. His writing not only brought these men alive, but the historical era as well.So I was delighted to find another book on the Church Fathers that was as readable as ‚ÄúFour Witnesses‚Äù because of storytelling and grasp of the history. This book is Marcellino D‚ÄôAmbrosio‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhen the Church Was Young: Voices of the Early Fathers.‚Äù This book covers the period from Saint Ignatius of Antioch to St. Gregory the Great. The actual category as to the time period of early Church Fathers is rather loosely defined and subjective as the the end of it. Marcellino D‚ÄôAmbrosio offers a good definition. ‚ÄúThe Church Fathers are those great Christian writers who passed on and clarified the teaching of the apostles from approximately the second through eight centuries.‚Äù This definition makes more sense when you think of early ecclesiastical writers such as Origen and Tertullian as it does not rely on the writers sanctity or full orthodoxy.I am generally read in this era of history and so the stories of the men contained were not unfamiliar to me. Still I learned a lot more along with more being put into context. This book is much more than a historical litany of facts. The presentation brought to me a larger view and helped me integrate the information I already knew with the wealth of stories regarding these men. Plus with enough of their writings to want you to go to the sources and read more. This was totally an engaging read that will not just pass out of my memory in a fog of facts. When I compared this to Rod Bennett‚Äôs book I consider that high praise indeed and these two books together certainly have my recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XMI4FJMMPIAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616367776#wasThisHelpful","R2XMI4FJMMPIAT","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a powered USB 3 hub this is very compact and smaller than a deck of cards.Testing a USB3 SSD drive the tested data rates using ""AJA System Test"" were only slightly lower than the same test with the drive connected to a USB3 port on a MacBook Pro.As a powered hub I was also able to connect my iPad Air and it seemed to provide enough amperage to charge the iPad normally.USB3 cables can be rather thick and that is certainly true about the supplied cable which was as thick as many power cables. The light weight of the port itself means that the cable has a tendency to lift up the port and not to lay straight.The hub itself provide three ports on the front and one on the right side. The USB3 connecting port and power adapter are on the back.

"As with other Amazon Basic cables I own, the word ""Basic"" is misleading as if these were low quality cables.Since Apple's lightning cables have a major tendency for the cable to fray even if you are careful in how you remove them, it is a good idea to go to other sources for certified Lightning cables.The shell of the connector is thicker and longer than Apple's cables giving you more surface to disconnect and connect the cable. The smooth shell is very similar to the feel of Apples's cable and the cord while slightly thicker feels much sturdier.These are quality cables and half the price of Apples 2 meter long cable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WE5JV6OTKB55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S9N6OO#wasThisHelpful","R1WE5JV6OTKB55","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Size-wise this scale is rather larger and heavier than most bathroom scales.  Although since this scale is rated up to 400 pounds, being sturdy is a good thing. Aesthetically it is rather pleasing with the curved white face with the scale numbers displaying through. Very readable.The main point to this scale is phone interactivity and it must use Bluetooth LE as I was able to connect to the scale via their iPhone app without pairing. I used the 2.0 version of the software which works with this scale along with other items from the same company.It does have Apple HealthKit functionality so that when you get on the scale and use the app the weight is recorded and entered into HealthKit data automatically along with date and time. Access to the scale part of the app is through the hamburger menu (funny for a scale) and one menu click. The app also gives statistics data along with other information. Although you can see this data via the Apple Health app also.The scale defaults to Kilo's, but when you turn on the phone app it changes over to pounds. I suspect this is related to the country you are in for determining this.It uses 4 AA batteries so you don't have to go looking for special batteries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QRKG285ST08T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NF7DB1U#wasThisHelpful","R3QRKG285ST08T","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"More like 4.5 stars. Normally I would want to place this book at five stars, but as good as this book is, his novel ""Boy's life"" is his five star book.This book take a cue from the Poe story ""Fall of the House of Usher"", but totally builds on it. The firsts half of the book is chuck full of atmosphere. You are dragged into an ever expanding mystery. Other elements introduced seem like they could not be really part of the plot but move to a cohesive whole.Throughout I was wondering if I would be satisfied by the conclusion. Would it answer my questions satisfactorily? Would so much mystery end in a dud? That was certainly not the case. Questions were answered in a convincing way as I did not feel cheated at all, really quite the opposite. I've read a bunch of his books this year and once again ponder why he isn't as well known as Stephen King. I like King a lot, but Robert McCammon is more fulfilling to me as a story teller. I've read seven of his books this year and am thrilled that I have so many more to discover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RQ2WQKMRAOIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005T54GF6#wasThisHelpful","R2RQ2WQKMRAOIH","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Closer to 4.5 stars.I have always enjoyed stories about Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. But aspects of the story as often portrayed made it more of a tragedy  than I story I could fully embrace. T.H. White's ""The Once and Future King"" is one of my favorite retellings, but the same story elements take some of the enjoyment away.So I was delighted to find a retelling that takes most of the familiar elements of the story and provides a different interpretation without totally removing those elements. The idea of a heir of King Arthur's living in almost modern times and being called for some destiny provides an interesting idea. The unknowing heir Blanche starts to find that everything she had believed and thought about the world was quite different than the reality. This is a familiar format in fantasy books to have a mundane enter a totally different world. Still this book takes these ideas and creates a story out of them highly worth reading. A world that gives you the best of the romanticism and idealism of Camelot.The story was a little slow in development as these elements come into play. Although quickly the story was moving right along. There was really nothing I did not like about the story and was glad to immerse my self once again into this legend. Better yet I loved the ending.I became interested in this book when I saw an entry from the author on the Superversive Blog ""When Originality Is a Bad Thing"", http://www.ljagilamplighter.com/2015/04/01/superversive-blog-when-originality-is-a-bad-thing/","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZS1IZVGZLBYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0994233906#wasThisHelpful","RZS1IZVGZLBYT","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The idea of an author interacting with his characters as he passes the 4th wall (a television related term) is nothing new. I first came across it in Vonnegut's ""Breakfast of Champions."" The excellent film ""Stranger than Fiction"" brought this idea to life where a man starts to realize he is a character in a novel and comes to interact with the author. Recently John Scalzi did a take on this in his novel ""Redshirts.""Still I was intrigued to see this concept taken to the Fantasy genre to see how it was pulled off. There has often been a segment of this genre where someone from the real world (or mundane world as Piers Anthony puts it) becomes involved in another world whether it is urban fantasy or a total world in itself. I've always enjoyed this type of story arc with the characters amazement and adaptation. So there is an aspect of this here.The framework of this novel is that student Sedrick is maintaining a fan wiki for an epic fantasy series. As a major fan he puts in lots of time into this site. Something happens and he is contacted by inhabitants of this world for help. We have here a situation that takes Tolkien's idea of ""cocreation"" in a fuller sense where a writer has created a world and the inhabitants are suffering due to the brutal nature of his world building and characterizations. Where rewrites and fixing of continuity errors can have drastic affect on real people.This is a fun idea and mostly it is pulled off successfully. How does an author respond when someone tells him about this? What are his responsibilities and the ethics involved? What can be done to change the situation. This and others are the problems faced in this novel. I find it interesting that the novels and movie I referenced at that start of this review along with this book all also have a comic edge. There is good amount of humor involved in this story as the characters resolved the situations they find themselves in. I enjoyed the story as these ideas were played around with along with other aspects.One thread of the story involves traditional book publishing and the rise of independent authors. Along with that rise is the increasing interaction between an author and his fans. I think of someone like Scott Sigler that built a fanbase online via podcasting his novels along with an author created fan site and tons of self-promotion. The wiki described in this book and the interaction between fans on the wiki regarding a story is quite accurate along with social media components like a subreddit list that acts as a forum. These play a part in the novel. Although I think the use of occasional wiki pages with character exposition interleaved in this novel was a bit overdone.The author calls this ""Both satire and homage"" to the implied ""Game of Thrones."" Still I thought the story stood on its own and that the satire aspect certainly lead to humorous aspects of the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GSMR3WJOG0NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1507623739#wasThisHelpful","R2GSMR3WJOG0NS","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again Lent is coming around again in it‚Äôs a annual cycle. Yet with Easter being a movable feast we still are always a bit surprised by the start of Lent regardless of whether Ash Wednesday starts earlier or later than average. Lent is almost something you can look forward to. We know we need that spring cleaning of the soul and that we have some work to do to get our spiritual lives untangled. Still if we think of an upcoming Lent at all we also know that we want to make good use of it.Yet once Lent starts we can hardly wait for it to be over. The saying ‚Äúno plan survives contact with the enemy‚Äù is often true of Lenten plans and we do have an enemy that would disrupt any plan towards growing in holiness. So exactly how do you maintain a good Lent? No doubt there are plenty of strategies to do so that we learn to adapt to our own personalities.I‚Äôve always found spiritual reading greatly helpful in this, but our moving inward must help us also move outward in the world. Fasting is very useful, but it also has to move into the dimensions of the spiritual works.So I was presently surprised to find an excellent book with all this in mind. Marcellino D‚Äôambrosio sent me a couple of his recent books including 40 Days, 40 Ways: A New Look at Lent. While there is a treasury of books with daily meditations during Lent, this book has that solid core while also being filled with practical suggestions. These suggestions help with concrete examples of how to live the faith. To externalize what you are learning. To take us out of ourselves.His personable style brings what he has learned in his own life through examples easy to relate to. This book is something to help challenge you through Lent and to make of Lent what you always intended but still fell away like a New Year‚Äôs resolution. Two to three pages a day makes reading this through Lent quite doable.I especially liked this points at the end of the book regarding Easter and the Easter season. Lent gets all the attention, yet it is the joy of Easter we are striving towardsAfter reading it I now look at the reviews and see that my own opinion was matched by many others whose opinions I trust, including my previous bishop.Marcellino D‚ÄôAmbrosio offers the neophyte as well as the seasoned Catholic a potpourri of Lenten reflections that are as engaging as they are practical. If you want to fall more in love with Jesus, then nourish yourself with 40 Days, 40 Ways!‚Äî Victor Galeone, Bishop Emeritus of St. Augustine, Florida","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4GG6IIFWMZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616368942#wasThisHelpful","R4GG6IIFWMZ2","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first came across Alice Von Hildebrand while watching Mother Angelica Live I was rapidly impressed with her. Her quick wit, intelligence, and common sense was a delight. Since then I have been interested in what she had to say. Around the same time I became acquainted with the works of her late husband Dietrich Von Hildebrand. I have by no means fully dipped into all his works, but I want to go further. His Transformation in Christ is a book I dearly love.When her biography of her husband came out The Soul of a Lion: The Life of Dietrich von Hildebrand I quickly attained and read it. Such an amazing story and an equally amazing man. You would think somebody who was a named enemy of Hitler would have his story more well known. There is at least a new book out called My Battle Against Hitler: Faith, Truth, and Defiance in the Shadow of the Third Reich.When I read Soul of a Lion I wondered about his later years since the story ends, as I remember, after his escape and ultimately ending up in New York. Some of this is covered in Alice Von Hildebrand‚Äôs new book Memoirs of a Happy Failure. While this autobiography does go into how she met her future husband and some of her life with him, she is mostly quiet on her personal life in this regard except when there are interactions with her students.What this book does cover is her life growing up in Belgium before World War II and her subsequent move to the United States during the war. The book starts out with her on a ship headed for New York that was threatened by a German sub with orders to evacuate before being sunk. I was quite interested in her descriptions of being raised in a very Catholic culture and the descriptions of her family members including the roles they played during the war. There were differences in both sides of her family that caused some tension.The large majority of this book covers her years as a teacher at Hunter College which is part of the City University of New York. This was to be where she ended up teaching philosophy throughout her career. Now having heard her speak I was aware of the difficulties she had regarding students versed in moral relativism as she taught the objectivity of truth. I just didn‚Äôt realize that this was a continual philosophical battle.What shouldn‚Äôt have surprised me is that this was rather minor considering even worse problems with the other faculty and those above her. The stories she relates regarding how she was treated by her fellow academics in such a pitiless back-biting manner raises your ire as she relates them. A Darwinian survival of the fittest where the fittest meant you had the right politics and sneer regarding subjective truth. Part of this was due to her being a women, but no doubt a lot of it was due to her being Catholic or really for being a faithful Catholic. Academics have no problem with Catholics just as long as they don‚Äôt believe that stuff. She describes how her education as taught by nuns little prepared her for such an atmosphere of prejudice and ill will.What I enjoyed most was her stories of students. It was quite obvious her love of teaching and her love of her students. There are many wonderful stories regarding the opposition she got and when the truth of what she was saying clicked with many of her students. Even stories of students converting to the Catholic Church despite the fact that she never talked about the Church at all in her lectures. Not all the stories regarding her students go well and some are rather sad. Still there were several that came into the orbit of her personal life along with her husband. Despite the opposition she was getting from the school and the many attempts to sabotage her career and to force her to leave, she endured. It must have really annoyed them the number of students who elected to take her classes over other philosophy professors more in tune with the zeitgeist.The title of her autobiography is quite apt. From the measure of the academic world she was mostly a failure. From the measure of her students that was not correct and even ultimately the school had to grudgingly admit this. I enjoyed the good humor she uses as she relates all these episodes. Experiences that might leave many bitter, yet her happiness shines through along with her love of the truth.On a side note this book provides another example to me regarding the cultural revolution of the sixties. In that it was not as if everything was in good condition before then and that this was a sudden revolution. Her examples of attitudes in the 1950‚Äôs show just how much the culture was infected with moral relativism and that it was even worse in academia. Cultural termites had already weakened the foundations of the culture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0I9613R69NW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1618901265#wasThisHelpful","R3O0I9613R69NW","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As the introduction spells out:""Sacred Scripture speaks of our ongoing battles with the world, the flesh, and the Devil (see Jas 4:1‚Äì7). This book focuses on our struggle with the last of those three adversaries ‚Ä¶""He gives his reasons for concentrating on this aspect based on disbelief in Satan‚Äôs existence, lack of knowledge regarding resources available, and that even our struggles with the flesh and the world can be influenced by the Devil‚Äôs interference. This is a book of considerable balance and prudence. There are plenty of caveats for a book of this type and Paul Thigpen takes care to make all the proper distinctions. One of the important distinction is regarding aspects that are reserved for the priestly role and what the laity is able to do. These distinctions are reinforced throughout the book. This manual avoids the Saturday Night Live‚Äôs Church Lady cry of ‚ÄúCould it be SATAN?‚Äù while specifying the reality of spiritual warfare and demonic influence.The first part of the book is a primer on the scriptural and theological aspects of spiritual warfare. The reality and urgency of what are response should be is spelled out as we really do have a mortal enemy who wants to seek our destruction. While we are alive there can never be a ceasefire regarding spiritual warfare and spiritual pacifism is just surrender of our soul. I really enjoyed this whole section of the book as it lays out the theology reinforced with a solid bedrock of scriptural references.The second part of the book broken up into multiple sections providing the tools and the weapons for spiritual warfare.+ Church teaching about spiritual warfare from Catechisms, Councils, and Papal documents.+ Biblical reference that provides a glossary, biblical history involving the Devil and Demons, and related scriptural verses.+ Wisdom from the saints on spiritual warfare. Like his saint‚Äôs meditation book I totally loved this section for the wide range of pertinent quotes. This is a part of the book I will want to revisit from time to time.+ The last section includes specific prayers, devotions, and hymns related to spiritual warfare. This section is about a third of the book and is a great resource for prayer. Included in this are Rosary meditations for each mystery along with some very nicely written prayers from the author.So this is surely all you need to be interested in this book. Yet there is one more aspect that makes this book even better. That this manual was published like an ‚Äúold school‚Äù prayerbook meant to be kept at hand and well used. It is described as ‚ÄúPremium Ultrasoft with two-tone sewn binding, ribbon marker and gold edges.‚Äù This is just beautifully made.

"For the last two years my habit has been to re-read Pope Benedict XVI‚Äôs Jesus of Nazareth: The Infancy Narratives. Just perfect reading leading up to Christmas to review all the scriptures related to the story of Christmas. After reading a book review by William Newton I have found another book to add to that annual reading. Scott Hahn‚Äôs recent book Joy to the World: How Christ‚Äôs Coming Changed Everything (and Still Does).In some ways they are companion books especially as Joy to the World references Pope Benedict XVI book throughout. The underlying chronology is of course similar as you would expect when the primary sources are a limited number of passages in the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. Reading them together back-to-back they reinforced certain themes while also have different emphasis. If you line up 15 scripture scholars together you are likely to get 15 different opinions regarding reconciling some texts and that is also the case here to a small degree.In Joy to the World I especially enjoyed one chapter on the angels and his saying ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Christmas appears in the Gospels as an explosion of angelic activity.‚Äù I found this phrasing rather striking and such an apt descriptor. He then canvases the Old and New Testaments to all the appearances of angels. While angels are certainly not lacking in the Old Testament the arrival of Jesus really does bring in an explosion of angels. We also learn from Jesus that angels are really good at multitasking. The Guardian Angels can both guard us and worship the face of the father.‚ÄúSee that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven. (Mt 18:10)Don‚Äôt blame Scott Hahn for the multitasking observation since it is my own. Really Scott Hahn kept his punning to a minimum in this book. Still I was laughing over his observation comparing the styles of St. Matthew and St. Luke in a chapter regarding the Magi. There is much in Mr. Hahn‚Äôs writing style I appreciate as his love of scripture is always infectious. I also enjoy his phrasing of things.‚ÄúWe live in a world of marvels, but we are schooled to put these aside if they do not fit the broadest generalities in categories confirmed by the scientific method and approved by a magisterium of skeptics.‚ÄùAnother point he brought out that struck me and stuck with me:‚ÄúThough the Gospel is certainly rich in allegorical meaning, it is first of all history. If there is allegory in the infancy narratives, it is fashioned by God, and not simply with words, but rather with creation itself‚Äîwith the very deeds of sacred history. God writes the world the way human authors write words.‚ÄùThis observation really applies to all of scripture. There is just so much parallelism and echoes in scripture. Mark Twain said ‚ÄúHistory doesn‚Äôt repeat itself, but it does rhyme."" Reading salvation history there is more than rhyming involved, and an agency involved with God as poet. All the crooked lines of human history being straightened with repeating refrains. Scott Hahn goes into some of these parallels as they relate to the infancy narratives such as the parallels between the New Testament Joseph and the Old Testament Joseph. While he doesn‚Äôt reference the parallelism of Mary as the new Ark of the Covenant in this book he has covered it elsewhere.

I usually find clever titles combing words to be a bit gimmicky.Still there is a solid story behind it focusing on two groups of people in the aftermath of killer virus. The problem I find with most dystopian novels is that the premise may be very interesting but I never totally buy in to how the society had collapsed to the premise.  This novel avoids that in a couple of ways. One there is a disaster, but it is not total. The effects regarding these two groups is more about the aftermath and traveling to a safer location after the collapse. As such I found the plot rather believable especially regarding how the government would react along with individuals.As a first novel there are weaknesses in the plot such as an apparent plot point that never really goes anywhere as far as I could tell. Still I liked the characters and this being a fairly decent dystopian novel you get to wondering what you would do in the same situation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XAZ5GVJMFPTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4VD7PS#wasThisHelpful","R2XAZ5GVJMFPTM","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For some book reviews I am almost tempted just to mention that some author has a new book out and that should be sufficient to pique your interest.Case in point is Peter Kreeft‚Äôs new book Practical Theology: Spiritual Direction from St. Thomas Aquinas. This is an author always worth reading. Since he is also a rather prolific author, directing your attention to specific books of his is also worth doing.Peter Kreeft‚Äôs books have had a positive impact on my life. His book Handbook of Christian Apologetics coauthored with Fr. Tacelli really helped me in my limbo from atheism to belief. It was the book‚Äôs format like St. Thomas Aquinas‚Äô Summa Theologiae with objections and the answering of objections that helped me to get passed some of my doubts. That I didn‚Äôt have to jettison my reason for faith and in fact required fuller use of it.In the intervening years I have found his other books to be helpful also. His latest book Practical Theology has quickly become my favorite book of his. The concept of the book is rather simple. Peter Kreeft uses St. Thomas Aquinas works and organizes them in a way beneficial as spiritual direction. As he reminds us this Doctor of the Church wrote his Summa Theologiae for ‚Äúbeginners‚Äù and that the same audience this book is intended for. Still it is rather hard for most people without a solid philosophical background to easily read St. Thomas‚Äô works. I remember once picking up ‚ÄúThe Pocket Aquinas‚Äù and being totally lost trying to read it. Fortunately that is not a problem here. Besides the saints words Mr. Kreeft provides an abundance of clarifications. Even when quoting passages he briefly interjects information to clear up St. Thomas‚Äô meaning. After these passages he then further illuminates it.Another aspect of this book that I enjoyed was just how focused it was. For the most part the topics are contained to just one page with few going beyond that. Combined with Peter Kreeft‚Äôs playfulness you have a nice touch of humor that doesn‚Äôt intrude on the topic. When I first received this book I figured at 366 pages I could read it in a week and then prepare a review. That plan was quickly wrecked as I more slowly read through the book and let it marinate in my mind. This was not a book I wanted to rush through. In fact I think I will shortly read it again. Only this time I will limit myself to reading just one or two chapters a day. With 358 topics this book is a good candidate for a topic a day to read through in a year book. Flannery O‚ÄôConnor use to spend at least 15 minutes with the Angelic Doctor each night.One aspect of St. Thomas Aquinas‚Äô writings that really spoke to me was not just the answers he gave to questions, but the questions he asked. This really brought to my mind this comment from G.K. Chesterton.Catholic doctrine and discipline may be walls; but they are the walls of a playground. - Orthodoxy, Chapter 9I have no doubt the saint would have totally agreed to this comment as his theological output was a playing in this playground. There are many who can‚Äôt see the forest for the trees and can‚Äôt see the playground because of the boundaries. There were questions he asked that I times I had wondered about, but figured nobody would have giving them any serious attention. So the best thing about ‚ÄúPractical Theology‚Äù is that it helped me to play in this playground and to remember that spiritual direction and spiritual reading can really fill you with joy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HGVLQAYWDRTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586179683#wasThisHelpful","R1HGVLQAYWDRTC","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John C. Wright‚Äôs latest SF short story collection is called The Book of Feasts & Seasons.Stories are arranged from the Liturgical Calendar starting with ‚ÄúThe Solemnity of Mary, The Holy Mother of God.‚Äù This provides a thematic presentation of the stories although many of the stories would only generally fit into specific feasts and seasons. All of them are SF stories and include time traveling, contacts with aliens, and even a ghost story. The first story ‚ÄúThe Meaning of Life as Told Me by an Inebriated Science Fiction Writer in New Jersey‚Äù is really rather fun.While I enjoyed all the stories, some of them were exceptionally good. Short stories are not my favorite medium, yet I found several stories I want to revisit later. Two of the stories I had read before. ‚ÄúThe Ideal Machine‚Äù was one I read in volume 1 of the ‚ÄúSci Phy Journal‚Äù not that long ago. Still I enjoyed it even more on the second time around as a unique alien visitation story that takes place in a parish with a priest and two military men. The other one I had read before was ‚ÄúYes, Virginia there is a Santa Claus‚Äù which was posted on his blog. A very powerful story perfect for Christmas or really the Feast of St. Nicholas"". A story that brought tears to my eyes again as did another story in the collection.The rather unique ghost story ‚ÄúPale Realms of Shade‚Äù was one of these and one that fit with the theme of the book. One of other themes of this book was marriage and sacrifice and surprisingly by the title ‚ÄúQueen of the Tyrant Lizards‚Äù fit in there. His explorations of the consequences of time travel as in his other short story collection are really fresh and unique as in this specific story. The one titled ‚ÄúNativity‚Äù is another time travel story going into a territory explored before regarding going back into the time of Christ. In ‚ÄúNativity‚Äù we a presented with a husband‚Äôs grief over the death of his wife and his travel into the past seeking answers to his questions. The question of evil and whether anything ultimately matters. I hadn‚Äôt found time traveling stories into the time of Christ very worthwhile in the past. Some were much better than others such as Brandon Sanderson‚Äôs novella ‚ÄúLegion‚Äù, but none of them really made contact with me; much less contact with the premise. ‚ÄúNativiy‚Äù presented in the Advent section of the book is great Advent reading which contains both the wonder of good SF along with the wonder of Christ and was the other story that brought tears to my eyes.As the theme of this collection suggests these are stories that have a philosophical and theological dimension. Yet this is not pious SF that sacrifices storytelling for piety. These are excellent stories that happen to have a deeper dimension. His description of crucifixion in ‚ÄúNativiy‚Äù was especially vivid to me and strangely I would love a set of reflections on the Rosary from his hands. There was a realism in the movie ‚ÄúThe Passion of the Christ‚Äù that I liked, yet some sentences in this story brought the horror of crucifixion fuller to my understanding, especially some very unglamorous aspects. Well done Mr. Wright.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5P1L46RD285F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEDGIQW#wasThisHelpful","R5P1L46RD285F","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After listening to Tim Staples for many years on Catholic Answers I was always hoping he would finally get around to writing a book. He has produced lots of audio CDs along with one book containing a collection of his excellent columns in This Rock (now renamed) magazine. So I finally got my wish with Behold Your Mother - A Biblical and Historical Defense of the Marian Doctrines.The Marian doctrines and the high place Mary occupies for Catholics was never really a problem with me during my conversion. Once I got over the ‚ÄúYes there is a God‚Äù and accepted the authority of the Catholic Church I was in the wanting to learn more mode. Still Catholic radio has certainly demonstrated that this is very often a stumbling block for Protestants. Whether they are heading towards the Church or just dumbfounded by this it is an obvious problem to address in the area of apologetics.With Tim Staples bing an ex-Assembly of God Youth Pastor he has experienced this reaction personally. The focus of this book is largely of an apologetics natu re in working with Protestants, but can also be useful for Catholics not quite sure what the big deal is about Mary.As a one volume work in popular apologetics it really packs a punch. As the subtitle suggests it looks at all the Marian Doctrines along with a lot of the titles associated with the Blessed Mother. I really enjoyed the tone of the book which was instructional without being dry. Common and other objections are dealt with during each chapter along with later chapters and appendixes providing deeper information.Tim really did his homework and there are a wealth of footnotes. These footnotes go beyond just references, but also contain further information along with fuller quotes. For a change instead of just skipping over the footnotes, I actually read many of them. As you would expect there is also plenty of Patristic references matched up to the chapters in the book.Al Kresta on his radio show when talking about this book said that he wished such a work was available in his Protestant days as he would have returned to the Church much sooner. This illustrates exactly why a book like this is so important since there are so many objections to Catholicism based on our special veneration due to the Blessed Virgin Mary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGSV9FN2TRYCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1NMGW6#wasThisHelpful","RGSV9FN2TRYCC","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I had already read some of these essays on the authors blog, still I enjoyed reading all the essays together as they bind together nicely. I find it very interesting how he looks at certain books and stories and analyzes them according to the demand of the story. Case in points some stores that were more didactic and the story suffered because the primary point was the message not the story. This is a problem that is only getting worse as politically correct pressures mount that certain types of characters must appear and that certain morality must be taught. The actual story be damned just as long as you have the correct quota for the ""right"" kind of character.  I really enjoyed how he takes such stories apart dissecting them showing where the stories betrayed themselves for the overriding message.  He is quite funny when doing this. Still while taking apart such stories he is careful to note how these authors are very good writers and praises their skill, but  critiques the short story or novel not the character of the author.One essay departs a bit from this when it critiques the second hobbit movie. Quite a hilarious review and as i felt the blow of the same ""stupid hammer"" repeatedly during the movie one I can agree with. Still he praises when the movie goes right.The weave of story critique is highly woven with his critical view of political correctness and the lies that we are suppose to affirm why saying how awesome the Emperor's new wardrobe is.  While these essays have a polemical tone I can't think of anything in them I disagree with and again he is always careful in attacking ideas and not people. As he so dislikes the political correctness two-minute hate and how it is directed to people who dare to not call heterodoxy orthodoxy. Where your motives can only be evil and their is no effort at understanding or even presenting their case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HFH60I81U1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4D7LO6#wasThisHelpful","R23HFH60I81U1K","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit that at first I liked absolutely nothing about these headphone.  First off I found this style of headphone extremely awkward to put on and adjust into my ear and when I saw the tiny buttons on the ear pieces I figured these would be unusable.Still I did finally manage to put the headphones on correctly and I also found that the tiny buttons such as for power were easily accessed.  I was rather surprised how good these sounded compared to in-ear sets I have worn and they projected rather well.Where this style of headphones excelled is for exercise. I have had bluetooth headphones fail because of sweat and that is not a problem here.  They were pretty much perfect for exercise and staid in place. So this would be a perfect application for them.The downsides are is this style does not cancel outside noise so I found them unusable while mowing.  Since they are so compact battery life will not give you a full day of use.So these have not become my primary set, but for exercising they are great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WON8X4C57L6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJLMBSO#wasThisHelpful","R1WON8X4C57L6A","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having gone through a lot of headphones with most just not lasting I got fed up and just bought the pair recommended at the wirecutter site. Really couldn't be happier. These are very sturdy and connect quickly with a simple slider switch. I have also found being able to connect to two devices at a time quite worthwhile and I am using this feature daily.Adjusting the volume by sliding your finger on the surface of the disk became natural very quickly and the double tap to skip/fast forward is as simple as it can be.  Listening to podcasts and being able to quickly skip commercials is a bonus. I also really like the multiple ways to connect. Being able to use the included cord to plug in directly is another feature I found myself using.As for sound it is quite good for Bluetooth and the range is right at the maximum distance for Bluetooth. Battery life is the best I have ever had for a Bluetooth headset. Before I had to recharge each night. This set one day I forget to recharge and I was still able to use it heavily the following day.They are quite comfortable for on-ear headphones and I wear them most of the day with zero discomfort. Time will tell if they last and as I said I seem to be rather hard on headphones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GYAYDDNOVIFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFO14W8#wasThisHelpful","R2GYAYDDNOVIFK","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I can't remember being so filled with a novella. I feel as if I read a 400-plus page fantasy novel. So much to unpack from it and think about and the story is really something I want to re-read.It contained an interesting premise where a group of children had previously gone on an adventure together and survived the quest in some instance of fairyland. Now they are adults who have put such ideas behind them. A new challenge threatens their own lands. I liked the playfulness is part of this idea.  To be challenged to go on a quest and yet don't you have bills to pay and a job to maintain?There are slight echoes of Narnia without some of the ham-fisted allegory. A deep understanding of human nature makes this quest go off not quite as you would expect. John C. Wright has a talent of invoking much with his words without having to go deeper into side stories.  Just his phrases paint a picture of events such that your own mind renders the  details to fill it out. There is always a sense when reading you are participating in a story, in this case I felt I was participating by imagining backstory.I found this story totally satisfying and no doubt I will find it the same in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19AQODEQMI6SQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9760GO#wasThisHelpful","R19AQODEQMI6SQ","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read his ""Awake in the Night Land"" not that long ago and was very impressed by that collection of novellas and short stories that had such an other-worldly feel.  Short stories for me usually leave me a bit unsatisfied in their completeness.  In the case of ""Awake in the Night Land"" and this collection I felt no such lack as there was a definite completeness in the storytelling.First off I just love the word Metachronopolis.  The world just rolls around in your mind and really describes something.  What I especially enjoyed about this collection of time travel stories is the exploration of a moral view of time travel that goes way beyond ""killing your grandfather paradoxes"".  They explore the human consequence of time travel and repercussions of what would inevitably happen. Certainly an interesting take on the time travel genre.Plus John C. Wright can really come up with cool future weaponry.  His ""Count to the Eschaton Sequence"" contained some of this and some of the stories in this involved some quite sophisticated smart guns that were rather audacious. One of the stories had a time traveling robot bodyguard  that proved another great concept. These stories were certainly lighter in tone than the Night Land stories and contained much that was amusing. There wasn't a weak story in the bunch and I thoroughly enjoyed all of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O1GYD18TOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L6WI3PU#wasThisHelpful","R3O1GYD18TOL","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again the wealth of Correia world building and cast of characters allows him to explore a character in the Monster Hunter world.  This time it is Agent Franks who we have learned something about as to his nature, but here we get the full origin story  which is rather surprising.  In fact I found it to be an intriguing take in its theological aspects.  While i missed more involvement from characters from Monster Hunter International, still there is a lot going on here and action galore.  I especially enjoy his characters for being multi-dimensional  and not just static. Characters who you come to dislike in previous books also grow and you grow to respect them.

"Almost everything about this book amused me. From the title to the cover to the contents. The idea of it was so promising and thankfully it delivered.It is hard not to think about the ‚ÄúHitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy‚Äù when reading this book. Although there are few real parallels other than that they are both really funny and take place in space.The story is told from the view of Sasha, the Self-Arresting near-Sentient Heuristic Android. While not a copy of Marvin, the Paranoid Android, there is a good amount of humor at his expense. His master Rex Nihilo is a traveling conman who is always barely a step ahead of the law and financial ruin.The running jokes in this book often involve Star Wars tropes and other Star Wars intersections as Rex Nihilo accidentally becomes involved with the rebels. The crazy adventures that result because of his working with/against the rebels is quite fun and I enjoyed the sheer ridiculousness of most of it.There is also a certain amount of playfulness with people‚Äôs names and semi-hidden pop references. One inference close to the start of the book involving both Dune and Gone With the Wind certainly had me chuckling. Really I read most of this book maintaining a grin.By the way this book is titled as a Rex Nihilo Adventure it looks like a beginning to a new series. Some of the plot reveals at the end put a different light on what was really going on and I would like to see this developed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FQ90QIGGM0XX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5X8OYS#wasThisHelpful","R2FQ90QIGGM0XX","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I enjoyed the previous two books in the series, this one blew me away. A slow start soon led to a frenetic pace of action and plot reveals that held up through the rest of the book.This series has so many cool ideas in it that they could easily had been provided as a basis for other books.  Space opera with plausible science brings it down to earth and up to the skies. Yet as cool as the action was, it was the interplay between between Menelaus and ""Blackie"" that provides so much entertainment. Especially as it is far from typical hero/villain interplay. The war of ideas and nuances in outdoing each other is just fun to watch and just went you thought you understood what was going on you descend down another layer of the onion.I just found myself smiling through most of the book. Although this was not a quick read as the book is os dense in characters and ideas you have to read carefully to keep track.

Music is another story because of the sound quality.

"In Michael O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs new book Voyage to Alpha Centauri he enters the genre of Science Fiction. This book is both in some ways totally different from his previous books and very similar. All the themes he explores are present in this story. Elements present in his ‚ÄúChildren of the Last Day‚Äù series are especially present such as an intrusive government and the loss of religious freedom. The collision of these factors providing tension along with personal conversion. Yet some of this is handled more tangentially than his previous books.Neil Ruiz de Hoyos as a young man meets with an accident that both marks him and opens up a new vista for him. His later career as a physicist bring him two Nobel prizes. His work leads partially to the construction of a ship that goes on an expedition to Alpha Centauri where he is a passenger. We see the voyage through his journal entries where he writes about the voyage, his life and childhood, and the discoveries they encounter on a planet in the system of Alpha Centauri. An epistolary novel works quite well when it comes to covering the large amount of time involved in such a voyage where journal entries can just highlight what is going on in the main.As a man Neil is both private and reaching out for friendships. A man raised in a Catholic family, but now with no faith which has been supplanted by a scientific skepticism. Yet somebody who is also skeptical regarding a form of government enforced political correctness and just following along with societal trends. Despite what he encounters and learns from his small core of friends there are some things he would rather explain away than to truly understand. This all provides the backdrop for the momentous events that occur on the trip out and ultimately what they learn on the planet they explore.I am already a Michael O‚ÄôBrien and my first love when it comes to books is Science Fiction. So I am totally delighted to have these two together. Just considering the SF aspects of the novel there is a lot to enjoy and adding the deeper theological and societal dimensions you have so much more than presented in so much rather shallow SF. The plot that develops is rather stunning and ties together nicely the blend of SF and theology. I especially liked how many levels the novel had and that the prevalent themes on the journey out became quite different on arrival. Some of the subtler Biblical themes also added to the enjoyment in that he didn‚Äôt have to hit you over the head with them. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15VOZI5MN5CZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586178326#wasThisHelpful","R15VOZI5MN5CZJ","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Since these in-ear plugs are rather short you can comfortably wear them even while laying down on your side, but they are also harder to insert and remove from your ear.I also liked the cord which is a rubberized flat ribbon since they really don't have a tendency to tangle.Like other Creative headphones these include a microphone and a controller.  The controller uses an analog volume switch that slides up and down along with a single button to pause/play with a click or select the next track with an extended click.

"A typical plot involving Biblical relics, conspiracies, and trying to make a discovery before you get killed. Still the book pulls it off fairly well with a good amount of excitement and the resolving of the mystery.The only thing that really kept me from liking the book even more was the whole subplot involving the Jars used by Jesus at the wedding at Cana.  There was suppose to be all this mythical history involving them along with prophecies and hidden messages and a Church history storyline.  This is all rather Da Vinci Code territory and while of course this is a novel of fiction, it works better when there is some grounding of truth that can be weaved into the story. So this aspect left me rather cold.  Still I liked the characters and was entertained.I was interested in this book in the first place as it was put out by Tuscany Press a Catholic fiction publisher dedicated to great Catholic fiction (properly understood). While there are Catholic elements it is not a hit-you-over-the-head-bit-of-Catholic-fiction (which is a good thing).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32M5V791R5Y44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DV639YE#wasThisHelpful","R32M5V791R5Y44","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new book by Francisco Garcia-Julve who is a Catholic philosopher and polymath - is quite an interesting book of a string of thoughts. The way it is written is as a long series of thought/statements that often engage in Chestertonian paradox and wordplay. There are no chapters, but successive statements often build on a previous idea or restate things in another way.Not the type of book that you would just sit down and read from end to end, but more like one to dip into meditatively from time to time. Though I did find myself returning to it each day for a week as I quite enjoyed his snippets of thought.It is like reading a twitter feed from a very wise person as each thought is quite compact. In fact the author really should start a Twitter feed and tweet much of the book. Of course when you have a book composed in this way not every thought is engaging, but there is a high ration of those that make you stop, think, and evaluate. The wordplay, paradox, and inversion can be jarring at times, but that is mainly when you respond to it the most.To better illustrate this here is just a very small sample of some of the thoughts that struck me specifically. This also gives you an idea about the formatting of the book.If Laplace's dictum--in Carl Sagan's version--that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proofs should apply to anything, it would be abortion.* * *We would believe some supernatural truths, such as the Eucharistic presence, if they were empirical; and we would not believe some empirical truths, such as particle-wave duality, if they were supernatural.* * *To think of oneself as incapable of being a saint is not humility but cowardice.* * *We don't think that we can't be saints because we know ourselves but because we do not know God.* * *It's of little use trying to be a theologian without trying to be a saint first.It's of little use trying to be a theologian without trying to be a saint first.* * *You are not the exception in having tortured and killed Jesus, but you can be in atoning for it.* * *Conversion to God is like a marriage in reverse, where they are two until death makes them one.* * *We only try right when wrong fails.* * *You must, by all means, seek happiness--but only provided it is not your own.* * *We cannot understand God, but we can understand that we cannot understand God.* * *There are two kinds of faults: the inexcusable and our own.* * *We must behave so that people who know us outside the church will not be surprised to see us in church.* * *The attention we give to ourselves, we don't give to the others.Unlike so many movie trailers - this is just a small sampling of the good bits.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KKH1L4YYBLYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493530925#wasThisHelpful","R2KKH1L4YYBLYR","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really loved her Prospero trilogy, but this new series kicks it up a notch.There is a certain tip-of-the-hat to the Harry Potter series while not just being a clone. She acknowledges multiple writers for influence including Rowling.So while the situation is similar of people in training for various magical arts there are a lot of difference in the magic schemes and the world building. Plenty of nuances to make things interesting. Really the world building is quite excellent as is the attention to detail regarding characters.The protagonist Rachel Griffin is especially interesting and while and while she has certain magical potential it is her eidetic memory that sets her apart and the way she user her memory adds to her capability. This being the first book in the series we see the action ramp up rather quickly and also see a hint of the extreme danger developing. There is darkness, yet there is also a light humorous touch.While I really enjoyed the Harry Potter series there were certain moral choices I had caveats about.  For example the amount of lying and how there was with no consequences for it.  In this story the morality of lying is taken up at times and while there are secrets there is no overt hiding information from people who deserved to know the truth.  I also like that Rachel was not from the typical YA broken family and from an intact family. That she grew up knowing magic along with her brothers and sisters who had excelled at school.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKT3IPM8HC2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937051870#wasThisHelpful","R1MKT3IPM8HC2K","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read several biographies on Pope Francis and they all did a fairly good job covering his life up to his accepting the chair of Peter. While covering the basic facts rather well and giving some measure of the man, I really did not come away feeling I knew him at all really.This new book put out by Ignatius Press is more than just another biography. Pope Francis - Our Brother, Our Friend: Personal Recollections about the Man Who Became Pope by Alejandro Bermudez is something a bit different. The book is a series of interviews of people who knew him as a priest, bishop or both. While some basic questions were asked of each person this lead down several pathways in intriguing ways.The first half of the book were interviews of Jesuits and I found these interviews the most interesting. These interviews for me gave me more of the measure of the man. Especially since all the Jesuits interviewed were not exactly Jorge Bergoglio fanboys. There were plenty of back-handed compliments considering Bergoglio theological orthodox in that he was not considered ""adventurous"" enough. You could certainly read behind the scenes that some of these Jesuits considered this a defect in what they thought was an otherwise goodman. Still there a a common thread of great respect for the man even from his theological adversaries. He seemed to have won them over not by pretending that these theological differences did not matter, but that he could deeply care for and be concerned with a person he had fundamental disagreements with. This fact was evidenced throughout the various interviews interviews.Some of the questions asked were what you would expect since they were the hot button ones concerning his life as a priest and then bishop. For example the time he spent as a Jesuit superior at a rather young age during a very difficult time in Argentina along with his actions regarding the dirty war there. All the interviewees were asked about their own reaction when the announcement was made that he was elected. The answers to this question didn't really add much to the book and it is no surprise that they were surprised.Other interviews came from layman and some of the journalists involved with books released about him or his book project with Rabbi Skorka (who was also interviewed).We have heard a good deal about his simplicity and austere lifestyle. His great concern for the individual in talking and listening to them. There are some great stories in this book in how he takes action totally uniting what he preached with what he did. Another great thread is how much he is a man of prayer and also a very capable spiritual director. One of the questions I had wondered about the Pope is his leadership abilities? How he came to make decisions and how he implemented and followed up? There are plenty of good and holy people that have poor leadership skills - Pope Celestine V come to mind regarding this. The answer to this really came through regarding his leadership abilities. That this is a man who seeks advice, but is not afraid to make a decision. Someone who expects things do be done correctly and as he specified. Willing to let people know when things were not being done right, yet showing mercy to those who messed up.I found this passage by Father Angel Rossi, S.J. to be indicative about what others said about him:So if I would have to single out only one thing that always remains with me--even though I do not know if I practice it, I am nevertheless grateful for it--it is his sense of mercy. Very few times have I seen mercy at the depths to which he lives it, and it does not consist in allowing anything whatever to happen, but, rather, in taking charge of the hearts of others and suffering and enjoying life with others. And he brought this to the other person with a very refined charity, a charity of gestures.While it doesn't really matter if I approve of the Pope or not, I am rather looking forward to seeing his leadership style of both collaboration and decisive decision making as it plays out in the years to come. In his short time as Pope I don't think we have really seen this played out yet. Although for example his appointment of eight Cardinal advisors is part of his leadership pattern.One other interesting insight in the book is the events around a particular Te Deum Mass. These Te Deum Masses are common in Latin America on their national independence day. At the time President of Argentina Cristina Fern√°ndez and her husband (the ex-president) took as an insult the homily given by Cardinal Bergoglio. It seems likely his homily on poverty and service was aimed at everybody and they out of arrogance thought it was all about them. This event and his later speaking out forcefully against so-called same-sex marriage got him charged as interfering in politics. Some of this is related by Lilian Negre a pro-life and pro-family senator who often consulted with the Cardinal.Overall I found this to be an intriguing book and one that helped me flesh out the man beyond the normal biographical details.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFM5XLV9ZZNFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586178725#wasThisHelpful","RFM5XLV9ZZNFX","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is not that much you can really say about a battery pack beyond the obvious. Still after a month of use I now wonder how I got along with out it.  With two usb ports and a serious amount of backup power it is super useful. The power indicator is a nice touch where you just shake it to see the current battery level based on which of the four lights light up.I have a usb stereo headset I use for work that is rather limited on battery life.  Using this i kept it charged up when I was in my car so I never ran out of juice during use.Where it really became useful was keeping my iPhone charged up on a trip.  I like to use the Waze mapping app and it certainly will drain the iPhone over a day of use.  Instead now I could drive around all day and part of the night with only a quarter of the battery being used.I also liked the design aesthetics as it is rather pleasing to look at.The only distractor is that it supplies a micro usb charging cable for its use, but no A/C adapter.

"An interesting premise for mostly a straight-forward piece of military space opera.  The story centers around two men abducted from earth from different generations who find them selves called up to help their captors.  There is a bit of an odd couple interplay as these two men hold very different world views when it comes to the use of force. This aspect plays partly in the story and both men's views are challenged during the course of the story. There are also other interesting aspects regarding their working with the aliens including some more familiar in a Fantasy adventure.Mostly I enjoyed this book.

"Over the years I have heard bits and pieces of author and literary critic Joseph Pearce's conversion story. I always wanted to hear more since the basic details seemed so wild. I usually find conversion stories as a genre fascinating since while there are similarities in each one, there is also a uniqueness to the individual. Some conversion stories seem much more dramatic such as St. Paul who went from persecutor to Apostle. Joseph Pearce's conversion story certainly has those striking elements especially how radical his previous convictions were.So I was quite delighted when I saw that Saint Benedict Press was coming out with Race With the Devil: My Journey from Racial Hatred to Rational Love. For those who do not know anything about his conversion story the subtitle gives some idea.What surprised me in this book was just how involved Joseph Pearce had been involved in racist and anti-Catholic movements. He was not just on the periphery of these movements, but was an organizer of them. An editor of the newspaper for the National Front and his involvement from the age of fourteen on is hard to fathom. As a reader you want to come to understand how a young man could turn down this road of racist hate and to devote his life to it.His father's racism certainly played a part in this and was an influence. One of the things I loved most about this book was the way people in Joseph Pearce's life were described. This was especially true in regards to his father's who he wrote about lovingly, flaws and all. His father was full of contradictions being vocally racist and anti-Catholic he could as the author describes ""genuinely love his fellow man."" I can totally understand this. While in the Navy I only met a couple of vocal racists. One I worked with tried to convince me that the music of Jimi Hendrix was actually written and performed by Robin Trower. He had many such crazy racist and misogynist opinions, but when it came to working with others he treated them quite decently.His portrayal of the complexities of his father really carries on throughout the book regarding the intricacies of the people he worked with in such evil movements. You see the friendships he developed through his eyes and come to understand something more about them than just the corrupting worldview they inhabited. This is a story of redemption and the hope for the redemption of others.The various chapters first deal with his dissent into racism and the various influences and philosophies that he thought confirmed his choices. His writing put him at the center of the National Front which he worked for full time. Soccer hooliganism also became an outlet for his racial hatred. This carried on to later becoming involved in the Troubles in Northern Ireland supporting the Protestant loyalists against the hated Catholics. His attempt to stir up even more trouble resulted in what he called ""flirting with terrorism."" As a reaction to ""Rock against racism"" he started ""Rock against Communism"" which was largely a skinhead phenomenon as he describes. He was very involved in promoting this effort along with writing about this music in every issue of the Bulldog. He was jailed twice under the Race Relations Act because of his writings. The first time he was jailed he left just as firm in his convictions as when he entered and he and others saw him as a martyr to the cause. By the time he went back to jail his ideas were experiencing a transformation. Retaining his racism while trying to hold in tension other things he was learning.It was these other literary influences that were opening him up. G.K. Chesterton was one of these great influences and many others followed including Belloc and C.S. Lewis. Yet at first he was only opening himself up to what he found compatible with his viewpoint especially as regard their social vision and alternative to big government.""Even AS Chesterton, Belloc and Lewis were working their unseen and grace-filled magic, enlightening my mind and healing my heart imperceptibly, I continued to pursue the paths of radical politics as if nothing was changing.""I think many converts can identify with this in some respect. Being opened to something higher while holding to our previous opinions. Looking back it becomes hard to see how we could hold such things in tension not seeing the contradictions.Yet the seeds were planted and by the time he finished his second prison sentence he was not the same man who had served the first on. His path out of racism and into the Catholic Church was now on a slow course as his changing attitude was putting him at odds with his personal relationships.This is such a deeply satisfying biography and conversion story. If I would have seen him as a young man I would have written him off as unredeemable scum. Like the racists it is easy to group people and just write them off. Our hatred for such a philosophy translates to hatred of the person with no willing of the good towards them. In this book he describes a couple of encounters that deeply affected him in regards to people that treated him in a manor that transcended the way he acted and appeared. This is such an unlikely story of racist to biographer and literary critic and such an insightful writer. Yet the movement of grace is wonderful to behold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PC0PUVD790YD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161890065X#wasThisHelpful","R1PC0PUVD790YD","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having admired the reporting and coverage provided by Ann Carey regarding women in religious life in the United States I had been interested in reading her book ""Sisters in Crisis."" Considering this book was first published in 1997 I had wished for an updated version especially considering recent history. So I was delighted to see Sisters in Crisis Revisited: From Unraveling to Reform and Renewal which exactly fulfilled my desire.There was a lot of information I wanted to see regarding the history of women religious in the United States from mostly the sixties forward. Exactly how did we come to the current situation and exactly who were the people that had a fundamental influence on this is something I am very interested in. As a convert I am always seeking to fill in my lack of knowledge regarding the Church in the United States.A book of this type can become easily polemical and just come down to ""religious habits good"", ""pant suits bad"" along with various stereotypes.From the author:""Finally, I am uncomfortable with using the terms liberal and conservative for religious orders because of the political connotations of the terms and also because they carry negatie images for many people. Therefore, I follow the example of sociologist Helen Rose Fuchs Ebaugh by using the term change-oriented to describe sisters of religious institutes inclined to seek a new definition of religious life by expanding the boundaries usually associated with the religious state. I use the term traditional to describe sisters or institues that adhere to the traditional understanding of religious life as contained in Vatican II documents and other Church teachings. Neither term should be construed as inherently negative.""I thinks this was a good decision as I have also dropped using terms like liberal, conservative, progressive etc when describing Catholics as much as possible. Even if I might quibble with the term change-oriented, I find it useful here.In 2009 when the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith announced a formal doctrinal Assessment of the LCWR and then later the Doctrinal Assessment itself I remember the news being reported as if this was something totally out of left-field and such a surprise. This books shows that if anything it was decades later then it could have been. Still the CDF acts slowly and deliberately and there are many good reasons for this.This is quite a comprehensive history detailing both all of the personalities involved and the sequences of events. Over and over again I was impressed just how much research was involved. Even more I was impressed by the writing style that lays out all the information without becoming just a dry regurgitation of facts. Mostly the author just lets the facts of the actual history tell the story with minimal editorial content. Ann Carey's own comments and opinions are short and to the point and nicely punctuate the history. Basically they are snark-free, although you can note the authors astonishment at times regarding the history she is putting forth.There was just so much I learned from this book that really helped me fill in the gaps. As much as I enjoyed it the book does not exactly make for joyful reading. The author describes how much of this came about as a ""perfect storm"" that took place among the cultural storm of the sixties and the false narrative of how Vatican II was going to change everything. The fact that religious life really needed a renewal is something easy to forget. There were many aspects of religious life that needed updating or a second look at. The education of women in religious life had been deficient and was only just starting to be addressed. The high numbers of those in religious life in the early sixties partly hid the fact that the healthiness of these religious orders was not all that it should have been.Really it seems that not only did the baby get thrown out with the bathwater, but that the bath was thrown out also. The term change-oriented is accurate in that it seems change-for-change sake was the order of the day. The Vatican's call for updating and experimentation was mostly met with a giddy-excitement of the possibilities for new ways of living religious life. What later became knows as ""The spirit of Vatican II"" seems to be quite evident in this early thinking. Unfortunately it seems the majority of women religious did not actually get to see the documents of Vatican II or were treated with some early translations that were not as accurate as they could have been. Word at the time that Canon Law was also going to be rewritten caused even more turmoil and the false expectation of the changes to be made and the false assumption regarding the applicability of the current Canon Law and other Church documents.There were so many parts of this history that were very frustrating to read. It was not that tens of thousands of those in religious life decided that everything was now in flux and acceptable. Mostly it seems to me that there were a dedicated core of women who came to believe in a totally different view regarding how religious life is to be lived that often had much more of a political identity and a push towards some specific social justice issues. Over and over you see the names of many of these individuals repeated as part of different groups and efforts. Ann Carey describe how some of this happened as a coup and that seems rather accurate. The transition of the US Conference of Major Superiors of Women's Institutes (CMSR) to the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR) is rather an amazing story.What surprised me was just how much dissent, equivocations, and disdain for the so-called institutional Church there was at the start of these events. Documents and guidance from the Church were often met by a very negative response. Any intervention from bishops and the Vatican was sometimes described as violence. If they were not consulted they considered it violent even as they took actions without consulting others in their orders. Some of the behavior I have noticed from the LCWR is quite evident in its history. For example dialogue meaning we are willing to enter into dialogue with you as a delay tactic or until you just give in. How the LCWR came about and its very name is an example of this. This book provides tons of documentary evidence regarding the adversarial relationship these leaders showed to the Church and the tactics used that seemed more akin to dirty politics than to religious life. One piece of information I found in the book I thought to be an excellent example of what went wrong. A building was constructed for retired and infirmed nuns that included a beauty shop but no chapel.Again it should be emphasized that so often those who became leaders in this change-oriented movement were not necessarily representative of those they were suppose to represent. This is also evident by the fact that the Vatican approved the CMSWR (Council of Major Superiors of Women Religious) a group of traditional-minded women in religious life that broke away from the LCWR. At the time the Vatican had never approved two different organizations representing women religious in the same country.I really could go on and on with this review since there was just so much information that fascinates me and so many episodes of this history that grabbed my attention. Again I was impressed with how Ann Carey wrote on this topic steering clear of demonizing people and being quite balanced in the telling of this history.While this book totally satisfied me in regards to a specific history of women religious associated with the LCWR, women's ordination movements, and other associated groups there are other aspects I would like to learn more about. For example I would love this author or another one to chronicle a history for example of women religious associated with the CMSWR. Mother Angelica's story has been told already in book form, but I bet there are tons of other interesting stories involving other women's religious institutes and the paths they took that took a divergent path from the LCWR. Mother Dolores Hart in her book [The Ear of the Heart][heart] also chronicles to some extent adaptations after Vatican II at Regina Laudis which were much more aligned with the intent of what Vatican II called for.There are references to men in religious life along with priests, especially those who inspired or were sympathetic with the change-oriented orders. There is probably a closely paralleled history regarding them along with some major differences. Plus the other context I would like to see are the currents worldwide in religious life in how they compared and diverged from what happened here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OYNKZG5KXVH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586177893#wasThisHelpful","R2OYNKZG5KXVH2","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very compact set of bluetooth stereo headphones.  Basically you have two in-canal earphones attached by a flat cable between them.I have been using them for listening to podcasts and music and the sound is decent enough and better on the low end than many bluetooth headphones.I've used multiple bluetooth stereo headphones over the years and this set has a lot of features I like.  The 3 button controls are very easy to use and to operate.  The problem with many such controls is that the individual controls are difficult to differentiate when operating them while wearing the headphones.  This is not the case here and I found I could quick pause/play, adjust volume, and go to the next track.I also really like how quickly they power up and pair - a problem with many bluetooth headsets.  A nice touch is that you get more than just power-up tones, but a synthesized voice describing the steps, power-up, paired, etc.  If you switch to another device it also tells you that.Since this set is quite small so there are two problems that occur.  One is that the range of these headphones is roughly a bit more than half of what a larger device would allow.  The other is that the battery time advertised of 4.5 hours is about what I got.A unique accessory is the charging case.  The case has it's own battery so you can recharge the headphones when you are away from power.  At first I found this rather gimmicky, but it is not a bad idea especially considering the relatively short battery life because of their small size.Overall I am rather impressed with this stereo headset for what it offers in a minimal size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E4QDUN0WVW2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DIOAM4Y#wasThisHelpful","R1E4QDUN0WVW2D","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using this for several days and so are is very pleased with it.  It really does make a lot of difference allowing me to use my iPhone 5 all day long without charging until the evening.Aesthetically it is designed rather well and adds little bulk or weight to the phone and you get use to the increased size rather quickly.  Although like any of these battery cases one hand use is a little more difficult in reaching across the screen.The iPhone slips into a case snugly that that  is then used to mount to the battery pack.  It does take some effort to pull the phone and case back off the battery and it is obvious it is meant to stay with the battery pack.  Phone controls are easily accessed. Although the bottom part of the case means that most headphones will not be able to plug in without an adapter or headphones with a straight connection like the headphones that come with the iPhone 5.  A light on the back of the case indicates general battery level and when it is done charging.  When plugged in via micro USB the phone charges first and then the battery pack.In daily usage I have found I got about six hours of battery life before the phone starts to draw on its own battery.  My usage environment is to have the iPhone display on continuously with usage including GPS, internet activity via cell data, and other tasks that fairly quickly drain the battery over a day.  Before I could not go through the day without having my phone charging at some point.  Now at the end of the day I have more than 50% battery.While it includes a charging cable (typical micro USB) it does not include a power adapter to plug the USB in.  This was rather surprising.  While you could certainly plug it into any computer USB ports, typically these ports only supply 2.5 watts and will provide a rather slow charge.  Although since you won't need to use the lightning cable to charge the phone, you can use the Apple power adapter which does proved 5 watts for charging.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STC3NB03UT6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CS4WRDO#wasThisHelpful","R2STC3NB03UT6N","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book takes on a variety of topics that might not be a the forefront of what you think are the biggest opponents to the Catholic faith. It is also interesting what he has not listed in this book. In the introduction he noted a ""book can only be so big"" and so deliberately not bring up the biggest part of the culture wars regarding abortion and same-sex marriage. As he noted there are many fine books on these topics. Al Kresta addresses four main parts with chapters dedicated to what he describes as opponents.While this book includes mentions of many famous personalities, this book concentrates primarily on beliefs and philosophies of the people mentioned. The first chapter deals with Oprah and how she mainstreamed so many New Age and other self-styled spiritualities. There is a lot of interesting information here looking at Oprah's early turning away from Christianity partly over the problem of evil to her openness to entertaining seriously so many individuals who have repackaged the ""Law of attraction"" and other New Age spiritualists. Part One addresses both competing spiritualities and and abuse of scripture to support them. It is interesting that the area is has concentrated on in this regard is the New Age movement, reincarnation, and Islam. An interesting mix and I think an accurate selection of some of the spiritual competitor to Christianity.Part Two addresses science and religion a topic that often gets addressed on his radio show. Scientism as a philosophy has infected so much of modern thinking and its usual fruits of materialism and relativism. Expecting that anything true must be proven by the scientific method while maintaining a philosophy not subjected to this method. Scientism has become almost a spirituality for atheists and agnostic along of course with some theists. That he titled this section ""Abusers of Science and Reason"" is quite apt.In Part Three we see abuse in the form of revisionism. Mostly a revisionism towards scripture and to an understanding of scripture and tradition passed down. This abuse comes from a throng of opponents such as religions like Mormonism and others who invent a great apostasy to explain why their beliefs can't be found in the history of Christendom. The same is true of the Jesus Seminar that also takes its preconceptions as a lens to narrow down scripture to only what they already accepted. We also see a sort of revisionism of the human person as regards to Transhumanism. We will make ourselves into our own image of what we should be.In the last part of the book we see a secularized government that strives to take control of all aspects of our lives to consumerism where a barrage of messages are crafted by business for a constant cycle of desire and hopeful-fulfillment. Often both of these are more than just two sides of the same coin, but maybe both on the same side.So what this book delivers is an honest perspective of who are opponents are in the realm of ideas. To be able to pray for our enemies we need a good understanding of who are enemies are and specifically the philosophies that drive them. What Al Kresta has been able to do here is to both document and provide analysis regarding these dangers to our faith. This book contains close to a hundred pages of notes at the end of the book providing references to pretty much every thing mentioned and asserted. The balanced view this book applies is not the type that drives you to anger concerning these false world-views, but a helpful assessment of what is out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R369INNQ2UCQCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592767257#wasThisHelpful","R369INNQ2UCQCX","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At roughly 350 pages this book is surprisingly comprehensive as sort of a beginners guide to apologetics and answering questions concerning the faith. This book is subdivided into several topics which contain multiple chapters. These topics start with ""Roadblocks"" with a general introduction to apologetics and starting with some common objections. Then moves on with topics on authority, salvation, the Sacraments, prayer and devotion, and Catholic living.The strength and weakness of this book is that it is sort of a a swiss army knife of apologetics. That is you will find many useful tools and others too small to effectively use. Since it covers so much ground you get from more in-depth treatment of a topic to single paragraphs on a subject making you wish more was said.Overall I found the various treatments given were quite solid. While mostly there is a lot of common apologetics fare it is exactly the type of basic apologetics information needed. When the author points you to other books to learn more they are all trustworthy picks. This books carries a Nihil obstat and Impimatur and they are well deserved as I found nothing that I had any really serious quibble with.The author describes his own experiences in learning apologetics along with dialoging with others and the lessons he has learned as a result. The conversational tone of the book and some light humor keeps the book from being just a regurgitation of so much apologetics. As I wrote it is quite comprehensive and there are also some interesting and useful inclusions such as a topic on logical fallacies.So overall I think this is a quite useful book regarding apologetics for those strengthening there own faith and wanting to be able to answer common objections and beyond.The cover of this book really pushed me against the saying of not judging a book by its cover. I was quite put off by the quality of the cover which I think is quite amateurish. This book being self-published I suspect do-it-yourself art. A common flaw regarding self-published books is not having an artist do a cover for you. As for the title of the book ""Mackerel Snappers"" I see where the author was going with it, but it seems like not a very effective choice. Possibly it would work better with better cover art worked in as a theme.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRVJ0QIIB2VD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1482637596#wasThisHelpful","RRVJ0QIIB2VD3","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This entry into the series is rather sprawling.  Sprawling across multiple continents and plot lines in the longest of the Temeraire novels.Maybe my greatest disappointed with the book  was the amnesia of Capt. Will Laurence.  This is soap opera territory and as a plot device I don't see how it really added much to the series. Maybe it will be important in the later story arc. The only reason I can think of for it's introduction was for Capt. Laurence to not fully reveal himself while in Japan.  As a honorable man he would not have withheld his identity and this would be perilous indeed considering his connection with the Chinese.  You can certainly see just the beginnings in how Japan is going to enter in regarding further novels.  There were some what I thought obvious plot developments that did not turn out as I expected. Still I also did enjoy the isolationist Japan portrayed in its introduction into the story.Most of the novel was typical of the series as the Captain and Temeraire navigate political intrigue while staying true to themselves. While I am still enjoying the series and this entry I would have liked to have seen the plot a bit more tightly focused and a return to more of the formation dragon fighting as in the earlier novels. There is a bit of a loss of the group dynamic so integral previously in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4FO2I9TJUJL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345522893#wasThisHelpful","R4FO2I9TJUJL0","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I greatly enjoyed ""The Last Policeman"" and was certainly wonder how he could follow it up.Thankfully what I loved about the first novel is also fully contained within the second novel which further develops the themes.First off we have such an interesting concept in what is a pre-apocolypse novel which is like a dystopian novel in reverse. One aspect of most dystopian novels that I often find weak is that the transition to however society is displayed in the story makes it hard to connect the dots to a real history. Usually I doubt an actual progression could take you to the background of the story. Usually more about an interesting concept than an actual possibility.This series on the other hand is totally believable to me.  I can imagine people acting like they do in this situation. There is a reality to it regarding a full-spectrum of human reaction and behavior. Not cut into good guys and bad guys, but again a range more like real life. It achieves this not by a moral relativism regarding the character behaviors, but with the patina of actual complexities and motivations.One of the major themes in ""Countdown City"" seems to me to be ""promises"".  With a literal earth-shattering event coming in the near future do you keep your promises and human relationships or do you break down to pure selfishness.  Or as the novel has people just leaving to go ""bucket list"".Hank Palace who was a Policeman in the first novel now continues on just doing what he can do.  He showed his skills in ""The Last Policeman"" exploring a suicide case that everyone had written off and non-consequential. This time he investigates a missing person case that again makes people around him question why he is even doing this in the first place. Also as in the first book there are many zig-zags in coming to a conclusion to this missing person case as the possible solutions keep changing.The end again comes back to promises and sets up the circumstances for the third novel.I greatly anticipate and so look forward to the conclusion of this trilogy. How we he handle the end of the world? It is funny how in some ways you don't want hope in the future of this fictional world in that is cop out to the circumstances. He at times has played around with suggestions that maybe something could be done, but mostly as a crazy conspiracy. Still I look forward to it more for the way he explores this possible world and the characters who have more depth than to just fill a interesting concept.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAIZZOICHMDCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594746265#wasThisHelpful","RAIZZOICHMDCV","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you receive a book from an author asking for a ""fair review"", you never know what you will get.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a good story.The story concerns Ytzak Anan a sailor who is working his way to buy his own ship to captain. A man who had worked the circuit as a fighter, but was more drawn to the sea as his father was. Adventures and misadventures leaves him at times closer and farther from his goal.This takes place on a planet where contact with other planets seemed to have been lost and the civilization has regressed and lost technology. Slavery exists along racial lines but it is not uniformly so among the various nations. Ytzak Anan while being a free man faces such discrimination at times, but rises above it.  A man with a strong sense of responsibility towards his family and those he meets along the way.While being a Science Fiction novel it also has some elements more common to fantasy. The world building is quite believable and I was caught up in the story of Ytzak and how his own goals often got sidetracked as he tries to protect others.I quite enjoyed the novel and it's atmosphere. Although I felt it ended to quick.  An epilogue would have been useful to better frame the story and setup what is likely a continuation of the series. I certainly look forward if there are any new books regarding Ytzak Anan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S7FMF316SM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQO25SY#wasThisHelpful","R1S7FMF316SM6","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had several bluetooth stereo headsets and one bluetooth headphone adapter before so I have a bit of experience with these.After a couple of weeks I have found this to be quite excellent.  One of my complaints about other bluetooth devices was how long they took to power on and off.  This device does both of those actions quickly.  Although the power button is rather small and you have to pretty much look at the device to find it.This also has some rather unique features such as a volume slider bar that has no physical button but an area you swipe up and down on.  This works quite well, although it can be adjusted accidentally.  Also a nice feature is the text display which not only helps you to know the device is on but also gives song and audio information.The range of this device is the best that I have seen  and I can go farther away from the bluetooth source than I have previously been able.  The battery also has long life and I have not come into a situation where I ran out of power despite using it all day at work.I never tried out the FM radio features.Overall I am very happy with this bluetooth adapter as it does exactly what I need with no hassles and it allows me to use any headphones I want with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DT8ABS411BHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LWZ9MC#wasThisHelpful","R1DT8ABS411BHS","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems book subtitles are becoming much like news headlines as a kind of summary meant to bring you in. Although news headlines often do not have much to do with the actual story. The subtitle in this case is actually quite indicative of the contents. Although the title ""American Church"" did not thrill me and when I discovered that the original title was ""The Gibbons Legacy."" I prefer the original title.There are a couple themes in this book regarding the history and the future of the Church in America. One is the contrast between the views of Orestes Augustus Brownson and his friend Isaac Thomas Hecker. Orestes Brownson a convert to the Church was rather pessimistic on future of the Catholic Church in America. Isaac Heckler was the founder of the Paulist Fathers and is now a Servant of God. Heckler had a very optimistic view of the Church in America and thought the two fit together perfectly. The other theme regards the 1950's best selling book ""The Cardinal"" by Henry Morton Robinson which had a view much akin to Isaac Heckler's. The book partly based on the career of Cardinal Spellman was also made into a movie directed by Otto Preminger.These themes help in part to explore the history of the Catholic Church in America. Considering that while there were some prominent Catholics at the founding of this country such as Daniel Carroll, for the most part Catholics were a very small minority. It was only after later immigration that Catholics became a more sizable minority. An anti-Catholic bias was there from the beginning for a variety of reasons, but partly concerning the doubt that Catholics could be good Americans with their ""allegiance"" to Rome. The Know-Nothing Party was on the extreme side of this bias, but it was prevalent in a largely Protestant populace.Cardinal James Gibbons (July 23, 1834 - March 24, 1921) who was the Archbishop of Baltimore was a pivotal figure for Catholics in America. He was also quite optimistic on the Church in America and that not only could Catholics be good Americans but that America was ideally suited for Catholicism. As an Americanizer his view, actions, and influence certainly shaped the Catholic Church here in some regards. His view was also not a minority opinion among Catholics and really exists to this day. That the Church fits hand in glove with America. Although really more common now is the false idea that the Catholic Church fits perfectly with one polical party or another.With this basic setup Russell Shaw explores the history of the Church in America, where we are now, and what portends fo the future. There were so many things I found excellent about this book. I already knew Mr. Shaw was a fine writer and I was really liked the way he explored the history and raised questions. I think it was evident Mr. Shaw had the more skeptical view of a Orestes Brownson, but he also did not let that get in the way. I enjoyed the balance of looking at the various questions and putting forth how others have weighed in on both sides. He presented information without trying to move you into specific conclusions regarding it.The history of the Church in America makes for a absorbing study and covers the growth of the Church and the prominent historical markers. The failed presidential candidacy of Al Smith and later the election of John F. Kennedy. The Catholic culture of the first half of the 20th century and the tumultuous years during and after the Second Vatican Council. He pulls out detailed information and my copy of the book is heavily highlighted as time and again I found much to think about and want to come back to. A good book of this type can present you with an array of information. This one goes beyond that and has filled my mind with much to reflect upon. I also really admired the way he brought the history alive and I could almost picture the reaction of Cardinal Gibbons when Pope Leo the XIII released Testem Benevolentiae Nostrae an encyclical condemning the heresy of Americanism.The latter part of the book deals with many of the facts of American Catholic culture as it stands now. The collapse of recognizing vocations to the priesthood and religious life. The sad state of Catholic education. The fact that Catholics are pretty much identical in almost every statistic compared to other Americans regarding divorce, abortion, contraception, and the support of other grave evils. This is not presented as doom and gloom, but as a realistic assessment of the problems we face. He also does not make the mistake of presenting some kind of Catholic golden age in America and in fact shows how from the beginning there have been flaws that in part led to the current state. When I had found Ross Douthat's Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Heretics a fascinating look at the history of religion in America and Russell Shaw's book gives a more in-depth look at the Catholic side of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J4WYMVFX6RJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586177575#wasThisHelpful","R3J4WYMVFX6RJK","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first read the summary of the book I thought it might be a bit like The Loser Letters by Mary Eberstadt. As I really liked that book as it was funny while making some great points. Very pointed satire.There are points of contact between The Loser Letters and Save Send Delete especially as one is a series of letters to a ""spokesmen of the New Atheism"" and the the later is a series of emails to a Richard Dawkins type.The premise of this book is that it details a series of emails to a famous atheist. Mira after having seen this famous atheist on a Bill Moyer's show on PBS decides to email him. As Julie Davis of Happy Catholic describes:She sends him a long, forceful, clever email that she knows will never get past his secretary. Except that he answers. And he won't let her off the hook with a polite apology.The book goes on where you only see her emails to this famous atheist intermixed with some to her friend. The ""Save Send Delete"" refers to the end of each email where one of these words is bolded. This is a rather clever idea and you get an idea of a thought process of initial reaction, revising, changing your mind about what you said, or committing to reply. But this goes on beyond just being clever as it really adding to the narrative of the story. See Julie's review for a sample of these letters.The often long emails that take so many divergent paths are a wonder to read. They are so funny, pointed, and filled with the realities of life. Political correctness has not only taken a vacation, but I think had run away in alarm. This is not common apologist fare, but a look at the reality of the faith. The ""famous atheist"" replies (as we draw from context) some of the standard objections and she calls him on the vapidness of some of these arguments. For example the ""Your Catholic because you were raised that way and plus you don't know other faiths"" argument. Sometimes in more dissenting publications you see an argument of ""Lived experience"" as if it was a trump card to the truth. Yet here Mira's ""lived experience"" is an argument for the faith and the life she has lived across the world. It also draws from a wealth of information culturally and historically. Strangely at times it even reminded me of Fr. George Rutler and the wealth of information he draws from when he writes, that is is Fr. Rutler was a bit coarser and swore.These series of letters are just a wonder to read on so many levels. I was so drawn into the book that time and time again I forgot that Mira was a character in the story. Sure a good novel draws you in, but this was beyond that. In just so many ways this novel is brilliant. The relationship between Mira and ""Rand"" the atheist goes from back and froth from adversarial to common ground respect. What also adds to this novel is that while Mira is arguing for the faith, she has her own difficulties and fallenness. She struggles in her faith while knowing it is true. Her correspondence with ""Rand"" brings out the desire to be a better Christian.""Inhale as a believer, exhale as an atheist""Mira's struggles are indicative of this phrase she uses. In some ways this is a theme of the book, but not without hope. It brought to my mind the quote ""Be pitiful, for every man is fighting a hard battle,."" There is a inner battle going on in both Mia and Rand. The novel also really brought to mind the reality of that quote to something more palpable to me. Are intellects can apprehend a truth while still not fully taking it in.There are aspects of this book that would have annoyed me if this was a lesser novel. Mia is not the perfectly faithful Catholic as she alludes once to supporting women's ordination and seemingly homosexual acts. Again I had totally forgotten that Mia was a character in a book. But even this was I think a part of the ""Inhale as a believer, exhale as an atheist.""I wish I had the skill to describe how good this book is and it has been one that gave me a lot to reflect upon. It is not the type of book you just put down after finishing it, because you are just not done digesting it yet. While I have very little impact on what books get better known, I can hardly think of a book that I want to have better known. It deserves all the attention it can get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q6JPA52L8W36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1846949866#wasThisHelpful","R2Q6JPA52L8W36","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the title suggests this is not a soft look at Islam, but it is also not a diatribe against Muslims and a recitation of acts of evil committed by individuals or groups of Muslims. There is a very common idea that Muslims, Jews, and Christians being ""People of the book"" have many foundational ideas in common. There is certainly some truth to this, but when it comes to Islam there is much thought to be in common that actually isn't. Robert Spencer also does not set out to say that we can't have common cause with Muslims in some areas, but that we should be aware how far that common cause actually goes. For example he talks about how for example working with Muslim countries in the United Nations in regard to abortion has certainly been helpful to keep or delay more odious abortion rights language. Yet at the same time this alliance was not all that we would want.The Muslim representatives agreed to the language ruling out the use of abortion as a means of family planning but opposed Vatican efforts to call for an end to it in all circumstances. For Islamic law, unlike Church teaching and contrary to widespread belief, does not forbid abortion in every case.This and many other examples he gives us shows that many terms and ideas we might think we have in common often have many caveats attached to them. This becomes even more apparent when we look at basic philosophical and theological ideas that ground Christian influenced Western thought that is just missing in Islam.Robert Spencer does a lot of quoting from the Qur'an and some would object that you can find calls to violence in the Bible also. The problem with this is that Muslims have a totally different view of their scripture compared to how Catholic view scripture such as detailed in the Second Vatican Council's Dei Verbum. Muslim's consider the ""Qur'an was dictated by Allah word for word, miraculously protected from scribal error, and contains no human element whatsoever.""While on the other hand regarding Holy Scripture Dei Verbum says:(1) In composing the sacred books, God chose men and while employed by Him (2) they made use of their powers and abilities, so that with Him acting in them and through them, (3) they, as true authors, consigned to writing everything and only those things which He wanted. (4) Therefore, since everything asserted by the inspired authors or sacred writers must be held to be asserted by the Holy Spirit, it follows that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings (5) for the sake of salvation. Therefore ""all Scripture is divinely inspired and has its use for teaching the truth and refuting error, for reformation of manners and discipline in right living, so that the man who belongs to God may be efficient and equipped for good work of every kind"" (2 Tim. 3:16-17, Greek text).This contrasting view provides a very different view concerning how Muslim read the Qur'an and how the various semi-official schools of interpretation view the Qur'an in general and specifically what we would call the difficult passages. Adding to that those vary same passages which usually occur later in the Qur'an are given more weight over earlier less violent ones.The biggest problem in understanding Islam as one of the Abrahamic faiths is that what we seem to have in common can be seen as completely different. We might think we are looking at the same basic story in the Old Testament, but while there might be commonalities in the Qur'an there are also vast differences. This comes about because of the way the Qur'an came about in the first place. Maybe this analogy is off-base, but it seems to me to be kind of like fan-fiction. Somebody takes a story they like and writes another story in that same universe. They also might reboot the story to be in a similar framework, but with some diferences. You can even have a case of one fan-fiction writer writing a story like the latter and then another writer taking off on that story. The Qur'an to me seems to be an awful lot like that as you have some similar biblical stories, but there are major differences such as Abraham attempting to sacrifice Ishmael instead. There are also obvious Gnostic Christian influences along with examples of other early Christian heresies.Much is made of Jesus and Mary being in the Qur'an and yet where we think we have something in common, we really don't. It would be like two people talking about President Lincoln where one is talking about the historic Abraham Lincoln and the other one talking about the Vampire Killer Abraham Lincoln. The Jesus in the Qur'an is really a sock puppet mainly used to deny that he is the son of God. A rebooted Jesus used to proclaim Islam. A major reboot happens where Jesus at the end of time is going to come back to break all the crosses and kill all the pigs. As annoyed by reboot story arcs found in Marvel and D.C. Comics are, they have nothing on the author or authors of the Qur'an.Another major underpinning that we don't share with Islam is the view that we were created in the Image of God and that we are merely ""Allah's slave."" The lack of the Imago Dei and the lack of the concept of original sin leads to many distortions that are evident in historical and modern-day Islam. A view of predestination that might even make Calvin cringe. This flawed anthropology concerning the human person means that the dignity of the human person as understood in Christianity is not reciprocated in Islam.Knowing all this is important when dealing with the individual Muslim so that we don't assume more than is evident. That when we enter into common cause we understand the limit of it. That when we evangelize that we don't forget that we often mean very different things when it comes to referring to the Old Testament. There view like so many religions that appeared after Christianity is that the texts we have today are totally corrupted and that goes for both Testaments of the Bible. When the Qur'an refers to the ""Gospel"", they refer not to the New Testament, but a lost Gospel of Jesus. Or at least that is the interpretation Muslim theologians give these passages referring to the Gospel as a source of knowledge.I found this book quite worthwhile as it gave me a better understanding of what it actually means to be a ""People of the book"" and that it does not mean as much as I thought. If we are not going to talk passed each other and to be able to talk with each other we have to have some common understanding. While many might think that this would be a rather polemical book, I did not find this to be true. As the author wrote ""The object of these explorations is to generate more light than heat."" Still just pointing out the underlying philosophical and theological problems is something many people would rather ignore. A view that charity means pretending there are no differences. This is a critique of Islam not the lives of individual Muslims. Often there is a disparity between the two. I learned a good bit concerning this in The Monks of Tibhirine: Faith, Love, and Terror in Algeria which was the basis for the great movie ""Of God's and Men."" That book nicely detailed the lives of these monks and there relationship with the Muslim village they served and had deep friendships with.The book ends with a transcript of a debate with Peter Kreeft and Robert Spencer. I had previously seen the debate on YouTube and greatly enjoyed it. For one I wish all debates could be so free of contention. Peter Kreeft is on the side of even greater common cause. Yet while he basically disagreed with Spencer's conclusions, there was little disagreement if any with the fact presented.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BDAYQK8T8TXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2HEXYI#wasThisHelpful","R2BDAYQK8T8TXT","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second 3M monitor arm that I have and this one was very fast to setup.The instructions are very minimal with only pictures, but really this is a rather quick setup with the arms snapping together.  You have the choice of using a clamp or a more sturdy screw on base.  I went with the clamp and it holds up fine with a  27"" monitor.This arm really does not have micro adjustments and what adjustments there are are via allen screws. Still I got it adjusted to the height I wanted easily along with the monitor angled correctly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O4ZJ06U90U70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NSJ8J4#wasThisHelpful","R1O4ZJ06U90U70","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had previously read and reviewed his previous book The Genius of John Paul II: The Great Pope's Moral Wisdom and found it quite worthwhile. It also is a good companion to this current book.I came in to the Catholic Church in the last years of Blessed John Paul II's papacy and so am only partially familiar with the breadth of his writings and encyclicals. This book really explores his writings and the consistent vision behind them. It helps to provide a better understanding of his underlying philosophy and how to get the most out of them and his other works.The book starts with a short biography which mainly concentrates on Blessed John Paul II's development as priest, philosopher and theologian. Focusing on his influences for his personalist metaphysics that took much from St. Thomas Aquinas and St. John of the Cross along with a phenomenological viewpoint. The following chapter deals with his writings before he was pope and how they were a basis for what he wrote after. This was an in depth chapter with plenty of insights and more than just a quick summary. I also appreciated the chapter just dealing with encyclicals as I learned there is much more to the subject than I had thought.The rest of the book focuses on Blessed John Paul II's encyclicals and the chapters are ordered basically chronologically from the year they were released or grouped together by topic. These chapters really go into analyzing the contents while connecting them both to the late pope's philosophy and to his other writings. Much more than just a quick summary and really a insightful guide into understanding these encyclicals. You definitely require at least a passing knowledge of some philosophical terms to get the most out of this often scholarly work. The fact that I mostly understood it means that the bar is not that high.One thing this book made me realize is that I really do need to go back and read the encyclicals of Blessed John Paul II I have not read and really to reread some I have. Blessed John Paul II is not always the easiest writer to take in and I think I can draw a bit more out of him now. It is rather amazing to live in this age of giants. From the relatively long papacy of Blessed John Paul II to a short but packed papacy of Pope Benedict XVI. We really were quite blessed to have these two great men and more blessed to be able to access their writings.The only downside to this book is that it is priced like a textbook. Although considering the content I guess that follows.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QXZXN0S1YQEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442219408#wasThisHelpful","R2QXZXN0S1YQEH","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this one over my previous case which provided some protection, but was much thinner.This one certain adds more protection without feeling bulky.  The material has a nice feel for gripping and the buttons are all covered.The thickness of the case makes it slightly more difficult to adjust the ringer/vibration switch.  Overall the case does not get in the way and I am much less worried about dropping the phone.This case also comes with various covers for the Home button that stick on.  The included button covers come in black/white/orange.

"When it comes to a plot concerning Jesus and time travel there are about a million ways this will go horribly wrong. Some authors have already explored those paths to failure. On one side you could get the skeptic concerned more about debunking than storytelling and on the other side a Christian who is just is not a good storyteller or writer. So normally a book with this premise is one I would pass by.""With those caveats being made, when a book is called ""The Christus Experiment"" and it is written by Rod Bennett those concerns mostly go away. The title sounds like one of those B-movies on the SyFy channel on Saturday nights. Going beyond the title when it comes to Rod Bennett I simply loved his book ""Four Witnesses: The Early Church in Her own Words"" which so engaged the words of four of the Church Fathers. Still this idea even in the hands of a gifted writer like he is can still go wrong. Mr. Bennett seems to be totally aware of this and I really appreciated his introduction which displayed, I believe ,the right attitude to approach this.This book is a spiritual and psychological adventure story full of wild and irresponsible religious conjecture, equally indefensible whether taken as theology or speculative fiction.""There's really no excuse for it at all, unless perhaps it's the same excuse Chesterton once offered for his own paradoxical religious writing: ""There seems to be some sort of idea that you are not treating a subject properly if you eulogize it with fantastic terms or defend it by grotesque examples...I think [on the other hand] that the more serious is the discussion the more grotesque should be the terms...So far from it being irreverent to use silly metaphors on serious questions, it is one's duty to use silly metaphors on serious questions. It is the test of one's seriousness...It is the test of a good religion whether you can joke about it."" The Christus Experiment, then, is offered as a serious joke, so to speak, in the Chestertonian vein, with hopes that no one will be tempted to mistake either its ""silly metaphors"" for actual theology or its serious questions for mere tomfoolery.So as to the story itself it has many typical elements involving time travel. In this case it involves a private compound owned by a Christ-haunted billionaire and skeptic. A group of scientists are able to successfully bring Jesus into the present and the story involves the bringing in a various experts to study and interact with him. Some of the experts brought in are Jesus seminar types along with a Rabbi and a psychic. The Science Fiction side of time travel is explored as you would expect regarding changing the past, multiple time lines, time lines splitting, etc. What I so enjoyed about this book is that when I tried to guess ahead at how the story would go or how a character would develop I was almost always wrong, but it goes in a truer direction than I imagined.Including Jesus as a character is also a difficult task to pull of right. In this scenario you just can't resort to only scripture as he is interrogated. I liked the way this was done and how it invoked Jesus being questioned by Herod, the Sanhedrin, and Pilate. Still it goes beyond just Jesus being silent in response to hostile questioning by answering them at times. The way this was done with theological nuance was quite satisfying and never took you out of the story.Beyond just the time travel scenario the plot contains many tensions as it builds as an adventure story. The characters are complex and so is the situation as they try to decide if they have really brought the biblical Jesus forward into time. Whether there is anything more to him than the simple man of that era he appears to be. There are also other forces at hand that reveal themselves.This book is really not what I expected, but it is what I wanted. The ending is certainly not what I expected, but quite interesting as ""wild and irresponsible religious conjecture"". There is a spiritual depth to this book and little touches I admired. Like I said at the beginning of this review, this book could easily have gone horribly wrong. Instead it went splendidly right. This novel displayed a theological deftness in regards to the plot and an authentic feel concerning the situation and the characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34PUBIJQNIPO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481148141#wasThisHelpful","R34PUBIJQNIPO8","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A one volume history of the Catholic Church is quite an undertaking and to do it in a bit over 530 pages is not a simple task. Writing only 500 pages on any century of the Church would be a difficult task. Creating a one volume history imposes many expected limitations, but if done well can provide a very valuable service. There are several one volume histories of this type, although I have mainly read either the multi-volume sets such as The History of Christendom by the late Warren H. Carroll or histories covering specific area.What James Hitchcock has pulled off if quite exceptional. This is a summary history that sweeps through the ages of the Church. While it leaves you wanting to know many more details of the history described, still you are given the best overview possible for this format.For the most part this is a sequential sweep through the history of the Church from its birth to the present. While mostly the history is sequential some of the chapters are focuses on specific areas and can contain large sweeps of history regarding that topic. I was hooked from the introduction on. The information is presented in topic focused paragraphs with a topic title displayed to the right or left of the text. The topics are usually only a couple paragraphs in length. I really liked the format of the book because I will be using it in the future as a reference. Besides the lengthy index the topic headings next to the text make it very easy to scan and find specific information you might want to go back to.I have heard complaints about Harry Crocker's one volume history ""Triumph: The Power and the Glory of the Catholic Church"" for being triumphalistic (doesn't that go with the title). So you might wonder how James Hitchcock presents the history of the Church. Well to sum it up the history of the Church can be described using Charles Dikens' start of ""A Tale of Two Cities"".It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the other way.The Vatican II document Gaudium et Spes starts off ""The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age."" This history displays that tension and does not whitewash the history of the Church. He does not gloss over serious evils that occurred. This history is nicely balanced as a presentation and this is certainly the way I prefer it. Really the history of the Church is sort of a proof for the Catholic Church. If it was just up to us Catholics the Church would be a historical footnote by now. If she were not a divinely given institution she would have passed like all man-made institutions. It does the Church no good to minimize what has happened and it is always a temptation to do this. For example some apologists will minimize witch-hunting as something that mainly occurred among Protestants. As he states witchcraft persecutions were an ""activity carried out by Catholics and Protestants with equal zeal."" So while the low points are not left out, neither are the glories of Christendom reduced.This is simply a great history of the Church that gives a topological summary giving you the birds-eye view. I really like how he crafted the topic summaries to pack in the information. This succinctness I am sure took some serious work to pull of. I also like that there is little editorializing of history while still delivering some fine insights. Plus peppered throughout were little details at times that added to the enjoyment. At times I thought that perhaps he might have left something out only to find it a couple of paragraphs later or separated into one of the more topic focused chapters.To sum it up I think this is a quite a major work and just a great one volume look at Church history. There was only one time in the whole book where I scratched my head a little where a footnote regarding Joan of Arc read ""She was canonized in 1920. Her sanctity is problematical insofar as she acted merely as a French patriot, but her canonization was based on her heroic virtue."". Although if you can go through 500 plus pages of a book of Catholic history and only have one quibble, that is a pretty amazing accomplishment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UABVBK5V3VG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586176641#wasThisHelpful","R1UABVBK5V3VG7","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christianity, Islam and Atheism: The Struggle for The Soul of The West is a new book from Ignatius Press by William Kilpatrick. This is not a light read, but I found it to be an very informative read.There are a range of ideas about engaging Islam and whether Islamist terrorists are misusing their religion or are more faithful adherents of it.  Within Catholic circles to some extent these differing views are represented  by Robert Spenser and Peter Kreeft.  In fact these two men engaged in a debate on the subject that I thought was a great debate in both the issues and how both men respected the other.I tend to fall in the Robert Spenser end of the spectrum and so did this book.  There is certainly a Mark Steyn like approach in this book and Mark Steyn is quoted rather extensively in it.  The Mark Steyn view is displayed regarding demographics and how emigration of Muslims into Europe is affecting these countries.  Especially as there has been less integration into these cultures as is usual. But this goes beyond the normal political approach and into subjects relating to the Church and the Evangelization of Muslims.The book is misnamed to some extent where atheism is really a reference to secularism and a reaction to Islam that is represented  by some agnostics, atheists, and believers of a more liberal stripe.  The second section of the book on ""Islam's Enablers"" is a reference to this and how bad behavior by some Muslims are protected and covered up. The book contains multiple examples of how tolerant societies have allowed this behavior while evicting or punishing to some extent those who highlight and fight agains this. In many ways it is quite laudable when people want to prevent prejudice of one group because of the actions of a segment of that group. The problem comes in when serious problems are smoothed over and no engagement comes to label and resist these problems.  Multiculturalism is really not practiced, what we actually have is favored-culturalism and the diminishment of other cultures.  For example the book demonstrates how textbooks have come to favor Islam while demeaning Christianity.I found the third section to be the most interesting ""The Comparison.""  We often hear of the approach towards Muslims as being one of the Abrahamic religions and that there are commonalities we can build upon.  William Kilpatrick demonstrates quite well that these common foundations are either non-existent or quiet weak.  For example Jesus in the Koran is purely of sock puppet for Mohammed to deny that Jesus was the son of God.  The Koranic Jesus plays a very minor role. A Jesus who performed no miracles and was not crucified - the very Jesus you would expect if you wanted to supplant him.  The Koranic Abraham is also much difference and the different view is more likely to cause contention than to unite.  This pretty much is true of most of the comparisons that are suppose to provide a common foundation. Although this is really to be expected in comparisons of Abrahamic religions in that Islam is a heresy cobbled up from Christianity and other sources with no historical foundation to the claims that are made.  The standards of historical reliability somehow never seem to get applied to the Koran and we will not be seeing ""The Real Mohammed"" on the History Channel any time soon.  Still it is important to remember that however fabricated Islam is that there is always commonality with Muslims themselves.The last section ""The Cold War with Islam"" expresses an idea I had not really considered before with a comparison to the cold war with Communism.  While not a perfect parallel there is much to think about here.  Things don't have to end up in a shooting war to be addressed.  He goes over several approaches and critiques ideas such as the moderate-Mulsim strategy. A chapter in this section deals with what Christians should do. Obviously this requires a multifaceted approach  with of course Evangelization being the priority.  Too often we walk on eggshells in relating to Islam. One of the facinating things I learned about was a Coptic priest Fr. Zakaria Botros. I don't think I had ever heard of him, but he is well versed on Islamic teachings and has a television show.  His show challenging Islam has resulted in al-Qaeda putting a $60 million bounty on his head.  He is suppose to be rather effective resulting in conversions.  Many Muslims are not use to being engaged at this level, but considering the various punishment for apostasy this is a very difficult area. Another book by Ignatius Press The Price To Pay: A Muslim Risks All to Follow Christ tells the story of a Muslim convert who was shot and left for dead by his brothers because of his conversion.  There is certainly not just one approach and the Catholic both/and applies.  There is and should be common cause with Muslims where possible and the message of the Gospel should not be left out.Over all I found this well-worth reading and I learned a lot while also giving me much to think about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ABX57OLKKDLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=158617696X#wasThisHelpful","R2ABX57OLKKDLC","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr. Ahlquist's new book is The Complete Thinker: The Marvelous Mind of G.K. Chesterton.  While actually reading Chesterton is better Dale Ahlquist strikes a nice balance by including a lot of Chesterton while applying Chesterton-like analysis. There is the old joke about owners becoming like their pets and I keep finding that  Dale Ahlquist is a lot like Chesterton and has a bit of a ""marvelous mind"" himself.The book goes on to demonstrate just why G.K. Chesterton was the complete thinker.  In this day of over-specialization we come to expect people to have only expertise in one area.  It is no surprise that the modern man will refer to someone whose knowledge spans numerous topics as a renaissance  man and not a modern man.  This concept is one reason I was always attracted to the character of Sherlock Holmes' brother Mycroft in that he gathered information from multiple disciplines and could see as a whole what the specialists were missing.  Chesterton could see the underlying truth in all things and thus was able to talk about all things.  Not only have we become accustomed to not seeing the forrest for the trees, but we don't even see the trees that well.  When all truth is relative it is not relative to see the truth.The chapters of the book cover many areas from the problem of evil, war and peace, sickness and health, abandoning hopelessness, law and lawyers, and many other contrasts.  The structure of the topics build on each other and demonstrate all the areas in which Chesterton was more than competent.  People are often amazed at how prescient Chesterton was in seeing the roots of problems and where they would lead.  The gist of what he says applies equally today because the problems that were evident to Chesterton in his day have only continued.What this book demonstrated to me is how much to the root of things Chesterton's vision was.  After the recent election and reading again Chesterton's thoughts on birth control we can see how much the debate has shifted or just plain deconstructed.  I was especially intrigued by Chesterton criticism of national health as it was starting in England in his day.  His arguments had nothing to do with slippery slope arguments about how such policies can go awry, but cut to the quick about the whole concept in the first place.  It is amazing how Chesterton can get you to re-look at something you believed you already understood even when you already agreed with his conclusions.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and there is also an appendix dealing with the Chesterton/Clarence Darrow debate. While sadly a transcript of the debate does not exists there is some information from those who attended and I thought this appendix was quite worthwhile in itself.  It is of interest to note that one of Clarence Darrow's relatives Leah Darrow now works for Catholic Answers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QO7FYO6M3VE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586176757#wasThisHelpful","R3QO7FYO6M3VE4","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a long time fan of the Thin Man movies first reading the novel they were based on was quite a thrill.  Dashiell Hammett's involvement in the first three movies is reflected by both the plot and so much of his dialog that made it to the screen.These two full-length novellas are screenplays that were written under contract and then made into the two subsequent Thin Man movies.  As screenplays there are some formatting that make them different from a normal novel and infrequently there are some directions given as far as characters and action.  Still as screenplays they read quite well as novels and you barely notice the screenplay formatting.As always Hammett's dialog is superb with involved plots.  There are some differences between these screenplays and the final movies, but they are mostly minor.Just having these two screenplays makes this a must buy for any Hammett fan, but there is also a lot of introductory commentary that gives a background to Dashiell Hammett's and the circumstances that brought about these screenplays.  There is also information regarding the films and the deviations they made along with some artistic choices they added.  This content really added to the enjoyment of these screenplays and really set the context.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38PH6511P5CUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802120504#wasThisHelpful","R38PH6511P5CUK","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The sonically dynamic tensions in their music just keeps working.  The contrasts between the powerful but also restrained singing and the underlying jam gets you hooked.  The underlying riff in the starting song ""So When"" is just so intriguing and the balance with the lyrics starts off the album in a powerful way. The whole band just play off each other contributing to a stronger whole.  Yet the subsequent songs are never a let down and the whole album continues to build.

"Seeing the title the thought that came to me was there was zero chance of it catching my interest .  Sounds just like a title given to a typical Catholic dissent-fest.  Later the same day on EWTN I heard this book referenced in a positive manner.Considering all the media coverage and the  phony ""war on women"" meme  and the fact that Catholic women who are dissenters are constantly being presented to us this book is quite timely.  This book is partly a response to the attacks on religious freedom and how the narrative was shaped concerning Catholic women and the use of contraceptives.This book in some ways could have been called ""Surprised by the truth of the Church's teachings on sexual morality"" as it is partly a ""Surprised by Truth""-like format of conversion stories.  Not the common Protestant-to-Catholic conversion stories but mostly concerning Catholic women who were in opposition to Church teaching and who came to see the wisdom and the truth of her teaching.  These women from a variety of backgrounds and professional experience not only provide the genesis for how they came to accept Church teaching, but explain those teachings in a very accessible way.  All of these chapters were very well written and had me quite captivated by their personal stories. Along with these stories are also a couple of essays that go with the subject at hand.Seeing how God worked in these women's lives was a joy to see and a couple of the stories related really had me praising God - which unfortunately is not something I do as much as I should.  The story of one women's affect on another headed to get an abortion is worth the price of the book - just so awesome! This book covers a lot of topics including: fear of children, contraception, same-sex attraction, beauty, the ends of dating, the sexual abuse crisis, stable marriages and family life, etc.Even as a man I could relate to some of the background of the stories on how secular feminism had shaped their lives.  Being raised in a house that subscribed to Ms. Magazine and Psychology Today and where Alan Alda was the pinnacle of what a man should be -- it is not just women who get subverted by this message.This book is a great antidote to so much of what we hear and it presents faithful Catholic women who can fully articulate their faith and who have had the same struggles as so many others.  Maybe the title that confused me is a positive thing and I sincerely hope that those who struggle with the truth of what the Church teaches will pick this book up.  They might be seriously challenged by what this book presents, but they won't be talked down to or feel attacked by it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAG13R5LQBDZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612786669#wasThisHelpful","RAG13R5LQBDZ4","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mercury Rests is the final volume of a trilogy of novels written by humorist Robert Kroese.These novels follow the adventure of Mercury an Angel who unintentionally gets wrapped up in a plan to prevent the Apocalypse from occurring earlier than scheduled.  Mercury is not a goody-two-shoes angel, but neither is he a cigarette smoking fornication John Travolta type.  Mostly Mercury just wants to be left alone and do his own thing.  Instead he gets wrapped up with a range of characters in the present times and involvement with characters in Biblical time.  This is all played for laughs in a way that reminds you of Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams.I quite enjoyed the first book (review here) for being a great humorous and imaginative romp.  The second book ""Mercury Rises"" picks up and continues the story.  While I enjoyed the second book it did  not shine on for me as much as the first one. Though the plot of it was also quite imaginative.Mercury Rests for me grabs more of the appeal of the first book while bringing the story to a conclusion.  It was not a book that really had me laughing out loud along the way, but one where there was a constant grin that often broke into a wider grin regarding the footnotes.  These novels are certainly played for laughs and not for theological precision, though the author is a believer in the Reformed tradition and some of that worldview is reflected within.In Ironic Catholic's interview with the author he replies in part:IC: Last but not least: Is Mercury Catholic or Reformed?RK: A lot of people have compared Mercury Falls to Kevin Smith's Dogma and I think it's an apt comparison, except that Mercury Falls is the Reformed version of the story. It deals less with the trappings of Catholicism than with the obsessions of the Reformed theologians, like free will and determinism.I think Mercury is sort of a hopeful agnostic. He wants to believe in something bigger than himself, but unfortunately the people he works for are idiots, so sometimes it's hard to maintain the faith. If I recall correctly, one of your criticisms of Mercury Falls was basically that God never shows up. And while I sympathize with that criticism, I deliberately did not make God a character in the story, because it felt like cheating. I wanted the angels to be just in the dark about God's existence and nature as human beings are. Which doesn't mean that they are *completely* in the dark, of course. You see some characters who really are God-like in the best sense, such as the archangel Michelle. Michelle obviously believes in *something*, even it if isn't spelled out in the book what it is. You'll see more of that with Job in Mercury Rests.The language can be rather raw at times with f-bombs and such, but it was fitting when spouted by the foul-mouth Satan.I certainly had fun with the series and the author does exactly the type of silly humor that I enjoy and there are many cultural mash-ups in the story that add to the fun in the way they are incorporated.  I certainly enjoyed these books enough to see reading them again later.  I definitely look forward to what Robert Kroese has to offer in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WONBV9U4HU9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612185843#wasThisHelpful","R1WONBV9U4HU9Q","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The prolific Catholic apologist Dave Armstrong has a new book out 100 Biblical Arguments Against Sola Scriptura which was published by Catholic Answers.Now there is a certain irony in taking apart Sola Scriptura via the scriptures but you have to stay within a certain framework when dialoging with others. Jesus when talking to the Sadducees only quoted from the Pentateuch since this was all they accepted.  So this apologetical pattern certainly applies here.Now first off when discussing Sola Scriptura it is best to define terms first. How Catholics might define Sola Scriptura can be quite simplistic compared to how many Protestants would understand it.  So Dave Armstrong starts the book by quoting prominent Protestants as to exactly how Sola Scriptura is defined.Many of the arguments Dave Armstrong used are quite nuanced and interesting and go beyond some run-of-the-mill typical apologetics replies concerning the topic.  In many ways Protestantism stands or falls on this since there must be some method of authority to answer questions. If you abandon the authority of a physical teaching Church  than Sola Scriptura makes what appears as an acceptable fallback position.  It is not enough to just refute Sola Scriptura though. Dave Armstrong as he methodically presents his arguments also sets the case for the understanding of authority presenting the three-legged stool of Scripture-Teaching Church-Sacred Tradition.  He does this in a structured way discussing the authority of tradition, authority of the Church, and then answering common arguments used to defend Sola Scriptura.Apologetics books of this type can be for dry reading, but I did not find that here as I was so interested by the arguments made and how they were presented.  Certainly an excellent resource for the apologetic toolbox and one that goes in-depth on a fundamental topic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5N35QYZQCKQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933919590#wasThisHelpful","R5N35QYZQCKQF","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The emphasis for this project is as a power dock since as a stand there is little functionality.It stands the iPad almost straight up when docked.  But considering the prices for power cords with enough amperage to charge the iPad this is not a bad deal as a dock to just charge it up.The cord it comes with has a typical USB connector and a wall plug so you can charge up either way.

"Anybody who as read his books from the Golden Age trilogy to Null-A-Contiuum knows he is a writer of big ideas and this book is an embarrassment of riches.  So many great ideas are contained within that they could have been parsed out a basis for a dozen of other SF books.  This book follows the rich tradition of the Space Opera where it's not over until the ""voluptuous green-skinned spacewomen in silvery space-bikinis"" sing.The specific story follows young Menelaus Illation Montrose from his childhood on.  The Western world is in collapse and the world is divided up into various spheres of influence such as the Indosphere and the Hispanosphere.  Menelaus is a brilliant polymath who dreams of ""shining tomorrows"" and the disappointments of actual life and not flying cars and other gee wiz technological developments.  His dreams are partially shaped by a comic book series named Asymptote that has many shadows of Star Trek and it's view of the future of man along with the cornier aspects related to Captain Kirk.  As someone whose childhood included the start of the Star Trek series and the race to the moon this young character had many elements I could relate to.  His mother though has other plans for him that don't include such starry-eyed dreaming and seemingly escapist literature.His path to adulthood leads through various phases of apprenticeship with nothing fully using his talents.  He becomes a dueling-lawyer, that is a lawyer that handles things outside of court hi-tech dueling pistols.  The description of one of the duels is one of the great ideas the story is so peppered with.  These special guns with defenses reminds me of aviation warfare with electronic countermeasures, chaff, and other deceptive techniques along with special missiles.  Having worked in this area in my Navy career this brining it down to the dueling level was especially pleasing. But this is only a small part of the plot of the book.The main thrust of the book deals broadly with space flight, harvesting of a star, and the results of abundant cheap energy on the world as it is politically controlled.  Menelaus steps into this future and into a subsequent future a century or so hence is filled with missteps that  initially take him out of the action for part of the time.  When he becomes able to participate he finds himself in a future where there is no war, but with a very cold war atmosphere where a group of spaceman-scientists have blackmailed the world both with cheap energy and the threat of destruction that can't be countered.  Instead of Mutual Assured Destruction, there is just destruction for those who oppose this rule.  This is a more dystopian than utopian future as the lack of wars does not denote actual peace and while technological developments have changed many things for the better, the tensions involving the source of energy are causing other pressures leading to conflict.Being that John C. Wright has written about the ""New Space Princess Movement"" and our need for it, it is not surprising that the book indeed includes a beautiful and super intelligent Space Princess.  A very enjoyable character who to me has shadows of the thankfulness of G.K. Chesterton.  Maybe I am reading this into the story, but there seemed to be a light shadow of Chesterton in it.  Of course any story with a Space Princess will set up a love triangle and in this case it is between Menelaus and his best friend and now dangerous foe Del Azarchel and Princess Rania. This of course creates most of the tensions in the latter half of the book leading to a showdown between the two.But with there's more.  The book also deals with post humanism and contact with an alien civilization which has left an artifact so dense with information that ultimately it can only be read by someone with post human intelligence.  The big ideas surrounding this aspect are also very interesting and the consequences of this and possible contact with the aliens that left this drives the plot in multiple ways that are surely to develop since this is first book of the trilogy.John C. Wright slings a lot of scientific BS in this novel, but it is slung well and is a higher order of scientific BS than of the Star Trek variety.  So there is a bit of technobabble, but you also get the feeling it more science-based than just space opera plot filler. The philosophical discussions between the main characters is also interesting and makes the types of distinctions I like to see.  Really the dialogue is quite enjoyable and often very funny at times.  One description involving hackers and Moby Dick is one of the funniest things I have ever read and his pun on the spanish pronunciation of Jesus is one that will never let me hear the Spanish pronunciation of the name the same again.One reviewer takes to task how the  super-intelling post human version of Menelaus in that he ""talks like a caricature of John Wayne in a low-budget Western.""  I can understand this criticism, but it seems to me also a bit of a bias as I can think of at least one Texan who I would consider very intelligent and extremely well read and who talks in a folksy Texan style.The ending of this book though is more in the fashion of a cliffhanger from an old serial than is usual in space opera.  Many things are left hanging and since I enjoyed the book so much my patience of waiting for the rest of the trilogy will be quite taxing. The book might not be for everybody, but it was certainly for me who loves both space opera and the old movie serials.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AVZQ7VWSR3A0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765329271#wasThisHelpful","R3AVZQ7VWSR3A0","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've recently started working with MVC 3 about a month ago and not longer after started reading this book.I really liked the style of the book in that it is meant to get you up and running in short time without dwelling on things you probably generally know.  The chapters are written by different people so you can really take advantage of different expertise.Though the most important thing is that the book was instantly useful and I was able to apply what I was learning immediately and since it had enough advanced tips I was aware of some MVC 3 capabilities others on my team were not aware of.  The chapter on security was exceptional with lots of good information.  The last chapter of the book covers advanced topics in extending MVC 3 Controllers, Views, etcOne thing I really appreciated is that all the code examples are available via Nuget and this is something I would like to see with any coding book involving net programming.  Plus there is even a chapter on Nuget and how to create your own packages for distribution.Very worthwhile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23562ZW8WNI1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118076583#wasThisHelpful","R23562ZW8WNI1V","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cover blurb says ""the most highly anticipated sequel to `Mercury Falls' ever published""Having been a fan of Mercury Falls I was looking forward to reading the sequel.  Once again we meet Mercury the ""renegade"" Angel as he tries once again to stop a premature Apocalypse .  The action picks up after the first novel where he again teams with the religion reporter who covered the Apocalypse beat.  Considering the silliness of Harold Camping this novel fits right in.  This time though the Harold Camping like publisher is gone and in place we have the atheist editor and his efforts to bring about the end of the world.I enjoy Robert Kroese humor and his world populated with Angels and Demons done in a fresh way and while you are reminded of Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett ""Good Omens"" it is not derivative of it, but its own book. The plot alternates between modern day and Mercury at the time of Noah. Much that was developed in Mercury Falls is carried on here and the setup for the third novel is in place.  One of the funniest bits in the book was a Vonnegut like reference to the trilogy. Kroese has been doing his homework on Quantum physics to create some of the plot elements, as he is doing the same for the next book.Ultimately I enjoyed Mercury Falls more than the latest book as it suffers some of the common problems in a transitional novel in a series.  Still though a fun read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQRD3B4O1G004/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612180868#wasThisHelpful","RQRD3B4O1G004","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Motherless is the second novel of the American Tragedy in Trilogy series. I reviewed the first novel ""Fatherless"" here. The third novel ""Childless"" is due to be released this fall.The novel picks up on many of the same characters introduced in the first novel, but some decades have elapsed as it takes place in modern time. The themes of the first novel remain as it deals with the toxic culture and the effects on families and Catholics dealing with their work environments. Retaining the faith in such environs and the dulling of conscience while compromising are again addressed. In this novel though Catholic healthcare is an important element of the plot and many things we have seen on the headlines and discussed on blogs is there. The diminishing of any real Catholic component as compromises with the Culture of Death become routine.These subjects do not present a pretty picture as our culture does not present one and it is no surprise this is almost a dystopian-like novel. But like our faith, this is a novel not without hope and there are triumphs among the characters amid the setbacks and difficulties they encounter. Things don't always come out rosy, but some characters strive to do what is right regardless. For me I find a lot of authenticity in what the author writes and that extends to the characters and to the plotting. The same goes for the dialogs of the various characters which seem quite natural. This also could be classed as an in-your-face Catholic novel in that the commentary via the characters is quite forthright and an accurate depiction of what the Church teaches.One aspect of the novel is the human embryos required for ESCR and other research and aspects considering how they are obtained. The disgraced Korean doctor who was experimenting in human cloning pressured women he worked with to donate their eggs and I suspect the international attempts to get human eggs and fertilize them is just as bad if not worse in setting up a distribution system. The truth about IVF and the destruction of so many human persons also plays a role in this novel.I quite enjoyed this novel as so much of the content is right up my alley and the authors views seem to coincide with my own. I heard the author Brian Gale a couple of times on Al Kresta's show and I was impressed with both his knowledge and what he had to say. His background in the business world was certainly a springboard for his understanding in this world and the themes the novel addresses. I'm looking forward to the final installment of this trilogy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q51E7HYWOCTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193101874X#wasThisHelpful","R2Q51E7HYWOCTH","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in the Legends of Shannara duology which is another of the prequel series that takes place before the original Shannara trilogy.I read this latest book after just finishing ""Bearers of the Black Staff"" the first book in this short series.  I quite enjoyed the first book which in many ways was standard Fantasy fare but written capably.  Brooks is very good at creating solid characters that you care about and want to find out what happens next.  ""The Measure of the Magic"" does add quite a lot of escalation to the first novel.  The first book ends with a very serious situation of an invasion coming into the valley that had been protected for 500 years.  A new danger enters onto the scene that is much more serious and a greater threat to the new holder of the Black Staff and his friend and companion.  This really adds to the story and makes it something more than just the end of the duo logy wrapping up previous plot points.I really liked the character development and the sacrifices some of the characters made and the book is more bitter-sweet than the other novels in the series.  Other plot elements and new characters round up the story.  Considering the young age of the main characters this novel though does feel more like a transitional novel than the end of the duology.  The characters were certainly strong enough for a continuation of the story and I certainly liked it enough to have wanted this to be more than a duology, but there always has to be a cutting of point when working with young heroes such as the Harry Potter series.If you like Terry Brooks style I am confident you will enjoy this addition.  I had forgotten how much I liked his writings and need to go back and read the other series again in the Shannara world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37VSTFQD5BWQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345484207#wasThisHelpful","R37VSTFQD5BWQI","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While this product is advertised as for Android specifically it does of course work just as a Bluetooth keyboard.  I use it with an iPad 2 and it works just fine.Since this keyboard has both an on/off  switch and a carrying case it does make for a very good traveling keyboard.  The size of the keyboard is fairly full sized so it is quite easy to quickly type on it without having to think about it as it feels quite natural.  The keys have a reasonable feel to them and are quite quiet.While the case can be used as a stand, I never really used it that way.

"This week I have completed nine years of blogging and so I can say that I have some perspective on the growth of the so-called Catholic ""New Media.""  Nine years ago I could pretty much read every post in the Catholic blogosphere during a short lunch.  Catholic audio on the internet was extremely limited and podcasting was still a couple more years into the future.  The growth of new media for Catholics has been quite an interesting thing to watch.Bearing that in mind I was quite happy to review the new book by blogger Brandon Vogt The Church and New Media: Blogging Converts, Online Activists, and Bishops Who Tweet. This book is mostly a collection of essays on topics related to Catholic media by well known names within Catholic media. Each writer provides their expertise and perspective. Within these essays are other factoids providing related sources and other information. Brandon Vogt provides both the introduction and conclusion. The book has been positively endorsed by a who's who of Catholics in America like Archbishop Dolan, Cardinal O'Malley, Cardinal Wuerl, Archbishop Chaput, Mike Aqulina, Amy Welborn, and on and on. Well let me add my own name to that list of positive endorsements.I found this to be a very good read that included things to chew on and other thoughts that agreed with my own experiences. The book starts out with Fr. Barron who like many accidentally entered into new media first by making his excellent homilies available on his site and then later podcasting them. Later he started to release short commentary addressing the issues of the day on YouTube and interacting with the YouTube commenters - not exactly a tame world. As you would expect Fr. Barron provides intelligent comments on his experience. Jennifer Fulwiler writes her conversion story from atheism from the perspective of interacting with Christians on her site. Like myself Jennifer Fulwiler was always an atheist from childhood on who had assumed that Christianity was simply a myth. Actually dialoging with Christians and have her assumptions overturned helped her to see the truth. While many complain about the atmosphere of commenting on blogs, her experience was largely positive.I can't really do an essay by essay review since it would be longer than the book. But I need to at least list some of the other people who contributed. Marcel LeJeune, Mark Shea, Taylor Marshall, Fr. Longenecker, Scot Landry, Jeff Geerling, Matt Warner, Lisa M. Hendey, Thomas Peters & Shawn Carney. Almost all our people I have read and interacted with over the years and in some cases have met. I found Thomas Peters thoughts the closest to my own and extremely well said. I especially liked his focus on the foundation laid by prayer. But there was so much said by all of them I found spot on. For anybody looking into Catholic media this book is much more than just an introduction.When it comes down to it the new media is like all media in that it is a form of communication. For Catholics this communication is simply to spread the Gospel and while living the Gospel ourselves to help others to do the same. Catholic media and Catholic new media is effective when it spreads the good news and helps others to fully live their faith. I have certainly seen many examples of this over the years concerning conversion and how Catholic media helped to open a person up to the fulness of the faith. The Vatican has lagged behind when it came to new media, but the Vatican doesn't need to do everything and us everyday Catholics can step in to take up the slack as our abilities direct.The only real complaint I had about this book is that it was a little too much blogger-centric. Yes a funny complaint coming from a blogger, but I am also a great promoter of Catholic podcasts. While Fr. Barron podcasts, he is not really a podcaster since only his homilies are podcasted and he doesn't engage his audience directly via podcasting. Lisa Henley though does have experience podcasting, but it isn't her main role. To be fair the book certainly does address podcasting throughout the book, but I would have liked to have seen a chapter from someone who was a weekly podcaster. This book would have been perfect with a chapter from somebody like Fr. Roderick of SQPN, Greg & Jennifer Willits, the crew of the Catholic Underground, or really the perspective from any of the many very good Catholic podcasts.One final thought is that I bet Brandon Vogt wishes that the Pope had used an iPad to make his first tweet and launch the new Vatican news site before this book was published. That episode would have fit right into his theme.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13G30T7MEZBHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592760333#wasThisHelpful","R13G30T7MEZBHN","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is a book that is an interesting juxtaposition. A Rock Star who has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame writes a new biography. In it there are pictures of this star along with pictures of him with people such as Bruce Springsteen, Lou Reed, and Scott Hahn. Yes Scott Hahn. I figure this is the first Rock and Roll autobiography co-authored by a patristic scholar - that is Mike Aqulina.Many though will have picked up by now that this is a new book by Dion DiMucci who is just most simply known as Dion. The book is ""Dion: The Wanderer Talks Truth.""I was already aware that Dion was a revert as I had seen him on EWTN before and have heard parts of his conversion story on EWTN Radio. This book though much more in depth in regards to his life and his conversion to the Church.His story begins with his life as a youth that besides performing music at a young age included being a gang member in the Bronx. There are some very interesting stories told here of this part of his life - especially his interactions with a Father Percione a man who was very much a shepherd of his parish. While Dion did not follow much of the advice of this priest, his talks with him on subjects such as virtue remained with him throughout his life and provided markers for him on his later path to conversion. I really enjoyed his descriptions of this priest and how active he was in his neighborhood.He describes his entrance professionally into the music business and his meteoric rise where he soon became a teenage millionaire. His path parallels so many stories which include sudden fame and the path of increasing drug intake. We think of the Sixties as the start of the Drug, Sex, and Rock n' Roll era - but the Fifties has it's share of the same problems. In this book he does not dwell on those aspects of his life other than how they affected him on a personal level and especially his lack of a spiritual life. There are though plenty of stories about this time that he recounts especially the famous episode of the coin flip and the subsequent crash that killed Buddy Holly, The Ritchie Valens, and J. P. ""The Big Bopper"" Richardson. He sets the record straight on some aspects of this story along with his disagreement concerning the famous line America Pie about the day the music died.This biography is interesting on several levels. First you have a good story about a musical career and the musical changes he has gone through in that career. Most importantly you have a spiritual biography that takes you from the days of a non-religious family and his later movement towards faith and the spiritual landmarks along the way. The acts of grace that allowed him to leave behind drugs and alcohol and to move first to Protestantism and then later to the Catholic Church. I really enjoyed the style of the book in that it was often quite humorous and his being able to laugh at himself contributed to that. The book is not pretentious in any way. Another important thread in the book is first his pursuit of a girl in the Bronx who later became his wife and has stayed his wife.I found it to be quite a good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQVME233HDJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0867169990#wasThisHelpful","R1WQVME233HDJ7","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you get a book to review there is always a bit of a hesitancy. What goes through your mind is ""What if it is really bad."" Well I have dodged that bullet this time as this new book An Imperfect Miracle is quite enjoyable.The story takes on the subject of all those sightings of images of the Virgin Mary.  There have certainly been a rash of them that apparently are quite ridiculous and so the media has paid them some attention mostly as a subject of ridicule.  Miraculous images are nothing new in the Church and of course there are some very good examples of very plausible ones such as Our Lady of Guadalupe. This interest provides the subtext of the plot.The story centers around a young boy Nathan Gray from a broken family who lives with his mother.  A rather  intelligent child with a large imagination that on the surface seems to be an escape from the past of an abusive father.  His dog Chewy might be man's best friend, but he is an imaginative man's best friend on the order of Harvey.  One day this young man sees something that defies explanation and is on the order of the miraculous and then he soon discovers an image of Mary on a cement wall that seems more than just a random water stain.The story is told through his eyes as he discovers more about Mary and the people involved in promoting what was becoming a new shrine.  He has intellectual curiosity and even though he and his mother belong to a local Protestant Church he does not see anything incongruent with what he is learning.  He also develops a friendship with one of the people in the local Catholic church in his small town along with the Catholic priest and also one of the pastors of the church he attends.The novel involves the tensions of this boy with an active imagination reporting this miraculous image and then the coming crowds to see this image and the towns involvement in seeing this as an opportunity to bring more money into the coffers as the image is on public land.  Further plot elements introduce some danger and further mysteries on a more material level.I really enjoyed the telling of the story and the boy's reactions to the multiple events that developed. There were a couple of plot points that seemed to be of a more implausible nature, but they didn't ruin the story for me.  This book is also not written as a novel disguised as Catholic apologetics and can easily be recommended to a wide audience as a good novel that takes faith seriously on both the Catholic and Protestant divid","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SGF5Y1UL6RAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005895OT0#wasThisHelpful","R2SGF5Y1UL6RAY","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Catholic Mass For Dummies is the latest book from Rev. John Trigilio Jr along with ev. Kenneth Brighenti, Rev. Monsignor James Cafone. They have done other books in the Dummies series such as the excellent Catholicism for Dummies and Saints For DummiesIt is surprising how nice a format the Dummies books are for teaching the Catholic faith. The formatting of the books seem to make them more accessible and the way fonts, titling, notes, and other things are implemented makes reading them some more comfier while still giving solid knowledge. I found the formatting of the YOUCAT to be engaging as our these specific Dummies books.This book on the Mass is much more thorough than a lot of introductory books to the Mass have been. Just packed for of information and I discovered many things I had not been aware of before. One thing I really liked it that it was not inclusive to the Latin Rite of the Church and the various rites of the Eastern Catholic Churches were covered throughout the book. Plus not only was the Ordinary Form of the Mass was covered in the Latin Rite, but attention was also given to the Extraordinary Form of the Mass.Lots of details and tidbits of information were given on the Mass from the liturgy, to architecture, vestments, etc. Really quite a thorough overview. The book is also written in a straight-ahead style that is devoid of any commentary by the authors. For example the chapter on architecture covered modern churches such as the L.A. Cathedral without making remarks that I am confident the authors held about this architectural style.This book would be at the top of my list to give to converts and people going through R.C.I.A. A lot of information is covered giving you the scope of the Church that is truly universal without having a book the size of a Russian novel.The only real caveat I had was that I wish there were drawings or graphics accompanying the section on liturgical vestments. Though,in the section on liturgical vestments for the Eastern Catholic Churches I discovered that they really do have the coolest names not only for vestments but other aspects of Divine Worship. The only error I noticed was on the Creed which they said was said Every Sunday and Holy Day of Obligation, that is true except for Easter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUN55XOACOK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470767863#wasThisHelpful","RUN55XOACOK5","A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UQN8ZBPCGQ49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are plenty of movie tough guys stretching back over the decades, and then there is Lee Marvin, a man for whom the adjective badass was invented.  In LEE MARVIN: POINT BLANK by Dwayne Epstein, we learn that it was no act, for Marvin was a true badass in real life.  Epstein‚Äôs book is well researched, it boasts a long list of interviews he conducted with family, fellow actors, directors, writers, producers and drinking pals who were there from the early days when Marvin started out in summer stock through the years of Hollywood stardom when he could command seven figures for a film role.For many of us fans, Lee Marvin‚Äôs movies and the stories of his hell raising in 60‚Äôs are well known, but Epstein gives us a look at the actor‚Äôs formative years, which laid the foundation for all that came after.  Born in 1924, he was the son of a WWI vet and a Southern Belle from Virginia; Lee and his brother Robert were named after the Confederate hero.  Both of his parents were distant in their relationships with their children and Lee grew up feeling that his father was emotionally repressed, while resenting a mother who placed great importance on social standing.  Marvin himself was a rambunctious child who loved the outdoors and did not take to school work, partly because of dyslexia.The molding event of Lee Marvin‚Äôs life, as it was for a generation, was his service in World War II.  He was a Marine who saw hard combat in the Pacific, an experience Epstein believes left him with a life long case of undiagnosed PTSD.  Epstein tells the story of Marvin‚Äôs years in the war through his own words, liberally quoting from letters he wrote back home to his parents and brother-the man was a very good writer and the reader gets a good feel for what he went through despite wartime censorship.After the war, there was no way Lee Marvin could have put on suit and tie and sat behind a desk all day; his energy and creative nature led him to acting, first in summer stock and then to small roles on Broadway.  Ultimately, he landed in Hollywood in the early 50‚Äôs where he found steady work playing villains in westerns and gangster movies.  He was tall, gangly as a younger man, possessed with the perfect actor‚Äôs gift-a distinctive voice, and better yet, great physical presence which made the audience take notice whenever he was on screen.  Lee Marvin was not considered leading man material in the age of Rock Hudson, but he made quite an impression on moviegoers playing bad guys in BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK, THE BIG HEAT, SHACK OUT ON 101, and SEVEN MEN FROM NOW.  He hated television, but did some of his best work there, including stints on Wagon Train and a now classic episode of The Twilight Zone.The changing culture of the 60‚Äôs opened up new opportunities for him, starting with an unforgettable performance opposite John Wayne and James Stewart in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE, directed by John Ford.  His work as the title villain nearly over shadowed his formidable co-stars and it remains one his most iconic performances.  It led to his being cast in Stanley Kramer's all star soap opera, SHIP OF FOOLS, where he had several memorable scenes with Vivian Leigh.  Suddenly, after many years in supporting parts, his tough guy persona started getting him big roles as the old casting rules fell by the wayside.  In THE KILLERS, THE DIRTY DOZEN, THE PROFESSIONALS, and POINT BLANK he set a standard that few would ever equal and made Lee Marvin the leading man of the cinema of violence.  His characters were hard men with blood on their hands who had no interest in redemption-quite a break with the heroes of the past.  Yet, he became among the very few to ever win a Best Acting Oscar for a comic performance when he won the Academy Award for CAT BALLOU.Throughout the long climb to the top in Hollywood, and the years on top, there was much going on in his private life, starting with the marriage to his supportive first wife, Betty, who gave him four children, followed by a tempestuous relationship with Michelle Triola, with whom he cohabitated for many years in the late 60‚Äôs.  Their breakup, and his abrupt second marriage to Pam Feeley, led to the infamous palimony lawsuit in the late 70‚Äôs, which only enhanced his reputation as a guy who lived by his own rules and didn‚Äôt give a damn. All through this are tales of Marvin‚Äôs epic drinking; ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt seem to like me when I‚Äôm drunk,‚Äù he is quoted at one point, for Lee Marvin could get mean when he was drinking.  But for all the stories of his boorish and ugly behavior while under the influence, there seemed to be few, if any, who genuinely disliked him.Many of us movie buffs truly love Lee Marvin, even after all this time since his death in 1987.  We loved the man who threw hot coffee in Gloria Grahame‚Äôs face in the BIG HEAT, who tried to bully Spencer Tracy in BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK, was one of the very few who could go to toe to toe with John Wayne in LIBERTY VALANCE, and led THE DIRTY DOZEN to glory.  Epstein‚Äôs book is a true gift to us fans, giving us a wealth of information.  Among my favorite parts is an addendum which lists the roles Marvin passed on or for which he was considered; this gives us some great might-have-beens: he contributed to the script for Sam Peckinpah‚Äôs masterpiece, THE WILD BUNCH with plans to star only to take a million dollar offer to do the musical PAINT YOUR WAGON; he turned down PATTON and was considered for the part of Quint in JAWS.  Had he taken those roles, would his star have dimmed quite so much as it did in the post STAR WARS era of the blockbuster?  There is also an addition which lists the roles he might have taken had he lived on into the 21st Century.  How great would it have been if Lee Marvin had been around long enough to work with Tarantino?I had the honor of visiting Lee Marvin‚Äôs grave in Arlington Cemetery on a Memorial Day a few years back, he was buried there after years of hard living finally caught up with him.  Still, we felt he was gone too soon and he has been missed greatly.  Dwayne Epstein‚Äôs book truly does the man justice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HR4Z1SWDE7Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936182572#wasThisHelpful","R1HR4Z1SWDE7Y1","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A FEAST FOR CROWS is George RR Martin‚Äôs fourth book in his SONG OF FIRE AND ICE series, now popularly known as the GAME OF THRONES books.  The first three were true page-turners in every way, filled with vivid characters and a finely detailed fantasy world that very much resembles medieval Britain, but this latest volume is something of a plod, for it has nothing like the shocking twists and turns of STORM OF SWORDS.  If the Red Wedding knocked you flat, then you‚Äôll be disappointed in CROWS, for nothing quite so outrageous occurs between its pages.  Furthermore, some of the epic‚Äôs biggest characters and fan favorites like Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow Daenerys Targaryen, Davos Seaworth, do not appear at all in the story, although they are constantly mentioned.  This is because Martin, in a note at the end of the book, decided to cut the fourth installment of GOT in half after writing it, with CROWS centering on the characters in and around Kings Landing, while the next book, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, will tell the simultaneous adventures of Tyrion and the others on far-flung shores.I think this was a mistake on Martin‚Äôs part and it makes CROWS feel awfully unbalanced at times, if for no other reason than there is no way to tell Tryrion‚Äôs story without the involvement of his twin siblings.  The other books have always benefited with the striking contrasts Martin has drawn between the conniving court at Kings Landing, the brutal existence and constant threat from an unseen evil that is life for the Night‚Äôs Watch on the Wall, and the barbarian struggles among the tribes of the Dothraki in their desert land.  I miss these places and their people, and constantly wonder what‚Äôs happening with them as I plowed through CROWS.As always, Martin chapters are told from a single point of view as we follow a multitude of characters, some more or less virtuous than others.  With some of the heavy hitters off stage in CROWS, some interesting heretofore-secondary characters get a chance to take a turn in the spotlight, namely Samwell Tarly, Jon Snow‚Äôs overweight friend from the Night‚Äôs Watch, who embarks on a journey at Jon‚Äôs insistence to become a Maester.  Like Samwell, many of the other POV characters are on journeys of their own, Arya Stark, who believing all her brothers and sisters are dead, travels to a temple called the House of Black and White where she will learn the ways of an assassin to better exact vengeance on her family‚Äôs many enemies.  Brienne of Tarth is on a mission, given her by Jaime Lannister, to find Sansa Stark, who is under suspicion in the murder of King Joffrey, a mission that may well prove fruitless as the reader knows Sansa‚Äôs whereabouts and that Brienne is hopelessly lost.  The story also goes to the Iron Islands where the Greyjoys are having a battle of succession, one that ends with a new ploy to make them a great power in Westeros.  In the kingdom of Dorne, Arianne Martell schemes to put another Baratheon child on the throne of Westeros, while her father, Doran Martell, makes moves that will insure that Dorne will survive the War of Five Kings unscathed.For me the two most interesting POV characters were the incestuous twins, Jaime and Cersei Lannister and Sansa Stark.  Jaime has become disinterested in the shenanigans at court in Kings Landing and in his sister as well.  Dispatched by Cersei, still the Queen Regent, to the Riverlands to end a rebellion, Jaime proves to be his cunning father‚Äôs son by concluding the conflict with a complete victory and without further bloodshed, which allows him to make a fateful decision.  Cersei proves to be less than her father‚Äôs daughter, for she lacks the shrewdness of either Tywinn or Tryion, instead letting fear and paranoia take control as she plots to rid herself of Margaery Tyrell, the teenage wife of her son, King Tommen, whom she suspects of planning to overthrow her mother-in-law.  We learn some interesting things about Cersei, especially the identity of her first love, as she willingly goes down a most treacherous path.The wanted Sansa Stark is now caught up in the manipulations of Petyr Baelish, who after murdering his wife and Sansa‚Äôs aunt, is now using her in a plan to take control of the kingdom of Vale long ruled by the Arryn family.  Passing as Petyr‚Äôs daughter, she is nursemaid to her sickly young cousin, Robert, and feeling she has no choice but to go along with Littlefinger, lest she fall into the vengeful hands of the Lannisters.Martin has a true knack for writing villains, the book really comes alive when Jaime, Cersei and Petyr are on the scene, not that Samwell or Brienne are not interesting in their own right.I am giving A FEAST OF CROWS  a high rating despite its disappointments simply because it still is a GAME OF THRONES book by George RR Martin, a master at fantasy world building and brilliant creator of compelling characters.  His characters spin their plots and make their plans with most of them leading to very unintended results.  Martin does well when he gives most of the story lines cliffhanger endings.  If CROWS does not live up to the high standards of the previous books, that is because the bar has been set pretty high.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GZBW9H282BQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055358202X#wasThisHelpful","R3GZBW9H282BQJ","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The heart of the problem many of THE WALKING DEAD fans have with the companion series, FEAR THE WALKING DEAD is this: the former had Rick, Shane, Michonne, Meryl and Darryl, and the Governor; bad assess and/or bad guys whose actions in the wake of the Zombie Apocalypse kept us riveted to our TV‚Äôs.  FEAR, on the other hand, has Travis, Madison, Nick, Liza and Daniel Salazar, respectively, an English teacher, a guidance counselor, a heroin addict, a nursing student and a barber (albeit one with a dark secret).  That is the point: FEAR begins back when Rick was in a coma and Shane was just the local Sheriff‚Äôs deputy on patrol and Lorie was the neighborhood bitch you avoided in the grocery store.  The characters in FEAR are supposed to come off as rather ordinary and mundane as their ordinary and mundane world begins to go straight to hell.It is very clear in the 90-minute pilot that this is going to be a very different type of story than TWD where the characters are thrust straight into the horrors of the Zombie Apocalypse, a place where extreme situations compelled the protagonists into extreme actions very quickly.  In FEAR, the characters often attempt to carry on as normal, expecting things to get better, only a perceptive few, like the student Tobias, the barber Daniel, and seemingly Madison, the guidance counselor, sense from the beginning that things will not work themselves out for the better.  A lot of TWD fans, who of course knew way more about the Zombie Apocalypse than the characters in FEAR, complained about the show‚Äôs slow pace and boring and/or wimpy characters and constantly compared the new show to its forbearer.  A good example is when Travis refuses to blow the head off a Walker after being given the opportunity by the local National Guard and goaded by the soldiers; Rick or Shane would never have done such a thing, but the point is that Travis is neither of them, nor is he in their shoes-yet. The Walkers barely show their faces in the first two episodes, and make no appearance at all in the third, which must be a first for a zombie show.  Instead, we get many scenes where Travis and Madison try to keep the peace among their extended family, now forced to live under one roof-it‚Äôs almost like The Brady Bunch meets the Zombie Apocalypse.I think FEAR was an intentional slow burn, and there were clearly budget concerns that at times made it seem like the most leisurely apocalypse ever.  There should be the sounds of gunfire and explosions coming from downtown LA during the middle episodes, and even if power is off most of the time, shouldn‚Äôt people be listening to emergency broadcast stations on their automobile radios?  There is simply no way the LA basin (or any other modern American metropolitan area) would empty out in a matter of days; if a truly deadly virus were to breakout, millions of people would barricade themselves in their homes and apartments.  We see none of that in FEAR.In short, the critic‚Äôs verdict:  too much talk, not enough Walkers and bullets to the head.I say to hell with the haters, I found FEAR to be a great drama about ordinary people caught up in an extraordinary situation, one filled with characters that were complex and full of possibility.  Travis is actually a strong man, one who will not be goaded into violence, but when confronted with the reality that compassion will not be returned in kind, explodes, revealing a side few have seen before-just ask Corporal Adams.  The steely Madison, who has no trouble bashing in the head of Walker Principle Artie to save Tobias, is a character with hints of a troubled past.  The screw up junkie Nick, Madison‚Äôs son, should be the first to die when the Walkers rise, but in tight spots he proves to be quite resourceful, like when he mooches off Mr. Hernandez‚Äôs morphine drip or lifts the cell key from Strand in the detention center without the man knowing it.  Daniel Salazar is a middle-aged barber, but from the get go proves to the show‚Äôs breakout badass.  Chris and Alisha are annoying potential teenage stepsiblings, but might they hookup?  Chris was clearly giving her the eye when they were trashing that abandoned house.  Victor Stand may have proved to be a savior at the detention center, but he‚Äôs obviously a man who does nothing out to the goodness of his heart.For me it all came together in the series finale, where Nick and Liza were rescued from the overrun detention center and for the first time, we get a herd of Walkers on a rampage, thanks to Daniel.  It‚Äôs filled with tension, narrow escapes, head bashings, beat downs, and good old gore; everything we Walking Dead fans have come to expect and love; really liked the infected soldier who takes a propeller to the face.  The escape into LA and the subsequent arrival at the temporary sanctuary of Strand‚Äôs beach house, followed by a shocking twist and tragic end for one character, sets thing up nicely for season 2.There was good acting by Cliff Curtis, Kim Dickens, Rueben Blades, Aliysha Debnam-Carey, Lorenzo James Henrie, and Shawn Hatosy; with special note to Frank Dillane‚Äôs acting as Nick for making us care about such a character and Colmen Domingo's slick work as Victor Strand.  Lincoln Castellanos‚Äôs Tobias was in only two early episodes, but he completely won over the audience. Please bring him back in season 2.There was some good dialog as well, my favorite being Daniel‚Äôs warning to the guards on duty that ‚ÄúYou should save your ammunition‚Äù just before all hell breaks loose at the detention center.If I fault the writers and creators anything in FEAR, it is that they seemed to be saving a lot for the second season, which is already green lighted.  This was not the case with the first season of TWD and Frank Darabont went out of his way to give us a complete arc in six episodes.  It‚Äôs my hope Robert Kirkman and Dave Erickson pull out all the stops when FEAR THE WALKING DEAD returns next year for a full 15 episode run.  And I  hope they make so that if Travis and Rick should ever meet, they would find they have much in common.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1018JNUN8PIKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0148ZDKP4#wasThisHelpful","R1018JNUN8PIKW","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Starz TV series version of the life of Spartacus, Roman gladiator turned rebel leader, always had a lot more in common with 300 than the Kirk Douglas/Stanley Kubrick classic movie.  The TV series was anything but subtle, with enough excess blood, gore and explicit sex to have earned it an NC-17 rating if it had been a feature film.  Many considered it a guilty pleasure during its original run, but now, more than two years after it concluded, it is obvious that SPARTACUS allowed viewers to enter a world every bit as complex and vivid as the one portrayed on GAME OF THRONES, but unlike Westeros, ancient Rome actually existed, and the gladiator schools, the arena, the opulent villas and estates ruled by patrician masters who made themselves virtual gods over their human slaves, were quite real.  Spartacus, Crixus, Caesar, Batiatus, Crassus and many more really did live and breathe on this earth at one time.  All of which makes SPARTACUS such a thrilling story.After the end of season 2, and the dispatching of such great antagonists as Glaber, Lucretia, and Ashur, I didn't know where the final season of SPARTACUS would go; being familiar with the historical facts, I knew it wouldn't end well for our heroes and wondered how producer Steven DeKnight would handle it.  I can say with certainty that SPARTACUS: WAR OF THE DAMNED ended things on just the right note in letting our heroes go down swinging against the hated Romans.  They may have lost, but they most definitely were not defeated.  For us loyal fans, this final trip to the arena with these vibrant characters we have come to care about with such passion is emotionally satisfying and a fine payoff after everything that has come before.We know from the beginning that Spartacus, Crixus, Gannicus and the rest will not emerge victorious in the their war against Rome, even if they've done a very good job of coming out on top so far.  The compelling storyline in WAR OF THE DAMNED is how they manage to continue to dodge their fate, and when it becomes inevitable, how well they meet it head on with courage in the face of all the fury Rome could throw at them.A couple of things stayed true to the end, the foremost being the pacing of the show, by which I mean never going more than two commercial breaks (10 minutes give or take) without the viewer being treated to a scene of hardcore gore and violence and/or explicit sex.  Did this show set a record for having characters copulate?  Same for having bodies impaled, hacked and dismembered.  And all of it in vivid color.Another was the stark contrast it drew between the haughty Romans and the salt of the earth slaves-something the Kubrick movie did as well by casting British actors as the Romans and Americans as the rebelling slaves.  In WAR OF THE DAMNED, the Roman commanders are still just as cruel, conniving and treacherous as their predecessors in previous seasons, staring with Simon Merrells as Marcus Crassus and Tod Lasance as Julius Caesar.  The only difference this time around is that Crassus and Caesar do not make the mistake of underestimating Spartacus in the same way as Glaber.  Christian Antidormi stands out as Tiberius, Crassus's son, an even more monstrous version of his father.Liam McIntyre had the unenviable task of stepping into Andy Whitfield's shoes when the latter was stricken with cancer after season one; he truly makes the role of Spartacus his own in this final season-a great tactical commander and a true leader of men, traits that McIntyre embodies perfectly.  He stands in good contrast with Manu Bennett's Crixus and Dustin Clare's Gannicus, his lusty and hot-tempered lieutenants-men who started out as rivals and opponents and became true brothers in making common cause against their oppressors. Cynthia Addai-Robinson as Naeiva, Crixus's soul mate, proves herself every bit a ferocious as the men.  It is truly hard to watch them meet their ends in the finale.One of the pleasures of SPARTACUS was the fascinating look it gave us at a pre Christian civilization-one where our notion of the dignity of all men and women and inherent rights of all people were very alien concepts.  It also gives us a world virtually without any sexual hang ups whatsoever; where same sex relationships were common and no big deal, as witness the gladiator Agron, played by Daniel Feuerriegal and the former house slave, Nasir (Pana Hema Taylor).  Agron being the only member of the House of Batiatus who does manage to survive and escape to freedom in the finale.In the time since SPARTACUS: WAR OF THE DAMNED concluded, fans have been able to catch Nick Taraday (Ashur) and Liam McIntrye as villains on THE FLASH series on the CW, while Manu Bennett (who's good in anything) was an awesome Deathstroke on the same channel's ARROW.  However, there will never be another SPARTACUS, it was so much more than a guilty pleasure, and it looks spectacular on Blu Ray.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQ3NJT4SAA1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B52FDXQ#wasThisHelpful","R2MQ3NJT4SAA1T","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you love epic horror and a great end of civilization novel, then Justin Cronin's THE PASSAGE is for you.  I picked this book up a few years ago after hearing Stephen King rave about it and finally got around to reading the the nearly 800 page novel recently.  I can say clearly that I had been missing out on one great horror/scifi/apocalypse mashup, the first book in what promises to be a trilogy.  Cronin's style is not what genre fans have been used to, for his pages are filled with long paragraphs filled with descriptive sentences that build an absorbing universe in which the story takes place.  Like all really good books, it's a story that works on more than one level; while it is a vampire apocalypse novel, it is at the same time a deeply moving love story about a grieving father for an adopted daughter and an epic saga on the human will not only to survive in the face of hopelessness, but to find a way to triumph against all odds.As has been noted by almost every reviewer, THE PASSAGE, is divided into two parts, the first set in a familiar near future, one where New Orleans has all but been destroyed by repeated hurricanes and there is even more war in the Middle East, and where a very top secret medical  research program, run by the United States Government, results in a viral holocaust, while the second part, set nearly a century into the future, recounts the efforts of a dwindling group of human survivors to find a cure for the virus that laid waste to North America, and by implication, most of the world.  In those first two hundred plus pages, we meet Amy, a small child who has been abandoned by her mother and who has come to the attention of Project NOAH, the secret military operation badly in need of test subjects with no close relatives; Amy is the thirteenth such subject, the first twelves being death row inmates.  It seems that a vampire virus has been discovered in the jungles of the Amazon and NOAH is seeking to refine it in order to create an immortal and indestructible soldier to better fight America's endless 21st century wars.  But things do not go as planned, the twelve inmates mutate into telepathic killing machines who manipulate the minds of their guards into releasing them, whereupon all hell breaks loose.  These creatures are filled with a craving for blood and possess super speed and strength, capable of shredding a human in seconds.  They can also infect others with a virulent strain of the vampire virus that turns its victims into undying Nosferatu like creatures, clones of their creators without a will of their own. The Twelve soon have an army of millions bent to their will.  Only Amy is spared this fate because-it is implied-she is ""special.""  Destined to seemingly live on indefinitely, she is the salvation the future survivors need if they are to save their world.The second half of the book picks up almost a hundred years after the end of civilization, where we meet a small community of survivors in the California mountains.  They've hung on because they still have the electricity that gives them enough light at night to keep the Virals (vampires) at bay, but the aging generators in their power station are wearing out and the future looks bleak until Amy wanders into their midst and some of the younger members of the community realize they have a chance for a better life.  But first they will have to journey to what is left of Project NOAH''s HQ in Colorado to learn the truth about how the world came to be in such a sorry state and to discover a possible cure for the virus.  It's a trek across a ravaged country filled with twists and surprising revelations.The first section of the book has a powerful narrative drive and a great central character in Brad Wolgast, the government operative tasked with collecting guinea pigs for Project NOAH; he's a tough guy with a tough past-he lost his only child to a deadly disease and now lives only for his work.  He's the man who always gets the job done and doesn't care if he gets his hands dirty in the process.  But Wolgast regains his humanity when he abducts Amy from a Memphis orphanage run by nuns and finds himself racked with doubt and guilt at the prospect of turning this little girl over to the ruthless men who run Project NOAH.  Wolgast ultimately proves himself the hero, but not before NOAH blows up in everyone's faces.Cronin does not give us a blow by blow account of the end of the world as we knew it, but through a fleeing Wolgast's eyes we get just enough information about the enveloping apocalypse to fill in all the blank spots as an army of superhuman and blood thirsty monsters spreads from Colorado to all corners of North America.The second and longer part, is set in the West, where some survivors fled in the final days of the war; many readers have found this part too long, without the urgent pace or compelling characters of the first section.  It does take it's time to set up the post apocalyptic world and introduces a whole new cast of people the reader has to get to know, but I found myself rooting for Peter, Michael, Alisha and Caleb once they were on the road to Colorado with Amy in tow.  We are treated to a nightmare landscape of a ruined America, where the horrific end of the war against the Virals can be found everywhere-a library filled with the corpses of  poisoned children and a stopover in Las Vegas which reveals how guests barricaded themselves in the hotels and played Russian Roulette as the city was overrun.  Another community of survivors is encountered and we soon learn the horrifying price they pay to keep on living.  And always there are the Virals lurking in the shadows and in the night, some under the control of the thing that was once murderer Giles Babcock, who makes all those who come near share his endless dream of matricide. But as monstrous as the world is, this hardy group manages to rise to the occasion, and with the help of some Texas militiamen (parts of the Lone Star state are still intact) reach their journey's end in Colorado where there is a measure of resolution and the table is set for the next installment in the trilogy titled THE TWELVE.Any longtime reader of genre fiction will recognize many tropes from horror and science fiction in THE PASSAGE: the ""special child"" who will lead them, the haunted tough guy with a secret heart of gold, the top secret and nefarious government agency engaged in immoral experiments for selfish ends that all goes bad; the ruthless black ops guy who has no problem gunning down civilians in public on the spur of the moment when necessary; lots of able, brave and capable female characters, while all the villains are men.  In an interview with Cronin at the end of my paperback copy, he freely admits to using them, admitting to how much he enjoyed their appearances in other works; but he clearly puts his own spin on them, making these characters and people much more than cliches.  His Virals may technically be vampires, but Cronin makes them most unique to his own work and does a good job with the phony science necessary for this kind of story to sound real and plausible.That's not to say there aren't a few logic holes and things left inexplicably unexplained-like how does Sister Lacey know to follow Amy to the Project NOAH installation in Colorado or why do the animals at the zoo react so wildly to Amy's presence?  And there are more than a few plot threads left dangling to be answered in the next book: what happened to Grey after he was bitten by Subject Zero? What about Peter and Theo's father who just rode away?  Who saved Theo and Mausami at the farm?  All things that will have to wait.In the era of THE WALKING DEAD, there has been a glut of apocalyptic fiction, and I will be the first to say that THE PASSAGE plows no new ground, but it's still a great and very entertaining read just the same.  I could pick it up and in no time fly through fifty pages, which is a good thing in so long a book.I am Babcock.We are Babcock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S32GU0BLGAPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345504976#wasThisHelpful","R1S32GU0BLGAPR","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you liked the first two seasons of AMERICAN HORROR STORY, then you'll love the third season, subtitled COVEN.  This time the anthology series heads down south to New Orleans and sets the action in a school for young witches.  That is the main story for this season, but as in the previous ones, there is always multiple story lines happening at once.  At times it seems like each character is a twisted arc all their own as their plot threads play out over thirteen episodes.  Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk have a real knack for this kind of everything including the kitchen sink story telling and they don't let their fans down this time.As always, AHS is not for those who offend easily, this season we are treated to: bloody torture, rape, self mutilation, incest, necrophilia, pedophilia, hardcore racism, not to mention a mother giving an enema to her adult son, and of course, Jessica Lange drinking a lot and cursing up a storm.  Consider yourself warned.The season centers around a gaggle of young witches played by Tessa Farmiga, Emma Roberts, Gabourney Sibide, and Jan Brewer who have been sent to the Big Easy to learn how to use their powers by  headmistress Sarah Paulson, whose mother, played by Lange, is the Supreme Witch, head of the coven and capable of performing The Seven Wonders, all specific acts of magic.  But it seems that Lange, who has spent many years away, is dying of cancer and must relinquish her title.  The problem: Lange is not ready to go, and is gunning for any young witch who might take her place.  The bigger problem: these young modern witches have minds of their own and are not about to be led to the slaughter by their elder.  Things do get ugly before the final episode, where a new Supreme is crowned, only it's not who you might expect.The main subplot concerns series newcomers, Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett, as Madame LaLaurie, an immortal Old South aristocrat from the 19th Century and Marie LeVeau, the equally immortal voodoo priestess, who cursed LaLaurie with eternal life back in the day and buried her alive.  LeVeau, who is at war with Lange's coven, doesn't like it one bit when her enemy digs up LaLaurie and gives her a job as a maid in the Witch's Academy.  LaLaurie, for her part, is aghast at having to serve blacks and horrified that someone like Obama is President.  Is this a sly commentary on the Tea Party?  Bates and Bassett are the best thing about this season-two real scenery chewers doing what they do best and I was a little disappointed by the flat resolution of their story line in the next to last episode.A lot of series regulars are back, besides Lange and Paulson, there is Frances Conroy as a ginger headed witch who gets burned at the stake more than once; Denis O'Hare as a butler with a real thing for dolls, living or otherwise; Evan Peters as a frat boy Farmiga becomes smitten with, who well earns the name of Frankenteen; Lily Rabe as a swamp witch who can raise the dead.  Other newcomers are: Danny Huston, as an ax wielding psycho of a trumpet player whose had a thing for Lange a very long time; Lance Reddick as Papa Legba, the shrewd king of hell; Pattie LuPone as a Christian fundamentalist neighbor and Alexander Dreymon as her hunky son to whom Brewer takes a shine.  Familiar faces like Mare Winningham and Leslie Jordan also turn up in small parts.  And Stevie Nicks is Stevie Nicks, the witch who sings Rhiannon and Seven Wonders.They do a great job of creating the proper New Orleans atmosphere, exotic and ominous at the same time; how cool would it if the characters of COVEN were to encounter Louis, Lestat and the Mayfair witches of Anne Rice's books or run into Sookie, Eric and Bill Compton from Charlaine Harris's TRUE BLOOD.  Only in fan fiction.The acting is great as usual, even if it is over the top, by now does Bates qualify as the 21st Century Shelley Winters? Roberts nails it in a wicked take down of the spoiled Hollywood teen star and no one does the Dragon Lady act better than Lange.  I do think some of the targets  Murphy and Falchuk take on this season-southern racists, sexists and Christian fundamentalists-are easy ones that Hollywood loves to trash.  And if the message of this show is female empowerment, then it's a very mixed one considering the witchin' and bitchin' these ladies do during the course of the season.But no one tunes into AMERICAN HORROR STORY for the preaching or the sermons.  I always make it a point to catch it on Blu Ray, where I can watch four episodes at one time.  Cannot wait for FREAK SHOW to come out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20LZPI8HQN5A1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQY4C86#wasThisHelpful","R20LZPI8HQN5A1","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ANT-MAN has never been on Marvel's A list in the same way as The Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor; but neither is he on the same level as Moon Knight.  The character is essential to the comic book version of The Avengers, and a stand alone film introducing him to the cinematic Marvel Universe is quite appropriate.  And if the movie does not swing for the fences in the same way as the first AVENGERS film or last year's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, it certainly tells its story of with wit, charm and just the right amount of action and special effects.ANT-MAN is an origin story, which some critics mistakenly believe is the easiest to tell; there have been two heroes to call themselves Ant-Man, the first being Hank Pym, a scientific genius who develops the suit which will allow a man to shrink to the size of an insect, while the second is Scott Lang, a guy who has done a stretch for B&E into a greedy corporation, but who also possesses a Masters in Electrical Engineering. The movie is the story of the latter, who learns from original how to master the suit and the science in order to stop Darren Cross, Pym's former protege, who is planning to sell the Ant-Man technology to Hydra.The first hour of the movie is filled with exposition, introduction, and set up, but it's done in a way that doesn't drag the movie down and make it feel like forever until the action starts up.  We learn about Hank Pym and why is estranged from his former colleagues and daughter; we get to know Scott Lang, just out of prison and weighted down with a lot of back due child support.  And we see Darren Cross racing to perfect what Pym has already discovered, but has hidden away from the world.  Over the course of the movie, these three story strands become entwined, eventually leading to the inevitable showdown between Ant-Man and his mirror opposite, Yellow Jacket.As with all good super hero movies, the story works on more than one level.  In one way, ANT-MAN is a heist film, with Scott Lang recruited by an elder to steal from the villains before something bad occurs; there is more than one scene that could have been lifted right out of a classic caper film-think OCEAN'S ELEVEN with super powers.  In another way it is the story of family and the bonds that hold and break with the unintended consequences of both: Scott wants to provide for his daughter and keep her love now that she has a new step dad in her life; Hank Pym has had a strained relationship with his own daughter, who is resentful about events in the past concerning her deceased mother; Darren Cross is the rejected son of Hank, while Scott is his worthy replacement.The casting and acting is spot on, starting with Paul Rudd in the title part; after all his roles in Apatow comedies, he would seem to be a odd choice to play a super hero, but they may have the single one he was born to play. Marvel's heroes have so often been average guys endowed with extraordinary abilities through incredible circumstances; Rudd is the personification of this classic character, especially in the scenes where he is trying to master the Ant-Man suit and his new powers.  Up till now, Rudd has never been the big star he should have been, hope this movie changes that.  Michael Douglas is perfect as Hank Pym, a once arrogant genius, now humbled by loss; Douglas's bigger than life persona and acting style is just what this role requires.  Darren Cross's Yellow Jacket is a Marvel staple-the protege gone bad and Cory Stoll plays the part well.  Evangeline Lilly is Pym 's daughter, who may be destined to become the second Wasp, and having an actor from LOST fits right in to the cast.  Michael Pena is always a welcome presence in any movie, here he plays one of Scott's friends from prison who comes to play a vital part in the action.  Anthony Mackie's Falcon from the last Captain America movie shows up when Scott tries to break into the Avengers HQ and they have a terrific and very funny fight.  Hayley Atwill shows up as and older Peggy Carter, as does John Slattery, playing Howard Stark in a flashback.The special effects are good without being overpowering, they are used in clever ways to show the unique powers Ant-Man and Yellow Jacket have-like a battle to the death on a toy train set or throw down inside a tumbling brief case.One of the best things about ANT-MAN is its lighter tone, this is not the X-Men or Spider-Man with their weighty themes of guilt and redemption; director Peyton Reed, who took over for Edgar Wright, does a good job of telling a story about a super hero who really enjoys being a super hero.  And I don't miss all those time travel and alternate universe paradoxes from the X-Men films one bit.  And listen for the references to the Hulk and Spider-Man.Of course there are a couple of post credit scenes that advance the story along and set things in motion for the next Marvel movie; the most significant one here, ties up a loose end from WINTER SOLDIER and gets the action rolling for CIVIL WAR.I cannot wait.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29LE2VVRSNAH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGDIGZ2#wasThisHelpful","R29LE2VVRSNAH9","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Season 4 of HBO's excellent BOARDWALK EMPIRE picks up in early 1924, a few months after the events of the third season as Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson sits down and makes peace with Joe ""the Boss"" Masseria and Arnold Rothstein from New York after the war caused by the late Gyp Rosetti.  Everyone agrees to pay up what they owe for the trouble they've cause, let bygones be bygone, and everyone will go back to the very lucrative business of quenching America's thirst during Prohibition.  But Nucky will soon learn in Season 4, peacetime can be just as much a hell as war.That's because none of these characters are ever truly satisfied with what they've got and there is always some scheme to make a little more at someone else's expense, such as Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano's plan to import heroin up from Florida, hidden away in cases of bootleg whiskey being transported in Nucky's trucks. Or Al Capone, who is no longer satisfied being Johnny Torrio's second in command in Chicago.  Then there is Federal Agent Knox, who is not content to just to arrest bootleggers in Atlantic City, he wants to nail the whole organization (Nucky, Masseria, Rothstein and all the rest) in one big bust, and to hell with who you have to threaten, lean on or leave twisting in the wind to get there.  Ambition and desire prove to be poison for more than one character, and when the season is done nothing will be as it was before and some familiar faces and fan favorites will bite the dust.Another theme of this fourth season is family and the ties that bind or break: Chalky White pretends to the family man, but not when he's inside his Onyx Club on the boardwalk and his eye wonders to the new jazz singer, the ironically named Daughter Maitland; Willie Thompson, Nucky's college student nephew plays a deadly prank on a classmate and turns to his uncle, not his father, for help; the disfigured Richard Harrow seemingly finds a home at last, but learns the past is not done with him; a twist of circumstances forces Eddie Kessler to confront the possibility of facing the sons he abandoned in Germany years before; and Gillian Darmody, alone in the world and addicted to drugs, desperately grasps at a chance to regain her grandson and make a new start with a new man.All of this makes for a lot of drama, and there were many who have complained that in Season 4, some of it was stretched beyond credence after what we had seen in the three previous seasons. That Eli Thompson would not have gotten himself back into a fix where he'd be forced to betray his brother yet again or that Chalky White would not abandon his family, not to mention his position in the community, after failing to kill a rival.  I think these are the problems many series get when they reach this point in their run and the writers have to keep spinning a yarn to keep the interest of the viewer.More than just about any other recent TV show, BOARDWALK EMPIRE really set out to be an epic and it had the story telling pace of a big thick novel; something would happen in one episode and the repercussions would not be felt until much later, as with the the salesmen Nelson Van Alden did dirt back in Season 3 who return for vengeance at a most inopportune time in Season 4 (this really does not end well for someone or someones).  For this reason alone, BOARDWALK EMPIRE has always been a good candidate for binge watching-it looks fantastic on Blu Ray, they way I have watched it after renting the discs from Netflix.As always the cast is near perfect, starting with Steve Buccemi as Nucky, a man who works very hard at never getting put in a corner.  This season allowed some supporting characters to shine, along with the actors who played them; this is especially true of Michael Kenneth Williams as Chalky and Shea Whigham as Eli Thompson along with Anthony Laciura as Eddie Kessler.  Plenty of familiar faces return as well: Stephen Graham's Al Capone; Michael Shannon's Van Alden; Erik Harvey's Dunn Purnsley; Jack Huston, who does his acting with half a face, as Richard Harrow; and Paul Sparks, ever annoying as Mickey Doyle.  Kelly MacDonold's Margaret Shroeder is largely absent from most of the season, and this is to her benefit. She actually acquits herself well in small subplot where she helps herself by helping Michael Stulhbarg's Arnold Rothstein.  Gretchen Mol has a great scene where her Gillian Darmody finally reaps what she has sewed.There were some impressive new faces in this season, starting off with Patricia Arquette's Sally Wheet, a Florida rum runner who just might be Nucky's soul mate; Jeffrey Wright's Dr. Valentin Narcisse, a golden tongued fraud who pretends to help his race while lining his pockets with drug money (the first of many in American history); Ben Rosenfield's Willie Thompson, a chip off his uncle's block; Brian Geraghty's Agent Knox, a man who believes a little to strongly in doing what it takes to get the job done.  There is Eric Ladin as the young J. Edgar Hoover, just getting started on a career that would make him America's supreme bureaucrat and a master of public relations.  And old pro Lou Gossett Jr. reminds us he's still got the chops in a small part as Chalky's mentor.The year 1924 was a crossroads for America, it's the year the Jazz Age, as it became known, arrived and perceptive Americans began to realize that Prohibition was a disaster, one which was leaving much wreckage in its wake.  But turning the country around would take time and much more would be lost in the futile war against intoxication.Season 4 was also a crossroads for BOARDWALK EMPIRE, in four seasons, it had found many loyal and devoted fans, but it was clear that it would never be a smash hit on the level of THE SOPRANOS or BREAKING BAD.  So rather than continue on through the decade with Nucky Thompson battling with his various competitors over turf (which is what is implied in the season finale), HBO decided to wrap things up in Season 5 with a time skip to the early 30's.  A bittersweet decision for us fans who were willing to take the long ride with Nucky and the gang in Atlantic City.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXVSGEQQWR0ON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEP9MYG#wasThisHelpful","RXVSGEQQWR0ON","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a life long movie buff and a real fan of REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, a film every bit as influential as CITIZEN KANE.  So I didn't want to pass up a chance to read a bio of Sal Mineo, whose performance as the troubled teen, Plato, in REBEL is iconic.  Along with his REBEL co-stars James Dean and Natalie Wood, Mineo played a prominent part in the creation the post war youth culture that has become such a part of the American fabric.Michael Gregg Michaud's bio does a very good job telling Mineo's typically American story: an Italian  kid from The Bronx whose mother put him in dancing school to keep him from falling in with street gangs. This put Mineo on a path that eventually led to a part in the Broadway musical production of THE KING AND I with Yul Brynner, which then led to Hollywood and the big break with a role in REBEL. Mineo would go on other movie roles, most often as a juvenile delinquent, and a short lived, but surprisingly successful, singing career as a teen idol.But despite two Academy Award nominations, one for REBEL (for which he really should have won) and the other for EXODUS, his career waned as the '60's wore on, good movie roles dried up and the only steady work Mineo could get was in episodic television.  It's a familiar trajectory for many talented actors who hit it big while young, but never find the one great part that would have have guaranteed them adult stardom.  I always thought it was a shame he wasn't considered for the lead in WEST SIDE STORY, he certainly had the musical background for the part.The second half of Michaud's well researched book could be considered the story of a has been, only Sal Mineo never saw himself as one, he kept on working and looking for new challenges after freeing himself from the control of his family, which had taken full advantage of his early monetary success while still a minor.  One of the big appeals of this book to some is the depiction of Sal Mineo's private life and bisexual exploits.  Michaud talked extensively with Jill Haworth and Courtney Burr, the two great loves of his life and they paint a picture of an essentially nice, if sometimes volatile, man who might not have always exhibited the best judgement-he spent many years trying to interest the studios and investors in productions with extremely limited commercial appeal.  He really wanted the part of Michael in THE GODFATHER, but they went with an unknown like Al Pacino, but Mineo benefited in an indirect way in the mid 70's when every cop show on prime time needed swarthy actors to play in shows featuring Mafia characters.  In the later part of his career, Mineo wanted to direct on the stage and his choice of material, which often included nudity and homosexual relationships caused whispers about his life style and definitely lost him work on TV.  His life was cut short by a brutal murder in 1976, denying Mineo the opportunity to have a great career third act like his REBEL co-star, Dennis Hopper.  It does say something well about Mineo that unlike many other performers who hit it big early, he apparently never fell victim to drug and alcohol addiction.Michaud's book is a must for those who enjoy a behind the scenes look at Hollywood, although I would have liked a little more historical context on how the culture went from the squeaky clean 50's to the anything goes 60's in so short a time.  A lot of names are dropped in this book (Bobby Sherman, Jon Provost, Jay North), with some surprising, though unverifiable, revelations.All three leads in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE came to violent ends, it gives the movie a very poignant feel when watching it now; read Michael Gregg Michaud's SAL MINEO and learn the story of one of them; he doesn't deserve to be forgotten.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MCK3KITVHXFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307716678#wasThisHelpful","R2MCK3KITVHXFL","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best thing I could say about MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is that director George Miller picks up right where THUNDERDOME left off, not once does he betray the fact that 30 years has passed since the last time we visited his awesome post apocalyptic world and spent time with survivor and former cop, Max Rockatansky. This movie could just as easily been the fourth installment released in 1988 and starring Mel Gibson.FURY ROAD spends little time exposition or backstory as the movie opens with Max being captured in the opening scene by the minions of Immortan Joe, a monstrous warlord who rules a desert oasis like a feudal master-a place where water, fuel, blood, and human flesh are precious commodities.  Like Lord Humongous and Auntie Entity before him, Immortan Joe wields power through the constant threat of brutality, and all either serve him blindly or cower under his heel.But Joe has a problem which presents an opportunity for the captured Max: Furiousa, one of his loyal lieutenants has turned against him and fled into the wastelands with Joe's harem of young lovelies, who exist only to breed for their master.  During the ensuing battle, Max, who is being slowly drained of his blood, makes his escape and reluctantly throws in with Furiousa and the girls as they are relentlessly chased across the desert by Joe and his extended family of post apocalyptic goons.That is pretty much it for the plot, about which some people have complained, bitching over a lack of character development and story.  I'm really at a loss for words when people complain that there is too much action in a movie.  The characters are very much defined visually with  quick snippets of dialog, and I would say FURY ROAD  has about as much plot as either THE ROAD WARRIOR or BEYOND THUNDERDOME.  This is not some convoluted super hero movie, everything is very basic-you fight like hell to survive or you die.What is great about FURY ROAD is the lack of obvious CGI; Miller gave his stunt people a real workout as they jump and caper atop huge mechanical mutants racing at incredible speeds through barren country.  Miller's camera is never still, it swoops high overhead and then down to the ground in the blink of an eye; nobody puts the viewer in the middle of the action better, and of course there are the patented shots with the camera mounted to the front bumper-a staple of all MAX movies.There is a strain of pop culture feminism running through the movie: women are oppressed nurturers, while old men in authority endlessly fight with each other over property, power and possession. Or it could be a dig at Islamic fundamentalists like ISIS who would rule with an iron hand through terror and reduce women to the level of property.  But no one's being fooled here, we bought a ticket to see trucks and cars go real fast and then crash into each other-the video equivalent of a thrill ride.The only really murky part about FURY ROAD is the timeline, it's not clear how much time has passed since THUNDERDOME; Max appears to have hardly aged at all, yet this movie gives us the feeling that at least a generation or more has passed since the collapse of civilization.Tom Hardy makes a good replacement for Mel Gibson, you could almost count his lines of dialog on two hands while most of his acting is done with his eyes.  Charlize Theron is Furiousa, a female road warrior, and something not seen before in this series: a perfect match for Max.  Nicholas Hoult is Nux, one of Joe's junior brutes who has a change of heart when circumstances throw him in with Max and the girls.  Hoult is one of the best young actors working today and gives the best real performance in the movie.  Josh Helman, who played Bill Stryker in DOFP, turns up here as one of Nux's compatriots. Hugh Keays-Byrne is truly scary as Immortan Joe, with his death's head mask, he is could well be one of Apocalypse's Four Horsemen.  Keays-Byrne played Toecutter in the original MAD MAX more than three decades ago now.But the real star of FURY ROAD is George Miller and the vivid world he created on screen; a hellish future where humanity survives in state of perpetual insanity.  If it does not seem quite so original anymore, that's because in the intervening years so many film makers have borrowed from Miller's vision.  If you want proof, just binge watch THE WALKING DEAD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G9U5P5EJD4J9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQ141W8#wasThisHelpful","R1G9U5P5EJD4J9","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you loved Joss Whedon's first take on Marvel's ultimate superhero group, then you will love even more his followup, AVENGERS: THE AGE OF ULTRON.  The whole gang is back: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (CGI Mark Ruffalo), The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), along with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, who else?) to take on a nasty piece of AI that calls itself, Ultron and is voiced to perfection by James Spader.  They even give the robot version of Ultron a face that ever so slightly resembles Spader, so the voice is a perfect match, even though there were times I thought the movie could have been called Avenger vs Red Reddington.  Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elisabeth Olsen are the newcomers this time as the twins Quicksilver and The Scarlett Witch, characters familiar to any Marvel reader; here they are humans enhanced by the villain Baron Von Strucker (another Marvel mainstay) who ally themselves with Ulton in order to get vengeance on industrialist Tony Stark (Iron Man's true identity) who manufactured the munitions that destroyed the twins village and killed their parents.Whedon does an excellent job of hitting the right marks in his second Avengers movie.  Basically, the Avengers are a group of very diverse siblings, with Nick Fury the uncle who tries his best to keep them focused on the job at hand despite a lot of very strong personalities-not to mention some who are just very, very strong.  Banner and Stark are the men of science and intellect, always trying to think two steps ahead and be the smartest ones in the room, while Thor and Steve Rogers know that sometimes all you can do is make a fist and out punch the bad guy.  Hawkeye is the working stiff without super powers, but with a deadly skill and a determination to get the job done.  The Black Widow is haunted by a past that casts a long shadow over the here and now, not to mention any future she might have with Banner, for whom she has developed feelings.We do find out that Hawkeye is really a family man in a very nice side trip during the action and also learn about the Widow's early days. The banter and dialog between these diverse characters is right out of the comics and spot on in the movie.The action scenes are first rate, the highlight being the battle between the Hulk and Stark in a Hulkbuster suit after the Witch has messed with the green Goliath's mind; the earth shakes and buildings fall as we are given the kind of throw down once only reserved for the pages of a comic book.  The movie opens with another on the nose action scene as the Avengers take down Von Strucker's Hydra lair, there is no Kirsten Dunst singing here.  And the finale, which boasts a city rising into the atmosphere so that Ultron can crash it to earth and wipe out humanity, does not provoke unflattering comparison's to several X-Men films, including DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, that had similar effects.Ulron is the creation of Tony Stark's hubris when he tries to create a weapons system capable of protecting the earth from cosmic Big Bads; Ultron decides that humans are the ultimate villains and the planet will be well rid of them.  An AI which turns against humanity was well on its way to being a trope back in the earliest Star Trek days, and the movie is a little weak on Ulron's motivations and where his animus comes from-sometimes it appears he is bad just because he's bad, something that is a weakness of comic villains.  I don't think anyone can be faulted for missing Tom Hiddleston's Loki, a villain who was as handsome as the heroes and even more witty.  He was one of the main reasons why the first AVENGERS movie worked so well.  But anything with James Spader is well worth the time.There are a lot of returning faces from other movies in the Marvel franchise: Stellan Skargaard, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Cobie Smoulders; one welcome new face is Andy Serkis as the arms dealer Klaue, yet another name familiar to Marvel readers.  Paul Bettany, previously the voice of Jarvis, appears as the Vision.  By the end of the movie's more than two hours running time, it is getting a little crowded.There has been a lot of complaints that AGE OF ULTRON does not break any new ground, that despite all the sound and fury, none of the heroes are ever truly in danger of losing their lives.  Well, THE GOOD, THE BAD, and THE UGLY didn't break any new ground when it came to the Man With No Name, but it's a hell of a good movie just the same.  I think the Wow factor, which was there with the first movie, has worn off a little with some fans the second time around.When will we get to see Josh Brolin's Thanos take center stage after another appearance in a post credits scene?  And the one thing that have made this a five star movie for me would have been at least a fleeting glimpse of Spider-Man at the end now that his rights have been bought back by Disney/Marvel.  He's supposed to appear in the upcoming Civil War arc, so it would have been nice to see him here.  Anyway, this is one film that is a must in Blu Ray.The different points of view on protecting the public between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, hinted at in ULTRON, will explode in CIVIL WAR, guaranteeing us more action for years to come.  Personally I would like to see them do a version of the Korvac Saga-maybe one day.  And maybe one day we'll see an appearance by THE YOUNG AVENGERS, one of Marvel's best 21st century comics, paving the way for a new generation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM6GTPXHHZF2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAJ8QXC#wasThisHelpful","RM6GTPXHHZF2P","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seymour Hersh's THE DARK SIDE OF CAMELOT came out almost 20 years ago now and was quite a sensation with its tabloid tales of lying, manipulating, and infidelity by John F. Kennedy during his rise to power and in the White House.  I remember the book being a bestseller around the time of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal and it was cited with glee by many on the right wing as documented proof that all Democrats were immoral and sexually degenerate.  When I recently picked up Hersh's book, I wondered how well it had stood the test of time, while curious to see what all the fuss was about originally.I can say that as a work of history, THE DARK SIDE OF CAMELOT falls short simply because Hersh never gives us the full picture-we get anecdote after anecdote of bad behavior by JFK, usually of a sexual nature, with nary a hint at what this man was doing on the world stage-the Berlin Crisis, the Bay of Pigs, the Civil Rights movement and its clashes with the segregationist South, an across the board tax cut, the showdown with the steel industry are all given short shrift.What we are given are tales of Kennedy's epic sexual misadventures with a very wide variety of women, ranging from Marilyn Monroe to mobster's moll, Judith Campbell Exner, to party girl and possible East German spy, Ellen Romestch. These dalliances, along with the regular skinny dips in the White House swimming pool with ""bimbos,"" paint a portrait of a man saddled with one hell of a sex addiction.  If anything, the years since the publication of THE DARK SIDE OF CAMELOT have given us even more stories of JFK's sexual conquests as more women have come forward with tales of being bedded by the President.  Here Hersh paints a portrait of a dangerously reckless man with no personal moral compass and seemingly incapable of grasping the possible consequences of his actions.  And in this, he was doing neither himself or his country any good.Hersh uncovers revelations about JFK's health that shows up his well crafted image of vigor as nothing but a lie, as the man battles Addison's disease, a very bad back, Crohn's disease and quite possibly VD; and gives us the lowdown on how Max Jacobsen, the original Dr. Feelgood, injected the President with pain reducing drugs of dubious quality.But what Hersh fails to do is make a definitive case that John F. Kennedy's sex life and exotic medical care had a detrimental effect on his performance as President; while he may have had the sex drive of a rabbit and gotten daily ""boosts"" by way of a needle, neither of these facts have any bearing on the policies JFK pursued as President-which is his real legacy.The Cuban Missile Crisis does get some space.  Hersh depicts Kennedy and his brother, Robert's, secret war against Fidel Castro as being motivated by purely personal animus.  From it came Operation Mongoose and a dozen or more failed assassination attempts on Castro by a CIA in league with the Mafia, all at the direction of Robert Kennedy.  According to Hersh, this secret war was responsible for driving Castro into the arms of the Soviets and precipitating the Missile Crisis which was resolved when Kennedy cut a back door deal with Khrushchev to pull US missiles out of Turkey in return for the Russians withdrawing theirs from Cuba-something quite different from ""the eyeball to eyeball and the other guy blinked"" final act Kennedy admirers have pointed to all these years.  Only problem: there are plenty of serious historians who have done extensive research, the most recent being Robert Caro in his LBJ bio, who give a far more objective view of the event.Papa Joe Kennedy is made out to be a manipulating monster, one who cuts deals with Sam Giancana to win the state of Illinois for his son and spends a fortune to win the West Virginia primary for him.  These stories have been around since 1960, and in the age of Koch brothers and their ilk, have lost much of their potency.  These days, Joe Kennedy just looks like a man ahead of his time.Seymour Hersh is an investigative reporter and no right wing hatchet man who turns out hate screeds against liberals and Democrats, his reporting on George W. Bush's war in Iraq is more than enough proof of that.  But one does question his methods in writing THE DARK SIDE OF CAMELOT with its many hearsay sources, many of whom had stories other journalists were aware of for years and would not go near for lack of proof. There is the case of the long dead Florence Kater, a Maryland landlord whose story is recounted Hersh's book, yet the documentation cited does not exist; Judith Exner's story changed over the years and was embellished considerably in the 90's when she was ill with cancer and had fallen on hard times financially.  Many reviewers at the time chided Hersh for being gullible in his quest to write a book he knew would be a bestseller because of its sensationalism.Yet Hersh is a good writer and presents his facts well, even if they are dubious; THE DARK SIDE OF CAMELOT is never dull and for the serious reader of history like myself, quite the contrast to all the puff pieces and worshipful books written by the many Kennedy acolytes over the years.Looking back, there really was something about John F. Kennedy and his family that was a true break with the past in America, and not just because of their Irish Catholic heritage.  The Kennedy's were brash and crass in the way they wore their ambitions openly and went after what they wanted without false humility. While many responded to this new style of leadership, it rubbed an equal number the wrong way and it still does.Perhaps it was generational; John F. Kennedy was like many men who had seen what the Depression had done to America and then had gone to war and now had no intention of waiting his turn like the men of previous generations.  It can be said that Richard Nixon was just as ruthless and pushy as JFK, but the man could mask it in public with a pious resentment that appealed to just as many as those who were drawn to Kennedy's charisma.THE DARK SIDE OF CAMELOT paints John F. Kennedy as a shallow man, all style and fake substance, a real life version of the Kennedy who appeared in James Ellroy's AMERICAN TABLOID; it's interesting that detractors said the same of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, yet long after they were gone, many Americans would look back at the years of these three Presidents with great fondness and miss them terribly.  Something for historians to consider.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EXD6ERKK4XSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316359556#wasThisHelpful","R3EXD6ERKK4XSP","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There must be a million books written about John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, the admiring ones paint him as a gifted leader whose triumphant life story ended in an unspeakable tragedy just as he was about to make his mark on history.  That is how Thurston Clarke sees it in this book that gives the reader a day by day account of the last three months of Kennedy's time in the White House.  So many books have covered this ground and advanced this same theme in the last five decades, why read one more?Because JFK's LAST HUNDRED DAYS is as much about what might have been as it is about what happened.  The John F. Kennedy of the autumn of 1963 was a man who was finally hitting his stride as President after nearly two and a half years of one crisis after another: The Bay of Pigs; the Berlin Wall; catching up to the Russians in space; Oxford, Mississippi, the steel companies, Vietnam, and the showdown with Khrushchev over the missiles in Cuba.  According to Clarke, JFK had weathered the storms and trials of his first term and was looking forward to setting the agenda as he prepared to campaign for a second term; this Kennedy wants to achieve detente with the Soviet Union, forge a new relationship with Castro's Cuba, get America out of the mounting quagmire in Southeast Asia, make the struggle for equal rights for black Americans the foremost moral issue of its time by passing the toughest civil rights act since Reconstruction, and pass legislation that would spread more of the bounty of America's great prosperity to the middle class while helping more of those at the bottom rise out of poverty.  In short, John F. Kennedy was a great man on the verge of doing great things.The problem with Clarke's assertion is that it is the same one made by virtually every other favorable biography written about Kennedy, starting with those by former aides Theodore Sorensen and Arthur Schlesinger, which came out within two years of Dallas.  This is the great myth of JFK admirers: that all the great turmoil of the 60's would never have come to pass if he had only come back from that trip to Texas alive.  No war in Vietnam, the Cold War resolved with peace and brotherhood between the races at home.  The problem with this picture is that it ignores some of the hard realities of the time: JFK would certainly have passed a Civil Rights bill, although maybe not until his second term, but he most definitely would have had to contend with the same forces of white backlash that bedeviled LBJ in his own second term and made George Wallace a force to be reckoned with along with Nixon's ""Southern Strategy.""  There was no politically viable way the United States was just going to ""cut and run"" and leave South Vietnam to the Communists, it should be noted that all American plans for getting out of there were contingent on the South Vietnamese becoming self sufficient in fighting off the North, something that never happened, not for Lyndon Johnson or Richard Nixon and there is no reason to believe JFK would have fared any better. There is also no reason to believe the Soviet Union would have voluntarily given up what the Red Army had shed much blood to take in World War II, and certainly not a little more than ten years after Stalin's death when the country was still ruled by men who had risen to power in the dictator's shadow.  The true end of the Cold War would have wait until Gorbachev and a new generation of leaders in the Soviet Union.These things were the forces of history, and no leader, not even one as gifted as John F. Kennedy could have turned them aside.What Clarke's book does give us is a portrait of a man and a family overcoming problems that would have sunk people of lesser character.  The book opens with the birth JFK and Jackie's third child, a premature son named Patrick, who lived only a few days; how this tragedy affected Kennedy and his wife and their relationship is one one of the most interesting parts of Clarke's narrative.  It has always been hard for biographers to square the admirable qualities of John F. Kennedy with his relentless and heartless infidelity; until the last months of his life, he seemed to possess an utter moral blind spot when it came to sex.  Yet the death of his son seems to have made him rethink his behavior and let him grow closer to Jackie.  There is also the matter of his precarious health and the sometimes questionable treatments he sought for the effects of Addison's Disease and chronic back pain.  It appears that in those last months, Kennedy had at last rounded a corner as he appeared to be in the best health in years.  Still, as the fall of 1963 passes and the days hurdle toward a fateful trip to Texas, John F. Kennedy was a man sitting two power kegs concerning secrets in his private life and his health; who knows if they would have detonated and come out sooner if he'd lived.Clarke spares us an account of the assassination itself, skipping instead to a moving look at the way America and the world mourned Kennedy; it is by far the best part of the book.  And Clarke gives us many surprising details about our 35th President: a fling with Marlene Dietrich when she was past 60, but still in great shape; a rich fantasy life and a love for reading James Bond style fiction; he watched no television except for football games. All these things help humanize a President who has become an icon to most Americans.John F. Kennedy possessed a great sense of history, that he would be the subject of so many books would no doubt have pleased him, if not the reason why.  I think he would have liked Thurston Clarke's book very much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU3OJ9GPB8IOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420425X#wasThisHelpful","RU3OJ9GPB8IOL","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"None of Christopher Nolan's previous films could have prepared us for INTERSTELLAR; a science fiction epic that at the same time is the most human and personal of stories.  It works on so many levels, not the least of them being an attempt at serious science fiction in an era of super hero fantasies, a genre Nolan has already proven himself a master of by making THE DARK KNIGHT.The movie is set in a not too distant future where a blight is slowly, but surely, destroying the Earth's food supply and turning the planet into one large dust bowl.  There is no escaping the truth that our world will become uninhabitable within a lifetime, and no reversing it.  Mankind's only hope is to leave its birthplace and home, venture into space and find another world that will support life.  This quest is what the plot turns on, and how the characters who commit to it, both on Earth and in the darkest of outer space, struggle to reach their goal and the steep price paid to get there. It's a story of meeting unimaginable challenges and finding ways to overcome them, because that is what makes us human.In many ways, INTERSTELLAR is a literal cinematic descendant of Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, but Nolan brings to his story a heart and soul that Kubrick, as great as he was, could never have managed. That heart and soul is embodied by Matthew McConaughey's Cooper, a farmer by necessity, but a trained astronaut and engineer who feels cramped by a world of never ending diminishment.  He loves his children, especially his daughter, Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), a math wiz, and fears for their future.  A series of inexplicable events leads Cooper to an underground NASA site, run by Professor Brande (Michael Caine), who has come up with a desperate plan that might save humanity and they can make good use of a man with Cooper's abilities.  It seems that a wormhole has appeared (put there by someone?) just outside of Earth's gravitational pull, and it offers a doorway to potentially life saving worlds.  But someone has to go there first and find them, that is where Cooper comes in; of course Einstein's Theory of Relativity will kick on on such a long journey into space, so even if Cooper does return home, so much time will have passed that his loved ones will very likely be dead.  If Cooper is to save his family, he will have to make a terrible sacrifice.The journey into space and through the wormhole is filled with loss, defeat, disappointment and even betrayal, as Cooper and his fellow astronauts, including Anne Hathaway as Brande's daughter, keep pushing onward with an ever smaller hope of success.  It all leads to a mind blowing resolution as Cooper goes into a black hole and discovers the truth about who has been helping humanity all along. I won't say it is a perfectly satisfying resolution for everyone and more than a few will be scratching their heads as to exactly what happens, but I give Nolan and his scriptwriters credit for swinging for the fences.There has been much made about logic holes in the story, and how much of what happens flies in the face of many of the working laws of physics; many simply could not buy into the whole Man Behind Murphy's Bookcase at the end of Time concept.  My answer would be that in all cases, the laws of physics have to bend to the necessity of plot and story.But INTERSTELLAR is so much more than the physics and science; it is a story of what it means to be human and how no matter how far we travel or where we go and what we leave behind, who we are  and what matters to us, does not change.  It is also a story about love: love of family, not just those closest to us, but the whole human family; a love that reaches across the vastness of time and space, one that reaches from the past to the future and back again.  It even transcends death itself; there is little mention of God or the divine in INTERSTELLAR, but to me He is there in the theme of love and the incredible lengths to which it drives the characters.McConaughey gives an excellent performance, the scene where reacts to seeing messages from his now grown children is worthy of an Oscar; so too is Jessica Chastain as the adult Murphy, who still feels the loss of a father who walked away and left for the stars.  There is a large supporting cast of familiar faces: John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, William Devane (always a treat for the Devaniacs), Topher Grace, and Matt Damon in an uncredited role.To me, INTERSTELLAR is the perfect blend of writing, character, music and effects; all used in harmony to create a riveting movie.  All praise to Hans Zimmer's score.  There were many who quibbled with its nearly three hour running time-it is nearly an hour before the main story gets underway.This is the kind of movie for which the Blu Ray was invented.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J1NOSJBEE5SX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI7GCJK#wasThisHelpful","R3J1NOSJBEE5SX","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was well aware of all the spoilers when I finally got around to watching season 8 of DEXTER, a series I had loved for all of its previous seasons, all of which were watched on DVD as soon as they came out, for DEXTER was the perfect show to be viewed multi episodes at a time. At its best, this rivaled Hitchcock in his prime, especially in the 4th season where Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan squared off against Johh Lithgow's Trinity Killer.  This was one show where everyone wondered how it would end, surely there was no finale that would satisfy all of us fans.Well, the writers proved us right when they gave us a climax that pleased no one, and at the time of it original showing, the fury of diehard DEXTER fans burned up social media; now over a year later, I can say that it is still a most unsatisfying conclusion, especially compared to the way Vince Gilligan ended the saga of Walter White (a similar character to Dexter Morgan) on BREAKING BAD.Many fans were most displeased with the entire final season, and I can see their point, starting with the Big Bad-the Brain Surgeon-who turns out to be the most bland of all of Dexter's foes, a psycho right out of Script Writing 101.  I think when they started this season, the writers only had the vaguest notion of how they wanted to end it all, for it appears they changed directions several times, abruptly terminating promising story lines and interesting new characters such as Charlotte Rampling's Dr. Vogel and Sam Underwood's Zach Hamilton.  Ynonne Starhovski's Hannah is brought back, mainly, I thought, because she is really easy on the eyes.  I thought the dynamic that developed in mid season between Dexter, Hannah, Vogel and Zach was the best thing about this season and had lots of promise, especially the prospect that Zach would become Dexter's protege and continue his work and Harry's Code.  Instead the show went for a resolution that could be best be described as rote, ending in a final, utterly improbable, scene with Dexter living the life of a lumberjack.  I think they were determined to leave the door open at least a crack to the possibility of bringing Dexter back at some point in some form.The burning question through all of the past seasons was would Dexter's secret life as a serial killer finally be exposed?  And what would be the reactions of all of his co-workers in Miami Metro be when this came to light?  This was what all those previous seasons seemed to have been building toward, yet it was just not to be.  In the end, they simply did not know what to do with the character of Dexter, was he a villain or an anti-hero?  Or maybe Harry and Dr. Vogel had been wrong all those years ago, maybe he hadn't really been a psychopath all along, merely the victim of a very bad diagnosis.  All more interesting possibilities than what we got.Plausibility was never a problem for the writers-there were way too many just in the nick of time arrivals and escapes by the skin of their teeth plot twists, but the one thing they got right was character development, especially the outstanding supporting players, many of whom had more than a few shades of gray themselves; Lauren Velez's late Lt. LaGureta being a prime example.  C.S. Lee, Aimee Garcia, Geoff Pierson, Desmond Harrington where all as fully realized characters as the main protagonist. Wasn't James Remar's Ghost Dad Harry a cherry acting gig? And David Zayas's Angel Batista is definitely on my list of favorite TV cops. Somebody needs to give him his own show.Then there was Jennifer Carpenter's Deb, whose character could always charitably be described as shrill; like many fans, she really got on my nerves over the years, but again, I think this is the fault of the writers, who in too many cable dramas seem to create leading female characters whose only job is to whine and snap at the protagonist, not unlike Anna Gunn's Skylar White or Kelly McDonald's Margaret Schroeder on BOARDWALK EMPIRE; shows that also had difficult leading male characters.In the end, I hope Hannah and Harrison are happy in Argentina, and Sam Underwood did get continue the work he started on DEXTER, when he played an even crazier pair of psycho twins on THE FOLLOWING, a show that would not be on the air if not for DEXTER.And all final praise to Michael C. Hall for making us truly care about a killer who butchered people (bad people) like they were cattle in a slaughter house; the one good thing I can say about that final scene is that he stayed true to the show at the end when he makes eye contact with the audience, reminding the viewers one last time that it was us he had been confiding in along.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7HLWDJ4L37G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DXP7L88#wasThisHelpful","R7HLWDJ4L37G5","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was another book that sat on my shelf for a few years before I got around to reading it and discovered what I was missing, for THE FIFTIES by David Halberstam is a truly epic yet uniquely personal look at one of our most romanticized eras, especially by the Baby Boomers who lived through it.  Halberstam was a great reporter, observer, and writer; one who brought all those talents to bear in this book, which chronicles the changing political, social, and economic landscape of America as it leaves the long shadow of the Depression and World War II behind.Many of the persons and events Halberstam covers have all been the subjects of well researched biographies and in depth histories, but here Halberstam weaves them together in a mosaic that firmly refutes the notion that the Eisenhower years where ones of dull conformity and social drift and proves beyond a shadow of doubt that the America of the last half century and more was built from the ground up in these years now remembered with hazy nostalgia.We get portraits of the heavy hitters in politics: Truman, Taft, MacArthur, Stevenson, and Ike; but we also get to meet Estes Kefauver, a Tennessee Senator who used his televised hearings on organized crime to propel himself into a Presidential run.  There is Joe McCarthy, a demagogue and degenerate alcoholic and who was always good company for the reporters covering his witch hunts.  We learn how in 1952, the political add as we would come to know it was born when the managers of Eisenhower's campaign become concerned that he just wasn't doing that well against Adlai Stevenson. J. Robert Oppenheimer is declared a security risk while Edward Teller builds the Hydrogen Bomb, and SAC Commander Curtis LeMay plans to use it in World War III against the Russians. And behind it all lurks the figure of Richard Nixon, a cold calculating opportunist who found no pleasure in the political life, but who practiced the art better than almost anyone else and possessed an iron will to succeed.One of the most illuminating parts of the book concerns the rise of the men with a vision and the guts to make it happen: Dick and Mac McDonald open their first fast food restaurant and Ray Kroc makes millions franchising it; Kemmons Wilson puts Holiday Inns all across the country; Bill Levitt invents suburbia by building houses fast and affordable; Gene Ferkauf opens Korvettes, the first discount store; and General Motors dominates Detroit with help of engineers like Harley Earl, the man who put big tail fins on American cars.  What stands out about these men is how much they enjoyed building something that would last-and achieving success not just in financial terms, but by creating prosperity and making America a better place.  They were tough guys with a real ""my way or the highway"" attitude, but I don't think they'd have thought much of Donald Trump, Jack Welch or Al Dunlop.The other part of THE FIFTIES that is fascinating is how many ""revolutions"" were launched in that decade: ""Goody"" Pincus works on the Pill, Alfred Kinsey does his research, Hugh Hefner publishes the first Playboy, and the sex life of Americans, something that had barely been acknowledged before, will never be the same; Jack Kerouac writes On the Road and Allen Ginsburg writes Howl, and the counter culture is born; Betty Friedan begins to ask the questions that will lead her to write The Feminine Mystique and modern feminism is launched; Sam Phillips, a Memphis record producer records a young truck driver named Elvis Presley, and American popular culture is ripped in half, with parents on one side and their teenagers on the other; Rosa Parks refuses to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery, Alabama bus when ordered to by the driver, simply because her feet were tired after a long day's work, and race relations changed forever.Of course, Halberstam gives much space to rise of television and how what we watched said so much about us; his take on Leave it to Beaver, Ozzie and Harriet, and Father Knows Best is most interesting, revealing how so much of what we saw was shaped by advertisers. He takes the time to remind us that behind those now quaint sitcoms were actors and performers far more interesting than the people they played on television-this is true of Lucy and Desi, but also for the young Ricky Nelson as well.  The old reporter in Halberstam is quick to point out how the Brown decision and the subsequent lynching of Emmett Till in Mississippi made the violence of the Jim Crow South, which had gone unimpeded for nearly a century, a truly national story for the first time.  When Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus uses the National Guard to prevent the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Americans see an explosion of violence on their TV screens that is a scary harbinger of the future.  Halberstam makes a point to show how the confrontation in Little Rock was not caused solely by racism, but just as much by class resentment and rank political opportunism.Another point of interest covered in the book concerns how the CIA effortlessly overthrew anti American governments in Guatemala and Iran and at the end of the decade believe it will have no trouble doing the same to Fidel Castro in Cuba.  It becomes a pertinent story of how political elites, represented in THE FIFTIES by the Dulles brothers, can be completely wrong and utterly mistaken in their course of action.There are some minor characters who are given the spotlight: John Daniel Rust, the inventor of the mechanical cotton picker, a development which will have tremendous impact on the lives of black Americans living in the Deep South; Grace Metalious, the misfit who didn't fit into small town life and author of Peyton Place, the decade's biggest best seller; Herb Stempel and Charles Van Doren, a pair of quiz show contestants, both harboring a big and dirty secret; reporter William Bradford Huie, whose check book journalism reveals the base hypocrisy behind the Till case; Mickey Spillane, a great self promoting writer who created the private eye Mike Hammer and raised pulp fiction to an art form-sort of.Perhaps Halberstam should have included a chapter on William F. Buckley and the founding of modern conservatism; I think in the long run, Buckley has proven to be every bit as influential as C. Wright Mills, a leftist who wrote criticism of the American way of life during the decade, who is given space in these pages.This book was written two decades ago now, but I still think it resonates: is there a direct line between the segregationists who reacted with fury to the arrival in the South of northern journalists and TV reporters in their communities to cover the crimes of Jim Crow to our present politicians and pundits who incessantly denounce the ""Big Liberal Media?""Ever since the 1950's faded into history and was replaced by the turbulent 60's, there has been a great nostalgia among many Americans for that supposedly simpler time and how much better things would be if that social status quo could somehow return.  In the aftermath of the Great Recession, I would settle for a return of the economic dynamism and boundless opportunity of that long gone decade.David Halberstam was great writer, one capable of explaining complex situations lucidly and in a manner even the most casual reader could understand; sadly he is gone now and I'm not sure there is even a real market for such expansive histories as THE FIFTIES anymore.  If that is true, then we are all the poorer for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SS46CXDJIWI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0449909336#wasThisHelpful","R3SS46CXDJIWI2","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most readers who have read the three preceding volumes of Robert Caro's THE YEARS OF LYNDON JOHNSON, I have eagerly awaited this installment, for it covers not only the most dramatic events in Johnson's career, but one of the most dramatic, as well as mythic, eras in American history.  THE PASSAGE OF POWER is the story of LBJ's passage from Senate Majority Leader to the Presidency itself by way the Vice Presidency under John F. Kennedy.  At over 700 pages, Caro's book offers a wealth of detail, including incisive character portraits of other players in the drama of the Kennedy years, along with some long overdue corrections to the historical record. Light reading this is not, but THE PASSAGE OF POWER is a must read for even the most casual student of 20th Century American history.The first arc of the book covers the 1960 campaign, and Johnson's abortive Presidential run.  He thought his powerful position in the Senate would translate into support from fellow Democrats at the grass roots, and it might have worked, if-according to Caro-Johnson had not drug his feet about jumping in out of fear of failure until the Kennedy campaign had all but locked the nomination up in time for the convention in Los Angeles.  He went into the convention with a solid block of support from the Old South and his native Texas, but not much else.  It was not nearly enough to deny JFK a first ballot nomination, but it made Johnson an attractive choice for the second spot on the ticket.Why did Johnson give up his powerful job as Senate Majority Leader and accept the number two spot on the ticket with the junior Senator from Massachusetts?  Caro has done his research well and gives a riveting account of the back and forth that went on during the day Johnson was picked, and the best answer seems to be that LBJ was willing to take a gamble that the road to power on a national scale in the 1960's did not include staying in the Senate and representing Texas.  And  he thought he could turn the Vice Presidency into a powerful office just by having himself in it-in this he was quickly proved wrong.  But Caro makes an utterly irrefutable case that Johnson's efforts to hold the South for the Democratic ticket in 1960 was an essential component of Kennedy's victory; there would have been no Camelot if it had not been for ""Rufus Cornpone"" campaigning in Dixie (not to mention some ballot stuffing in Texas).  Johnson's contributions were ignored by Theodore White, but Caro makes up for it here.Although Caro's portrait of the conniving and over bearing Johnson in the previous books made him less than sympathetic (to say the least), one cannot help but feel his discomfort in the role of Vice President to JFK, where he had no power more than what the Constitution or the President allowed him.  He had to contend with the condescension, if not outright contempt, of the President's inner circle, led by the President's brother and Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy.  RFK despised Johnson and the feeling was mutual, especially after Bobby Kennedy's repeated attempts to talk Johnson out of taking the Vice Presidency at the convention.  Caro makes it clear that the sidelining of Johnson was a mistake and how his advice and help would have been most valuable when it came to the administration's dealings with Congress, especially on framing a strategy to get the Civil Rights Act past determined Southern opposition.The center of the book concerns the events of November 22nd, 1963 in Dallas; here Caro gives one of the most intense accounts of what happened ever written from Johnson's point of view: the landing at the airport, the motorcade, the shots in Dealey Plaza, the wait for news at Parkland Hospital, the swearing in on Air Force One.  All of this has been covered in countless other books, but few, if any of them, will surpass what Caro does here.  And he goes on to recount some of the controversies of those tragic days and refute some of the accounts by loyal Kennedy aides that LBJ was insensitive and ham handed in taking over the office of President.  If the Warren Commission was a mistake, it didn't seem so during the last days of November, 1963, when Lee Harvey Oswald's Soviet and Cuban connections left many people convinced he was part of a foreign conspiracy.The last section of the book concerns the immediate days and months after the assassination, when Johnson at last reached the summit of power he had so long desired and worked to obtain.  Caro's theme here is that this man, who could be by turns pushy, grasping, cruel, bullying, wheedling and conniving to get what he wanted and further his ambitions, nevertheless hit all the right notes during and after one of the most traumatic public tragedies in American history.  He stayed out of the spotlight during the funeral, did not insist on working out of Kennedy's Oval Office, instead Johnson retreated to his Vice President's office in Executive Office Building and worked the phone night and day.  And when the time came to step forward and address a joint session of Congress days after Dallas, he found the right words and delivered them in a way that solidified support for the new administration in the country.In the aftermath to the tragedy in Dallas, Johnson would use whatever tool he could lay his hands on to break the legislative logjam in Congress and get Kennedy's program moving again, especially the Civil Rights Act; in this he had spectacular success.  Kennedy'd acolytes would later claim  he would have accomplished all that Johnson achieved had he lived, but Caro makes a most convincing case that on the morning of November 22nd, 1963, JFK's programs were dead in the water in both house of Congress with little chance that things would change anytime soon.  Only days after Johnson succession to the Presidency, Senator Richard Russell of Georgia, the South's General in the battle to perserve segregation, confessed to an aide that Kennedy would never have gotten the Civil Rights Act passed, but Johnson absolutely would succeed and make it the law of the land.Senator Russell is among many fascinating secondary characters who appear in the narrative; chief among them is Bobby Kennedy, relentless and driven where his brother was charming and witty; the junior Kennedy brother emerges as Johnson's #1 antagonist, a rift which would make both men bitter enemies over time.  There is Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the man to see when the President wanted a budget or a tax cut passed; a man who wields great power in the 1960's, but whose values and outlook would have been much more at home in the 1860's. There is a poignant portrait of Theodore Sorenson, one of JFK's most loyal men and the grief he bore in the days after Dallas as he tried to serve a new President.One thing I did take from this book is how badly short changed was the historical record when both John and Robert Kennedy died before they could write definitive memoirs covering their days in power. Who wouldn't want to hear a detailed account by JFK as to why he picked Johnson as a running mate, and would he have really kept him on the ticket in 1964 despite the Bobby Baker scandal and embarrassing news stories of how Johnson acquired his fortune during his years in Congress.What Robert Caro does so effectively in THE PASSAGE TO POWER is to remind Americans that Lyndon Johnson was much more than a character out of HOUSE OF CARDS; yes, he ruthlessly and obsessively sought power over a career spanning decades, but once he achieved his goal, he actually did something positive with it.Near the end of the book, Caro gives and account of a huge barbecue, held by the Johnson's on their ranch over the Christmas holidays of 1963, it is quite the contrast to the elegant affairs put on by the Kennedys; it was covered very favorably by the press at the time, but we know that Johnson's raucous Texas ways would eventually wear out its welcome with the American public as the struggle over civil rights turned violent in the years ahead with riots tearing apart cities, not to mention the searing rift over Vietnam that will divide the country like nothing since the Civil War.  But that is a story for the next volume in this series, one that Robert Caro will, no doubt, tell very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FDKU8XJJ8PSC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375713255#wasThisHelpful","R1FDKU8XJJ8PSC","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been an avid reader and collector of comics for many decades now, but my introduction to teenager Archie Andrews and the gang at Riverdale came from the original Saturday morning cartoon series at the tail end of the 60's, the same show that gave us the hit single, ""Sugar Sugar.""  The comic book Archie goes all the way back to the 1940's, and somehow the clean cut teens of Riverdale have managed not only survive, but thrive in a culture that has gone from Glenn Miller to Eminem.  Somehow Archie and his friends kept up with the times just enough and stayed under the radar just enough to escape becoming a relic of a long gone past, unlike LEAVE IT TO BEAVER and OZZIE AND HARRIET.When I first heard about AFTERLIFE WITH ARCHIE, I thought it was another attempt to cash in on the zombie craze and make a few bucks, but, when out of curiosity, I picked up a copy in a comic shop, I discovered that AFTERLIFE was no goof.  Instead it was the best horror comic in years thanks to the story by Roberto Aguirre-Sasca and the artwork by Francesco Francavilla.  In many ways, AFTERLIFE WITH ARCHIE recalls the classic horror comics of the 1950's, the ones which were an inspiration for Stephen King and caused the entire comic industry to be investigated by Congress (which as usual, should have had better things to do).  The layout of the pages, with their dark shadings and use of colors, could easily be used as story boards for a horror film.The reason why AFTERLIFE works so well is that Aauirre-Sasca plays it straight, situating Archie, perennial girlfriends Betty and Veronica and Jughead in contemporary times-characters utter curse words.  When Jughead's beloved pet, Hot Dog, is killed in a hit and run (one guess as to who is behind the wheel), the grief stricken teen goes to Sabrina the Teenage Witch to see if she can do a spell that will return the dog to life.  Sabrina complies, but the dark magic she must use has horrifying consequences as it becomes clear that the revived Hot Dog is spreading a ravening zombie virus, and the first victim comes when dog bites master.  Soon an Undead Jughead is off to the Halloween dance with an appetite for human flesh.  AFTERLIFE pulls no punches as beloved characters from the comic rapidly join the zombie hoard and the survivors must fight to stay alive, even if it means putting down family.  Some of the twists and turns in the story hit like a fist to the gut as Riverdale burns and those left alive retreat to Lodge Manor. Through all of the horror, Archie has to repeatedly step up and be the hero, but he has his two best girls right behind him; Reggie is still a jerk and Dilton Doiley is still a nerd, while Mr. Lodge still can't stand the comic's #1 redheaded teenager being anywhere near his daughter.AFTERLIFE has been an unexpected hit, bringing new attention and readers to one of comic book's oldest icons, and while it will probably not overtake THE WALKING DEAD in popularity, it could give it a run for its money.  And I'd love to see them do an animated version of AFTERLIFE in the same style (but certainly not substance) as that long ago cartoon series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R114I4AOATUT5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619889080#wasThisHelpful","R114I4AOATUT5H","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first glance, TRUE DETECTIVE sounds like just another police procedural, with a plot that, with a few alterations, would have worked just as well on CSI or CRIMINAL MINDS, but while those shows are whodunits, TRUE DETECTIVE is much more a WhoSolvesIt.  For this crime, the detectives on the case are Rust Cohle, played by Matthew McConaughey, and Marty Hart, portrayed by Woody Harrelson, of the Louisiana State Police, who are called in to investigate the apparent ritualistic murder of a young woman in an isolated field.  It soon becomes obvious that a serial killer is on the prowl and there is much more going on than meets the eye.But when I say TRUE DETECTIVE is a WhoSolvesIt, I mean the show is as much the story of these two detectives as it is about the search for a killer; Cohle and Hart are in 90% of the scenes, with only a few brief side trips to heighten the tension.  And we get to know these two men very well in the course of eight episodes, and learn that calling them ""difficult"" is putting it mildly.  From the get go, Rust Cohle is clearly damaged goods, years of deep undercover work and a ghastly family tragedy has left him with a dark and nihilistic world view, and in a place where the dogged work of being a detective is the only thing that gives him purpose.  On the outside, Marty Hart is a conventional family man, with a wife and two daughters, but he is one of those cops who has come to believes that the dirty job he must do, along with the savagery he witnesses, have entitled him to a few perks, like extra martial sex with a court reporter. Neither one particularly likes the other, but each in their own way, is determined to get to the truth; and as the story progresses, it becomes cleat that these two men are the only ones who will ultimately catch the killer, even if it takes 17 years and long after both of them have left the force. It won't be giving anything away to say that when the killer is finally revealed, we learn that like most serial killers, they were in plain sight all along.In the past, I have not always been the biggest fan of McConaughey and Harrelson, but they completely won me over here in the way they committed to their characters and made them real. We truly come to understand Cohle and Hart, their failings, their regrets and their demons; they live in a world populated by monsters who leave their mark upon all who encounter them, but it is also a world where love endures in the face of terrible evil, as these two men come to understand at the end.There are a few familiar faces in the supporting cast: Kevin Dunn, Shea Whigham, Jay O. Sanders; Michelle Monaghan is Hart's patient wife who finally has enough and detonates their marriage, while the gorgeous Alexandria Daddario is the woman with whom he cheats on her with and who doesn't take being spurned lightly. Brad Carter is effective in his scene as a prisoner in Angola possessing pertinent information.The other great supporting character in TRUE DETECTIVE is the state of Louisiana itself, with it's lush greenery and bayous; trailer parks and little box houses; fishing communities and endless two lane blacktops going to no place in particular.  Most of the homes Cohle and Hart visit seem to be in a permanent state of decay, while off on the horizon are huge oil refineries, emblems of a wealth and power those in its midst will never touch.All praise to creator Nic Pizzolatto and director Cory Fukunaga for putting together a show that is so much more than its parts; especially liked the way they framed the first half of the show by having the present day Cohle and Hart being interrogated about events long in the past and using it as a device to slowly peal back the layers of story and character.  T Bone Burnett contributes some excellent music that perfectly sets the mood; and that is one killer of an opening credits.  By all means see TRUE DETECTIVE on Blu Ray, it is well worth the extra money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRDER8HF5XOGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUCF6KK#wasThisHelpful","RRDER8HF5XOGL","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FEAR is the fifth installment in the GONE series, and many where many series have long run out of steam after the first couple of books, GONE is still going strong, somehow finding new ways to challenge its already well put upon cast of characters-all of whom are children under the age of fifteen.  All praise to author Michael Grant for still being able to get juice out of this squeeze.It has now been more than a year since the adults vanished and the dome came down over the town of Perdido Beach, California, and life in the FAYZ hasn't improved since the last book, PLAGUE; there are two groups of kids, one headed by Caine and Albert in town and the other by Sam up at the lake.  An uneasy peace exists, but no one is happy and there is always a new unseen menace lurking and waiting.  In FEAR, the menace doesn't stay hidden for long, the dome itself is turning black, threatening to throw all the inhabitants of the FAYZ into total darkness.  It seems the Gaiaphage is dying, but it will not go quietly and has a plan for survival that includes Diana and Caine's unborn child.  A plan that also entails Drake/Brittany, the series's most enduring villain. As in every other crisis, it falls to Sam, to try and find a solution and fight the bad guy, but how do you battle the coming of total darkness and the feeling that the end is imminent.There are more than a few scenes in FEAR that would be strong stuff in an out right horror novel, including violence directed at small children and in one case, a toddler, although in the context of the story, it is not as heinous as it sounds...or is it?As in all of the books of the GONE saga, there is a lot going on with a lot of characters, all of which figures into the plot by the last page.  The heretofore autistic Little Pete is now existing on another plane after the events of PLAGUE and desperately trying to reach the others; his sister Astrid has been wracked with guilt over what happened to her brother and forsaken her role as a leader; Caine is content to play the role of King in Perdido Beach while Albert holds the real power; Quinn is the complacent fisherman until he has to stand up for one of his own;Lana is happy being the Healer and being with her normal boyfriend, Sanjit; while Diana watches the child inside her grow at an alarming rate.  Then there is Penny, who lives up to her name and is quite dreadful.  The mutant coyotes are still lurking, so too are the monstrous Zekes.  And Grant's talent for characterization has not waned in the least, he has put all these characters through hell in the past four books and he spares no one in the fifth.  Sam, Astrid, Caine, Edillo, Quinn, Lana, Orc and many others, bear little resemblance to the people they were when we first met them, many have been outright selfish at times, down right evil other times, while some have struggled mightily to do what was right when they had no idea, but all of them are complex and fully formed human beings.There are more than a few twists in FEAR: we learn one main character is gay, while two others engage in a sexual relationship for the first time.  Perhaps the biggest twist is that Grant lets us in on what has been happening in the outside world for the first time; allowing the outside to get a good look at what is happening inside the FAYZ; it is not a pretty sight and leads Sam and company to acknowledge that even if they could escape, they may not belong anywhere else but inside the FAYZ after what they've had to do in order to survive.  Can't wait to read the series finale, LIGHT, and these books are so much better than the TV version of UNDER THE DOME.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KK6KKOKDUUJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061449172#wasThisHelpful","R2KK6KKOKDUUJR","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the story of three guys and their obsession with Marilyn Monroe, so much so, that they take a road trip to Hollywood back in 1962 to meet her.  Comic hijinks ensues. That's pretty much it for the plot, as Roy (Jason Priestley), Ned, (Gabriel Olds), and Scott (Jerry O'Connell), all just out of high school and about to take the next uncertain step in life, scamper around LA-LA land trying desperately to meet up with the most famous and recognized American woman of the 20th Century.  They sleep in their car and watch her house incessantly all night, certain that if they could meet the woman of their dreams for just one moment, she would be madly taken with their adolescent charm.  They also have to avoid a pair of loan sharks trying to get back the money Roy stole from them to pay for the trip.CALENDAR GIRL was clearly intended to be a star vehicle for Jason Priestley, who had just rocketed to fame on TV as the star of BEVERLY HILLS 90210-Penny Marshall was one of the producers-but it was simply too slight and mild a story to interest moviegoers in the late summer of 1993 to make it a hit. The fact that we only get a few brief glimpses of Marilyn, darting to and fro, works against the story; how much better this movie would have been if the screenwriter had made Marilyn a major character.  Maybe have her actually meet up with the three dudes and go off with them for a day and a night to get away from the stress of her fish bowl life in Hollywood-her troubles with fame are well documented and could have been worked into the plot.  Marilyn Monroe and three teenage boys loose on the town in 1962; could have been the plot of a good coming of age story.  But that would have created quite a problem for the film makers: how do you recreate the awesomeness of the woman who sang ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" to JFK?As it is, CALENDAR GIRL does a good job of recreating the early 1960's, one of the most romanticized eras in American history, especially by older baby boomers; the bright colors and big cars look like they came right off a cover of an old issue of LIFE magazine.  Priestley is good as Roy, the more cocky and self assured of the trio of guys and this was the first time we noticed how much Jerry O'Connell had grown up since STAND BY ME.  A lot of reviewers wonder what ever happened to Gabriel Olds, a check of IMDB says he guest starred on BOARDWALK EMPIRE not long ago.  One big asset is the presence of Joe Pantoliano, Steve Railsback, Kurt Fuller, and Stephen Tobolowsky, four great character stars, in the supporting cast.  Would the nude beach scene get this movie an R rating today?  Basically all we see is some buns, but so much has changed since the 80's and early 90's when you could still get quite a bit of raunch in a PG-13 movie.Anyway, the early Neil Sedaka still rocks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMRBKPX5JT6J5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008I34Z0W#wasThisHelpful","RMRBKPX5JT6J5","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his fourth installment in the GONE series, author Michael Grant manages to not only hold the interest the reader, but to throw incredible new challenges at his desperate characters, all of whom are children and teenagers, only a very few of whom are barely past the age of fifteen.Things keep going from bad to worse for those trapped in the FAYZ, but in PLAGUE,some particularly nasty elements make themselves known; not the least of which is a virulent form of the flu that literally forces its victims to cough their lungs out.  Then there are the parasites that grow inside a human body, ultimately eating their way out and consuming the host.  These bugs then grow to the size of SUVs and proceed to chow down on human flesh.  Also, drinkable water is growing scarce in Perdido Beach and the leadership council, headed by Astrid, is having a very hard time agreeing on anything, while the Ghaiaphage is still out there in the mine shaft, plotting to be set free and setting its sights on Astrid's autistic brother, Little Pete, who is far more than what he appears.  Drake/Brittany is still a problem and one couple is having unprotected sex, but who's worried because nothing bad ever came from that?As the reader can see, its just one damn thing after another, but author Grant makes it into great page turning fiction because of his well developed characters, most of whom barely resemble the kids we met in the opening pages of the first book.  Sam no longer wants to be the leader and is tired of always having to the hero who saves the day, but he is going to have to rise to the occasion yet again.  He spends most of PLAGUE on a trek to a remote lake in search of fresh water, a journey that results in him finding way more than he bargained for, both good and bad.  The other half of the book follows events back in Perdido Beach as Astrid finds herself in an ever more intense situation as she tries to keep the truth about her brother from becoming known.  In every GONE novel, some character is really put through the wringer to the point where their survival is in doubt by the climax; in PLAGUE, it is Astrid's turn.The friction between kids with powers and those who don't continues; Albert, the teenage CEO, finds that his way of doing business is wearing thin; Lana the Healer finds romance of a sort in the form of Sanjit; Computer Jack has the chance to be a hero, as does the monstrous Orc. Toto is the new kid introduced in this book, one who possesses a unique, but potentially very annoying power.  And bad boy Caine finds a way to get himself back into the action in a big way.As in previous books in the series, PLAGUE is told in the form of a countdown; the tension perfectly ratcheted up by Gran'st expert use of the short, declarative sentence, many only a single word in length.  As noted, he ups the ante in this book with more gore than in any previous one, and with the introduction of a sexual relationship for the first time.  He also lets the more perceptive of the kids realize that when or if the barrier cutting them off from the rest of world comes down, there will be no normal for them to go back to after what they have seen and done; childhood is over no matter what happens.This is a YA novel, but it's definitely for older teens, with content far more intense than anything in THE HUNGER GAMES or TWILIGHT.  And it is a good read for adults who simply like a good story well told.  Let's hope the same can be said for the next installment in the GONE saga, FEAR.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLNPZJKZDDCDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061449148#wasThisHelpful","RLNPZJKZDDCDN","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As in his other two books in this series, GONE and HUNGER, author Michael Grant does not let up on the action and suspense one iota in the third book in his series, LIES. It has now been seven months since everyone over the age of 15 vanished in the seaside town of Perdido  Beach, California and the surviving kids are barely hanging on; the power has has gone out and open warfare now threatens to break out between the mutants and the Human Crew. Everyone is dirty, hungry and desperate, a few outcasts have even resorted to cannibalism; turns out it's not so much fun not having any adults around after all.The surviving heroes from the previous books, Sam, Astrid, and Edilio are really feeling the strain here; Astrid is being constantly challenged in her role as leader of the governing council, while Sam's is still healing and hurting from the physical and emotional wounds he sustained in his battle with Drake the Whip Hand at the climax of HUNGER. At one point, Sam simply walks away when there are reports that Drake has been glimpsed around town after seemingly rising from the dead.  Then there is Orsay the Prophetess and her apostle Nerezza, who are spreading the word that the only way to escape the FAYZ is to embrace death and be reunited with parents and loved ones waiting outside of the dome that has descended over the town on the day the adults disappeared.  Astrid believes this prophetess is spreading a false a gospel, but how can she be sure?As in his other books, Grant frames his story with a countdown, clicked off at the beginning of each chapter, ending with a confrontation at the end that changes the story in a way that sets things up for the next volume in his saga.  Grant writes in a very straight forward style, never lingering with one set of characters too long before moving on and ratcheting up the suspense; yet everyone is given a distinct voice and personality.Some fans will be disappointed that the series's main villain, Caine, does not have a more prominent role here; it falls to Zil, the head of the Human Crew to fill the part of chief nasty in LIES.  Yet the reader should remember the title, for it is revealed at the end that someone is not who they say they are.  The most memorable character in this book is Mother Mary Terrifino, who has been faithfully looking after the ""littles"" while battling demons of her own, the arc of her story is the most compelling part of LIES.There are also some new characters introduced: a multi-ethnic gaggle of adopted children whose parents are a Hollywood glamour couple.  They have been marooned in a mansion on an offshore island where the oldest, Sanjit, must find some way to get to the mainland when one of his siblings becomes ill.Many readers have commented on the similarities between the GONE series and Stephen King's UNDER THE DOME, which is interesting since it was a blurb by The King himself that first attracted me to this series.  I think it has much more in common with LOST, although thankfully, it does not have that show's endless and maddening mythology to wade through.All in all, LIES, is a very good installment in Michael Grant's YA series, one that will more than whet the reader's appetite for the next volume, PLAGUE.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KP4KZ1IBOHY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061449113#wasThisHelpful","R3KP4KZ1IBOHY4","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most TV series usually hit a speed bump by their fifth season as creative exhaustion begins to set in, but not BREAKING BAD; after a spectacular 4th season that culminated with the final (and literal) face off with Gus Fring, Vince Gilligan and company upped the ante and took the story of Walter White to heights heretofore unseen by their own, or any other show's, standards.In season five, chemistry teacher turned meth cook, Walter White has finally reached the top of his chosen profession.  And with his partners, Jesse and Mike, Walter now plans to make millions free from the fear of drug lords like the now deceased Gus and Tuco.  But Walter learns, as everyone does, that being the boss is a lot harder job than it looks, for there are constant crises to resolve among partners, suppliers, former associates, family and the law in the person of his brother in law, Hank, a DEA agent now in charge of the Albuquerque office.  Dogged Hank is trying to tie up the loose ends from the Gus Fring investigation and keeps edging closer to learning Walter's secret.No matter, Walter is a man who thrives on challenge and for every problem or setback, there is a solution, even if it means coming up with a scheme to drain a tank car on a train of desperately needed methylamine or orchestrate the mass murder of a bunch of potential snitches in lockup.  Is there anything left to salvage in this man's soul?  Faithful viewers will be pondering this question as each episode of season 5 leaves ever more mayhem, both physical and emotional, in its wake.  The episode titled ""Dead Freight"" contains a heist sequence worthy of Hitchcock, but ends on an act so heinous and despicable that even die hard fans will be shocked.Bryan Cranston's acting has made Walter White a true contender for the greatest character in TV history, right along side Archie Bunker, Lucy Ricardo, and Tony Soprano.  To me his standout scene has to be when he explains why he does not want to take the buyout offer Mike has arranged and we learn something vital as to what makes this character tick.  All due praise should be given to Aaron Paul's Jesse, whose conscience is starting to wear down to the raw by his long partnership with Walt.  Then there is Dean Norris as Hank, who is far from the buffoon we first thought he was back in season 1; instead he has become  the only moral adult in sight.  Bob Odenkirk is back as Saul Goodman, perhaps the most corrupt lawyer in TV history.  And we really wonder what will happen when and if RJ Mitte's Walt Jr. learns the truth about his parents.Special praise to Anna Gunn as Skylar, whose character seems to be barely holding it together as she runs the car wash and launders the drug money her husband wheels in.  Many viewers hate Gunn's character and the writer's do her no favor, but watching Gunn's acting as Skylar burns from the inside is a real treat.But the breakout performance in season 5 is Jonathan Banks's Mike Eharmentraut, Gus Fring's former security chief and now Walt's wary (to say the least) partner.  With his deadpan delivery and steely glare, Mike is not to be messed with and his sparring with Walt is the highlight of the season.  Banks has been around a long time (I remember him on WISEGUY many years ago)and this was the role of a lifetime, making us actually feel sorry for this ruthless thug when things get tight.There are a couple of new characters in Jesse Plemons's Todd and Laura Fraser's Lydia, the ultimate corporate weasel.  Larry Hankins makes a brief return as Old Joe, the junkyard owner who once again helps Walt and company out of a jam.I'll never be able to hear ""Chrystal Blue Persuasion"" by Tommy James and the Shondells again and not think of BREAKING BAD. One of the best uses of an oldie ever.How will it all end?  We are given a clue in the season opener's first scene and it does not look good; especially after the twist in the final scene of ""Gliding Over All,"" the season's climax, which sets up a showdown that has been in the making since the first show.  But no one should underestimate Walter White, many have and many have died.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RQEIHYKZB7HG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060MYKYY#wasThisHelpful","R2RQEIHYKZB7HG","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Civilization does not come to an end on the opening page of Stephen King's novel,Duma Key, nor do any monsters, vampires, a possessed 1958 Plymouth Fury or a rabid Saint Bernard appear to menace the protagonist.  Instead something worse happens, a man has his life destroyed in an industrial accident, leaving his body mangled and his mind traumatized.  Edgar Freemantle is a very successful Minnesota builder until his pickup  is backed over by a crane, leaving his right arm severed and his brain scrambled.  In the aftermath of the accident, Edgar's marriage of many years falls apart and he moves to the coast of Florida in a last ditch attempt of pick up the pieces and restart his life.There on Duma Key, Edgar takes up painting and discovers it to be the one thing that brings some happiness and satisfaction.  It turns out that Edgar has quite a latent talent and is soon turning out portraits and still lifes, one after the other at a furious pace.  He also becomes close friends with a Jerome Wireman, who is also recovering from some trauma of his own and gets to know Elizabeth Eastlake, the elderly woman Wireman is paid to care for.  But this being a Stephen King story, things are definitely not what they seem and there is more to Edgar Feemantle's sudden artistic genius than what it first appears to be.Some fans of King's work will find this book slow going, at least through the first half where there is nary a hint of the supernatural, but slowly the truth is revealed through the history of Elizabeth Eastlake and her family, who have lived on Duma Key for nearly a century, and the evil that hides there finally shows itself.  But it is the kind of evil that lurks and waits, first enticing and seducing before it consumes.  In the end, Edgar and his friend, Wireman, will have to literally unearth the past and confront this evil face to face if they are to survive.King clearly poured a lot of his own personal experiences into this book since this is the story of a traumatic accident survivor and the long and very difficult road to recovery.  King also spends his winters in Florida and his knowledge of the place and people really come through on the page.  There are some great observations on the gift of creativity and the drive to make it real, whether it be on the painter's canvas or the writer's page.  For some it can be literal salvation, but it can just as easily lead to damnation if one follows, or is led, to the wrong path.  To me that is what King is trying to say here.And he also clearly likes his characters in this book: Edgar, Wireman, Elizabeth Eastlike, the young Jack Cantori, Edgar's daughter, Ilse and his ex-wife, Pam, Zander Kamen and the others; there's really not a nasty son of a bitch among them, and I say this because King is a master at creating hateful characters and filling his books with them.  It's also unusual to have a piece of genre fiction dominated by two middle aged men and it not be about the pitfalls of aging and the desire to recapture lost youth.Duma Key is Stephen King on a slightly more mellow vibe, but his die hard fans will not be disappointed.  And for those who don't like hardcore horror, it's an excellent introduction to The King.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYPGKCA5BOOV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416552960#wasThisHelpful","RYPGKCA5BOOV6","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read many works of epic fantasy, including Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy that started it all, but I think there is nothing quite like George R.R. Martin's SONG OF ICE AND FIRE series, of which CLASH OF KINGS is the second installment.  What sets Martin's work apart: he writes epic fantasy for adults with a minimum of emphasis on magic and the supernatural.  There are no cute little Hobbits, noble Knights on a quest, virginal princesses or wise old wizards to be found anywhere in Martin's books.  Instead, his characters are filled with lust, have sex frequently, and are driven by motives that are far from pure.  There is no Sauron like embodiment of evil, only very human and very flawed people, some much more sympathetic than others, but that is the genius of Martin's writing, for even the minor players in this drama are well fleshed out and the reader fully understands why they do the things they do.CLASH OF KINGS picks up right where GAME OF THRONES left off: the kingdom of Westeros has been thrown into bloody civil war in the wake King Robert's death and the execution of Eddard Stark by the boy king, Joffrey.  Robert's brothers, Stannis and Renley each claim the throne while Eddard's son, Robb, has proclaimed himself King in the North.  All of them must fight each other and with the House of Lannister, the late King Robert's in-laws.  There is much conniving, back stabbing, murdering, torturing, avarice and harrowing cruelty as everyone wars against everyone else for the prize of setting upon the Iron Throne.I think CLASH OF KINGS, along with the rest of Martin's books gives us a picture of what civilization would have looked like if there had been no Jesus Christ (or Mohammad or Buddha for that matter).  People worship pagan Gods who are distant and uncaring, all the while acting out of pure self interest and desire for power.  Some of the Lannisters would have made Nietzsche blush.  There is loyalty and love for family and tribal bonds are strong, but no one in the ruling houses of Westoros appear to have the slightest notion of the common good.  Hatred and revenge rule the hearts here, even the hearts of children.All the people we loved from GAME OF THRONES are back again, including Tyrion Lannister, who has the thankless job of being the Hand of the King to his vile nephew, Joffrey; Arya Stark, who is still on the run from the Lannisters and making a list of all the people she will kill to avenge her father; Jon Snow, who ventures beyond the Wall in the North and finds a new threat gathering in the cold and icy forests; Daenerys Targaryen, the Mother of Dragons, who wanders in the South in search of allies to bring down all the ruling houses of Westeros.  There are some welcome additions in CLASH OF KINGS: Brienne of Torth, the woman warrior, and Qhorin Halfhand, who saves Jon Snow's life at great cost to himself.  My own personal favorites are Bran Stark and the Hound, two characters whose fates take interesting turns.At nearly a thousand pages, CLASH OF KINGS is truly epic in length, but Martin's writing makes the pages fly by; his fantasy world comes alive in rich detail along with the people who live there, often using simple descriptive phrases i.e. ""he was all scowls and jowls.""  Harrenhal and Winterfell are as real to the reader as the street they live on.  Is there a twist in CLASH OF KINGS to equal the beheading of Eddard Stark in GAME OF THRONES?  Yes there is, but keep reading, for all is not as it seems.If you've just watched the HBO series, then you are doing yourself a disservice, read the books that started it all, they are well worth the considerable investment of time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BMQENDA3XFNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345535421#wasThisHelpful","R1BMQENDA3XFNT","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a lifelong reader of comic books and have been a viewer of every incarnation of Superman starting with George Reeves in the original TV show.  So how does MAN OF STEEL stack up when compared to its predecessors?Pretty damn good, I would say, mainly because:Plot tension: is Kal-El/Clark Kent the last son of Krypton or a freak marooned among an alien race?  This one of many questions driving David Goyer's script which tackles what it means to be an outsider and whether one's destiny is predetermined or a result of free will. This gives Superman some much needed internal conflict and a theme to drive the story.A great Superman: Henry Cavill has the looks and the physique to pull it off, but he has the talent to convey Kal-El/Clark Kent's inner battles.  Cavill has to do a lot of acting without dialogue and express a broad range of emotions with his eyes and body language.  He is far from the cipher some critics have charged him with being.  He doesn't make you forget Christopher Reeve, but perfectly compliments the earlier performance.A great villain:  Michael Shannon is a terrific General Zod, and that's not taking anything away from Terrance Stamp's version of the character.  But MAN OF STEEL manages to explain and deepen his motivation, giving his animus toward Kal-El a real edge.  All super hero movies need a great bad guy to go up against, and MAN OF STEEL really delivers in this department.Great fathers:  Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner as Jor-El and Jonathan Kent respectively.  Crowe's Jor-El sees his son as a future champion, the embodiment of all the greatness of Krypton; while Costner's Jonathan Kent raises Clark to hide his powers from a public that fears and hates what it does not understand and can't control.  And there is one hot Momma here as well as Diane Lane makes Martha Kent sexy for the fist time in a Superman movie.  (I'm not forgetting Annette O'Toole on Smallville, but that was TV.)Great battles: the final throw down between Superman and Zod makes skyscrapers crumble and the earth itself shake.  This is exactly the kind of fight we've waited years to see.  And I have no problem with the way the battle is resolved, something many Superman fans did not like.Great tweaks in the origin story: I'm not going to detail them here, but let's just say they work.  I especially like how Crowe's Jor-El was given a lot more screen time and the demise of Costner's character was changed so that it resonated more.  Lot's of die hard fans most emphatically did not like these changes, and some of them I would agree with, like when Jonathan Kent implies that Clark should have let his friends drown rather than risk revealing his powers.  Then there are those who just can't buy into ""comic book logic,"" and for them there is no help.Amy Adams is a fine actress, and she does give Lois Lane the proper amount of pushiness, but I just don't like the way the script has her simply slip onto the long buried Kryptonian ship and discover Superman's origin and identity.  At the same time I like the way the story does right by some minor characters like Pete Ross.  But where is Jimmy Olson?  I do miss some of the humor Richard Donner brought to his 1978 movie; everyone in MAN OF STEEL is very serious and very earnest.Nevertheless, MAN OF STEEL is a great reboot or re-imagining (whatever) for one of the 20th Century pop culture's greatest icons, making him relevant again in the 21st.  Siegal and Shuster would be proud of what producer Christopher Nolan, screenwriter David Goyer, and Director Zack Synder have done with their creation.  And I can't wait to see what they don next with Superman; maybe take on Brainiac? Or Lex Luthor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ARCMUGBTYYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUPK8#wasThisHelpful","R21ARCMUGBTYYX","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"AMERICAN HORROR STORY is one of those series that is best enjoyed by getting the box set and viewing multiple episodes at once.  It's the perfect way to keep track of the series's many, many, twists and turns, along with some jaw dripping revelations over the course of the first season.  And let the viewer be warned yet again: there is graphic sexual content and violence, the kind that pushes the limit about as far as it can go for cable television.But for those who like this kind of stuff, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is must see TV.  The basic premise is one of those horror story tropes: family goes through emotional trauma (psychology professor husband is caught cheating with a student)and moves across the country to LA and a fresh start, which includes buying an old house with a past in a quiet neighborhood. This Murder House, as it is called, has more than a few things in common with the Overlook Hotel from THE SHINNING, in that it is a place where a lot of bad things have happened to a lot of people, mostly former owners and some unlucky visitors.  Basically, what dies in the Murder House, stays in the Murder House and within these walls, the ghosts are all too real. These ghosts want things of those who are still alive and will do whatever it takes to get them. Not all of this is explained up front in the first episodes and part of the fun is figuring out who is dead and who is still among the living (at least for the moment).One of the many things viewers might find off putting initially is that the story's principle characters, played by Dylan McDermott, Connie Britton, and Tessa Farmiga, are so down right unlikable and unsympathetic right from the get go.  McDermott's psychiatrist is an adulterer who is remorseful only because he got caught red handed, while Britton's wife is cold, bitter, and unforgiving-the complete opposite of the wife and mother she played on FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.  Teenage daughter Farmiga is sullen, full of resentment and hopelessly self absorbed.  Not the kind of people with whom you'd want to spend time, but without giving away any spoilers, it is safe to say that where these characters start out is not where they end up.  In the end, everyone is where they need to be, for good or bad.Over the course of the season one, the plot comes to include such elements as the birth of the Anti-Christ, a Columbine like massacre, miss treatment of the mentally challenged, illegal abortions, kinky sex, rape, multiple murders, and a character in a Gimp suite. All that and the enduring legacy of family dysfunction, seeping into the woodwork generation after generation like so much toxic waste. A lot of viewers will be turned off or rubbed the wrong way, and not with out good reason.  But for those who are game, it'll be well worth the watch.Maybe AMERICAN HORROR STORY's chief virtue is the excellent cast and superior acting which goes a long way toward helping sell the often outrageous actions of the characters.  And the most outrageous of them all is Jessica Lange as neighbor Constance Langdon, a faded southern belle who once lived in the Murder House herself and has left more than memories behind her there. Constance is the kind of part Bette Davis would have played back in her Baby Jane days, a human monster who makes even the dead cringe.  Lange is given great support by Frances Conroy as Moira, the maid who has been on the job a very long time; Evan Peters as a most troubled teen, a patient of McDermott's and secret boyfriend to Farmiga; and Denis O'Hare, as Constance's horribly disfigured ex lover who keeps hanging around for a reason.There are also appearances by such familiar faces as Charles S. Dutton, Zachary Quinto, Lilly Rabe, Matt Ross, Kate Mara, Mena Suvari, Eric Stonestreet, Morris Chestnut, Christine Estabrook, David Anthony Higgins, and Brando Eaton.Give credit to writers and creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, in AMERICAN HORROR STORY they have come up with something about as far from the saccharine sweetness of GLEE as it was possible to get. God help them if these two worlds would ever collide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LF3K211GB3MU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAJ1O0#wasThisHelpful","R3LF3K211GB3MU","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The second season of BOARDWALK EMPIRE brings back Nucky Thompson and the whole gang from Atlantic City for another epic of scheming, double dealing and cold blooded murder in Prohibition America.  Like the first season, I watched the second on DVD, taking in three episodes in one sitting and it was like plowing through multiple chapters of a good book at one time.  In the second season, BOARDWALK EMPIRE makes it clear that it is no retro version of THE SOPRANOS, but a superb saga in its own right.At the end of the first season, a group of Nucky's partners in crime, including surrogate son Jimmy Darmody and brother Eli, enter in an alliance with Dabney Coleman's nasty old Commodore in a plan to dethrone the King of Atlantic City.  This scheme becomes a reality in season two as Nucky is indicted on charges of vote fraud and is forced out of his job as Treasurer, allowing his former allies the chance to take over his vast bootlegging network in AC.But Nucky does not go down without a fight and the battle to reclaim and hold onto his empire of crime is the main story arc of the second season.  Nucky will need all of his considerable smarts and cunning to survive; and his enemies would do well to remember the old warning: when you strike at a king, you'd better kill him.  Steve Buscemi is really at the top of his game in this season, dispelling all doubts that he could not handle a lead role; his Nucky is a man who may be down, but who is never desperate, even when the Federal Prosecutor, Esther Randolph, is ready to put his common law wife, Margaret Shroeder, on the stand and implicate him in the murder of Margaret's husband.For me, the moment that defines the season comes in the finale when Nucky tells Margaret that the only thing which might convince him of God's existence is the love he feels for her and her children and the only good thing in his life is the bond of family they give him.  Buscemi delivers these lines with the utmost sincerity, but we are well aware that it is in his interest to convince Margaret to marry him so she can't be compelled to testify against him.There are various other story lines in season two, all driven by such memorable characters as Michael Pitt's Jimmy Darmody, who finds that being the big man in Atlantic City is not all it is cracked up to be; Jack Huston's disfigured WWI vet, Jimmy's loyal trigger man who can't quite leave the battlefield behind; Stephen Graham's Al Capone, Vincent Piazza's Lucky Luciano and Anatol Yusaf's Meyer Lansky: all middlemen itching to get to the top of the heap in their chosen profession.Then there is the great Michael Shannon as Federal Agent Nelson Van Alden, a man whose deep repressions finally burst to the surface, utterly shattering the facade of virtue he presents to the world.I do have some problems with the way Margaret Shroeder's part was written this season and the way Kelly McDonald was directed to portray her as a woman who feels pangs of guilt as she becomes ever more prominent and complicit in Nucky's life and crimes.  At times I just can't see why Nucky could be all head over heels over this gloomy Irish lass. McDonald has some great moments, especially in the finale, but Margaret seems utterly incapable of experiencing joy except for that fleeting moment of coitus with Owen Slater.There are a host of great supporting players, some holdovers from season one like Michael Stuhlbarg's ultra slick Arnold Rothstein; Gretchen Mol as Jimmy's mother, who loves her little boy an awful lot; Paul Sparks's Mickey Doyle and his annoying giggle; Shea Whigham's lackwit Sheriff Eli Thompson, who is no match for his brother; Michael Kenneth Williams's Chalky White, who battles the KKK while always angling to get the best deal for his people from whatever powers that might be.And then there are the new guys (and girls) in town: Charlie Cox as henchman Owen Slater, who provides Nucky with a valuable connection to the rebels in Ireland; William Forsythe as a kosher butcher in Philadelphia with a side business in bootleg whiskey; and Julianne Nicholson's Esther Randolph, the Federal Prosecutor, the one woman with power in her own right.Greg Antonacci and Dominic Chianese (Uncle Junior himself), both alumni of THE SOPRANOS, have small parts and there is a great turn by Christopher McDonald (Shooter McGavin) as Attorney General Harry Daugherty, possibly the most corrupt man to ever sit in a President's Cabinet, and that is saying something.But the great uncredited character in BOARDWALK EMPIRE is the America of 1921, vividly recreated in the clothes, the cars, the music and in the temper of the times when the old America of the 19th Century, with its agrarian values and Victorian morals were giving way to a country that had gone big city.  There were fortunes to be made and the Irish, the Italians, the Jews and the Blacks, all groups who'd long been disdained by the majority of their countrymen, were now damned and determined to get their fair share of the money any way they could. Prohibition may have been the law of the land, but there were millions who still wanted a drink and could have cared less about right or wrong.All in all, season two of BOARDWALK EMPIRE is great entertainment, a thrilling history lesson and good storytelling, all to the credit of a great cast and writer Terrance Winter.  I wouldn't be spoiling anything when I say there is a confrontation at the end of the season that is a stunner and well worth the journey to get there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RMOAZWM2W3H7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAJ1H2#wasThisHelpful","R2RMOAZWM2W3H7","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading Stephen King for more than three decades, I can attest that he is the master of short (or shorter) fiction, especially the novella, a talent on full display in FULL DARK, NO STARS, a collection of four of his darkest tales.They are: 1922, a tale of murder on a lonely Kansas farm; BIG DRIVER, where a writer of cozy mysteries plots revenge after a brutal rape; FAIR EXTENSION, concerns a cancer stricken man and the deal with the Devil which saves his life for a price he willingly pays; the final story is A GOOD MARRIAGE, which tells how a middle aged wife discovers that her union is not anything of the kind after finding a box under a table while searching for batteries in the garage.These stories are very brief when compared to 11-22-63 or UNDER THE DOME, two recent opuses by King, but pack a wallop just the same, allowing him more than enough room to do what he does best.  Not the least of which is the creation of character and place.  We come to know Wilf James all too well in 1922, and understand his self serving motives for committing a heinous act of murder (described in great gory detail) and for involving his teenage son, but we are also able to visualize the isolated farm in Hemmingford Home, Kansas (home of Mother Abigail in THE STAND) down to the smallest detail.  The road trips that writer Tess goes on in BIG DRIVER are both real and spiritual after surviving a brutal rape on a rural byway leaves her thirsting for revenge; a journey that leads to an ambush and cold blooded retribution on a dark Maine night.  The drab George Elvid in FAIR EXTENSION sits by the road outside the Derry airport and waits for the desperate Streeter to come along and jump at the chance to not only live, but get some payback for a lifetime of resentments.  In a GOOD MARRIAGE, the suburban home Darcy Anderson has shared with her husband Tom for decades becomes a hell on earth in the blink of an eye, a hell shared with a monster as malevolent as Randall Flagg, Kurt Barlow or Pennywise the Clown.I think one of the reasons for Stephen King's enduring popularity, besides the scares and the gore, is the spotlight he shines on what is often condescendingly referred to as average people-farmers, loan officers, truck drives, accountants and housewives, people who are not dazzlingly attractive, awesomely talented or relentlessly self promoting.  But whose outwardly ordinary lives get turned upside down through personal apocalypses that rival anything in the Book of Revelations.There is very little supernatural horror in FULL DARK, NO STARS, it is more the horror brought on by the consequences of very bad choices, whether it be Wilf James listening to the conniving man inside; Tess taking some very bad road directions after a speaking engagement; Streeter giving full vent to a lifetime of repressed hatred and envy after pulling his car off at a roadside stand; or Darcy Anderson looking into a box she has just stubbed her toe against. But there is enough gore and yuckyness to please the fans.  Anyone creeped out by rats?  Then you're in for a treat.  If there is anything that unites all four tales, it would be the family unit and how what goes on inside them behind closed doors and out of sight is often the polar opposite of the picture the outside world sees.King is often criticized for the way he chooses to end his stories; I think the way he wraps up BIG DRIVER and FAIR EXTENSION are not quite satisfying, especially in the latter case where there seemed to be more to be said.  But 1922 and A GOOD MARRIAGE end on the perfect note.And be sure to read the Afterward at the end of the book, where King answers the old question of where he gets his ideas; would be writers should pay attention.In short, FULL DARK, NO STARS could best be described and Stephen King in full Hitchcock mode, because any one of the four stories in this book could have been made into a great movie by the Old Master.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7INGYP4P4YA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PHMB48#wasThisHelpful","R7INGYP4P4YA0","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some old movies just don't hold up, especially the ones we loved when we first saw them as kids, but that is not the case with THE GUNS OF NAVARONE.  It is one big budget adventure epic that still delivers because of a tight plot full of suspense and realistic characters played by great movie stars at the top of their game.Released in 1961, when WWII still dominated the popular culture and when the population  was still filled with veterans of that conflict (including the newly inaugurated President-the youthful John F. Kennedy), NAVARONE was considered a slick piece of entertainment, one so good that it got a Best Picture nomination the following spring.Directed by J. Lee Thompson and based on the bestselling novel by Alistair MacLean, NAVARONE is the ultimate ""impossible mission pulled off by a team of experts"" film.  The simple plot concerns a team of commandos who are infiltrated by the British onto the Greek island of Navarone to destroy a pair of heavily fortified big guns that are preventing the Royal Navy from rescuing two thousand stranded British troops on a nearby island who are about to be overrun by the Germans.  The team of commandos will have to do a job the air force is unable to complete within a narrow window of opportunity; this includes scaling a steep cliff to avoid detection by the enemy and then risk capture and torture to complete the mission.  There are narrow escapes along the way, and betrayal by a supposed ally as the men get closer to the fortress of Navarone; all the while the clock is ticking and time is running out to blow the guns or face disaster.The three leads are Gregory Peck, David Niven and Anthony Quinn as Captain Mallory, Corporal Miller and Colonel Andrea Stavros respectively.  Mallory is an expert mountain climber who has to take over command of the mission once on Navarone; Miller is a demolitions expert, who cares for his comrades more than the mission; Stavros is an expert killer who is nursing a grudge.  All three men have seen a lot of war, and it has hardened them and made them cynical.  But before the mission is done, all three will have their convictions and tough attitudes put to the test.  Peck, Niven and Quinn were true movie stars and real men who portrayed adults up on the screen-not buffed boys playing action stars.Among the great supporting cast is Anthony Quayle and Stanley Baker, two great character stars of the era, now long gone.  It is Quayle's Major Franklin who causes the group to confront a tough moral choice when he is injured and must be left behind to be captured by the Germans.  There is another tough choice to be made when a traitor among the ranks is unmasked and must be dealt with; it is interesting to note that at the last minute, partisan leader Irene Papas pulls the trigger because in 1961, stalwart leading men like Gregory Peck could not gun down an unarmed woman, even if she'd sold him out to the Nazis.  Things would change very fast; just contrast that scene with the one in THE DIRTY DOZEN where German women (and officers) are herded into a basement by American soldiers and then gleefully incinerated.Papas and James Darren round out the supporting cast, along with Gia Scala, Richard Harris and that great bearded Scotsman, James Robertson Justice.  Walter Gotell, who would go on to play the KGB head in a number of Bond movies, turns up as a German officer.  The two Anthonys, Quinn and Quayle, must have gone straight from NAVARONE to the set of David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, an even greater classic movie.Producer Carl Foreman had been blacklisted in Hollywood and was working in Great Britain at the time; he had the great good sense to hire Dimitri Tiomkin to do the score for NAVARONE.THE GUNS OF NAVARONE has proven to be an enduring classic, and one of the biggest hits of that era of the big epic war movie that began with the release of BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAII in 1957 and ran through the release of PATTON in 1970.  An era of films that included THE LONGEST DAY, THE GREAT ESCAPE, WHERE EAGLES DARE and the aforementioned THE DIRTY DOZEN. All of them to some extent suggested that war, on some level, is an adventure.  This viewpoint went out of fashion in the Vietnam era and never really came back.  But the big war epic did return in such films as APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THREE KINGS, and BLACK HAWK DOWN.  All of them with scenes and attitudes unthinkable in a movie released the same year as NAVARONE.But NAVARONE has never lost its audience and has proven to be quite influential over the years; in many ways its plot prefigures the Bond movies with its cliff climbing sequence and a daring mission into a heavily fortified lair with the intent to commit sabotage.  Not surprising since Alistair MacLean was a contemporary and friend of Ian Fleming.  Sadly, his books were out of print in America for a long time.If one wants to see the influence of THE GUNS OF NAVARONE, just check out Quentin Tarantino's INGLORIOUS BASTERDS; Brad Pitt's Lt. Aldo Raine would have fit right in with Mallory, Miller, Stavros and the rest of the group.No self respecting movie buff can afford not to have this classic on DVD or Blu Ray in their library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2PJG4O47HC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0767821785#wasThisHelpful","R3L2PJG4O47HC7","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"DEATH NOTE is considered by many to be the best anime series ever produced, which is quite interesting since it does not contain any plucky underdogs who learn to be a badasses through martial arts training, no magic to be learned by an inexperienced young person or a monstrous tyrant to be defeated-all standard plots of the most popular anime.  DEATH NOTE is something else altogether-a nerve wracking suspense thriller with a supernatural background, full of plot twists too numerous to keep track of and filled with ingenious and diabolical characters.The basic plot is simple: a brilliant young Japanese man named Light Yagami acquires a notebook that was once the property of a shinigami (a God of Death); writing an individuals name in the book will cause that person to die, thus giving the owner of the book the God like power kill indiscriminately and on a whim.  Light is obsessed with and disgusted by the evil and corruption of modern society, so he sets out to purge those whom he holds responsible by using the Death Note; in the process making himself the God of the New (and better)World. He calls himself Kira (Japanese for killer).But things do not go that easily for Kira; when criminals start dropping like flies, the police turn to the equally brilliant and eccentric detective known as L to unmask Kira and bring him to justice.  There begins a cat and mouse game between Kira and L as each one tries to get the better of the other. Because his father is a high ranking official in the police department, Light is able to get himself appointed to the task force whose job it is to find and stop Kira, and thus finds himself working along side of his nemesis.  Then there is the other Death Note in the hands of a ditsy young model named Misa Amane.  Miss Amane figures out Kira's real identity and Light has one more problem to contend with; or does he, since Light proves to have a ruthless and uncanny ability to make it all work for himself.  That is except for the problem of the tenacious and super smart L, who won't stop until he discovers Kira's true face.I've said this is the kind of anime Stephen King might have written; it has the Master of Horror's love of an intricate plot and compelling characters who are not what they seem at first.  There is just enough of a supernatural element to hook horror fans.  Light Yagami is one of anime's great villains, who just happens to be series main characters through whose viewpoint the action unfolds.  L has proven to be huge hit with the fans of this genre, a truly unique, and perhaps sad, character.The animation is striking, as it creates the proper dark mood, often using a mixture of  black, gray, brown and red to set the mood; never have skyscrapers, offices, highways and bedrooms, where most of the action takes place over the 37 episodes, seemed so ominous and filled with palpable dread.  And its all set to one of the best music scores in all of anime.Written by Toshiki Inoue and directed by Tetsuro Araki, DEATH NOTE has developed a fanatical following world wide, as the hundreds of thousands of fan fiction stories posted online attest.  There have been a number of live action version produced in Japan and surely there will be a Hollywood version sooner or later.  And surely they will screw it up.  Buy the DVD set and see DEATH NOTE in its original and still best version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NPNHGCR3KSND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CZJP0S#wasThisHelpful","R2NPNHGCR3KSND","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in the 8th grade when most the salient events of Marc Feldstein's Poisoning the Press occurred, and have a very hazy memory of hearing about the ITT scandal, Dita Beard, Richard Kleindenst, and the Eagleton affair.  Now after reading the book, it all comes back  into focus again and I have a clear picture of what was going on in the highest and lowest levels of our government during Richard Nixon's first term.  What we didn't know really did hurt us.The book is a blow by blow account of the vendetta (and there is no better word for it) between President Nixon and Jack Anderson, the original investigative reporter, an old fashioned shoe leather newsman who had no problem going through the garbage if it would provide a scoop for his daily newspaper column, The Washington Merry Go Round.  Anderson was not intimidated in the least by power and the often secretive ways those who held it went about their business; while Nixon's was an administration brimming with dirty secrets and filled with men determined to do whatever it took to keep them from the light of day.  The confrontations between these two unyielding forces were epic with reverberations and consequences that are with us still today.Marc Feldstein has given us a riveting account of the clash between Nixon and Anderson, which was well documented at the time, that now tells us what was happening behind the scenes in the oval office and in the furtive meetings between confidential sources and the reporter determined to get the story.  It is a true history film noir filled with blackmail, bribery, break ins, slush funds and secret loans, hush money, rogue operatives, illegal wiretaps and murder conspiracies.  All of which happened before those legendarily inept burglars broke into the Watergate office of the Democratic National Committee.  Feldstein writes in a precise manner that allows the reader to keep track of the often convoluted events being described in the narrative.Besides the two principles there is an outrageous cast of supporting characters which include a corrupt Attorney General (John Mitchell), a hatchet man who loved his work (Chuck Colson), a reclusive billionaire who bought influence any way he could (Howard Hughes), a lobbyist who wrote a very incriminating memo (the before mentioned Dita Beard), a naval officer who spied on the White House for the Pentagon (Charles Radford), and an ex-FBI agent who ate a rat and held his hand over an open flame until the flesh turned black (G. Gordon Liddy).  Fiction couldn't make up people like this and it is one of the many reasons why the evening news during the 70's made for better drama than anything in prime time.Then there is the young Bret Hume, who got his start working for Anderson when he was exposing Nixon's misdeeds; contrast him then with the present day front man on the Fox News Channel, a partisan outfit that regularly gives a platform to the kind of mendacity spewing hacks Hume's old boss would have made short work of.After reading Poisoning the Press, two things remained with me. The first being that there has never been an administration more venal and corrupt to the core than Richard Nixon's.  Nor has there been a President more filled with hatred and paranoia than the 37th man to occupy that office.  I have read many histories and biographies of men who have become President, most of whom were tough and calculating politicians, and none of them come across as rancid as Nixon; which is sad because there is much to admire in someone who rose from very a very meager California childhood to become one of the dominating world figures of his time.  A self educated master of the political game and statesmanship. But does anyone not believe he was up to his neck in Watergate right from the beginning?The other thing I took away from this book was how fleeting is fame, especially in the arena of journalism.  In the 1970's, Jack Anderson was a household name, yet today I doubt anyone under the age of 35 has any idea who he was or why his newspaper column could make the most powerful men in Washington tremble.  He was egotistical and vain, and he did get things wrong, egregiously so in the case of Thomas Eagleton's DUI arrest, but he spent his life trying to explain to the everyday American citizen what their public servants were up to in their name.  He wasn't in anyone's pocket or part of any establishment; we could have used more than a few men like Jack Anderson during the run up to the Iraq War and before the great economic meltdown of 2008.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN26VMDSFSIE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005K5GS1U#wasThisHelpful","RN26VMDSFSIE0","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the history books, the Presidential election of 1920 is usually described as a debacle, one that resulted in the election of Warren G. Harding, universally thought to be one of our worst Chief Executives; to ice the cake, Harding won with 60% of the popular vote, making him one of the few men ever to pull off a feat that not even Ronald Reagan could achieve.But in his book, 1920: The Year of the Six Presidents, author and historian David Pietruza brings the America of that year back to life and shows us that much more was going on than meets the eye.The six Presidents of the title were: Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, and both Roosevelts, all of whom factored into the campaign of 1920.  America would not see this many political heavy weights contend in a Presidential contest again until the 1960's.  But Pietruza's book is not just about them, he gives the reader a detailed portrait of a country leaving the supposedly simple and agrarian 19th Century far behind and rushing headlong into the 20th.  We were no longer a nation where the center of power rested on farms and in small towns; the majority of the country now lived in urban areas and as a result the United States had gone big city, embracing automobiles, woman's suffrage, jazz, department stores and radio, then in its infancy.  Those who loved the older America pushed back, enacting Prohibition and outlawing the teaching of evolution, thus setting off a culture war that has never really gone away.In his book, Pietzuza chronicles the resurgence of the Klan and the challenge of the Socialists; the sad case of Sacco and Vanzetti and the Red Scare that cracked down on anarchists and leftist agitators; the battle for America's entry into the League of Nations and the isolationists who wanted nothing to do with it. All of these things had tremendous impact on the election and its outcome.It is in his portraits of the titled Presidents and the others who made their mark on 1920 that Pietruza really shines.  The Woodrow Wilson of these pages is bitter, inflexible, and after suffering a stroke, no longer in touch with reality and clearly unfit to continue as President.  Yet he conspires to seek a third term, much to the detriment of his fellow Democrats.  Warren Harding is quite the contrast, a kind and generous man to his friends, well liked by everyone, but at the same time, an amoral adulterer, as bad or worse than Bill Clinton on his best day. Herbert Hoover is the heroic public servant who saved millions from starvation in Europe after World War I, admired by his fellow Americans, with supporters in both parties who want him to be their nominee, although no one seems to notice he lacks the common touch.  The young Franklin D. Roosevelt is the Assistant Secretary of the Navy and Democratic VP nominee, ambitious for higher office and with a fidelity problem of his own.  Theodore Roosevelt, FDR's distant cousin, who leaves us with one of the great What If's of American political history when he dies in January of 1919, well before he could have claimed the Republican nomination the following year and won the White House again, thus making Harding's nomination possible.  Then there is Calvin Coolidge, clearly a favorite of Pietruza (whom he has written about in other books), who comes across as a plain speaking and unassuming public servant, everything the others are not.This book also has a great cast of supporting characters, some forgotten by history: James M. Cox, the Ohio Governor who lost badly to Harding and was the first divorced man to head a Presidential ticket; Harry Daugherty, Harding's shrewd and dishonest campaign manager,a future disgraced Attorney General; Florence Harding, the Senator's ambitious and fearful wife who knew how to look the other way; Hiram Johnson, the petulant California Senator who blew off a chance to be Harding's VP and ultimately the Presidency itself; General Leonard Wood, the Republican front runner who could not seal the deal; Professor William Estabrook Chancellor, a morbid racist and character assassin; Eugene Debs, the Socialist candidate for President, who did all his campaigning from a cell in the Atlanta Penitentiary; and Al Smith, the Governor of New York and the first Catholic to seriously contest for the Democratic Presidential nomination.We also get a great behind the scenes look at the Republican convention that year where legend has it that Harding was picked by party bosses in a ""smoke filled room.""  The truth is somewhat different, but just as fascinating. So to the homosexual scandal at the Newport, Rhode Island Naval Base that nearly derailed FDR's political career.Why did Harding win and by such a big margin?  It had a lot to do with ""back to normalcy,"" a slogan and an issue that resonated deeply with a public tired and disillusioned after the tumult of the first World War and desperately wanting a return to quieter times.  But ""normalcy"" in the 20th Century would not be what it had once been.There is some bias in this book; you'd wouldn't know it from these pages why Woodrow Wilson is regarded as a great President, and Pietzuza is generally easy on the Republicans. Not unusual for a guy who appears on FNC, but he should know that the Republican and Democratic parties of the 1920's are not the same parities of today.  There needs to be more context when it comes to the policies and choices Harding and Coolidge made and how they ultimately contributed to the Great Depression and the coming of World War II.  There is also some snark in Pietzuza's style, which may not sit well with some readers of history.Still, most of those who devour history books, not to mention students of political history, will love 1920: THE YEAR OF THE SIX PRESIDENTS.  Read it and see how much has not changed in nearly 93 years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIS30L47Q2BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786721022#wasThisHelpful","R1WIS30L47Q2BY","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BREAKING BAD is maybe the most addictive show on TV now with the possible exception of THE WALKING DEAD.  I watched the three previous seasons on DVD and tore into season 4 as soon as the set arrived from Amazon.  It did not disappoint as the story of cancer stricken chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine cook Walter White spiraled even further out of control.From the opening episode, Box Cutter, that resolves season 3's cliffhanger to the final confrontation with drug kingpin/chicken franchise owner, Gus Fring in the season ending episode, Face Off, the tension is non stop as it is ratcheted up to almost unbearable levels. Watching these characters stew in a hell of their own making makes for terrific drama.  Everyone is back for the ride: Walter, Jesse, Skylar, Hank, Mike, Marie, Gus, Walter Jr. Saul, and even nasty old Uncle Tio, who plays a very significant part in the action before the season is done.Impossible as it seems, Walter's life becomes even more complicated this season: he's increasingly on thin ice with Gus; his partner in crime, Jesse Pinkman, is starting to have divided loyalties; wife Skylar is buying a car wash as a cover to launder all the money Walt's meth making as brought in and trying to help her shifty former boss dodge the IRS at the same time; and his DEA agent brother in law, Hank, is sniffing at Gus's trail and getting closer to the laundry that houses Walt and Jessie's meth lab.  At every turn, Walter is finding himself in ever more desperate straits.And the viewer is left with the question first posed back in the very first episode: is Walter White a good man forced by dire circumstances to do bad things or was he an evil man all along, whose dark nature was liberated by his own very bad choices? There's no definitive answer in Season 4 for me, but the final image of the season ender will make up the mind of many viewers.The acting is exceptional, especially Bryan Cranston as Walter; he literally makes us feel this character's rage, panic and sheer hell bent determination in every line of dialogue and smallest gesture.  But all high praise to Aaron Paul as Jesse, Anna Gunn as Skylar, Dean Norris as Hank; Bob Odenkirk as Saul, Jonathon Banks as Mike, Mark Margolis (who does it all with his eyes) as Uncle Tio, and certainly to Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring, the perfect embodiment of ice cold evil.  Because of these great actors, we feel we know their characters much better then they know themselves.  And let's not leave out the fine writing and directing.Is BREAKING BAD a scathing commentary on the decline of the middle class or a 21st Century film noir?  Let the viewer make up their own mind,  For me, it's the kind of riveting drama that movies and regular network television don't seem to want to provide anymore.  Just watch episode 10, titled Salud, and you'll see what I mean.  I so enjoy watching series like this on DVD where I can devour multiple episodes in one sitting instead of having the network dole out one show a week at a time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CO572KB6G2UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058YPG1G#wasThisHelpful","R1CO572KB6G2UW","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year I read ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt"" by Edmund Morris, and after finishing it, could not wait to read the second volume in the series, ""Theodore Rex,"" hoping it would be a worthy second act.Now after finishing ""Theodore Rex,"" I can say with certainty that it does not disappoint, for Morris has given us a book that explains in detail why this extraordinary man is one of our greatest Presidents.The narrative starts on the day Roosevelt takes over the reigns of power from the assassinated William McKinley and ends eight years later when left the White House after refusing a third term that could have easily been his, and when he was barely past the age of 50.In between we are treated in detail to an onrush of great events: the building of the Panama Canal,the Russo-Japanese War and the peace negotiations that followed; the confrontations with the Trusts and the passing of the Food and Drug Act; the Panic of 1907; the coal strike of 1902 and the battle to get capital and labor to sit down to together and work out a deal; brinkmanship with the Kaiser's Germany over Venezuelan debt; an epidemic of lynchings in the South and an outbreak of discrimination against Japanese immigrants on the West Coast; the terrible injustice of the Brownsville, Texas dismissals (TR's worst hour), where black soldiers were kicked out of the Army without due process; the pacification of the Philippines and independence for Cuba; the conservation movement to protect natural resources and the creation of the National Parks; the expansion of American Naval power.  By the end of the book, we are given a vivid picture of an America fast leaving the 19th Century behind and hurdling headlong into the 20th.At the center of all this is Theodore Roosevelt, the man; an accidental President at a time when no Vice President who succeeded to the higher office had ever gone on to win a Presidential election in his own right.  That is until this human dynamo succeeded McKinley at age of 42.  Morris gives us a Roosevelt who is both a man of action and an intellectual of the first order; TR was a prodigious writer on multiple subject ranging from history to nature and politics.  And as I said in my review of ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,"" he was a man who thrived on challenge and was utterly unafraid of confrontation.  At the same time, he was remarkably free of rancor and bitterness; so much so that he could say kind words about William Jennings Bryan, a man with whom he strongly differed politically.In the pages of this second book, Morris makes clear what I think was the true reason why Roosevelt was such a success as President and why he prevailed against powerful opposition: he was a man who truly understood how and why the America of his day worked and had a clear vision of where he wanted to take the country.  Present political leaders take note, in fact I think Morris's book ought to mandatory reading for anyone who aspires to the Presidency.Morris also gives us a great supporting cast of characters: John Hay, JP Morgan, John Mitchell, Mark Hanna, Alton B. Parker (the most obscure man ever nominated by a major party for the Presidency), Henry Adams, Elihu Root, Philander Knox, Henry Cabot Lodge, General Nelson Miles, Kaiser Wilhelm, Tsar Nicholas II, Booker T. Washington, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, Oliver Wendell Holmes, a cameo by HG Wells and a brief appearance by Woodrow Wilson. Most poignant of all is William Howard Taft, Roosevelt's Secretary of War and chosen successor; a man who wanted nothing more than to sit on the Supreme Court.  The final chapter adroitly sets the stage for the tragic split that was to come in the years ahead.What I take most from Morris's book is how incredibly relevant the America of a hundred years ago is today; especially in the depiction of economic power and the extent it to which it would go to protect its influence.  In Roosevelt's time as in our own, great corporations were intent on buying politicians who would serve their interests and how anyone who dared stand up to them was branded as anti American and ""socialist.""  The Theodore Roosevelt who stood up and promised the American people a Square Deal would be right at home in the political thicket of today's politics.Edmund Morris is a master of the dramatic narrative and the fine art of making historical non fiction read like a novel; dramatic scenes jump off the page and once famous and now obscure personages come roaring back to life.Now, with two of Morris's books down, I can't wait to finish the series with ""Colonel Roosevelt.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UG3MI6NJXUZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812966007#wasThisHelpful","R3UG3MI6NJXUZY","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For decades I have heard the praises of Russ Meyer sung by such different critics as Roger Ebert and John Waters, but back in Meyer's heyday I was much too young to get in and see his films for myself; FASTER, PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! is the first Meyer film I've had a chance to view, although I've been aware of his work for more than four decades.  I well remember VIXEN playing at a neighborhood theater for two straight weeks back in 1970 and can remember admiring the poster for HARRY, CHERRY, AND RAQUEL in the lobby a year later.FASTER, PUSSYCAT,! Meyer's epic about Vegas go-go dancers on a murder and mayhem spree in the desert, is now considered his best and most famous work, and I was interested to see how well it holds up after all these years.Much about FASTER, PUSSYCAT! remains rooted in the mid 60's: things like Tommy's plaid shorts, Billie's mini skirt, sports cars drag racing in the desert, and lots of hip slang.  Then there is Meyer's leering attitude toward his buxom beauties, it all now seems to belong to a long gone time when boys still stuffed Playboys under their mattresses.But on both style and substance, FASTER, PUSSYCAT! was well ahead of its time in the way Meyer celebrates sex and violence; making it a harbinger of a whole new genre of movie making where sleaze and trash would become the hallmark of popular culture.  The America depicted in FASTER, PUSSYCAT!, one completely devoid of morality and common decency, beats NATURAL BORN KILLERS to the punch by 30 years.And the very uniqueness of FASTER, PUSSYCAT! makes it timeless in a way; there is no other movie that features female characters quite like Varla, Rosie and Billie.  These bad girls on the road are nobody's THELMA AND LOUISE; they are crude, cruel and take what they want when they want.  And woe to any fool who gets in their way.  Tura Satana is rightly celebrated for her nasty Varla, with her awesome body, razor sharp tongue and killer karate moves.  But I think she's matched all the way by Lori Williams's Billie, who showers in the nude under a water tank and has a most memorable drunk scene. Among the mostly hapless male actors, only Stuart Lancaster's pathetic and hateful old man comes close to stealing a scene from Meyer's lethal Amazons.As much as the sex, it's the violence in FASTER, PUSSYCAT that makes it stand out; most memorable is the scene where Varla beats Tommy to death in the desert or when The Vegetable stabs Billie repeatedly.  For me, nothing tops the sequence where Varla attempts to crush the muscle bound Vegetable with her sports car.Russ Meyer is long gone now, but his work lives on and his influence can be seen in the works of Tarentino, Paul Thomas Anderson, and even HBO's TRUE BLOOD series.  Not bad for a World War II vet with a great eye for the female form.  Check out FASTER, PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! and see what I mean; it's worth the time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JNPHIXN0SE7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009YA3V8#wasThisHelpful","R1JNPHIXN0SE7R","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read GONE, I couldn't wait to read it's sequel,HUNGER, to find out where author Michael Grant had taken his characters and what he'd done with his fascinating story of Perdido Beach, where all of the people over the age of 15 disappear in a blink and the remaining children find themselves trapped behind an invisible barrier, while the rest of the world is...gone.  Oh, and some of the kids start to mutate and develop super powers such as telekinesis, the ability to shoot beams of energy from their hands, super speed, and the ability to heal wounds.  Did I mention the animals start changing as well?  HUNGER picks up the story three months after all the adults vanished and things inside the FAYZ (the name the kids give their peculiar exclusive zone) have gone from bad to worse.  The food is running out and the normal kids are turning on their super powered peers out of fear and jealousy. Then there is the disembodied creature at the bottom of a mind shaft outside of town; its gotten awfully hungry too, only it is hankering for the nuclear fuel inside the power plant just beyond the town limits.  This alien force has gotten into the minds of several characters already and plans to use them to in a scheme that would allow it to eat its fill and escape from the mine.  Author Grant stays true to form and has written another story where something is happening in every chapter; he frames each book in the GONE saga with a countdown-each chapter is simply titled by a number of hours and minutes-and each passing moment clicks down to a potentially catastrophic climax.  The tension builds as characters with both good and evil intentions (and some with a few shades of gray) square off.  And Grant has crated some terrific characters: School Bus Sam Temple, who finds his role as hero and leader an almost unbearable burden in this installment of the series; Caine, Sam's brother and deadly enemy, who plots to take control of the nuclear power plant; Lana the Healer, whose mind has been poisoned by the creature in the shaft; Diana, Caine's love and loyal lieutenant, who seduces a smitten computer genius into helping them; Brianna the Breeze, whose super speed powers are pushed to the breaking point; Duck Zhang, who can change the density of his body depending on his mood; not to mention Edilio, Quinn, Mary, Orc, Zil, and Albert. But the break out star of these books (if fan reaction is to be believed) is Drake Merwin, Caine's not so loyal lieutenant with a tentacle arm he can use like a whip; some female readers seem to think he's just a ""bad boy,"" but it's obvious he's intended to be the one irredeemably evil character in the story.  As you get engrossed in the action, you sometimes forget these people are no more than fifteen years old-that's the kicker of the tale.  As I wrote in my review of GONE, I am more than a few years out of this book's intended demographic, but I found it to be surprisingly adult for YA fiction, especially compared to TWILIGHT or THE HUNGER GAMES.  There is a lot to like here for just plain old horror fans, like giant flesh eating worms and vicious mutated coyotes who can now speak.  I've watched interviews with Michael Grant on Youtube and find him to be a nice guy and wonderfully unpretentious and down to earth, the kind of writer who really wants to please his fans.  Let's hope that in his next book, LIES, we get some real hints as to what is behind the FAYZ and what the ultimate fate of all these fascinating characters will be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQGCR5TWBIOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061449083#wasThisHelpful","R2GQGCR5TWBIOV","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was 5 years old when JFK was killed and still vividly remember the black and white TV images from that day and the following, especially the sight of Lee Harvey Oswald being shot down on that fateful Sunday morning.  So imagine my anticipation when I learned that my favorite writer, Stephen King, was putting out a novel whose plot concerned time travel and the terrible events of November 1963 in Dallas,Texas.Now, after finishing the book's 849 pages, I can say that while Mr, King has written a book filled with many of his usual tropes, 11-22-63 is a novel of of great subtlety and restraint; nowhere does King go over the top in his quest for the big gross out; no monster clowns chomping down on little boys or buckets of pig's blood here.  Instead what we get in 11-22-63 could best be described as an epic version of The Twilight Zone, for in many ways it feels like King is channeling Rod Serling at his best.The novel's protagonist is Jake Epping, a thirty something Maine high school English teacher living in 2011, who through his friendship with Al Templeton, owner of a local diner whose burgers are ridiculously cheap for the 21st century, learns of a portal in time.  This handy portal is located in the pantry of Al's diner and once you step through to the other side, you are back in the year of 1958, where Ike is in the White House and Elvis is not only still alive, but thin as a rail. No matter how many times one goes through the portal and returns to the present (where only two minutes have passed even if you have spent years in the past), it is always the same day and year in 1958 on the other side of the portal, right down to the hour and minute; every trip is a complete reset.  Or so it seems.Jake is one of King's great everyman heroes in the tradition of Stu Redman and Clay Riddell from the The Stand and Cell respectively, which is to say Jake is a regular guy thrown into extraordinary circumstances who then rolls up his sleeves and does his best.  One day Jake is called to the home of his friend and favorite diner owner, where he is shocked to discover that Al suddenly appears to be many years older than he was only 24 ago and terminally ill with cancer to boot.  This sets in motion a chain of events that will send Jake back to the past on a five year quest to stop Lee Harvey Oswald, save JFK and prevent the Vietnam War.  This requires Jake to assume the identity of George Amberson, a high school English teacher with a murky past and an uncanny knack for making the right bet on the right winner at the right time.  His quest requires Jake/George to journey to Texas and build a whole new life in a little town outside Dallas while marking the time until he can step in and change the course of history.  What Jake doesn't count on is falling in love with fellow teacher Sadie Dunhill, and deciding that the past might actually be a nice place to stay and live out his life.But Jake discovers what his friend Al learned the hard way, the past does not want to be changed and will actively resist any attempt to alter its course.  I wouldn't dare give away the novel's twists and turns at its climax, but I'm sure most ""constant readers"" won't see it coming; just remember what I said about The Twilight Zone.Anyone who has read King knows he has great affection for the late 1950's and early 60's; and has a great ability to recreate those times down to the most minute detail, just read It or The Body to see what I mean.  In 11-22-63 he uses this gift of nostalgia to make a long gone America live and breathe again in the cars, the clothes, the music, the habits and the attitudes.Because, for the first time that I know of in his writing career, King is using real historic figures as characters in a fictional work, he pulls back somewhat on his characterizations.  What I mean is that no one is better than Stephen King in creating mean, sociopathic, hateful bastards (half the characters in Under the Dome could be described as such), but in 11-22-63 he never goes further than the historical record when depicting real life people like Marina Oswald, James Hosty, George de Mohrenschildt or General Edwin Walker, a right wing nutcase, but a rather dull personality if Youtube is to be believed.  King's Lee Harvey Oswald is not the personification of evil, but simply an abusive and delusional loser.For many baby boomers of a certain age, mainly those who were teenagers or young adults at the time of Kennedy's assassination, there has always been that great What If?  And it has become an article of faith among them that had JFK lived, there would have been no Vietnam War because he would not have escalated like LBJ did and America would have been spared the loss of all those names on the Wall and our country would not have splintered apart in the late 60's over the conduct of the war.  Somehow Camelot would have continued until the end of the decade, and all the hope, potential and optimism of the Kennedy years would not have been squandered; this notion has taken a powerful hold on our popular culture, for there is a reason why American Graffiti, National Lampoon's Animal House and Hairspray are set in 1962, the only year John F. Kennedy was President for all 365 days.But in truth, JFK was a tough Cold Warrior and very calculating politician, one who was ever sensitive to charges his administration was soft on Communism.  It is safe to say that Kennedy would have beaten Barry Goldwater in 1964, but after that the speculation is nothing more than seeing through a glass darkly, and it should be remembered that Vietnam proved to be a very hard nut to crack, a problem ultimatly resistant to all well intentioned western solutions.But I digress; 11-22-63 is a page turner in the best Stephen King tradition, a thriller with a sci-fi angle, while also a beautiful and bittersweet love story at the same time.  And for King fans there is a side trip, early in the book, to Derry, Maine and a couple of cameos by some favorite characters from IT, while a pertinent one from Christine turns up in the background as well. Let me say that if Frank Dunning and Jack Torrance were ever to meet, they'd discover they have a lot in common; even in fiction, to quote The King, the past and present do seem to harmonize.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1446BA8LVEAUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451627297#wasThisHelpful","R1446BA8LVEAUB","A17PNW5KFXRDT3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17PNW5KFXRDT3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are little, floating bath toys for young children, and while sort of cute, they're not great. There are quite a few pieces to pick up after bath time is over, and I think most kids would be just as enthralled with a wet washcloth as with these toys., and would probably be more interested in playing with some actual 3-D animals and people toys than with 2-D faces, bones and flowers. Overall, I'm not real impressed by this particular toy, as it seems to be lacking in the fun department.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OOGWM09EBVSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WANGGTY#wasThisHelpful","R3OOGWM09EBVSB","A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a high-quality, rugged floor mat that is just the right size to put in front of most front doors. (Even better, my front door was still able to swing freely over the top of this mat, due to its low profile!) The color is dark grey (almost black), so it can really be put just about anywhere, but I imagine it will most often find a home in mudrooms or near garage service doors. The thing feels like it would stop a bullet, so I have no trouble imagining that vacuuming stuff of the top of it will be a cinch. Also, because it is made from polypropylene, washing it with liquids will also be an option without degrading the material.

"I was very happy to receive a new laser measuring tool from Bosch as a review product. As the owner of other Bosch tools, I am very satisfied with the brand, as a whole, and am always eager to try out new things from them. I use a laser measurement tool (Bosch GLM 15 Compact Laser Measure, 50-Feet) when I am building project proposals for customers. I use it to take quick measurements of rooms, and it not only looks more professional than stepping off a room, it is faster and very accurate. While I was very happy with the measuring device I had been using, I had two issues with it that put me in the mindset to pick up another one:1. When I was measuring exterior projects, I could get accurate measurements for sections that were larger than the 50' measuring capacity of my tool, and...2. I really wanted one for both vehicles that I drive. Sometimes I would find myself half-way to a bid and realize that I left my laser measurement tool in the other vehicle, which was more than a minor inconvenience.Obtaining a second Bosch laser measurement tool should solve both of these issues. This one has a few more features, and can definitely measure farther distances, too, so I am thrilled with it. Time will tell if it can help with one other small issue I had with my other device: the red laser dot was sometime hard to see in bright daylight. While shopping for a newer, better device, I was on the lookout for one that had a high-energy beam that would still be visible in daylight on the exterior of a building. I am at the end of my exterior work season, so I may not get much of a chance to use it in that capacity this year, but who knows what the next month will bring? If and when I get to use it outside a few times, I'll be able to tell if I have the same issue with this one as I do with the other and can accurately update this review. Regardless, I am still happy with this product and am anxious to make full use of its available features.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R287AL0J7T1ME4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015FCJTEA#wasThisHelpful","R287AL0J7T1ME4","A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Title: Hawkeye Vol. 4: Rio BravoPublisher: MarvelWriter: Matt FractionArtists: Chris Eliopoulos, David Aja, Francesco Francavilla (pencils, inks), Jordie Bellaire, Matt Hollingsworth, Francesco Francavilla (colors), David Aja (covers)Collects: Hawkeye #12-13, 15, 17, 19, 21-22Price: $17.99So, I guess this wraps up Fraction‚Äôs run on Hawkeye, and I am pretty sure that this is the end of the series, as well. If another Hawkeye series is launched, it will be post-Secret Wars, and who knows what it could look like by that point. With this being the end game for the series, I was expecting a good finish to the book. Did I get it? Mmmm‚Ä¶  not quite.This book has Clint‚Äôs brother Barney popping in, and the two of them seem to have an ongoing love-hate relationship with one another. The interactions between the two were good, and were probably the best thing about this book. Kate was largely absent from this particular volume of the series, but I can‚Äôt say that I missed her much. She has yet to grow on me as a character.The on-going conflict with the ‚Äútracksuit draculas,‚Äù of course, needed to be wrapped up, and it was. Along the way, Clint receives the beating of a lifetime, but ends up giving as good as he gets. The mysterious assassin character also makes several appearances. Somehow, despite having Clint at his mercy on several occasions, he manages to injure him instead of killing him, because‚Ä¶  well, it‚Äôs Hawkeye. Marvel isn‚Äôt going to kill him no matter what, right? He does end up with a permanent disability, though, because that‚Äôs what the current political climate is demanding ‚Äì more and more diversity. Instead of changing his skin color or making him homosexual, they decided to give him a disability. OK. Whatever. By this point in his career, he should have all sorts of injuries, so why not a disability? I can live with that. However, the nature of his new disability (deafness) made for some difficult-to-read comic book art. I get that the artists were trying to give the feeling of a person who can‚Äôt hear the people and sounds around him. They did this by lots of empty word balloons, confused facial expressions, and copious amounts of illustrations of sign language. Since I don‚Äôt know sign language, this was all pretty meaningless and hard to follow for me. It sort of failed in what it was trying to do ‚Äì at least from my perspective. I have no idea how a deaf person would react to it, but it would be interesting to hear about these pages from their own perspective.Despite the books‚Äô high points of action, humor, and suspense, I can‚Äôt say that the book thrilled me with its conclusion the way I was hoping it would. It was still a good book, but it just failed to meet my [admittedly high] expectations.I haven‚Äôt heard anything about new future projects by the Fraction/Aja creative team, but I hope this one wasn‚Äôt the last. I would definitely be interested in seeing more from them.Writing: 8/10Artwork: 7/10Cool Factor: 8/10Value: 7/10Overall: 7.5/10","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24I1N7RYSP5SW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785185313#wasThisHelpful","R24I1N7RYSP5SW","A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Microfiber cloths are the best! I use them, on a pretty regular basis, at work, and I also use them to wash my vehicles. These are more appropriate for household use in the kitchen or for dusting, rather than for outdoor use. (You can always use them outdoors, of course, but they look too nice to be used outdoors.) The advantages of microfiber cloth are that it is super absorbent and super clingy. If you rub your hand across it, you can often hear a scratching sound as it grips all the little rough pieces of skin on your hand. It grips dirt particles the same way, making it an excellent choice for dusting or scrubbing. And because it is so absorbent, it holds more liquid than you would first imagine.I'm a fan of microfiber products, in general, and these cleaning cloths, in particular. They are a good value for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LDMA7452S0SO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T5M9L5O#wasThisHelpful","R2LDMA7452S0SO","A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a backpack that is designed to take the place of a briefcase. You probably surmised as much by reading the name and description, above, but just in case you glossed over some part of that, I'm clarifying that for you, here. This is a backpack with a downtown commuting businessperson in mind. The backpack has no fewer than ten (10!) zippered compartments - many sized specifically for holding and transporting specific items, such as tablets, laptops, tote umbrellas, cellphones and standard portfolios. Inside it, there are even more unzippered pockets for slipping smaller items into. Throughout the entire backpack you will notice lots of thick canvas and padding. The entire thing feels very sturdy, and the zippers are thick, metal ones that you would expect to see on a heavy winter coat or sturdy tent. Overall, I am quite impressed with the construction of the pack. Empty, it will stand up all by itself on its markedly flat bottom - something few backpacks can do and something that makes loading it up even easier.I really like this backpack, but I simply cannot give it five stars due to one significant factor - the steep price. I have seen far larger, more spacious specialized hiking backpacks offered for far less money. In fact, you could purchase a hiking backpack and fill it with most everything you need for your trip for the price of this one ""brief pack."" It's a nice, specialized backpack, to be sure, but I don't understand the high price of it. It seems to cost at least double the price I would expect to see attached to it.

Bendis did a great job a couple years ago with his year-long mini-series (Moon Knight, Vol. 1, Moon Knight, Vol. 2)starring the character, but these issues by comic-master Warren Ellis are just fantastic!Each of these 6 issues are written in a one-and-done format, so the entire TPB is a series of six loosely-related stories. Each of them is very interesting and unique. In the stories, Spector faces off against foes including ghosts, a sniper, a dead man, and a copycat killer. Each of the stories is a joy to read, and I can only hope that Ellis will return to the character at some point in the future to give us another helping.Declan Shalvey isn‚Äôt a name I was familiar with, but I have to say I really enjoyed his style of artwork. It was a bit reminiscent of David Aja‚Äôs work on Hawkeye and Iron Fist, but better. Jordie Bellaire‚Äôs colors bring it all to life just perfectly, too. Both the writing and the art on the book is more simplistic and elegant that what you‚Äôll find in a lot of books, but I found it to be almost perfect.This is (narrowly) my favorite Marvel book that I‚Äôve read this year, and certainly the best book Marvel published in 2014.

"WWE action figures aren't really my bag, as I don't care for the show and all of its play fighting and drama. However, I can't deny that there are kids who would enjoy these things. Building action figures is nothing new. However, it has mostly been done in the past as a ""collect-the-pieces-to-build-a-bonus-figure"" sort of thing. Putting all of the pieces for one figure in the same package is a relatively new thing. At first it seems kind of silly, but then you realize that when you purchase several figures you can swap pieces between them - sort of like LEGO minifigs, but on a much larger scale. What concerns me is the ability of these pieces to stay connected over time. If you lose one figure, it's big enough to be able to find it. If you only lose an arm, though, that's going to be harder to locate by itself.I suppose that the characters will be fun to demolish as the kids play with them (gleefully dismembering the characters as they engage in violent wrestling matches), but how many times will they snap back into place before wearing out?The characters each come with some accessories that are unique to them - though not necessarily representative or indicative of anything the real-life characters wear in actual appearances.

"Everyone is used to bathroom spritzers that you spray after using the toilet. Probably most people have used an air freshener like Febreze Air Effects Air Refresher - Meadows & Rain - 9.7 oz - 2 pk or something similar. This is different, though, as it is intended to be sprayed the TOILET BEFORE you go rather than into the AIR AFTER you go. The stuff works, but it takes a bit of getting used to doing it in such a different manner. Maybe the reasoning is that it might not be healthy to be inhaling so much of the air-based stuff as you stroll through the bathroom? Maybe some people with sensitive noses have complained to employers? (I'm just speculating, here.) This stuff has a very strong scent to it, so you're definitely going to notice when it's used. Although there can't be nearly as much of it in the air as in the toilet, the scent is still quite strong in an enclosed area. It isn't a bad smell, just a strong smell, so this might not be the best choice for a very small bathroom.Overall, it's not bad, and I'd definitely be willing to try it again in some other scents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M50RL0EN57VC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01486Z5G0#wasThisHelpful","R2M50RL0EN57VC","A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As is the case with most any product made by OtterBox, this one is high quality. OtterBox build solid-looking and solid-feeling products that offer a high level of protection while still allowing full functionality. Some people complain, at times, that OtterBox products are too heavy. That is patently ridiculous. Those people are the worst kinds of pansies. You would have to be a person with some sort of serious debilitation to not be able to easily handle this product! With the case on it, your iPad isn't going to weigh any more than a medium-sized textbook, but with less girth.I have owned four iPad cases/covers to date - three of them OtterBox branded products. I have been happy with all of them. I have (including this particular case) three cases with attached keyboards. Of the three, this one is my favorite of the bunch. It connected easily and has a better feel to it than the other ones I own.I could really do without the wall mount, but it's a nice option to include. Some people are likely to find this much more useful than others. It really depends a lot on what sort of environment this product is likely to be used the most in. If you are mostly going to use it while lying in bed or sitting on a couch, it won't be very useful. Likewise, if you are only going to use this product while you are up on your feet, it won't come in handy. This is going to be most handy for people who will be using this product in a home office or kitchen nook/desk space.Overall, I very happy with this product and would highly recommend it to others. Just keep in mind that you may want to pursue a similar product that comes without the wall mount if you don't think you'll use it much.

"This is an OK art creation project for kids ages 8+.

The things stick surprisingly well and peel off cleanly - provided the hands that put them up were pretty clean to begin with.I think this project will appeal more to girls than boys, but there are probably some boys who will enjoy it, too. The price is maybe a little bit high for what you are getting, here, and some parents may not particularly want brightly colored objects stuck all over the place.

"Mashin' Max is a 2-3 player game for kids ages 4 and up. In the game, each of the players chooses one of the three available color - each of which is molded to look like a different type of woodland critter- hedgehogs, bunnies or turtles. The object of the game is to leave the safety of your stump (starting area) and scurry around the forest (circular game board) collecting berries (white plastic chips) to bring back to your stump (safe zone). The big obstacle in the game is Max - a giant bear/monkey hybrid that dominates the forest. He is a violent beast who takes pleasure in squashing little forest critters with his giant fists. Max sits in the center of the circular game board, spinning around and slamming down his giant fists. If your little forest critter gets ""squashed,"" you lose your stash of berries that they were carrying. The player with the most collected berries at the end of the game is the winner.Sure, this is a silly game, and it really isn't anything special, but kids will enjoy playing with it for a time or two, and it's always good to get kids off their screen/devices and into a socially interactive environment/activity now and then. I don't love the game but I don't hate it either. It's a typical sort of young children's game that has a quick play time, no strategy, and some moving parts.

"This is a somewhat silly game for kids that DOE NOT involve sitting around a table. In all actuality, this is more of an activity rather than a game. This activity involves safely traversing a laser-crossed path to get to a bomb and ""defuse"" it before time runs out. If defusing bombs and avoiding traps seems like kind of a mature theme for a game for kids, just relax - it's a plastic bomb that never actually goes off and the lasers are really nothing more than strings.

Kids will enjoy it the most if they are naturally creative. Kids who are glued to mini or large video screens most of the day probably won't enjoy it nearly as much as the kids who are very active and not addicted to devices. The novelty of the game will wear off pretty quickly, but it will last longer if two or more kids take turns challenging each other to make ""rooms"" or ""courses"" for one another to beat.Like I said, this is more of a play activity than a game, and it's pretty basic stuff, but there is some fun to be had with it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP4Y9K3UUF8IG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UPAYYCA#wasThisHelpful","RP4Y9K3UUF8IG","A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gale Force 9 has a reputation of being a company that does what few game/toy companies ever manage to do: make games based on movies or television shows that are actually appealing to gamers! Most games based on movies or TV shows are generally simple re-themes, and if they aren't they are too simple or silly to be any fun. GF9, on the other hand, has a good track record of making quality games that are fun and engage the brain. This is my first game from GF9, and I am quite pleased with it!Homeland is a hidden role game in which players act as government agents, terrorists, or political opportunists that each have hidden personal agendas. Throughout the course of the game, players will score points based on whether they accomplish their goals - namely preventing or causing terrorists attacks.The rules book is a bit lengthy, but part of this is due to the fact that is has copious amounts of pictures, illustrations and tips - all laid out in a clearly in large-font text. It will take a bit of digestion on the part of the person who is learning the game for the purpose of teaching it to others. Once players complete a round or two of play, however, the game is pretty easy to pick up and run through. Game play will typically last between 75-120 minutes. The game can accommodate up to six players, though a larger player count means that you'll have a longer play time and more down time between turns.The game has a nice theme that is relative to current world events, and even if you have never watched the show and are not familiar with it, it won't stop you from enjoying this game. Knowledge of the show is not necessary to understand or appreciate this game. The recommended age for players is 14, though I think 12-up is probably more accurate.Components are decent enough, and the cards probably won't be handled so much that you will require sleeving them. The game board is fairly large, so you will want a good-sized playing are to set up and play the game on.Overall, this is a good game that I have no problem recommending. After playing this game, I'm a bit curious to try out the Sons of Anarchy Men of Mayhem game to see if it's any good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27F79SCO0Q592/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940825539#wasThisHelpful","R27F79SCO0Q592","A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the fourth Epson printer than I have owned. It is replacing a previous model - the Epson XP-810. This printer does everything the former model did - print, scan, copy, fax, and it has just about the same footprint as the older model. It connects wirelessly without too much effort. Following the included instructions and the prompts on the touch-screen, it only took about five minutes to get it all connected to my home Wi-Fi network. (This may be easier for me than some, as I have done it several times before with other printers.Like every Epson printer I have owned, this one prints quickly and nicely.

With that one, I generally spend about $100/year on ink cartridges. If that sounds high to you, don't be too surprised. I think this is pretty normal and you just have to face the facts that these ink cartridges don't come cheap.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this printer and I can't determine too many differences between this one and the previous model. That being said, I highly recommend this printer as a home use all-in-one compact printer. I have had great success with Epson printers and they are easy for me to recommend. Unless something happens to really thrown them off their game, I don't plan on ever owning a printer that isn't made by Epson.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RD2FECN2F8KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5XSS#wasThisHelpful","R2RD2FECN2F8KT","A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very sharp-looking formal watch from Invicta. It has the larger-than-average watch face that is trendy, these days. The watch band claps securely, and for me it fit just right. (For reference, I am a 6', 180 lb man.) The watch has a nice heft to it and seems to be solidly built.The controls on the watch are pretty standard for this type of watch, and fairly simple to learn to operate - so long as you at least peruse the manual that comes with the watch. It looks quite handsome when worn - especially if worn with white or black clothing. I tend to wear silver-colored jewelry more than gold-colored jewelry, but I like this watch quite a bit, and it goes very well with some of the more formal attire I own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S56EDQ8OFSRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCSRXCS#wasThisHelpful","R1S56EDQ8OFSRV","A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Compared to the original Campbell's Chicken Noodle that I am used to eating, this soup differed in many ways. The noodles, here, are larger, as are the chicken chunks. There are a few mushy carrots in the mix, too, along with a smidgen of celery, I think. Overall the soup is definitely a bit heartier, but tastes less salty than the common chicken noodle. It isn't bad, but it isn't great, either. I found it pretty average, so it gets only three stars from me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PZM08T3CM9T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5WYV6M#wasThisHelpful","R1PZM08T3CM9T4","A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great luxury wristlet and iPhone 6 Plus phone case. Has multiple compartments for your ID cards, credit cards and or medical cards.I was recently offered the opportunity to try this wristlet and all in one iPhone 6 Plus case in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I jumped at the opportunity because I love the hot pink color and because I can never really find any stylish iPhone 6 Plus cases and much less one that has a wristlet combination.The case is a great high quality material that looks super expensive and cannot be beat for the price. It comes in a variety of different colors and bright and bold designs, a different choice for everyone.  It has the variety and beauty that I was looking for.Would also make a great gift for anyone that like myself dislikes carrying around a huge purse. I love the ease of hanging it on my wrist and keeping my hands free because I use a cane.I have other ULAK iPhone cases that I have purchased and I can honestly say that their products stand up to much wear and tear. They provide an extremely durable product at a reasonable price.**All opinions of this wristlet/iPhone 6 plus case are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NWEGK5FHIPYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UXLO7O#wasThisHelpful","R2NWEGK5FHIPYL","A3IDU9P6FQLVD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IDU9P6FQLVD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So when I was offered the opportunity to purchase the Crafts 4 Kidz Liquid Chalk Markers by Impulseev at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion, I was super excited to get them.The Crafts 4 Kidz Liquid Chalk Markers comes with 8 bright, different colors and 24 labels that can be placed on just about anything.  The markers themselves work on glass, ceramic, chalkboards and any non-porous surface. Basically anyplace you can think of.I love the variety of colors and the ease of writing with them, but I'm especially impressed with the ease of cleaning it off, easy peazy like my son says. They are also great for kids to use because they are non-toxic, and most importantly they are dustless, which is great because both of my boys have asthma and dust is a big trigger.My boys and I had a blast using these liquid chalk markers to decorate our windows just for the fun of it and now they can't wait for the holidays so they can do it all over again.I would definitely recommend the Crafts 4 Kidz Liquid Chalk Markers by Impulseev!!

"I am in no way a beginner with toys but I was extremely excited to try this Pyrex Tempered Glass Dildo. So when I was offered the opportunity to try it at a discounted price during a special promotion in return for my honest and unbiased opinion I immediately accepted.This is a great toy for beginners or experienced users. In my case I've always used silicone toys and this way actually my first glass/Pyrex tempered toy. Tempered meaning that you can heat or cool the toy to your desired temperature. You can warm it in the microwave or give it an ice bath if you like the cold sensation.  It is also great for clit simulation but you can use it as a butt plug if that's your pleasure.It is not a very thick toy. It is about 8 inches long, the head is more or less 3 inches long and the ribbed end is about 5 inches, totaling 8 inches.  The blue ribbing on the shaft is just beautiful. It gives it a classy look and it comes with a nice black bag so it can be put away discreetly (for the noseys).  But what I love the most of all is how easy it is to clean and keep it clean.I know if I enjoyed using it alone, I can't wait to use it with my hubby. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a great toy, that is easy to clean and at an affordable price.

"What an amazing product!!! Does exactly what it is supposed to do!! Very soft, smooth and almost human like feeling shaft.I especially love the fact that it only uses two double AA batteries. It does not sound like a vacuum is runningwhen in use and it is nice and quiet compared to others I have tried. The iPleasure Black Dildo is about seven inches long. It has a small rotating knob that allows you to adjust the speed of the vibrations, from slow to fast. It has a nice curve to allow it to hit the perfect spot. The only downside for me was the strong rubber smell that it has, I've already washed it a few times and the smells is still slightly there, I'm hoping that the smell will go away eventually. The pros of iPleasure definitely outweigh the small minor con.I received this iPleasure Black Dildo during a special promotion at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and I would highly recommended the iPleasure Black Dildo for anyone that is looking for a great quality vibrator.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20WJOI1WFN25T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3JP9HG#wasThisHelpful","R20WJOI1WFN25T","A3IDU9P6FQLVD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IDU9P6FQLVD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In my family home remedies are the way to go. Many of my family members have high blood pressure issues and the elders in my family believe that swallowing a whole piece of garlic is extremely helpful and helps to keep a healthy blood pressure reading.But have you ever tried to swallow a clove of garlic. Yuk!!! I think it is absolutely disgusting. I mean I LOVE cooking with it and flavoring many different foods with it. But to actually swallow a clove down NO WAY!! Thankfully I was offered the opportunity to try Nova Sun LLC's Odorless Garlic and Parsley Supplement in return for an honest opinion.I have to admit that I was recently having a small blood pressure issues so the Garlic and Parsley Supplement couldn't have come at a better time. The pills are as promised completely odorless and they are very easy to swallow (unlike the garlic clove).Since I have found them to be very helpful and has helped to keep me off of any high blood pressure medications, I will definitely continue to take them. I might even get a few more bottles for other family members, if they are nice. Just kidding!! I will definitely get this for them so they NO longer have to go through swallowing down the whole garlic clove.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QSPAW2G3JRAT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RY3WEI2#wasThisHelpful","R1QSPAW2G3JRAT","A3IDU9P6FQLVD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IDU9P6FQLVD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am impressed! Writing long messages on a smartphone is a chore for me and then I decided to try this portable keyboard. I actually ended up writing entire review using this keyboard while in a coffee shop and enjoyed the experience every bit. There was some getting used to period, but I was able to adapt quickly to this design. For the record, I usually type 80 wpm on a regular keyboard, on this I could reach 60 wpm with the test I've done. Lets get to the Pros:Pros:- Beautiful design and solid build quality. The back appears to be made out of aluminium and the front looks like a laptop keyboard- Keyboard keys feel good, almost like notebook feeling just a bit more compact- Bluetooth connection is excellent and decent range- Long battery life and I am yet to deplete it after a day of use- Carry pouch included (I like to keep my gadgets scratch free)Nice to have:- Wish it would have a stand to rest a smartphone against- The backspace button is a bit smaller which might take sometime to get used to it, but not something I would be too overly concerned- Lock for folding mechanism when using it on a lap- Flat aluminium back would be sleeker and possibly more stableOverall: This is a wonderful and clever designed travel keyboard. I could see myself using more then I thought I would. It really helps to reduce the time it takes for me type long emails on a smartphone by roughly 70%. Highly recommended!I will update this review once I get to use this product more extensively.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8RTK0N7YD1AW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YWLJNPQ#wasThisHelpful","R8RTK0N7YD1AW","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've gone through several portable air conditioners and currently I have 8000 BTU SOLEUS AIR KY-80E9 (do not recommend), Delongi 12000 BTU from Costco and now this. I ended up getting rid of Soleus and now able to maintain comfortable temperature throughout 1500 sq feet with just 2 portable ACs.Cooling power:More BTU out of Global and it really does a decent job to cool and maintain comfortable temperature. I have about 450 sq feet space and was able to bring down temperature from 87 to 80 in about couple of hours. If I keep the unit on entire day and turn on fan only circulation for my furnace I was able to maintain 76 degree temperature throughout entire 1500 sq feet while it was 90+ degrees out. Although, take it a with a grain of salt, because not every home is the same.Noise:Global is only a bit quieter and there is an ECO mode in Global that could reduce the noise level. Also, I downloaded Android app called 'Sound Meter' and if I stand next to both of it shows 80-85 dbi. Bottom line, in my experience there are no quiet portable ACs.Fan power:Global moves more airDesign:Surprisingly the unit looks high end even though it was the cheapest I could get for 14000 BTU. It has touch sensitive buttons and nice sleek panel. Also the vent door is automatically opens/closes. Size wise it's only slightly taller then my 12000 BTU, but a bit thinner.Unlike what previous reviewer said vent hose is the same size as other ACs I've tried, no issues here. The window kit is not great. It has two attachments that you have to screw on and which are not adjustable and a bit short to cover any window  in my homeRemote holder is ok, I wish it was more secured to the unitWhen not in use you can plug the cord into the unit itself. Nice touchOverall, this looks, works as more expensive 14000 BTU units. Time will if it will last, but so far I like it.One negative is that the compressor makes buzzing noise (most ACs do that), but this unit has slight vibration in the buzzing which a bit annoying, but could be just my unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39LWZB0FXF4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VM4VCGE#wasThisHelpful","R39LWZB0FXF4H","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My review probably goes unnoticed, but in case someone does care about their Bluetooth speaker they should look elsewhere. I had Bem cube speaker for a few years now which I got for the same price ($30), it's a bit smaller then this and battery life isn't as great, but it sounds miles better then Anker. I don't care much about bass and surprised people actually think this one produces good bass. In my experience this speaker didn't deliver on the sound quality or loudness.On the positives, I do like microUSB plug and buttons location and battery life but that's about it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F5YEQNK1HJ2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP4CRSI#wasThisHelpful","R3F5YEQNK1HJ2D","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time you try it, especially if you follow directions, you'll be disappointed. This stuff gets hard pretty fast. I have experimented with different approaches until I found one that is acceptable. Basically, whenever I need redo/reuse I warm up the water to 190 degrees and use heavy duty rubber gloves and keep dunking it in the water. I'd like to try this with a heat gun as well, because working with hot water gets a bit tiring because you constantly have to heat it up.

"We all know the convenience of a microwave, but it has major drawback - the reheated food doesn't taste the same. Also using oven or reheating on the pan is just not always convenient/efficient, so this comes to a rescue. It heats up quickly and warms/cooks food on both sides. I used to reheat pizza and make grilled cheese sandwiches. Speaking of grilled cheese sandwiches on this cooker. I prefer to use only one slice of bread and cheese on top. This cooker crusts the bread at the bottom and melts cheese on top, something you can't do in a microwave. Non stick surface seems to work great, but my only concern is what type of covering it is. Considering it's pretty cheap no mention if what they used to make it I would have to assume it contains bunch of chemicals, but it's just speculation. Also, lack of the power switch is a minor annoyance in otherwise excellent cooker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDKSS60D28WJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDWPFB2#wasThisHelpful","RDKSS60D28WJ1","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE: 10/29/2015I ended up getting a second one a few month back, it seems there were slightly improvements. My first one froze up a few times and gps stopped working, but otherwise still recording. There are no more firmware updates since May and looks like they are release new version 0827 & 0901.UPDATED: 6/11/2015I've been using this dashcam for 6 month now. It was first batch and the unit worked flawlessly. I haven't done any firmware updates and have not had any issues.  I just ordered a second one after not finding anything better for the price and compactness.UPDATED: 3/16/2015Presently IMHO this is as good as it gets for a compact dashcam with decent enough image quality and features for the price. I came from using BlackVue 500 (you can see my review) and most recently SJ4000. The only reason why I keep upgrading is I am always looking for the best IQ I can get for the price. I will not go into reviewing all features the cam has, you can get this from either manual or specs, just cover the main points that stand out for me:PROS:1. Image Quality 8/10. You can pretty much spend $100 or $300 and will not see any huge difference in IQ. As a matter of fact these newer A7 units combined with good lens will provide as good IQ or in some cases could even outperform slightly higher end devices  from FineVu, BlackVue etc...  0806 provides nice day time and decent night time picture that you can even make out license plates in some dark conditions. Still far from perfect but this is what I will have to settle until the next generation of sensors. It uses A7LA50 Ambarella which  you'll find in a lot of recent dashcams these days, (slightly better then A7LA50D used in previous generation 0801/0803) so they should all perform the same? Not always, also depends on the quality of the lens, sensors used etc... As an example check out sample videos for G90 with A7LA70. It actually looks just slightly better in the daytime, but at night time images appear darker.2. Design 10/10. I was looking for a compact unit without a huge suction cup which most dashcam use. It's quite compact unit and I like the new low profile dock. It's really thoughtful design too, there are 3 usb plugs where you can plugin the charging cable, two on the dock and one on the unit allows flexible placement of the dashcam on the windshield. Also it's nice that you can easily slide it from the dock without having to detach any cables. It does take quite a bit of effort to slide in and out, I rarely do that, so it's not an issue for me.3. Dual card recording. This is the first dashcam I've seen that offers dual recording of up 128GB cards each! Great for anyone who needs a long video log, also you can use the other slot to backup data in case you need to make a copy for anyone on the fly.4. Support. It's also important point to consider. I've bought dashcams before where it was difficult to either find a firmware upgrade or any support from the manufacturer. It's not an issue with the unit, the manufacture constantly updates the dashcam with new firmware which you can find at mini0806 website.5. Mine came with CPL filter that helps to eliminate the glare which is another feature that rarely seen on most other dashcams. I am not sure I will use it, especially for night time recording, but it's definitely a nice option to have.NEUTRAL:1. I didn't buy it for GPS, but it does have it and it seems to work ok. Signal gets locked in about a minute on mine on good days and other days I had it start after 6 minutes so it's YMMV. I like how you can embed GPS coordinates in the video. (UPDATE: They fixed a design issue with the GPS in latest batch, so it should lock much faster now)CONS:1. Build quality 7/10. The only thing I am not too impressed at the moment. The casing creaks, buttons have cheap feeling to them when pressing  and rotation of the unit is bit difficult. SJCam 4000 that I am replacing had overall better build quality.2. A few bugs, but that's expected this being a new release. For instance, it's showing mph, but the actual speed is calculated in kmh. (Update: Fixed)3. Screen is only 1.5"" and resolution is not that great. Ok for changing settings, but reviewing videos is a painful process.NICE TO HAVE:1. I would like WiFi with apps support instead of LCD screen which is too small to use2. Higher resolution 4k would be nice with even better night time vision. Perhaps even 60 fps option.UNKNOWN:1. Reliability.2. Does it get hot? It gets warm as far as I can tell, but I can't really test it because I am in a cold climate. They did mention they improved the design by adding additional cooling vents vs older design on 0805Where to download latest firmware?I can't list links in the review, but if you search for ""mini0806 Dash Camera - Home"" you should be able to find the link to their  website, or look through comments.Why not get 0805 vs 0806?They both have identical hardware, but 0805 uses older design and has less features: different mount, no dual card recording, no CPL filter, can't mount it up side down, different lens angle 120 vs 135 viewing angle.BOTTOM LINE:As of today this is my favorite dashcam. I have been using this cam for over a month and once I mounted it I forgot it's even there. With such low profile mount I was able to mount it close to the headliner behind rear view mirror so it's completely out of my view. Other units I've considered/researched BlackVue DR600GW-HD and  SJCAM 5000+ (also with A7 Ambarella) they both offer wifi option. Both of these cams are higher priced especially DR600GW-HD at around $300 and based on the video samples I've seen it doesn't seem to offer any improvement in the IQ for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ZABJCAZZTYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S556AQU#wasThisHelpful","R13ZABJCAZZTYT","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a black version. The back is not glossy, it's matte which is perfect, however the rim around it is. The cutouts are very even and for all buttons which is the only TPU case I found so far.

"The router has nice and clean web interface albeit lacks some advanced features that you find in other routers, excellent range and decent throughput. Considering that UI is very simple looking and lacks some advance features that competing products have, I believe Dlink is targeting different crowd with this. Don't expect DD-WRT level of customization or even what Asus AC routers have to offer otherwise you'll be disappointed.I am upgrading from Netgear R7000, technically they both have identical specs in almost every aspect, except CPU. Which is slightly better on Netgear (BCM4709A vs BCM4708A). In most professional reviews Netgear and Dlink performed very similar and perhaps Dlink was close behind but in real world usage it feels quite the opposite. From my experience Dlink DIR-880L offers slightly better browsing/streaming experience, seems like the optimized the firmware better, although the throughput is marginally better on Netgear. The 5Ghz band range is about the same on both, while Dlink has a bit of advantage in 2.4Ghz band.My network consists with about 18 devices, lots of IP cams, tablets, pcs, smartphones, smart tvs two network attached storage units (QNAP), wifi thermostat that cover 2500 sq/feet. This routers performs excellent, without any need of any extenders which I had to use for my R7000 in 2.4 Ghz band.In terms of firmware the router lacks: limited to 15 rules for port forwarding/virtual server, no mac filtering, can't select type of encryption to use AES/TKIP, there probably other things that it doesn't have, but I don't have the need for those.For the price this is an excellent router and while I have above average user needs for my network this router performs well in my environment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R2JGV4XIHLSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J8NCVX4#wasThisHelpful","R1R2JGV4XIHLSX","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used Nilkin case for Z1 for a year and it was excellent, actually hold up pretty well after over a year of heavy use. Although, the case cause some wear and tear to the phone, the dust behind left imprints on plastic and the silver around the phone rubbed off a bit. With Z3, I am putting extra layer of protection to the back, but I don't think there is anything can be done to protect the sides. So back to this case. It looks like with this Z3 version they added a bit more protection on the corners, but otherwise it looks the same. I picked up brown color, but it's pretty dark and looks like black anyway. The only disappointment was when I found out the case didn't work with Sony dock, but it worked perfectly with the dock I used for Z1. Which btw was better dock anyway because you can just slide it and it fits perfectly especially with Z3.

The width is the same though, I wish it would've been slightly thicker. Another thing is I didn't care for was the ice container which is screwed to the lid and makes the lid too dip, so when you fill the jug almost to the top the part that used to attach ice container is submersed in the liquid.

"So far these worked like a charm. I put them in inside the 8x16 shed with the solar panel on the roof and they provide decent amount of light.

"UPDATE 1/6/2015: It's been a year now since I got 4 of these compact cams. Two of them used as baby cams. I bought them for $170, now you can find them as low as $100. Even though Hikvision introduced security features for the Chinese firmware cams where you have deal with firmware hacking to get English language they are still the best IP cams with rock solid firmware and excellent IQ. I have been running them on version 5.1.0 for a long time, but recently upgraded to 5.2.0 and I was surprised to see that IQ was improved at night. I also purchased other Hikvision domes and they are pretty good as well, but I still prefer these compact cams for indoor home use. Keep in mind if you purchase Chinese version and you will want to upgrade firmware it's not a straight forward process, but there are guides available in many IP cam forums.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I went through many IP cams over the years (Just sold all my Foscams) and I didn't consider this brand for a long time for one simple reason they did not have compact wifi cam until the introduced 2432. I bought one about 5 month ago to try out from Aliexpress. It has Chinese version firmware, but there are language selections and it's set to English. I didn't expect much, but after playing with it I was more then satisfied with this camera and ordered several more.Pros:Excellent IQ.Firmware is stable with lots of featuresWiFi very stable and far reaching. I have total of 5 cams running at 1080p resolution and 15 fps.Free smartphone apps! See below.POE in a WiFi cam!Wide angle at 2.8mm about 100 degrees. Excellent for indoor coverage of small rooms. It was difficult to find a compact cam with a wide angle before. Hikvsion not only offers 2.8mm, also has option for 4mm & 6mm lens as well.Microphone has excellent sensitivity. Nothing like a Foscam.Bandwidth control is excellent. You can select specific region of interest (ROI) which will produce the best IQ while compressing the rest of the image.Motion detection works flawlessly and sends out email alerts to gmail account. It only sends 3 images and you can't change that.Cons:Unable to disable front activity leds, I am using electrical tapeHikvision implemented protection starting from 5.1.2 firmware for its Chinese cams so that when you upgrade to the firmware you no longer can select any language other then Chinese. There are hacks and workarounds available however.Speaker while pretty loud, doesn't work well with two-way audio. I get echo for some reason, perhaps that could use some improvementAndroid Apps:Hikvision offers free apps for most popular mobile platforms and I am using several of them. Their free Android app (iVMS-4500) is good if you want two way audio, but the usability of that app is not great. Specifically with zooming in/out. The best Android App for this cam (and others) is Tiny Cam Viewer. Recently developer added h.264 and audio support for this cam and it works beautifully. Do not bother with IP Cam Viewer app which not only looks dated it also has performance/feed quality issues with HD cams where image quality doesn't look as good as the either Tiny Cam Viewer or native Hikvision app.Windows Mobile App (iVMS-4500)The recently added this app and it looks and works great. Unfortunately they did not add zoom functionality.Windows PC Tools (iVMS-4200)I am using this on a Windows Tablet and it i pretty good app for being free to manage/view/record all your Hikvision cams. It appears to have memory leak issues as after awhile it just slows down.The previous reviewer cons really are not cons.1. Night time image is excellent on 2432, but because it has single IR it is actually weaker then multiple IRs on Foscams, so the coverage is less. You could get external IR and you'll be amazed at the IQ.2. Email alert with gmail account works fine, Running on original firmware 5.1.03. WiFi is what sold me on this cam. It's been the most reliable and far reaching wifi. It depends on the router, so perhaps the reviewer didn't have a good rounter. I am running Netgear R7000 and I have 5 of these cams connected at different distances.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BCWDICSX8ZCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JWCV9CU#wasThisHelpful","R1BCWDICSX8ZCY","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am disappointed with this new cargo bag from Thule. Based in the picture it looks like it should hold shape, but what it is actually is just a nylon bag.

"What I was looking for is a compact humidifier that would humidify the air above me instead of entire room. There are tons of options from very cheap ones to expensive, but I really wanted one that also had an option where I can plug in any bottle to it. The advantage of that is I can fill up bunch of bottles and have them ready for the next day instead of filling up daily as I currently do even on my bigger units. Also, makes it easy to replace them when they get dirty.  So it was compact + your own bottles + made in Korea was the selling point for me.I got the unit pretty quickly and hooked it right away. It's pretty simple to use. Fill up the bottle add the attachment to the bottle and turn the knob. My initial reaction was how little steam it was generating, but after awhile the amount of steam has increased so I had to actually dial it down. In the end I was quite impressed with the amount of steam it puts out. Essentially I thought this unit would be enough to humidify the air in front of me, but it actually managed to increase humidity in a small room by 5% overnight.What I don't like is the faint blue glow, I wish there would be an option to completely turn it off. Not everyone likes to sleep with the lights on.Overall Excellent!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REP95MBPZEZQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H20ORR8#wasThisHelpful","REP95MBPZEZQQ","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an honest review from someone who has just tested a few highly rated antennas (DB4E, ANT751, HDB4X, Mohu) and this one.First, the positive, for which it gets two stars is that I really like simplistic and modern design and I really wish I could've kept it, but let me tell you the story...For years I used DB2 antenna which is ugly, but compact and it was kept indoors. I lived within 15 miles of the broadcast towers on the hill and was getting great signal for all channels I needed. I recently moved and of course that prompted me to setup antenna again, but it turned out to be not as easy task as before. My new place is within the same 15 miles, but this time it was at the bottom of the hill so I had to experiment with different spots to get the antenna to work . So, I figured it was time to test a few antennas and try out which one performs best. The short story long Winegard performed worse then cheaper antennas.In comparison to DB2 (Same as Eagle Aspen EASDTV2BUHF for $18 on Amazon) which was getting 20 channels and not even amplified this one was getting 16, ok, not bad, but that's $20 antenna vs $100 which requires amplification. I've tested it without plugging an amplifier and got only 9 channels. Bottom line, save your money, no miracles here.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BDIB3Q0QHFKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5Z3R6A#wasThisHelpful","R1BDIB3Q0QHFKT","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned 9821 V1 for a while and was looking for better options. 9826 was released a few month ago overseas and only now made it statewide at a higher premium price. 9826 is not a direct replacement of 9821, there is also 9831, but it's the only one available for sale in the US. So is this one better then 9821?PROs:1. Excellent and actually improved image quality over 9821. It has a new sensor with 960p resolution and it doesn't disappoint, there is very little noise and images are quite clean and sharp. Day or Night, looks beautiful. If you use 960p image is 4:3 format, there is option to use 720p for a wider picture.2. Improved design, overall this one looks nicer. Same size as the rest of Foscam PT cameras which is on a large side.3. Zoom lens is a nice addition, although not as wider angle lens as 9821 or especially the new 9831 (not available yet).4. I am using this as a baby cam and built-in speaker/microphone work well, but not quite as loud. Also, there is just no way to control sound levels.CONs:1. Firmware is still far from being perfect and you will run into bugs there and here and some features not fully working. Especially latest firmware where the camera would drop fps and show ghosting with IRs on. (1/2/2014 Ghosting addressed in latest beta) For recording I would probably use some 3rd party software. It's getting better though, at least they added support for ""hidden SSIDs"" with latest update.2. Same issue as 9821, but 9826 takes extra time to display picture then my other IP cams. Especially annoying when using Android apps. That doesn't matter if it's on wireless or wired. For instance it's 3 am in the morning and your baby cries, you launch the app if you are using it as a baby cam and you want to see picture immediately at night and not wait 3-4 seconds before it connects. These extra seconds are really annoying.3. No zoom presets.4. Expensive at full price. I bought it for $195 during holidays which I think is reasonable.5. QA is not very good still. I have two cameras with different hardware issues that require replacement. If you are lucky you may get a perfect one, otherwise be prepared that you might have to exchange it at your own expense.6. Zoom lens a bit noisy. Might be a concern if you are planning to use it in a baby room7. Focus is fixed and if you have a blurry picture there is no way to adjust it. It's a hardware defect that requires replacement.Issues specific to my cameras:1. My first camera exhibits strange behavior with PT angle button movements where camera stops responding when pressed. It comes back after a minute or so.2. My second camera came in defective with a blurry bottom when zoomed in and IRs on. I had to exchange for a new camera at my own expense. 1/2/2014: New Replacement arrived, again with blurry lens with IRs on and zoomed in. Waiting for resolution from Foscam.If you do buy this camera, expect you'll run into bugs with the firmware and make sure to check if you have any blurriness in the picture when using zoom and IRs on. I have 2 cameras with this defect already.I've been doing extensive research and monitoring IP camera market over the years.

"I am usually early adopter in routers, but learning from my previous experience  I've decided to hold of before trying the latest one from Asus. I waited for 4 month after release to see if they would workout any issues. Finally, I bought one last week and coincidentally they had new firmware available the same day 12/20. I've upgraded the firmware and everything seems to run excellent until the next morning when 5Ghz band degraded to unbearable performance. So back it goes.... If they can't get the most obvious basics right I have very little confidence that the rest works as intended.In comparison to Netgear R6300V2 which I currently have:RT-AC68U has external antennasRT-AC68U has nicer web interface with many options and configurationsRT-AC68U does NOT offer more range or more throughput, actually it felt lacking hereThey both have pretty much identical hardware (dual core 800Mhz, USB 3.0 etc...)I really liked admin interface, it looked modern and professional with lots of options. I might revisit it again perhaps when it's in a bargain bin with hopefully stable firmware by then. For now I would not bother wasting money on this, especially if you already have AC router.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HXOO6YS1G6R3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FB45SI4#wasThisHelpful","R2HXOO6YS1G6R3","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for home use thinking it would improve my range over existing R6300v2 router using 2.4Ghz band.  The setup was easy, although make sure you have the same firmware as the control software you are installing to save you from a headache. My unit shipped with 2.4.5, but the controller software I downloaded was the latest one 2.4.6, so I ran into all kinds of trouble, in the end I read one of the forum posts  that suggested to make sure the two matches. Once I did that, it solved all my issues and I was able to configure it easily.Now to not so special part, I really thought that Long Range would mean a long range, but I walked around with Wifi Analyzer comparing signals from my router and AP and R6300 that were placed next to each other and the both had nearly identical signal in all spots. Download speeds from NAS were unimpressive  as well, with R6300 showing much better transfer rate. So, I am not sure what people are raving about it about this being long range.I guess this has real advantage where you want to deploy multiple of these units and you can easily manage them with the interface, but one of these doesn't make any sense.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R86SXBLQF0D5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005H4CDF4#wasThisHelpful","R86SXBLQF0D5P","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned Windows RT tablet from the launch and it was quite limiting in what you can do with it, so I was holding out for a long time before upgrading to a better tablet that runs full Windows and not expensive.Initially I bought 8"" Dell Venue (which is quite popular), but quickly realized that screen size is not going to work for me while working in Windows Desktop mode. Luckily this one became available locally at MS store and i quickly made the jump. Here is what I think:PROs:Handsome looking tablet, although pretty much just like any other one with the bonus of replaceable cover/batteryFeels like a premium device, but the back appears to flex a bit.Has full size 3.0 USB port.

"I have owned 9821 V1 for a while and was looking for better options. 9826 was released a few month ago overseas and only now made it statewide at a higher premium price. 9826 is not a direct replacement of 9821, there is also 9831, but it's the only one available for sale in the US. So is this one better then 9821?PROs:1. Excellent and actually improved image quality over 9821. It has a new sensor with 960p resolution and it doesn't disappoint, there is very little noise and images are quite clean and sharp. Day or Night, looks beautiful. If you use 960p image is 4:3 format, there is option to use 720p for a wider picture.2. Improved design, overall this one looks nicer. Same size as the rest of Foscam PT cameras which is on a large side.3. Zoom lens is a nice addition, although not as wider angle lens as 9821 or especially the new 9831 (not available yet).4. I am using this as a baby cam and built-in speaker/microphone work well, but not quite as loud. Also, there is just no way to control sound levels.CONs:1. Firmware is still far from being perfect and you will run into bugs there and here and some features not fully working. Especially latest firmware where the camera would drop fps and show ghosting with IRs on. (1/2/2014 Ghosting addressed in latest beta) For recording I would probably use some 3rd party software. It's getting better though, at least they added support for ""hidden SSIDs"" with latest update.2. Same issue as 9821, but 9826 takes extra time to display picture then my other IP cams. Especially annoying when using Android apps. That doesn't matter if it's on wireless or wired. For instance it's 3 am in the morning and your baby cries, you launch the app if you are using it as a baby cam and you want to see picture immediately at night and not wait 3-4 seconds before it connects. These extra seconds are really annoying.3. No zoom presets.4. Expensive at full price. I bought it for $195 during holidays which I think is reasonable.5. QA is not very good still. I have two cameras with different hardware issues that require replacement. If you are lucky you may get a perfect one, otherwise be prepared that you might have to exchange it at your own expense.6. Zoom lens a bit noisy. Might be a concern if you are planning to use it in a baby room7. Focus is fixed and if you have a blurry picture there is no way to adjust it. It's a hardware defect that requires replacement.Issues specific to my cameras:1. My first camera exhibits strange behavior with PT angle button movements where camera stops responding when pressed. It comes back after a minute or so.2. My second camera came in defective with a blurry bottom when zoomed in and IRs on. I had to exchange for a new camera at my own expense. 1/2/2014: New Replacement arrived, again with blurry lens with IRs on and zoomed in. Waiting for resolution from Foscam.If you do buy this camera, expect you'll run into bugs with the firmware and make sure to check if you have any blurriness in the picture when using zoom and IRs on. I have 2 cameras with this defect already.I've been doing extensive research and monitoring IP camera market over the years. Tried dozen different brands at my own expense. Despite all Foscam flaws, I haven't found anything else yet that would offer same set of features and offer excellent image quality at this price, but their quality control could be hit and miss. They still have no real competition with their latest cameras specifically 9826 or 9831. I really hope someone can tell me otherwise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GJ5305NPQE3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GU0J3D4#wasThisHelpful","R3GJ5305NPQE3M","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lot has been said about this tablet already, so I won't repeat everything. It's well designed, beautiful screen, fast, light, good price point and most importantly runs full Windows 8. It can play 1080p youtube videos smoothly, I haven't seen any tablet do that in the past. Battery life is quite amazing for such a small and powerful tablet.Flash is there which I haven't seen on a tablet since Android stopped supporting it. Tried a few old school flash games and they played smoothly, but most of them require either a mouse or a keyboard to be useful.The only frustrating part which I also love is the actual Windows 8 desktop, it's just not designed for such a small screen and I find myself hitting tiny buttons several times (FYI I have average fingers). Also, keyboard doesn't automatically popup in the desktop mode, so you are required to do extra clicks to either open it or close it. Occasionally you will be stuck in full screen mode of some sort (like at the end of CNN video with ads at the end) and the only way to get back is to either click the next video and then minimize it or kill the process in the task manager. Also, got stuck in full screen Chrome and I had to kill the process as well. I just wish it had physical back button instead of Windows Metro which I don't see being used that often.Wifi is great as well and you can stream full 1080p video files from your share such as NAS smoothly.Overall, it's a wonderful device and possibilities are endless. I see it getting more use then a 7"" Android tablet that I have.I love it!FYI: The tablet name is VENUS, according to the sticker on the back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17BCMRPPNE1QR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FEE7B1I#wasThisHelpful","R17BCMRPPNE1QR","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE 10/15/2013After testing and using R7000 for about a week, I've decided to stick with R6300 V2 version. The reason behind this was there were no noticeable performance difference that's worth paying the premium price. If you already have R6300 v2 or perhaps another AC router that you bought this year, don't expect this would offer groundbreaking performance or range.Here I have comparison with R6300 V2 version:Performance/Range: Pretty much identical for regular use. I walked around the house comparing signal strength and in some cases R6300 had better signal and in other R7000, but overall they performed quite similar. An some cases R7000 showed just a bit faster connection (Mbps) at longer distances, perhaps due to external antennas, but transfer speeds (MB) were about the same as R6300.Specs: The specs are quite similar and the only difference that I noticed is the cpu on R6300V2 is 800 Mhz dual core vs R7000 1 Ghz dual core. For reference the original R6300 v1 had 600 Mhz single core. R7000 does have external antennas, but they don't really offer extra range as you might think. Perhaps it's just gives a user an option to upgrade to a higher dbi antennas.Power usage: Both use between 8-10 watts.User interface: Identical, no new features that I could see in R7000. Yes, it's easy to use and everything , but I was expecting something new. In contrast Asus RT-AC68U offers a lot more features in its UI.Noise: R7000 makes some static noise which is more noticeable then R6300, but it's only noticable within 2-3 feet from the router.Bottom line is this is a decent router and probably good for someone who wants the latest and the greatest or upgrade your aging one, but don't expect mind blowing performance over any existing routers that came out in the past year.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I currently use R6300 v2 as my main router (you can read my review in the profile) and while it's still new I really wanted to try the latest crop of high performance routers. Initially I preordered RT-AC68U, but after reading SNB test it looked like Asus still hasn't learned the lesson and still releases excellent hardware with problematic firmware. Another difference between the two RT-AC68U uses 800Mhz dual core process while R7000 has 1Ghz. Despite minor specs difference R7000 came on top in most of the benchmarks. I quickly picked on up at local brick and mortar store and was ready for a test.Initially impressions were this is quite a large router, although probably the same size as R6300 v1. The looks are subjective, and it most likely will be sitting in the closet anyway, so really doesn't matter. I really like that it has external antennas which means I could technically upgrade those if needed. Setup looked all too familiar from R6300 which is a pro and con. As a pro it was easy to setup, but on the other hand it didn't seem like offered any new features. I also noticed a few bugs on the way, but nothing major so far.I've did my usual download test from NAS to my laptop (Envy 17) at the same spot. R6300 was getting about 10 MB/sec while R7000 showing 19 Mb/sec. This looks already to a great start, but I need to wait for signal to settle until making any judgments. Even though the signal and Mbps connection showed pretty much identical to R6300. So range wise it doesn't seem like there is any improvement.Test setup: using identical settings in both routers and both are placed in the same location which is about 20 feet away through several walls. Also testing on N clients primarily, so I don't know how it performs if you use AC card yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KYLAU0BE46IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0DD0I6#wasThisHelpful","R1KYLAU0BE46IX","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been researching different toilet seat covers that would work for our 2 year old and Bemis seemed like a popular choice, but I was reluctant to buy one due to reviews about durability and that toddler seat easily gets detached. Then I found TopSeat elongated during my search which looked like it would be much better choice, but round option was no where to be found for sale. I've contacted the company directly and to my surprise they were able to sell me one directly.I got the seat very fast and upon opening the package I could tell this seat cover will last a while. It feels solidly build and the toddler seast doesn't come off (unlike in Bemis). I didn't find any instructions in the package, so it took me extra 5 minutes trying to figure out how to mount it and I actually got it wrong first time.After the seat was mounted our toddler gave it a test run and enjoyed the experience from the first try. The seat opening is just right for our tiny toddler. Unfortunately, there is no soft closing for toddler seat.  Also, I prefer seat covers with foam as this one is a bit harder to seat on, but I knew what I was getting. Perhaps there is always room for improvement.I will update this review on durability if there is any change.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K83OOW0NIXDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005QODHDC#wasThisHelpful","R2K83OOW0NIXDC","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update: 11/28/2014Handles separated on all most used pans and became unsafe to use.

Perhaps the coating is German, but everything else feels like designed in China. First of all the lids, they have cheap feeling, especially the round handle which also traps water on the inside.

"This review is for DIR-868L.UPDATED 5/24: After testing it for a few days I decided to stay with R6300, while I liked the design of 868L, web interface and feature set it just didn't deliver the same (or better) bandwidth/range as now a year old Netgear R6300.ORIGINAL REVIEWLove trying out new routers, so I bought this one so I could compare to my trusty Netgear R6300 that I owned for almost a year (you can see my review for R6300 in my profile)My needs: Improve performance for all my N clients in 2.4Ghz & 5Ghz bands. I don't own any AC clients to test the speeds.Initial thoughts:Design. I like the tube/cylinder design which is a bit unusual to see it in a router. It's difficult to compare to the size to R6300 (which is big already), but it is pretty tall and round.Performance. I setup the same settings as my Netgear and started testing various things. I've placed the router at the same location and . It's located 3-4 walls, ~27 feet on 2nd floor.- Signal strength. Good to Excellent, 4-5 bars 120-180 Mbps. R6300 is the same, but shows occasionally goes up to 300 Mbps which does make different in file transfer- HD Youtube streaming 1080p. No difference noticed in buffering or playback- Pages load the same on both routers- File transfer: Transferring 10GB file from NAS 868L averages at 6MB/sec vs R6300  at 10MB/sec.- Firmware appears to be more stable then R6300 was at lunch, but I didn't try every single feature- The 868L has dual core ARM processor which is much much faster then 600Mhz processor found in R6300, but I didn't notice any difference in performance and I do have about 20 wireless clients that some stream HD content, although not at the same time.Not so hot.- While playing with it for a few days I noticed that 868L offered shorter range and performance then R6300- Nexus 4 and some no brand tablet signal strength shows a bit lower then R6300 does using in the sapots. Also both devices constantly lost connection to 868L.Conclusion: While this router is still on revision 1.0 the performance may still be optimized in the future updates, but currently it doesn't offer any advantage over a year old AC routers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DGH0DVT5IT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9VB318#wasThisHelpful","R1DGH0DVT5IT5","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was excited to receive this camera. When I opened the box, it looked like a quality made cam, but my disappointment came later when I saw image quality. It was just below average for so called ""HD camera"". Considering the price I would probably deal with it, but then my next disappointment came when I found out there is no way to turn on/off IRs. Which basically means forget about using this camera when pointing out of the window, unless you put the tape on it. The interface itself is awful looking, although administration menu is not bad. To view camera in IE you'll need ActiveX control, so no surprises here, but for Chrome/Firefox you need QuickTime plugin which I didn't like either.

"When I go on vacation I like to bring my movies with me and since most hotels/resorts already upgraded to flat panel TVs with HDMI port this device works perfectly for travel. This unit is compact and I won't be upset if it's lost or stolen. It's not restrictive in formats it plays up to 1080p resolution.

"... but falls short in a few areasPROSHardware is beautifully simple.Easy SetupRemote while busy very functional and being able to control my tv's sound and on/off was a nice surprise.DEAL WITH ITWhile the hardware has dual core 1.2Ghz cpu the device felt a sluggish. Takes a while to boot and switching between apps is not satisfactory smoothUser interface is rough. Vizio needs learn a thing or two how to build functional user interface for big screen TVs. What's point of so much real estate when your icons are taking 1/3 of screen.Play store, while available, seems to miss bunch of apps. Specifically, I was looking for MX Player and other player apps. All were missing. I didn't bother research if I had to hack something to get them to work. Just seems like a no brainer that they should be available by defaultLimited support for file formats.

"UPDATED 1/14/2015Today this is no longer the best car DVR. The image quality is now considered subpar and reliability of the unit has been questionable, occasionally it would stop recording and require reset. I've switched to newer and cheaper unit which outperforms this for half the price Mini 0806. It doesn't have wifi, so you'll stick with LCD screen, but IQ is much improved, especially at night. If you prefer unit with wifi I would recommend SJCam 5000+. Also downgrading this review to a 3 stars.UPDATED 4/12/2013Upgraded to latest firmware 1.0.5, but didn't notice any new features or improvements. Also switched to using 32GB card and now on a few occasions it wouldn't record. I have to unplug the camera power to start recording again. WiFi feature maybe selling point, but I haven't used it in 2 month. The video feed is choppy and with delay when using live view feature. I covered silver accents with black tape, looks tacky, but at least it doesn't stand out as much now.Virus issues: There were reports that there is a virus on the sd card from this seller. I have not had this issue because I purchased this from another source, but prior to upgrade my blackvue to 1.0.3 I've actually formatted the card, so I don't know if I had the virus or not.I've been using different DVRs over the years, mostly Chinese made, this is first Korean DVR and this is the first one that actually I really like and it addressed most of my previous concerns:THE GOOD- Compact, simple, non distracting design and solid quality feel- No built-in display, it's substituted with WiFi connection to your smartphone which becomes DVR display. Love this feature! Keep in mind there is about 1-2 second delay in the live image. You can also stream live video to a browser without using any apps, simply by entering the following url in the browser (without spaces) h t t p:// 192 .168 .8 .1 / blackvue_live.cgi.- Excellent daylight quality- Low profile mount, but see cons- Parking mode motion sensor, haven't tried yet- Bunch of venting holes for hot climates, I haven't tried it in the hot weather, but it doesn't seem like it would have any issues as previous model- Voice notifications, fun to have at first, but I would rather turn them off- Extra wide angle, you will most likely see the A pillars in your car. If you turn it facing inside the car you will see the sides of the front windows which may be handy, but the image doesn't flip over.- Very easy to view your recordings on a smartphone. (I only tried Android app)- Included wire management clips, nice addon- IR sensor to turn on/off microphone. Interesting feature, but I don't see any practical use to turn off microphone.THE NOT SO PRETTY- Night quality still has plenty of room for improvement, but overall it's definetely better then most cheap DVRs I've tried- Some minor user interface glitches in the Android app, hopefully will be resolved in the future updates- A bit pricey when there are plenty of HD cameras that cost less- Silver accents are noticeable. Blackboxes should be All-Black-Boxes, but nothing that black tape or marker can't fix.- Design does not allow you to move the camera horizontally- No built in battery, there is however some sort of capacitor that serves purpose of allowing the cam to save the file correctly when there is no power.- Standard bitrate is a bit low at 7000, but with some modding (search forums) you can increase it up to 15000- I've been having mixed feelings with the mount. On one had I understand the stick on clip design, but I prefer non permanent solutions, like suction cups. Also removal of the DVR is a bit cumbersome. You have to first unplug power then click the button to unlock and only then you can remove it from the mount.- It does get warm a bit to the touch, but venting holes help to cool it down fast after powering down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IH51O8H1BHPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B4E9764#wasThisHelpful","R3IH51O8H1BHPE","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this speaker on a spur-of-the-moment Groupon deal for 1/3 of the retail price and didn't expect much out of it, but after getting one I regret not getting more for presents and here is why:- When it first arrived and I unpacked I was surprised how compact it is. I even put it my baggy pants and was walking around with it, but that's not my daily routine- It has nice rubbery surface and feels solidly build- Pairing was straightforward and I was playing music on it from my smartphone (Nexus 4) within a minute of unpacking- Although, I rarely listen music loud (I am a good neighbor) I had to crank this one up just to see how it handles and it sounded quite nice without distortion- There is no much bass, but what do you expect?- Someone reported a short battery life, so I did test of my own and I think it lasted about 4-5 hours, but that would also depend on sound levels. I'll try to do more tests- Bluetooth distance was pretty decent too. I was able to walk around 1500 sq/feet town home and the speaker didn't lose the connection even when I was on the 2nd floor- There is not much negative to say about it. Perhaps if they made the power button somewhere else other the the bottom and wish the logo would be matching colorI am amazed how much sound is packed into this size. I have Yamaha Bluetooth speaker NX-B02 from 2008 which is probably 3x the size/price of this and Bem is just as loud and clear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVRTAJPC59VS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHHYOW6#wasThisHelpful","RVRTAJPC59VS5","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The case fits RX100 just right, maybe a bit tight, but I didn't have issues with removal or inserting the caemra. It does add some bulkiness, but that's expected with this type of case. My main gripe was the closing mechanism. I was expecting this case would have a magnet, but it uses button which requires some pressure.

"6/13/2013 UPDATED entire review based on latest firmware update 1.1.1.13**REVIEW**THE GOOD:1. Video Performance is excellent due to using h264 compression. Even when on wireless and running at 720p @ 30fps I get smooth motion2. Web User Interface. Excellent! Very fast and easy to use and most importantly clean looking. You can toggle IR on/off.3. Colors appear accurate4. Excellent coverage for built in IRs.5. Wireless signal is excellent. I am about 20 feet away with several walls on the way from the router and get strong signal. There has been numerous issues with WiFi disconnection in earlier builds, but this should be addressed in .12. It also depends on the router that you are using and I have not had disconnect issues with Netgear R6300.6. Built in speaker is a nice feature to have, but see cons7. Lens angle is good at ~70 degrees, I rarely us PT feature in cameras, so extra degrees always nice to have, but extra angle come with slight distortion at the edges.8. Image masking is working well9. Works in IE/Chrome very well after downloading browser extensions.10. Setup was straightforward11. Works well with IPCamViewer for Android. Most functions can be controlled via app.12. You can upgrade lens on this camera. Although it will void warranty.13. Able to set default position after restart with the firmware update14. Using IPCamViewer for Android app and it supports all camera functions needed.15. RTSP stream is now available after firmware .11.I CAN DEAL WITH IT:1. Most important thing on any camera is the image quality and I really had high hopes for this one. Prior to the firmware update (2/1/13) I was highly disappointed with the image quality but Foscam has listened to the feedback and addressed IQ starting with firmware .10. It's not a groundbreaking improvement but for the price of this camera it's decent2. Expected from the specs, but lens is not bright enough (F2.4 aperture) for night time viewing through the window without IRs. My Zavio F3206 with F1.8 aperture can handle this much better. Obviously if you do turn IRs on the camera and try to see through the window you won't be able to see anything at all. The workaround for me was to buy external IRs (about ten bucks) and put them outside the window. (UPDATE: You can upgrade lens yourself)3. Limited video settings (can't do custom exposures) so not much image control other then color, brightness, sharpness.4. 2 LEDs in the back camera that you can't turn off. I had to put a black tape over it.5. Manual focus ring a bit difficult to turn and because there is latency on the displayed image it will take a few tries to get the picture perfectly in focus6. Zoom up/down (should be called Zoom in/out) is a bit difficult to use. You have to right click on the image and then select zoom in/out and there is no control over how much you can zoom. So you have to click 52 times (yes I counted) if you want to zoom in all the way in and again 52 times to zoom all the way out. It should really be a slider on the left where all other image control settings.7. Can't seem to purge the log it creates which is in just couple of days already at 14 pages. Clear/Reset button would've helped.8. Issues with sending motion detection emails, it works a bit better in latest update, but still needs work10. Update .10 Added mjpeg stream via url, unfortunately it's limited to VGA@15 fps.11. Camera will not work in mobile browsers (iPad, iPhone, etc...). You have to utilized apps for that.12. Camera is actually larger then most other PT cameras and I really don't like the design.13. Can't control volume on speaker or microphoneOH THE HORROR:1. Prepare to deal with the firmware issues. There are a lot of features that are either incomplete or don't work as advertised, before buying this camera visit Foscam forum to read the feedback. I am personally sticking with the camera in hopes that Foscam will address all major issues in future updates2. As of firmware update .12 & .13 camera doesn't work with hidden wireless SSID. It appears it worked in .10 update3. Camera occasionally locks upMY IP CAM BACKGROUND: I've been testing various ""HD"" (at least 1MP) IP cameras over the years from brands such as Axis, Trendnet, Edimax, Zavio, Dlink and Zyxel, but stayed away from Foscam mainly because it had low resolution sensor and awful looking web interface. Foscam changed this with the introduction of FI9821W. Overall this is an ok entry to ""HD"" PT camera for the price.SETUP: Setup itself is not much different then any other IP camera on the market. If you never done this before probably best to contact technical support to save you from frustration, but if you setup IP cameras in the past it should be no brainier. First connect the camera to the router using the Ethernet cable, insert the included CD in your PC and use the search tool to get the IP address and Port of the camera. Double clicked on the IP address found with the search tool which will open up a browser. You will need to install plugin/extension/activex control (depending on the browser) before you can see live image. Login with admin account. The rest of the settings needs to be customized to your preference and if you don't know what you are doing again I would suggest to get in touch with the technical support. At the very least you could go to wireless settings and connect to your wireless network.CONCLUSION: I think this camera will deserve a solid 4 when they finally address most of the issues. When I bought this camera I couldn't find anything else for the price with the feature and extra resolution and Foscam has been consistently releasing firmware update that addressed some of the concerns, including image quality.Review based on firmware 1.1.1.13Other cameras that I use:My current favorite camera is Zavio F3206. It has bright lens and full 1080p resolution, doesn't have IRs though or PT, but picture and bright wide angle lens make up for it. Also, I use Edimax 7110PTn & 3115n. First one is PT camera like this one, colors are not that great, but has been a solid camera for baby monitoring and cheap 3115 is actually pretty decent one too for day light indoor monitoring. Dericam H502W is a good alternative but image quality a bit lower then on FI9821.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BO4E618HGG7O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJWK5WW#wasThisHelpful","R3BO4E618HGG7O","A3F116LSHJU7YS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3F116LSHJU7YS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some reviewers have called this an air purifier, I want to be clear this is an aromatherapy diffuser, it does not process, clean, or purify the air. It is also not a humidifier, this is a tabletop device that I can grasp with one hand- despite the ironic name 'Mammoth,' and should be used to introduce pure grade essential oils into the atmosphere for space conditioning.We purchased the Mammoth Allie in Brown Wood- which is a finish, not the physical material it is made of, and this particular unit (there are several styles/shapes/tank sizes) is very easy to use. It reminds my of an onion in shape and the top half lifts off quite easy to reveal the inner tank. For the size the 4.5oz capacity is very generous and allows for up to 3.5 hours (based on our time, the brand says 3 hours) on continuous mode. The one setting continuous stream seemed a bit heavy at first, but we found that elevating the unit a little higher allowed for the best expansion of particles and aromatherapy impact. For this little unit we only introduce 1, 2 drops make of pure grade oils, per tank.While the 'wood' finish looks great in detail from anything 5 feet+ out, it is a shiny plastic frame- but thankfully no operational lights. This, paired with the fact that it will auto-shut-off once the tank is empty, makes it great for bedroom diffusion and night treatments. It is also reasonably quiet, with only a very faint bubble or gurgle heard now and then. In all, it looks great and functions well. We received a product discount in hopes we wold share our honest opinions, which we have done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NUW4562W4SZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155T3T6M#wasThisHelpful","R2NUW4562W4SZ7","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As some have noted, there are a lot of 'discount' reviews on here, which I know tends to make people skeptical. It can be frustrating when reviews do little more than repeat what the product listing says and highlight those listing points they think are most attractive. I can tell you I have used this product extensively, multiple times a day, in many scenarios, since it was delivered. While the bottom line is that I would buy it again, and even buy it as a gift, there are some things I noticed that are of note on either end of the spectrum.Using the product is indeed easy- The cord stashes away in the base with a little wheel to wrap it up. The cord, about 2.5', overall seems short but is more than ample in length to  plug it in as needed for use. Keep in mind that the base heats the water in the kettle and the kettle can be removed and used freely outside of the tethered/plugged in base, so the length of the cord is of little consequence in most instances. Keep in mind this shorter cord allows it to stash away nice and neat in the base when not in use.Simply fill the kettle with a minimum of 2 cups of water, or a maximum of just over 7 cups (there is an internal etches Max Fill line.) Set the kettle on the plugged in base and press the toggle switch down. It will illuminate orange- there is no other visual way of knowing the kettle is on. Keep in mind, for safety needs, that there is also no way of knowing the water inside has been heated once the light is off. The kettle is equipped with an automatic shut off function that is supposed to turn the unit off (flip the switch) once the water boils. I've found that this proved temperamental. It first I was filling directly to the Max Fill line and the unit ran for almost 20 minutes before I manually shut it off. The water, which takes about 7 minutes to reach boiling, was clearly boiling.After some back and forth with the brand we determined that moisture near the internal sensor was causing the auto-off switch to work temperamentally. I found, on my own, about 5 cups will boil just fine and shut off on it's own without any issue. To help ease the concerns with the auto-off on a full kettle I've been told to allow the unit to entirely air dry, open, overnight, between uses. Also, keep in mind that boiling multiple pots back to back could, potentially, cause the auto off to work wonky- though the brand assures me this is the rarest of cases.On the topic of safety- I do like that this kettle is primarily cook touch. The handle never gets warm. The base of the kettle (exterior, outside, plastic) does get warm (not hot) to the touch. One thing I do wish this kettle had was a way to lock the lid for transport and additional safety around kids. As this design stands the kettle will pour if tilted (which is needed to release steam,) but the top lid will easily pop up if the handle button is pressed.Some reviewers have noted how they love that no plastic comes in contact with their water- this is true. The stainless steel design is indeed very fluid and the stainless steel lid a great touch. I do want to note that the steam from opening the lid with the boiling water (which I'm sure would not be a common thing to do) did seem to melt the plastic on the outer rim near the hinge. And, by melt, I mean that it became tacky to the touch and took on a fingerprint imprint.This kettle is something we use daily for multiple uses- from beverages to even making instant potatoes for dinner- I love that I don't have to pull a pot out anymore, and I still have water leftover for an after dinner cup of coffee. I honestly, seldom put it away- it sits out on the counter nearly day in and out. Because we have used it so much I have noticed that our hard water has left hard water deposit build up on the very bottom of the kettle- this especially happens when the water gets below 3 or so cups.

"This is a very slick 2-way for the price- We picked this up for use with our system at work (security on the marina,) and I was initially hesitant to buy outside the company's radio system. Naturally, the handhelds we use at work are quite pricey, and only approved in pairs. I was unsure if we could get the channels working, but figured it was worth the investment, and I'd simply return it if I couldn't. This being said, it was indeed a pain to pair it with an existing channel system due to the fact that our network had a physical password and security built into it's own setup. What was required essentially was to reset the existing system and start fresh with a new network paired to each of the handhelds. However, it is possible to do so- My best suggestion for encounters like mine would be to skip the very thick, detailed (which is good, but a bit overwhelming) instruction booklet and go online. You will fairly quickly find walkthroughs and even videos for pairing different systems.Of course, that was my initial intended use, and experiment- if you are looking for campaign or recreational 2 way 'home' or 'casual' use, you will find it is a lot easier to pair frequencies and connect to a channel. It's highly unlikely you will have the advanced network protection worked into the back end of my workplace, professional, setup- in this case, follow the instructions provided with the radio (this one, not the one you want to communicate with) and you should be good to go in minutes.This radio is sold individually, which is nice because you can add it to an existing setup (again, in most cases it is easy) or buy odd numbers if needed. They really are reasonable to get an entire operation going for quite a reasonable price- I'd highly suggest them for hunting parties! This unit also comes with an earpiece- which to me is not too exciting, and just an extra bonus, a charging dock, and a built in flashlight function. The flashlight is reasonably bright and has a wide radius of reach, which pairs great with the very bright visible (3 color option) screen background.Some other functions we've enjoyed include the voice command confirmation, 128 channel capacity and dual band operation. With a PC cable it can be programmed, for more advanced needs, but none of our existing 2 way cables seem to be compatible so you would have to order one through the brand or here on Amazon. The clarity is very strong, and interference through obstructions (such as land masses and across the marina/water) is minimal. I would suggest buying an extra battery- or perhaps just another handheld unit for the cost, as the battery life seems to be a little less than the suggested 12 hours, so you would have to keep it docked for charging purposes (which seems about 2.5 hours) or swap the battery out for a 24 hour rotation.

"We've invested in a few of these now and really appreciate that they come with the bonus cutlery. We don't have children in the home, but we do watch our nieces and nephews often, and I pack lunches for myself from time to time. However, what we really buy these for are large gatherings, holiday celebrations, and meal donations. If you are involved in a church potluck or soup kitchen, these are wonderful for sending warm meals out to the many outstretched hands that come by. They are generous in size with very deep pockets and the dividers make portioning simple. With the snap on lids we find we can pre-package dozens of meals and reheat them on a moments notice.The BPA free plastic is very thick and sturdy- the base tray does not seem to flex or bench when holding onto an edge and full of food- we eat directly from them often and even reuse them. I especially like how the clear lids don't seem to get scuffed up or cloudy after cleaning. Most of my reusable food storage looks dingy after a few uses (especially with red sauces and microwaving.) These have held up quite well- though I should note they are very hot to the touch immediately after microwaving (though microwave safe.) We've also used these for freeze ahead meals- and so far only 1 in our set has cracked, which I suspect is because it was not allowed to reach room temperature before being pried open.When it comes to storing liquids, such as a sauce in one compartment, the lids do snap fairly airtight but we have noticed some spilling in transport- try to keep these upright at all times, and do not fill liquids more than 2/3 the cavity height, you shouldn't have an issue. I'm giving this for stars for the minor issue with compartment spillovers in transport (which we have avoided by filling less) and the sheer heat the containers give off to the touch after heating. I would also like to see these come in larger bulk numbers, but that's a request, not a complaint.

"We've had this for 6 weeks now and I've been very critical on it's performance and versatility in an attempt to provide the best feedback possible- when shopping I noticed many of the reviews were black or white- Either the product doesn't work with their setup or it works exactly as planned with not issues. When we first set it up we ran into a few issues others had noted- it was not immediately compatible with our Windows 10 PC, 2 of our 4 devices tested gave admin setup errors, and in one room of our home it seemed the connection would cutout inexplicably. However, the devices which did connect immediately and functioned clearly with the adapter worked beautifully without issue.Troubleshooting was my natural next step- it seemed unlikely that the device was 'faulty' when it worked so well in one room, and with certain devices while it does not work so well with others. First, I should say that the company has very quick troubleshooting assistance, though only a few of our communications solved actual issues (which were instructions errors on our part.) Outside of their troubleshooting, the unit functioned pretty much the same in each situation as it had before. Great here and on those devices, temperamental on others.While the aim of this product is not to enhance your WiFi speed, it is a natural assumption that it would increase the speed or quality of service in areas of your office or home where the WiFi from the main adapter is otherwise spotty. This being said, it did result in a triple speed boost ( 30mbps to 110mbps,) on our oldest and most difficult hardware. I am noting this hear because we did find, in testing, that it does seem to work more efficiently with equipment running on Windows 7 backwards. Our newest PC and laptops seemed to be the most temperamental, but are also the ones with the most programs and security software, etc. The only device we could not get to work fluidly (as a constant running connection for hours and days on end) is our Lenovo Yoga Pro 2. While we connected just fine, and device recognition was simple (After the Windows 10 drivers,) it just seemed to require to reconnect to the server more often than any other method of WiFi in our home.While this might discourage some- it seems the company is more than willing to troubleshoot or accept a refund/return, should the device not satisfy. We see no need to pursue that because it does work, and work exceptionally well, with our older laptops and PCs. We frequently MMORPG game which takes a lot of bandwidth on multiple devices (several people playing off our connection at once) and in one of the rooms the user used to have to re-log about ever 30 minutes. Thanks to the D-Link adapter we have a secure, stable connection to game on- which means we don't have to huddle together in the living room if we don't want.In all, it does look modern and cool (which is not exactly a reason to buy an item like this in our opinion,) and is very easy to set up, and highly compatible with any device we would want to seek a more stable and flexible connection from. However, if you are experiencing issues with new technology and hardware production post 2013, you might want to consider looking into your router as I'm not sure this will be of much help.

"I bike to work for my primary method of transportation and I regularly wear sunglasses and earbuds when biking. For me these were the perfect solution to simplify the number of things I have to pack up each day- AND they are slick enough to be worn while patrolling the marina at work. Not only can I listen to the radio, I can also accept calls while biking and walking around.When these first arrived I already knew what to expect from initial 'setup,' and the film was indeed a pain to remove, as I had to pull out the included screwdriver to remove the screws and lenses- I did try to remove the film without doing this, but there was still a portion trapped beneath the plastic frame. I have to say the biggest annoyance with these glasses is the need to use a screwdriver to simply swap between the yellow and polarized lenses. Of course, this is likely in part due to the fact that the lenses also flip up- which is a feature I love and use often.The glasses come with a case- it's pretty sturdy and basic for sunglasses bought on Amazon- it has a cheap plastic clip and is a little bulky but the overall shape protects and fits these glasses with no problem. Speaking of which, I am very happy with the compact footprint of these when folded up- they are also lightweight and comfortable to wear. However, due to the positioning of the earbud arm they are not compatible with my in car visor sunglasses clips :(The build is a fairly cheap plastic, they're definitely not designer, but they work very well for their intended purpose. There's a little bit of a learning curve on operation, as the glasses have minimal controls but several applications. I only discovered that I could use these as a remote camera shutter on my smartphone on accident! I also took a few tries to figure out how to reject incoming calls, though the audio is fairly clear in and out despite the mic being exposed to wind and surrounding noise.The earbuds could be rubberized or more comfortable in general. I don't much care for the cheap scratchy earbud cover, though they do the job. You can head the audio coming out of them when their on, which is to be expected. You can choose to wear the beds just hovering around the ear, or with the bud tilted in and resting further in the ear (though never in entirely like traditional earbuds would.) I used to have issues with my earbuds falling out due to sweat while biking, but this eliminates that problem and gives me the option of allowing surrounding sounds (such as traffic) in for safety purposes.In all, these do the job well. Sound quality was better than expected and it pairs quickly to my smartphone- One note- it does appear on my phone as a bluetooth keyboard device when scanning. Battery life is good- I've gotten just over 5 hours of continual play on a full charge. They also are easy to wear with a helmet on, and sliding in movement and sweat (on the bridge of the nose) is minimal.

"I am always looking for new knives, especially large chef style cutlery that can help process vegetables and large ingredients for family meals. I recently bought a new cutlery set and self sharpening cutting black with 3 open spaces for my own knives. That's where this chef's knife comes in- it is the perfect size for my 'Chef's knife' slot on my new block, and it has such a wonderfully natural weighting it feels like I am hardly putting any effort into cutting at all! Not to mention the blade arrived very sharp (with no sheath, so you will definitely want to have a black to house it in,) and the stainless still blade spans near 8"" with a very fine tip for precision and thin slicing. So far we've used it on potatoes, onions, pork roast, tomatoes, and leek. I cannot stress enough how comfortable this is to chop and even dice with- and the handle seems to be slip resistant, which is great when working with wet ingredients like tomatoes. I would definitely invest in more knives by this maker, and even consider gifting one!

" 1:35 Mins I've seen a lot of DIY security camera and nursery camera setups in my day, many of them running several hundreds of dollars, so I was very skeptical of the quality of this camera for the price. That being said, it had great reviews, so we decided to give it a go.Setup was easy to accomplish, once we settled the minor issue of the power cord not being long enough to keep the unit powered AND have the LAN cable reach our router....I suppose this is a freak occurrence of our house wiring and furniture setup, so it's hard to fault the camera. In the end, we solved the problem by using our own, much longer Ethernet cable. Once everything was connected properly, the app on our phone scanned the bar code on the bottom of the unit and quickly paired the camera to our viewing account.We immediately noted that multiple cameras could be viewed through the one account, and that we could even set up temporary or 'guest' passwords for remote viewing by multiple people. This is especially nice from a security or childcare perspective where multiple parties might want to access a feed. The fact that we could toggle or change the guest passwords as needed is a wonderful bonus- sometimes you have someone house sit, or such, and only want them to temporarily have access to the feed.The power cord is kind of kinky and not very pretty- however, the white color is likely the least obtrusive. Since we, personally, don't use it for security, the cord being visible isn't a huge concern to us. Others may want to use the included mount and run the power supply along the wall for long term or security use. The camera itself is not very discreet either- it's not something you'd be hiding in a plant or toy to spy on people without their knowing, and doing such would limit the mobility of the camera and feed, which is such a big selling point. It is also audible- not loud in operation, but detectable in moving. The motor makes a rather noticeable noise when turning (something the cat has already picked up on.) I like this, however, because I usually know when someone is viewing the feed.So, since it's not compact, makes a little bit of noise, and the power source is not the prettiest- the camera itself actually makes up for those things ten-fold in ease of use, clarity of image, and an intuitive app. We were immediately impressed by the clarity of the live feed, and even still images, or recorded video. In fact, my father, who has a very expensive home monitoring system is looking into installing a few of these. He says they ""trump the company's surveillance feed by a long shot.""One thing I do wish I could do sometimes is pan the camera down just a little bit more....but mounting would surely fix this problem. Until I invest in a few more I like being able to 'plug and play' from one room to the next, so it is what it is. The camera, otherwise, does nearly a 360, so we try to face it in a corner to sweep down the hall and into the two major rooms of our house.While you can set the camera to motion detect, and even record (to SD or to your app) it will only record in 30 minute chunks- That is the smallest time period it will record upon sensing an 'incident.' Using the app remotely is intuitive and a breeze, however, simply swipe the screen up or down, left or right, to watch the camera pan in real time. We notice about a 5-7 second delay on image transmission to the app screen. This is not a big deal in most cases, but would not make it suitable for especially young infants, where choking and time to react would be of the highest importance. For all other monitoring needs it is more than acceptable in our opinion.Through the app you can toggle live sound feed on/off and even talk through a microphone on the camera. I have actually held conversations with people in our home from  remote location. It's not exactly Skyping but the image is clear and the audio works to communicate. My main issue there is that the feedback from my voice is very obnoxious and loud on my end (and muffled,) but, clear coming out of the camera.We use this camera a LOT for night streaming- Often I'll hear something crash on the opposite end of the house, and, instead of getting up can flip to the feed and see it's just the cat. The video is very sharp, and I can easily capture stills that are highly legible. In all, we couldn't be more pleased with this unit. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to add home security without complicated operation or setup, and flexibility of use. It is great to be able to keep an eye on our home from anywhere with our smartphone! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"We chose this photo prop set mainly for the quantity of props and the variety- we loved how colorful so many of the props were. We mainly intended on using them for school carnivals with the kids as they go very well with a face painting station. To set a little photo station up we took a big cardboard box (Think refrigerator or water heater) and clipped some fabric to it for our background. We then laid out all of the props and let the kids go to town. With 'digital' film the possibilities are endless and the kids really love hamming it in front of a camera. Here are our observations about this set. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.*The props were very easy to punch out of the sheets. There were no issues with tearing and the perforation was clear and defined.*There are 2 pipes in this set. One is attached to a goatee- we cut the pipe off of the goatee as, personally, it wasn't appropriate for the kids.*You will have to assemble this props, glue is included but in our opinion not the best method for attaching the props to the included sticks. I would suggest using a piece of tape across the stick, and overlapping onto the prop. This seems to offer the most secure option, but is not the easiest when dealing with the smaller props. For smaller props with thinner edges, we used hot glue. Only a few of our props came apart after an afternoon of rough kids. Even then only a reattachment was necessary.*As far as the sticks go, we found them sturdy enough to support even the larger props, but a bit on the short end, even for the kids. We wished the sticks were a little longer.*The prop sizing is just right, a little over-sized for the kids, which makes it comically hilarious, and just right for the adults.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R262AG8V4MWZID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OURTXIO#wasThisHelpful","R262AG8V4MWZID","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We own over a dozen different cutting boards from butcher blocks and traditional bamboo boards to decorative and polypropylene boards. They all serve various purposes. The thought behind acquiring this one was the slender depth (which will store well between appliances or even hanging on the wall, and the convenient handle, which can aid in transport when we take our 'cooking show' on the go. We do a lot of cooking at friends and family's houses during various entertaining events and having a light weight, yet durable, cutting board is essential.As far as bamboo boards go this is pretty basic- We loved the generous size/footprint, which allows for the processing and storage of large quantities of ingredients all at once. The outer edge is lined with a divot that acts as a drip catcher for juices. It is not too deep, though, so you will still want to rinse it off now and then- take note the etched border only appears on one side, so make note of which you prefer to use for your meats or fruits/veggies and use that as a reminder.We noticed this cutting board is fairly resistant to staining- typically some of my cheaper bamboo boards seem more porous and tend to absorb colors from fruit juices. While I haven't noticed any accumulation of stains yet you can easily care for your bamboo board by sprinkling some coarse salt on it and scrubbing with a lemon half. This will usually remove the majority of staining (while acting as an antiseptic.) We also noticed very little splintering or separation from the bamboo swelling on the first few washes, which usually indicates a high quality cutting board.

" 3:48 MinsI wasn't quite sure what applications I would have for this product when I invested in it, but I knew that it was something I'd find use for, if I had it around. It's just that sort of unique crafting product that is there when you need a unique, truly one of a kind, gift. While I think I'll be using it primarily to play around with miniatures and action figure/model molding, I could see someone using this to craft jewelry pendants, earrings and such.Do not expect to pick it up and be able to use ti right away- While the instructions are pretty straight forward, you will want to have a candy thermometer on hand to measure your water, as well as a cup of cold water for your fingertips and hard setting, as well as containers that do NOT ever touch food. While the product advertises itself as biodegradable I do not want to be ingesting it and when the product is superheated it WILL stick to the interior surfaces of pots and pans. We thought we had our pyrex measuring cup thoroughly cleaned and the next time I poured cold water into it a bunch of plastic flakes came bubbling up to the top! I suggest investing in a cheap muffin pan where you can pour the hot water in (since it is heat resistant) and 'melt' several small portions in different colors all at once- and even have a reserve for cold/fingertip water.My next tip is to go slow- a little goes a VERY long way. The great news is, it's pretty much impossible to waste the product because you CAN always reheat it and mold it again. Keep in mind that a thick mass of the material, hardened, will take longer to soften, and not soften as evenly, as the tiny equal pellets.This took me 2 attempts to get the hang of, as I initially didn't heat the water enough to melt the pellets- You will notice right away the pellets becoming translucent if you have the right temperature. Your water should not be actively steaming (if it is, it is too hot to handle and you should allow it to sit a moment before reaching in as the pellets will stick to your hands and the container/vessel.) Daub your fingers in the cold water prior to manipulating the product and don't be afraid to re-submerge part of your creation in the hot water to allow it to become more pliable once gain.While the product does seem indestructible, I have to say that I found adhering the different pieces was easy when warm, but not so strong in the long term. My poor minion's glasses busted off with the first good fall :( I'd love to see more tutorials and tips to help work with smaller or detail pieces. If you have traditional vinyl working tools, they will help with etching and some shaping and are worth investing in if you plan on playing with the product again and again. One thing I'm not sure about is how the company plans on selling more product, since it is so easy to re-purpose and reuse from one project to the next!Oh, and a bit of insight, the black, blue, and purple pellets all look the same- I'd like to see the company put an identifier on the vial (such as a colored cap or sticker) so it's not so hard to differentiate between them.

"I have mixed feelings about this one, because I think the name and the concept is really cool for beer enthusiasts, but the execution is not so much for the casual drinker. That is to say I wonder if these will become more of a conversation piece than functioning tool in my entertaining line-up.First impression is that these would have angered me for the 'original retail of $35,' but they are fairly reasonable for the current (at time of this review) $11 asking price. With the holiday gifting season fast approaching these have viable use as a novelty gift that is also functional, to a point. That is to say these are in fact Stainless Steel outer shells to a cheap foam can koozie inside. The bottom is made with the thinnest of the foams present in the product, which I fear will fray quite quick with the rough use of my friends, and outdoor use (by the pool, whatnot.) However, the open/light bottom does allow for air flow and make it easier to clean the product- just note all moisture wicking dos eventually begin to drip down through the hole in base.As far as sizing, these do work with standard cans, tall cans, and bottles. Bottles seem to have a bit of 'slosh' room, but not enough to make them top heavy or tippable. The stainless steel surface is slick (but, obviously, collects oily fingerprints quick.) I was a bit disappointed by the readability of the logo- I thought it would be etched, but it's more 'brushed' on. The logo isn't quite centered (a little crooked) on one, and I do wish the 'Beer Keg' was more legible, because that really doe add to the novelty value of an item like this.Does it help keep cold beer cold- In my opinion, yes. More so than a traditional can koozie sleeve? No. In fact, tighter 'shell' like koozies seem to work a little bit better, but, again, I consider this a novelty item for a beer lover or entertainer, so it's not a big issue for me. It's my personal opinion that anything over $15 for these would mark it at 3 stars, but the current price is a good value for the functionality and build, thus landing it a 4 star status.

"We aren't really what you'd call Big Bang fans, but we'd seen this around the net in various memes, and I've always thought this was one of those 'If I could put it on a bumper sticker,' type things. When I saw this 2 sided shirt I was stoked to see it came in 'fluffy' sizes. As a 5'9"" 240lb male I typically by 2xl shirts; which are often $5+ more expensive for the 'extra sizing.' This shirt was the same price for a small as a 2xl #winAs far as fit, it is a little narrow around the waist than what I normally wear, but not tight by any means. I think this is due in part to the nice (thicker yet soft) material. I was also happy to see that the screen printing was the nice 'thicker' layered kind, yet didn't peel or tear during wear. The inner neck has a tag-less label that reads 'Big Bang Theory,' and the quality is exactly what I would expect for official merchandise. As far as the screen printing, we can't see any deviation in alignment, the words on the back seem to run straight, and centered, on my back.This has been a great buy and remains a shirt I get plenty of compliments on!

"Originally I found the idea of these a bit niche- I don't go around dropping GoPros in coral reefs or precarious places (like off bridges) so I don't have an everyday application for them. Then Jay (who works as a security guard at a marina) dropped his $500 phone off the docks while trying to tie up a wayward board, while on the clock. Even a Lifeproof case cannot stop life when the tide is rolling and you've got 30'+ of sea-foam green water. So, we initially invested in these for use with the Lifeproof case-I have to say I wish these had some sort of application for smartphones (IE came bundled with even a cheap sleeve) style waterproof case for modern smartphones, because they have proven themselves so useful. Yes, they are bulky, but they do not hinder his work, and are only in use while out ON the water, and they attach to pretty much anything with a loop- including the 2 Way Radio handsets. They are also very bright, which make them easy to spot, even at a distance (say when the water is carrying precious electronics away) and can also be added to the dock key ring to make the duggie stick or keys floatable in a pinch. We've even found application to throw something out to someone on the water where this made the item easy to skim off the water.Naturally, where these will come in most handy is for recreational users (vacationers, those with a pool, those who camp.) In fact, I used these heavily on my recent cruise with my water proof camera (And even to help strap my camera to my person while ziplining!) The extra wide, soft, foam strap is very light and easy to wear for extended periods (say leaning over a cruise ship in a glacier inlet?) I could barely feel my hands while on deck, half the time, and knowing that my camera would be easily spotted if it (or I) went over board was great for piece of mind. Of course these also came in use while in the solarium pool, on deck.I've dropped phones and cameras in the water enough by now, with these straps on, to feel confident. The first few times (for testing purposes) I didn't want to let go of the strap- but I'm reassured that these are indeed going to hold my camera/phone up (we've tested up to 9oz, without issue- and have found we can use BOTH straps on one device to support more weight, if needed. In all, these are a great investment to keep on board of you boat or vacation near water- for the price, why not have the option to protect your gear around water? ** I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

" 3:48 MinsI wasn't quite sure what applications I would have for this product when I invested in it, but I knew that it was something I'd find use for, if I had it around. It's just that sort of unique crafting product that is there when you need a unique, truly one of a kind, gift. While I think I'll be using it primarily to play around with miniatures and action figure/model molding, I could see someone using this to craft jewelry pendants, earrings and such.Do not expect to pick it up and be able to use ti right away- While the instructions are pretty straight forward, you will want to have a candy thermometer on hand to measure your water, as well as a cup of cold water for your fingertips and hard setting, as well as containers that do NOT ever touch food. While the product advertises itself as biodegradable I do not want to be ingesting it and when the product is superheated it WILL stick to the interior surfaces of pots and pans. We thought we had our pyrex measuring cup thoroughly cleaned and the next time I poured cold water into it a bunch of plastic flakes came bubbling up to the top! I suggest investing in a cheap muffin pan where you can pour the hot water in (since it is heat resistant) and 'melt' several small portions in different colors all at once- and even have a reserve for cold/fingertip water.My next tip is to go slow- a little goes a VERY long way. The great news is, it's pretty much impossible to waste the product because you CAN always reheat it and mold it again. Keep in mind that a thick mass of the material, hardened, will take longer to soften, and not soften as evenly, as the tiny equal pellets.This took me 2 attempts to get the hang of, as I initially didn't heat the water enough to melt the pellets- You will notice right away the pellets becoming translucent if you have the right temperature. Your water should not be actively steaming (if it is, it is too hot to handle and you should allow it to sit a moment before reaching in as the pellets will stick to your hands and the container/vessel.) Daub your fingers in the cold water prior to manipulating the product and don't be afraid to re-submerge part of your creation in the hot water to allow it to become more pliable once gain.While the product does seem indestructible, I have to say that I found adhering the different pieces was easy when warm, but not so strong in the long term. My poor minion's glasses busted off with the first good fall :( I'd love to see more tutorials and tips to help work with smaller or detail pieces. If you have traditional vinyl working tools, they will help with etching and some shaping and are worth investing in if you plan on playing with the product again and again. One thing I'm not sure about is how the company plans on selling more product, since it is so easy to re-purpose and reuse from one project to the next!Oh, and a bit of insight, the black, blue, and purple pellets all look the same- I'd like to see the company put an identifier on the vial (such as a colored cap or sticker) so it's not so hard to differentiate between them.

"First of all, I want to say, for the current list price (At time of this review, $12.99) this product is a bargain. If the only thing it did successfully was play clear music through the car stereo via Bluetooth connection, I would find it worth it's price. That being said, it does also allow for Bluetooth calling through your car stereo, a feature that is, perhaps, a little less effective (more on that later) but still functional and an added value for older cars, or cars with failing Bluetooth systems.I have to say I haven't used an FM transmitter since my 1985 Chrysler LeBaron, and I am always amazed by how few people know these exist. To put it plainly, if your car has no Bluetooth capability, this is how you can stream audio files (like radio, phone calls, MP3s) from any Bluetooth capable device (MP3 players, tablets, smartphones.)You can indeed set it up straight out of the (minimal) packaging- but I had  'duh' moment when I realized I couldn't have the transmitter paired to my Bluetooth device AND change the transmission frequency/station at the same time. The default is 87.5FM, and my car does not read below 87.7. It took me a while to realize I had to un-pair my phone and the transmitter to use the buttons to toggle the station pre-set. If paired the buttons will only make or decline calls, change the frequency volume, and switch through tracks.To help adjust the clarity of the unit you can range the transmission volume/frequency down and up 1-30. Find a clarity that is sharp, then adjust the volumne on your car stereo directly to the desired listening volume.The LCD display on the front is very easy to read in just about every lighting situation, even direct with the moon roof back, and there are a few simple features that add bonus functionality to the device such as the ability to angle it at any direction (to fit within your car's console/dash) configuration, and dual USB ports so that you can still charge from the cigarette lighter port while using the transmitter. As far as making 'hands free' calls, yes you can talk through the stereo system, thanks to a mic receiver on the front of the device, but you will have to fumble with the small buttons on the end to accept or end the call.I have had a few accidental hangups (Whoops) because the buttons are so small and so close. In addition, my cigarette lighter is located very low on the passenger's side and the mic picks up a decent amount of interference. It is usable in a pinch (an important call comes in while driving and streaming music) but I wouldn't choose to use it as a Bluetooth call device in any other scenario.Again, this was easy to set up and use out of the package (instruction included but not needed in the end,) and works great as an FM transmitter. I love listening to my Amazon Prime library while cruising around town- it's so nice not to have to listen to commercials on the radio anymore. Even better, the clarity is sometimes sharper than the local radio station! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"It's hard to fault this as anything other than what it is advertised as- a 'flexible' (it's in the product description) PVC magnifier lens. This means it will bend and distort if not held with both hands, or in a structured grip. It also does not have any form of lighting system, as it is intended to be an easy to store magnifier one would keep in a magazine, book, map guide, or stashed in a purse. It does just that with magnification of up to 3X (which is not a tremendous amount, but  practical everyday use amount) and suitable for very fine text, or in addition to the use of corrective lenses. That is to say it will not replace your reading glasses.Hold the magnifier .5 to no more than 5"" away from the surface you are trying to read, while ensuring it is flat to minimize distortion or disruption. We found that about 4"" is the sweet spot for maximum magnification with total sharpness/clarity. We especially enjoyed the black border around the outer rim, which helps define the beginning and end of magnification- We have had others without borders and it becomes a pain to keep track of your reading place without the flat, defined, edge.This is a very portable, lightweight yet durable, magnifier we keep with the magazine pile. I am looking at buying another for my grandparent's who travel a lot and often have trouble consulting menus and maps while on vacation. For those wondering, this material could be trimmed to pocket or credit card/wallet sizes if desired- fairly easy- just be sure to sand or tape the edges, which can be quite sharp when cut.

"We've recently begun cutting dairy out of our excess diet and it's been a challenge to find dessert or snacking options that excite the sweet tooth while still satisfying. Popsicles have been the solution- In particular coconut or almond milk with crushed OREOs- pure heaven! But I digress- In the past we have had to store glass tumblers in our freezer door to help our popsicle molds set- and that sometimes led to a big mess then the pressure of squeezing them all into a glass caused the caps to burst (never fill your popsicles higher than 1.5"" below the rim.)While I could go without the funky swirl coloring, it is nice to have each one be a different flavor as it cuts down on arguing with the kids and even allows for multiple flavors/variations with easy exterior identification. The stand included in this set is a must have- I searched high and low on Amazon for a stand for this style of popsicle mold and only found one option sold by itself. Save yourself time, effort, and money and invest in a set like this so you are good to go immediately. That being said, this stand is a little tricky to clean, and the plastic concerns me as far as wear and deterioration being pulled in and out of the freezer (extreme temperatures.) We did have ours fall once and the weight of the frozen pops combined with the force left a small crack in the corner.The molds themselves are standard (compared to my 2 other sets by 2 different brands,) I find Sunsella has the deepest lids, but these are just deep enough to eliminate spilling in the event they are tipped- and these can be frozen at an angle or on their side (which we do to make half/half popsicles sometimes.) The lids are a little bit of a pain to clean so I suggest soaking the entire mold and you will want to invest in a wire brush to get down to the very inner tip. Cleaning these with any cream based pop is more difficult than juice or sugar based options. Regardless, the fact that the lids are attached to the molds is truly the best park of this product. We've lost 4/12 of our lids on OTHER brand's sets, so this really does extend the live of the product, and even add reuse-ability for homes with kids who may not eat an entire portion in one sitting.

"Note: I am not a medical professional and nothing contained below should be considered medical advice, these are merely my honest insights and personal experiences.I have suffered from Lactose intolerance since I was a pre-teen, to the point I have gone portions of my life without dairy at all. While there are several options to help ease Lactose intolerance (daily pills with extended 12-24 hour relief, and capsules that are taken just prior to eating,) the price range varies dramatically. Which is funny because most of them have identical ingredients- it's only the brand name or method of application, (capsules, tablets, chewables,) that changes.Keeping up with this condition can be costly, unless you intend to cut lactose out of your diet entirely- and symptoms and severity vary from one person to the next. For me, I have never been in the position to drop $35 a month on the daily pills that offer freedom of eating whatever I want, whenever I want it. Having a tablet such as this, where I can take 1 or 2 prior to dairy consumption, is economical and logical for me. With 180 tablets, even if I take the maximum suggested dose of 2, that's over a 3 months supply for me (closer to 4 or 5.)However, like I mentioned, severity of symptoms does matter- Keep in mind the single tablet dosage of this product is 3000 FCC ALU of the Lactase enzyme. A typical dosage is actually 6000-9000, so if you are taking just one, you might not see much relief if your symptoms re severe or your diagnosis is fresh. Keep in mind that people who regularly eat dairy with lactose intolerance my also build natural lactase production and naturally decrease the severity of symptoms over time. I, personally, have been taking 2 immediately before ingesting lactose heavy products.My original intolerance was classified as severe- through the years the symptoms have lessened but not to the point that I would willingly consume lactose without some sort of enzyme support. The results would be quite interuptive and even painful the following day. These tablets do just what I nee and have replaced a bigger name brand on my shelf (the ingredients are identical!) which saves me money. I also like how easy these tablets are to take, it really is a no brainer for those suffering from lactose intolerance.

"Jenna here- These are $9 fashion sunglasses, and you should expect such when ordering them- Personally, I like that because I need a wide range of fashion frames for various occasions where kids or potentially extreme activities are involved. I don't want to wear my $130 frames, for example, somewhere where they might be damaged, lost, or forgotten. These are just the trick for a day at the theme park and, while the plastic frame is thick and this can make it feel on the cheaper side, I also feel the plastic frame will hold up to more abuse and makes for the perfect pair of thrashers.The lenses themselves are actually of seemingly higher quality than the frame itself, and block out the sun quite well with a moderate tinting effect. I can read crisp and clear with them on, and they are great for driving.The main drawback for me is I have a wider temple and they tend to feel tight when worn for several hours on end- and don't enjoy staying put on my head when pulled up and rested on my hairline. I store these by hanging them off my tank, or in my purse as a result.The little rhinestone detailing is quite cute and, despite skepticism as to how long they will stay put without falling off, the little gem detailing seems to still be quite in tact. Overall the design/style is very cute and, in my opinion, worth the current $9 asking price- I would, however, like to see them a little wider in the bridge.

"A lot of my friends and family only know Matcha from modern day coffee house beverages, or 'green tea' ice cream after a sushi dinner. For a while now I have been trying to explain the textural and palette difference in REAL quality matcha flavor and tea. A true green tea powder will often demand a pretty penny and appear fine ground (almost like a corn starch or confectioner's sugar) and have a beautiful leafy green hue. The aroma should be slightly sweet but pungent and just a little is required to make a 'shot' of usucha.This is NOT a product for baking- though one could certainly do so with great results, you will be spending an arm and a leg and the true richness of the genuine green tea powder will likely by lost and baked off (a true shame.) This is a matcha for drinking, and should be done with room temperature to luke warm water (never hot, as you will burn the tea and ruin the flavor, giving it bitter notes.) I personally prefer a few drops of of coconut milk in my koicha. For a foamy product you can use a small battery operated frother, or a super fine mini wooden whisk- stainless steel manual whisks tend to leave the matcha flat.In all, this is a true treat- Kenko has brought me back to treasured memories of sipping koicha in the sun room of my school-mate's obaasan. I am grateful to have had the chance to try this product at a discount, and will be ordering more quite soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKLXW2H8ZEU4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V9FJZMY#wasThisHelpful","RKLXW2H8ZEU4T","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product seams (pun intended) to get poor reviews for quite glaring manufacturing issues in defective products. I can't say we recieved a defective product, so I can only speak to our experience, though it does appear it might be a gamble. I can only hope the customer service is good and quick in replacing the item if needed, as the 2"" patch really won't do much but repair tiny punctures (as from small rocks or thorns.)It should also be noted that the ball, inflated, is closer to 32"" in diameter- and comes closest to 48"" uninflated and flat. It's still quite big and fun, but a good foot short of what most might expect based on the product title and description.If you're wondering can this be inflated by mouth? Sure, it can. It took a healthy adult 70 full breaths and about 15 minutes to fully inflate. Be warned, the spout is on the larger side and a it's bit of a pain to open the valve. My fingers got sore from pinching long before my lungs got tired of blowing. Personally, I'd suggest an air compressor with wide nozzle, but it certainly is possible to fill it with lungs alone, and not pass out :)Note: You will likely never see it taught/inflated full. We were able to get it quite full but the process of closing the valve does allow are to escape and it seems air does/is slowly (and I mean minuscule) leaking over days and time (which could be due to heat and expansion.) Regardless, it retains it's bounce and buoyancy- and flies through the air with ease. In fact, we like to keep it a little softer so the small hands can grab and grip it easier- otherwise it goes flying in all directions when a kid tries to pick it up!We bought this not for a pool or the beach so I was a bit worried about the potential for puncture, as we wanted to use it outdoors for the daycare kids to play with during active outdoor time. So far it has survived several hours of outdoor play with some pretty rowdy kids ranging ages 4-12. It's flown into bushes, even bounced on the ground, and even had children lie across it. I think, like most inflated things, it will have a shelf life depending on how it is treated. Accidents happen, especially with kids and inflatables, and I already feel I've gotten my money's worth with the many uses and hours on end of play we've gotten from it so far.

"There has been some debate as to whether this looks like a lion head or not- It's my best opinion that it does when fitted to the right size animal or a short hair cat. Yes, the hair is not as fluffy a 'mane' as one might like, but keep in mind that this is intended to go on a pet's head and is fairly warm/weighted/thick already. I'd also be concerned with pets who might spook or flail with this if the hair was much longer who knows what it could catch on! That being said, here are my thoughts:*This is advertised as a cat/dog hat- so keep that in mind, that (if it is intended to fit a cat, it is intended to fit small dogs.) The measurements are accurate and t fastens by a 2.5"" velcro strip under the chin. While you likely could get this to fasten on a medium breed dog with a slender face I think it will look a bit silly and less like a lion, as one reviewer noted.*As far as fit- We tried this on our 10lb indoor adult cat- it fit her better than the 4.5lb Maltese dog (she's all hair.) I had to fasten this at the very edge (Tightest) of the velcro strap and even then it seemed to move/slide quite a bit on the dog. With the cat it was snug and secure and even in rolling and rubbing stayed put quite well.*It's built well, except our left ear seems to be inverted/turned a little outward so it looks a little silly from different angles. I wish the ears with both forward facing but I'll assume this was a factory error- it doesn't detract from the hood too much. Otherwise the material and sewing is great- it is warm enough to wear Trick-Or-Treating or for just a fabulous evening about town. The inner fleece-like liner tends to slip forward and make itself visible now and then, so you may want to ensure this is all the way tucked back before strapping it on.*Some pet hoods/hats have a tendency to come down too far in the back and obstruct leash/collar/harness performance. We were pleased to note that this is cut a little high in the back so you can efficiently walk your dog without any issues.*Not really a review note but as a tip- Expect cats to 'freeze' when clothed, especially when their ears are covered. IF you plan on getting photos of a cat that isn't pissed off then you will want to ease the cat into wearing the hood by placing it on the cat for a few minutes, several times a day, over several days, and reward the cat with treats upon removal. Dogs who are not used to wearing costumes/clothes will likely have the opposite reaction and want to flail about to knock it off. The Velcro is secure but also (which is good for safety) able to be removed or pulled off by the pet in an emergency.We received a discount, but paid more than a few cents or dollars, in hopes we would share our honest thoughts, which we have done.

"I've wanted a donut pan for quite a long time but am limited to the amount of storage space in my kitchen since I tend to go a little wild with crazy pans and molds for special occasions I'll only use once.... This donut pan was a great investment but now it has me wanting to invest in a literal 'pan' from one of the more established kitchenware brands. Don't get me wrong, there are many great uses for silicone baking bake this produces full sized donuts and can get a little flimsy when full of hot baked donuts and has had a few issues, over 8 baking cycles so far, with cleaning even. There are an overwhelming number of glowing reviews, maybe because it does what it is supposed to and people are simply so tickled to be making donuts at home? But it's not without some things worthy of note:*This silicone donut mold is freezer safe and good for temperatures up to 450F- In our experiences anything over 400F has caused non stick agents to bake onto the silicone. This created a slick grease layer that doesn't really soak off but can be scraped off with a Brillo or fingernail.*It performs wonderful in the freezer with no issues no stick wise....Out of the oven with several various types of batters I've lost some chunks in even fully cooled donuts. We did find that a light flour dusting has proven most useful on this particular pan. Clean and dry it thoroughly between batches or invest in 2-3 to allot for full size batches.*It's silicone and fairly long so it doesn't have much rigidity when handling the wet batter and taking the hot donuts out of the oven. Always handle the silicone baking pan on top of a cookie sheet or baking pan for safety.*The mold/pan has discolored a little (brown) since the initial use but it is overall still quite operational. As I said, it works and does the job but I think I'll be investing in a more substantial traditional style pan since I plan on making many more donuts!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAQFJUWTQQST9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01370MS18#wasThisHelpful","RAQFJUWTQQST9","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This particular press is great for those new to the concept of French Pressing as it is simple to operate and offers flexibility in serving portions (with a maximum of 8C/ 4 coffee mugs output.)Our first french press was made with chrome accents which looked slick for about 2 washes, the stainless steel frame of this press not only keep the device looking great wash after wash, but also allow the glass beaker to slide out for easier washing. Another nice feature you don't always see on entry level presses is the plastic lid liner which prevents the coffee from coming in direct contact with the stainless steel when pouring, and protects your fingertips from the heat.As far as french presses go, this one if very straight forward, but the American conversions seem to be missing from the internal messaging/instructions. While you will want to adjust the grounds based on your blend and desired strength, in general you should aim to use about 4-5 TBS of grounds. Place the grounds at the bottom of the empty glass beaker then add about 3/4 C hot water and stir (you will want to use an iced tea spoon or wooden utensil to get to the bottom and properly agitate the grounds.) Next, add the remainder of the water (approximately 2.5C) to the beaker, stirring again, and allow the mixture to sit for about 4 minutes. When you are ready to serve plunge the press downward to strain the grounds and allow for a smooth coffee experience.We were quite pleased with the double screen filter and it's ability to keep, even finely ground, coffee grounds out of our cup. The result was an exceptionally smooth drinking experience, and the resulting cleanup was equally simple. However, after several uses we have noticed the plastic handle seems to require some tightening, thus our 4/5 star reviews. This is simple enough to fix, but not something you'd see with higher end units after such few uses.In all we are very pleased with the coffee quality and easy of use for the price. This has proved to be one of the easier to clean units with have owned, and the conversion issue is a minor note for anyone who has brewed French Press style before (especially giving that the perfect cup of coffee is more of an art than a science.) I received a product discount in hopes I would share my honest thoughts, which I have done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIUP0C8ZPZNXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012XXPN4E#wasThisHelpful","RIUP0C8ZPZNXT","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were a little skeptical when ordering this, simply because there weren't very many reviews and there were a lot of similar styles and brands to choose from on Amazon. We needed something to tote around selfie sticks, cameras, sunglasses, passports, Sd Cards and more while on our Alaskan/Canada cruise and the number of pockets and pouches, along with the compact size and one shoulder use, was very appealing.When this arrived we were fairly impressed with the build and material quality. It is very lightweight when empty, but the seams are are quite reinforced and the numerous zippers and latches keep your things in place so they are easy to locate when you need them, and secure when you don't. One thing we did quickly note, however, is there is no pouch to store/hold a water bottle. You will notice in photos there is a side pouch that looks like a drawstring bottle holder but it really only fits a sunglasses case or smaller smartphone.The overall visual styling is pretty slick and something we didn't feel geeky about while toting around as tourists. It actually complimented the majority of our accessories and clothing and was unlike an of the other bags and totes going through ship security daily- so it always stood out.There's over 12 pouches/pockets/cubbies to organize and stash stuff in with this tote ranging from the largest main bag compartment to very tiny zipper pouches on the inner flap. In addition the main flap (which folds over the front and clips in) is a secondary security for the inner compartments which have their own zippers. This was especially great for keeping our contents secure when we needed to retrieve something from one pocket without having to open or exposure the valuable electronics in another. We cannot speak enough to the utility purposes of this tactical bag.The main chest strap is also very wide and well reinforced with stitched detailing, again adding to the tactical appeal and styling, while making it very comfortable to wear (even full) for long periods. We especially liked how easy it was to sling down from the back to the front with minimal maneuvering. This made access in tight crowded spaces quick and efficient. Not only did this hold up through extensive daily use of slinging, zipping/unzipping, clipping/unclipping, and extreme weather (including rain with impressive waterproofing) we have yet to note a seam begin to give or a zipper begin to stick. This was a great buy and we are thrilled we had the chance to review it in exchange for a small product discount.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TTMJIOY2SB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01204TCYI#wasThisHelpful","R2TTMJIOY2SB7","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite being available through Prime this took weeks to arrive to my house as there seemed to be an inventory issue at the time I ordered; this wouldn't really be worth nothing if it weren't for the fact that the nature of this product is something that people might be buying out of immediate need and hoping to have in hand within a few days to repair something in particular. If you are looking to have this laying around for general occasions, then the slow Prime shipping shouldn't really impact you.Let me start by saying that I was impressed with the storage case this came in and the slick design of the actual product. This being said, the next thing I noticed was the extensive, very fine, print and warnings included. You have your basic 'don't point the LED in your eyes' but there are also a lot of cautions about the liquid product becoming aerated and to only use this in a heavily ventilated area (which can be hard to remember since there is no offensive odor.) In addition, you will want to wear gloves and work over a disposable drop cloth/surface because there are numerous warnings about how to clean up after spills or skin contact.As it turns out the day after this came in the arm of my glasses ripped off the frame and I had a perfect opportunity to give it a try. General use is pretty simple, clean the surfaces you wish to adhere by sanding and wiping, then apply the Bondic solution to bridge the gab between the broken halves/pieces and apply the mounted UV LED light directly to the seam for 5-10 seconds. Bondic works by primarily bridging the gab between two halves/a seam through the curing process of the liquid (plastic like) compound. Once hardened/cured the solution can be filed down for an even seam and smooth repair. It is fairly translucent, with a light yellow tinge when cured.For us this product worked very well under tug tests and to repair odd fabrics such as leather, plastic and wood- the majority of the resilience holding out on plastic repairs, which we could not re-fracture after repairing.This being said, the actual Bondic pen is messy, very messy for a product with so many hazard warnings! The top drips constantly, and if not stored properly will drip as soon as the cap is removed, making a mess. The LED light is a little bit of a paint to turn on/off and I dislike that I have to turn the potentially drippy Bondic pen end upside down. In all, this product seems to have some interesting applications but is more of  bridge than an adhesive and requires some more finessing in the product application aspect of the concept.I received this product for free in hopes I would share my honest thoughts and experiences, which I have done.

"I ordered this for my tween niece who is all about the attitude and the texting- Her bed is a riot of color and stuffed animals and I knew this would make a great addition.The first thing I noticed was the lack of any tags or labels. It came in a bag with no choking hazard warnings and, while I personally cut the tags off of toys before I give them to my nieces and nephews I'm not sure how this can be sold without care or warning labels? Why is their no material information? The lack of tags also gives it a sort of mass produced 'cheap' feel which is a shame because the quality of the embroidered details is actually quite nice.As other reviewers have noted this is not a perfect circle. While I don't necessarily notice pinching I do see points where the outer seam seems to be stitched tighter than other areas.The embroidered face is very well reinforced and seems like it will hold up to a lot of snuggling and abuse- I don't have any fears about an eye peeling off.The material is of decent quality and soft to the touch but the batting (filling) seems a little lumpy which doesn't really compliment the exterior seam stitch-work, In all this is a pretty cute throw pillow for the average tween.

"This is going to sound silly, but don't mistake the brand name, combined with the listing photo, to mean you will get both mats shown. The brand is Two Meows, and you are ordering either grey or lime green :)In any case, we have 1 indoor cat-  1, small, harmless looking, tuxedo kitty. And she is a DIGGER. She loves to kick up sand like a mole tunneling. We've had to house her litter box in a special piece of furniture (cabinet) and make her our own extra large litter box from a storage tub, simply to help curb some of the aftermath of her waste disposal efforts. As you'll see in the before photo, I actually started lining the cabinet with wrapping paper because all of the pet mats we found were too small, and all of the fabrics we had on hand tended allow the movement of sand from paws to the outside of the box.When this mat came in I was thrilled with the large size. It was actually larger in width and length than the cabinet footprint (and this is not a small piece of furniture.) It did have a medium strength (rubber?) odor that has dissipated within a few days of unpacking. The bottom of the mat is fairly smooth- so it doesn't grip well and will bunch if one the flood and nudged or stepped on by human feet. For our needs it is int he box and stays put. It even wraps up the side and back to help trap any sand that gets knocked around in cleaning.The top surface is textured with grooves. It reminds me of a good bath scrubber- it traps sand like nobody's business and is even minimizing the amount of sand being tracked outside the cabinet! Our cat is usually picky about the surfaces she'll walk on and she has accepted this mat with no issues. I love it because I don't have to clean out wrapping paper weekly- The mat holds quite a bit of scatter sand since the scrub pockets are deep. When I need to clean it I take it outside and beat it- We'll be hosing it off for the first time soon. I really love how durable it is and expect it to hold up for years!

"I did a bit of research on the benefits of garlic supplements before I began taking this- Many may not realize that garlic's most potent byproduct, Allicin is actually an enzyme reaction that dissipates quite quickly after the garlic bulb is cut into or disturbed. This is the ingredient/reaction from consumption of large quantities of garlic that is scientifically associated with the benefits of lower blood pressure, decrease in clotting risks, and immune support. Because of the manner in which Allicin is released it is widely accepted that 'fresh garlic bulb' equivalent supplements do not actually contain a measurable amount of Allicin. The best way to obtain the results of Allicin is through an Allicin Powder Extract.When choosing a garlic supplement  keep in mind that very few 'garlic' supplements contain Allicin (because of the way Allicin is created as a byproduct and enzyme reaction within the garlic consumption process,) and your decision of which 'Garlic' supplement to take will ultimately not burn down to that specific garlic byproduct. If you do research you will quickly see genuine Allicin is really only obtained through direct consumption of fresh physical garlic, or through processed Allicin SPECIFIC powder supplements. Once you understand this, should you still choose to take garlic supplements for other benefits (non Allicin related,) and find that the 1000mg Fresh Garlic Bulb Equivalent in these capsules is a good option for you- then you can continue to read about the product's experience and performance.Keep in mind these capsules are not Vegan and do contain gelatin, which is standard for capsule formats. These are, however, non-GMO and organic. The supplement also contains parsley and chlorophyll to help mask the odor and garlic burps you might find with other supplements. There may be some potential health benefits from these ingredients in addition to that of the intended garlic. I found the small green capsules very easy to take and the 2 month supply a modest size for the price. While I have not noticed any direct fluctuations in my blood pressure (my hopeful intent) since taking these, I plan on finishing the bottle through and updating with any perceived results. I did receive a product discount in hopes I would share my honest thoughts and experiences, which I have done. I am not a medical professional and nothing within this review should be taken as medical advice. Always consult your physician before taken any supplement, even the natural ones :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AD8CU29H9AKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYK3MMA#wasThisHelpful","R3AD8CU29H9AKB","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mother is a property manager at a 55+ retirement community. When she moved into the management unit she inherited a rather large garden full of lawn gnomes. She quickly learned that it was a point of pride for residents to collect and display unique gnomes though-out their lawns and gardens. When her birthday rolled around I knew I wanted to find a gnome that would be different than the typical red capped smiling faces. I debated long and hard between this gnome and one that was mooning with a bird on it's bum. Airing on the side of not offending any of her residents I decided to go with this guy. He has just enough punch to be unique and sassy without taking things too far.This arrived in a plain cardboard shipping box wedged between two molded pieces of Styrofoam. It was fairly lightweight and made of resin with a hand-painted job. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the detailing seems a little sharper on the listing photo, but that is likely just a case of strong lighting and contrast adjustment more than anything. The place where the paint job shows most is on the back of the gnome, where the jeans are hap-haphazardly painted over the chaps. I don't find this bothersome, however, because 1. This is quite an affordable gnome, 2. It's not a 'collectible' gnome made by a well known brand/artist, and 3. You really don't notice these things when the gnome is in a garden, as intended.The gnome itself is just under a pound in weight  and about 8"" in height and 3.2"" from shoulder to shoulder in width. I was worried it would be too light ti withstand winds and weather but it really is very sturdy and stable. It should be placed on a flat surface though, as it seems unstable on loose soil. If you intend on putting in the ground with plants make sure to bury the feet a little for stability. Because this is so lightweight it would make a great traveling mascot (just a thought.) In all, we're happy with the buy and I'm sure my mother will love displaying this sassy gnome in her garden.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F47QX9Y22Z0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMBDFB2#wasThisHelpful","R2F47QX9Y22Z0U","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I asked my stepfather for any ideas as to what to get my mother for her birthday this year his response was,""I don't know, she really seems to like unique earrings.""  One would think this would open a whole world of possibilities but my mother has several allergies to various metals and an only tolerate surgical steel and genuine solid gold. Any of my buying options in the surgical steel range were quite cheap and just didn't have the feel of a quality gift one would give their mother. Once I committed to genuine, solid, gold posts I browsed nearly every design I could find on Amazon (as Prime shipping was a crucial factor in my time frame) within the $40-$100 range.As I came across these I was instantly drawn to them. They looked 'unique' by every definition without being too gaudy or loud. Fun and trendy without being inappropriate. My mother isn't the sort to wear flowers and hearts so finding a feminine touch that would garner her compliments was high on my checklist. Once I decided on these I anguished over 'mm' size and whether to go with these Lavender or the Margarita pair. While the Margarita (green) listing seemed equally beautiful I had high hopes that these would offer more depth in the range of colors.I'll admit, I've never paid $63 for any piece of jewelry before, so this was a big deal to me and that first glimpse was a true hit or miss moment. These arrived in a pretty cheap silver jewelry box (not like the clam-shell, velvet lined, one I have placed them in to gift to my mother,) and there was no way to know they were solid gold other than a sticker on the outside of the bag the box came in. All that aside, I was very pleased with the actual earrings. The way these caught the light from every angle, one couldn't help but stare and inspect them from every side and lighting. They are even more beautiful than my photos (and I think I did a great job capturing their glow and facets!)The 6mm ended up being the right choice for me- They are not too small, but not too big to look cheap or overwhelming. The gold posts are extremely dainty and hold up to basic genuine gold testing. The backings seem to fit snug, and the stones seem well mounted, though only time will tell how they will hold up. I wish, for the money, these had been presented in a nicer jewelry box- but I really am very happy with this buy. I was nervous about spending this kind of money on such a unique pair of earrings, sight unseen, and online but I couldn't have been happier with the speed of delivery and their captivating real life impact!The stock image falls flat and doesn't begin to convey the depth of the stone and the way it changes color!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I82ZZDI2MKPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LX9YTS6#wasThisHelpful","R2I82ZZDI2MKPY","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the time of this review I turn 29 tomorrow- While it's sad, at my age, I have to regulate and monitor my blood pressure; it's not a task I want turning into a chore. I'll admit, it's no fun carrying around a BP gauge everywhere one goes, and it's far from sexy. Well, I have to say this is one of the slickest monitor's I've owned, very slim in profile- just a little over the thickness of the AAA batteries it runs on. The backlit screen is bright and the LED is a soft white glow readout so it's very easy on the eyes and quite stylish.All too many time I've had to take multiple readings on multiple devices and average the numbers, or revert to a manual cuff for an accurate measurement. It had gotten to the point my own physician didn't believe I was monitoring my blood pressure at home! Since my medication is highly regulated and taken in very small mG doses, I need to take my BP multiple times a day. This cuff delivers fast readings with a very easy to track system that stores up to 60 records (which is about 2 weeks data for me.) I've actually been able to stretch this closer to a month thanks to the 2 user system (for 120 readings total.)Speaking of the 2 user storage system, this is the first digital cuff I've owned that was so intuitive to use I could actually make use of multiple user profiles. There literally are 2 buttons- one for each user, so even a caregiver new to BP tracking could learn to use this. Visual indicators are quite easy to read as well with number readouts that correspond to a visual meter on the left side. This system is pretty standard with digital cuffs, but I found the Green/Yellow/Red scaling was a lot more accurate in relation to the actual numbers. I've had cuffs place my in the yellow zone at 160/118- when you are relying on a device to alert you to crucial changes in your body's function, that's not safe!As far as accuracy, I actually brought this into my DRs office this past week to compare the readings with the RNs manual cuff readout. It was within a few points each time- which is good enough for me! Similarly, while the manual does say you can use this on either arm, it's best not to take wrist cuff measurements on one's right arm, as variances will occur. I did play around with this and was getting readings over a 5 point variance from one arm to the next.This cuff is very lightweight and comfortable to wear- setup was easy and took less than a minute and all literature for troubleshooting, resetting, and use are thoroughly documented with included instructions, as is a carrying tote (that is a bit over-sized so I store my meds with my cuff.) I received a product discount in hopes I'd share my honest thoughts, yet still paid more than pennies or a few dollars- I have bought a lot of cuffs in my time, and ease of use is important for my busy lifestyle. Consider all notes here genuine- I will likely buy a second for travel and the car.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHB8S1I73L4A2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TG9CBYO#wasThisHelpful","RHB8S1I73L4A2","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It feel funny saying we 'love' a shower curtain, but this deserves 5 stars- We've long bought our clear liners on Amazon and have been through several brands. For a while we settled on one that was about $8 with Prime, and replaced it every other month. It was affordable, but it wasn't sturdy enough to clean regularly. We could really only spray it down and give it a gentle wipe and it eventually would get mildew when it was time to replace. We've also had problems with the grommets wearing out and tearing, on previous curtains, so we didn't have any real idea what to expect.*This 10 Guage shower curtain IS heavy duty. It feels thick, and is about twice the weight of our usual liner. We use these clear curtains as actual liners that drape inside the tub while showering- we keep a fabric curtain on the outside of the tub. I was concerned our curtain rod wouldn't be happy to put up with the extra weight of this curtain but there are enough grommets that the weight is very well distributed. As a liner, it's pretty thick- and really more of a clear shower curtain- but suits our needs well.*We truly appreciate the attention to quality and stitching at the top, around the grommets. We can easily scrub the bottom of the curtain (since it is thick enough) and not worry about straining the grommets or fraying the edges.*This was a little stiff to use for the first week or so. It seemed to want to fan out, and folded quite thick at the bottom when pulled back, but has since relaxed a little.*There is a pretty standard, not particularly overwhelming, plastic odor when you first remove this from the package. We placed our liner out on the patio for a day before installing it and the odor seemed to have dissipated.We rarely have no criticism for a product but this is a solid buy all around, I only wish I could subscribe to it, as we will certainly be ordering this liner from here on out.

"I was raised with an analog pressure gauge- we put a lot of wear on our tires from travel and work expeditions and it isn't always convenient to pack a giant professional gauge with ll our other gear and equipment. In the past we've relied on the very basic 'stick' gauges; but those usually fluxuate as much as 3-4 PSI, which is a lot when your tires are gauged to 35. I especially liked the easy of use and portability of this digital tire meter.*It's body is entirely plastic- I like that it is brightly colored and easy to locate in a glove compartment or tool kit. It has a single button operation that is very intuitive. Click the trigger button once to turn it on, and again to cycle through each of the 4 measurements (PSI, Bar, Kpa, or kg/cm.) Hold the button down for an extended 5-7 seconds and the unit will turn off. It will also automatically power off if left unused for more than 30 seconds.*The back-lit screen is very bright and very easy to read in direct daylight or the middle of the night, and even provides a little glow to work by when locating the stem. This is very useful for those 'side of the road' or late night gas stop checks.*The unit seems to measure within a few decimal points accurately when compared to our professional analog meter (PSI.) even better, this measures PSI to decimal points- which is really great when accurate monitoring an measurements are needed (especially to track and detect leaks over time.)*While the gauge is ergonomically designed, it could use a rubber grip- especially if you have to pull this out in foul weather.*The reading is quick, but we've had a little difficulty getting a clean fit. We let out a little air now and then because we can't seem to get a flush connection right off the bat. This really is our only complaint, and a minor annoyance with such an easy to use, accurate digital pressure gauge.*I love the little notch at the bottom to attach to a caribiner or tool belt- it just adds an extra functionality.*This comes with batteries installed- and this might be an issue for some- the unit operates on a total of 4 cell batteries and the only way to get to said batteries is by unscrewing the unit. It's not hard, but not convenient- I suppose it does make for a durable and water resistant gauge though. Speaking of battery- we anticipate a lot of life on the included batteries, since the unit is so efficient at turning off when not in use!In all, this is a great buy at the current asking price of $10- and something everyone should have on hand in their car. Why fuss with trying to read analog and stick measurements when you can enjoy a quick digital read on a back-lit display?

"I own several Bluetooth speakers and paid well over $200 for our JBL speaker at the time of it's first release- I am very critical of design and execution in portable sound technology but I have to say, right up front, I was blown away with the amount of speaker you get for such a low price here. I do not write glowing reviews, and always have notes of improvement but it's literally hard to pick apart a speaker that does everything it promises to such great execution. I would buy these for gifts in a heartbeat and am looking to invest in a second to test the possibility of surround sound or continuous syncing. Here are my thoughts:Appearance: Very well built, heavy in the hand but very modest in size for the amount of sound it can output. I love the 360 speaker design but find the speaker is a little tall can can be wobbly unless on a very flat surface, since it is slender and tall. We usually place this face down on the buttons/front when we take it out and about to avoid mishaps with falling when at the pier or park.Waterproof: This speaker offers a level of IPX4 protection- this means you shouldn't swim with it or submerge it underwater, but having it out while camping, or in areas where weather may be tentative is acceptable. Minor splashes and water encounters should be fine. The bottom charge ports and on/off switch are protected by a silicone fitted flap. I've had no issue removing the flap (which is securely attached by a small tab at one end,) though it does fit flush with the speaker for waterproofing purposes.Streaming Options: While this is a Bluetooth speaker there is a TF/Micro SD port for you to introduce your own media- I've found that this seems to add extra life to the playback time (about an hour more when directly reading media.) Bluetooth connects and pairs quickly and intuitively. There is a voice acknowledgement system that sounds like an Asian woman with a French accent- it's a little robotic and really livens up our listening experience- we are constantly trying to place her accent.Connectivity + Life: We get about 5 3/4 hours continuous playback via Bluetooth on a full charge (full charge takes about 2.5 hours.) The Bluetooth range is about 30 feet before interference/cutting out. Note: even a human body can disrupt the clarity of the feed, resulting in a crackling/breaking up effect. The field between the Bluetooth device and speaker should be kept directly clear at all times for functionality. This is where the price level of the speaker shows itself- it's truly a minor inconvenience, as I rarely am using my phone while streaming. Like so many people I play music while cleaning up the house, hosting a party, or relaxing in the backyard.The 'Clip': In an effort to market this as more of an active lifestyle speaker a pull out tab and complimentary caribiner style clip has been included with this speaker. The tab doesn't seem like something I'd quite trust clipped to my belt while biking (as in one of the stock images) but is convenient to fasten in a backpack, or to one's belongings while out and about. In my opinion the aluminum clip is by far the cheapest looking element of that is otherwise a very slick speaker package.There is not carry pouch or sleeve like many other speakers on the market have. I suppose that's another thing that refers to the price point, but it's such a gorgeous speaker that I'm sad to note this. We store ours in the original box when not in use....which is pretty much never, since it's usually on display in the living room when not being charged.The Sound: I wanted to dislike this speaker but it's hard to argue with the sheer power of this tiny unit. I am amazed by the amount of sound being pumped out of it and the clarity from all angles. In our 2 bedroom condo I can hear music clearly and comfortably with the volume at about 80 percent! Even more impressive, there is minimal muffling and distortion when up so loud. BASS highs and lows come in fairly clear with decent depth- the only issue with sound quality would be interference when handling the bluetooth streaming device, or when the device gets out of range.We also thought it was worth noting that the device can actively be charged while in use- and will power off the included cable endlessly if used as a power source. Clarity for calling modes seems okay but is not the highlight of this unit. In all, I am blown away at the quality and performance of this speaker, with the added benefit of waterproof protection, for it's price. I did receive a discount, but paid more than a few dollars, in hopes I'd share my honest experiences and thoughts- which I have done. I purchase a lot of speakers at discount and I think this is the first I have given 5 stars; that should stand for something. Feel free to drop us any questions about the device!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRDUSBV184RUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AG2MZW#wasThisHelpful","RRDUSBV184RUR","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For some reason I initially saw this listing and assumed it was fabric or somehow inflated- the product images don't quite convey that i is resin, as the edges are all so smooth. And, while the sizes are written (as pretty much the ONLY product info really given) I envisioned it a little bigger. All this being said, I'm a bit bummed that all the current reviews go on about how cute it is with no real product insight or scrutiny. Don't get me wrong, it IS adorable- and at the current $15 price, it's not a bad buy, however there are some quirks and things worth noting.*This seasonal decor comes in 3 pieces, the main moose body, left hand/arm, hanging solar powered lantern. In truth, it comes in 4 pieces because the lantern handle does not run through the lantern piece and actually is just two nubs  that sit in very shallow drilled out holes in the side of the lantern top. We've actually gone and drilled the holes a little deeper to push the handle nubs in further0 but they are so short it doesn't quite help with the issue that SoCal gets very windy and the lantern has fallen off a few times already. Fortunately, the resin is very durable and nothing has broken.*The lantern is made of resin....and painted. The light coming from within is not very powerful at all. While we have verified that it does charge, and we seem to get over 5 hours of light from the tiny solar cell after a day outside, the light is just much too muffled to do more than add an ambiance glow. I tried hard to get it on camera, but there is too much light pollution on our block to really capture it.*This Christmoose fastens onto pretty much any tree via a 2 screw mount on the body and a one screw mount on the arm. Screws are NOT included but the rest of the hardware is mounted into the resin. When hung by screws the moose body is very secure (minus the issue with the lantern potentially blowing off in heavy winds.) The hand's mount seems to be embedded sideways and the hand would be placed against the curvature, up and down, rather than hugging as shown in the product images, in order to be hung properly. Regardless, with a snug screw fit we are able to secure it easily.*This is not a heavy piece of decor, which we love, and it comes packaged in a box with Styrofoam padding, great for storing year after year for use.*The paint job varies a little here and there but, overall if very slick and looks great. There's no denying this is a unique and cute addition to any holiday decor setup.In conclusion, as a piece of decor, it is adorable- The lantern doesn't quite function as we'd like as far as brightness but does charge with solar power and is easily turned on/off via a push switch on the front (assuming you place the panel side facing back.) I wish the lantern attached to it's handle more securely, that's really the biggest downfall of this decoration, as the lantern is a bit integral to the design of the character holding up it's hand. It's viable without the bright light, but not so much with the lantern on the floor beneath it. With some fussing you can find a solution to this though by adding your own wire as a handle, extending the drill holes, etc. Like many of the reviewers on here at time of posting, I received a discount, but paid more than a few dollars, in hopes I'd share my honest thoughts, which I have done. If the lantern issue were addressed and fixed, this would easily be 4 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QEMQCHH439XY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3KGI7U#wasThisHelpful","R3QEMQCHH439XY","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very skeptical of mounting my phone to my bike when my girlfriend first suggested it. We looked at several options and they all seemed to rely on plastic frames and various friction/grip spring loaded claws. I bike 8 miles to work, roundtrip, daily and often through busy traffic. I never know when I will have to brake hard or swerve and the concept of putting my smartphone on my handles, where the most jerking might occur made me very uneasy. I especially liked the idea of silicone band enhanced mounts that added that extra shock absorbing embrace of security when riding.*The product says, on the packaging, 'to fit any smartphone'- which seems to be a bit of a stretch (pun intended) of the truth. While 3 grip bands are included and one could use two bands to secure the top and bottom of one's phone separately, I would not put my Phablet style (Note) phone in here. The spring loaded grip is VERY tight, which is a great thing, as I feel confident it could hold my phone in place alone, without the silicone netting, but doesn't expand much more than 4"", making it a tight fit for larger phones. This being said, I think this mount would work best with most iPhones, and second best with Windows and Android smartphones such as the Lumia and Galaxy models. My Samsung Galaxy S4 is shown and fits snug. You'll note the Apple phone shown in the product images has more grip room on the corners because it is a smaller footprint. Take in mind most protective phone cases you'd want on your phone while biking add a considerable amount of bulk.*This mount was easy to install and did only take a few minutes. We didn't care much for the 'adjustable' method of sizing the frame grip by adding layers of included silicone grips. It works, but it required some cutting/trimming, and seems like the grip should telescope much smaller and simply require less tightening for larger framed bikes.*The phone mount itself snaps into a 360 pivot joint that allows viewing from nearly any angle- which is great when you're out biking in the sun and need to adjust for glare. I suggest investing in a glass screen protector with glare protection if you intend on using this mount, or any mount for regular navigation. I primarily use mine for Bluetooth purposes to screen calls to and from work, and listen to the radio.*This product advertises full phone access- again, I don't quite now how they can claim that for EVERY phone, but on our Galaxy S4 we are able to easily position the expandable clam-shell grips so that they do not interfere with volume buttons. This being said the silicone grip frame DOES cover our touch home and menu buttons. (See photo)In all, my phone feels very secure and I bike confidently with this mount. I have yet to notice any weakening in the pivot joint and the elasticity of the web band. The company offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee, so if you're in the fence about the FIT of the mount and your device (as case thicknesses and such vary,) it's worth a chance in our opinion. Our only real gripe with our unique experiences is the fact that the webbing DOES go over and interfere with our menu and home buttons on the S4. This is to be expected with the design- but contrary to the marketing of the product. We received a discount in hopes we would share our honest thoughts, which I have provided here. Please feel free to drop any questions about our experiences or the mount's performance, we'd be happy to assist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CTCON87H7ZNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010OPQVUS#wasThisHelpful","R3CTCON87H7ZNH","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Jenna's Thoughts) We own a lot of expensive and fancy pillows- I'll admit, I'm a pillow SNOB. 5 years back I was sleeping on your everyday cheap Wally world $5 value pillows. When Jay moved in I begin really looking at my bedding and my sleeping experience. Getting a good night's sleep is not quite the same game as you move out of your 20s and can't stretch across your bed like you used to when you were single! I also noticed that all of my and his cheap pillows get nasty pretty quick. They either changed color (eew) or turned lumpy and uncomfortable. We were going through $5 pillows once a month- and that adds up quick!I also am the sort who has trouble falling asleep and requires multiple pillows under head and arms to get comfy- so, when I invested in a brand new mattress the salesman talked me into trying memory foam pillows. Ever since then I haven't looked back. While my favorite (main) pillow is the Hydraluxe Cooling Memory Foam Pillow by Comfort Revolution, I still find myself sleeping with two pillows behind my head. During the winter I keep a thin memory foam pillow on top, and during the Summer I prop it up on the bottom. For me, this Slim Sleeper would solve that need perfectly.*The pillow arrived n a clear plastic bag/wrapper that truly is a choking hazard to kids and pets (so dispose of that proper and right away.) Out of the packaging there was no foul odor. Some memory foams tend to have a chemical smell, but even outside the case it was odorless.*The pillow, as seen in product photos, is actually inside a very soft and plus case that removes entirely via zipper for washing.*The 'memory' life of this foam build is very rich- I can press my hand down into it with about an inch and a half to spare and the imprint will hold a good 10 seconds upon pull back. The design has a soft curve to cradle the neck at the widest point and help make slim sleeping ergonomic. I took a nap on the couch with only this pillow and felt quite comfortable- I'd like to think this would be great for travel!*I am primarily using this as a bolster pillow on top of my existing memory foam pillow- Most memory foam pillows tend to be very thick and bulky. I can't stack a cotton blend pillow on top or it will sink and slide (and bunch) and I can't stack another foam pillow on top because it feels too high- until now. This Slim Sleeper is PERFECT for my needs and very comfortable to sleep on- I'd highly recommend it for anyone who wants to take that foam sleeping experience on vacation or to a family's house for the holidays- it;s so light and easy to transport!In all, I'm marking this down a star only for it's price point- I see similar pillows sell closer to $35-40 and wish the maker wold consider lowering it's price so more people could experience the comfort and convenience of such a well made, slim, memory foam pillow. I did receive a discount on my purchase but have provided an honest and unbiased account of my opinions and experiences, regardless. I will update over time with any wear/flattening/discoloration notes as/if they arise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCYCCN3TEXL1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012B6ZYYM#wasThisHelpful","RCYCCN3TEXL1H","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my stepdad as a birthday gift- we are a family of photographers and I knew he'd get a kick out of carrying this around on shoots. Ironically the product images don't really do it justice. I'd read reviews before buying it and I was unsure how it would look when it arrived. It almost seems like Amazon might have some old inventory or models in their stock that some other buyers have received? After reading the critical reviews I was really worried about the drinking on the go situation as some had mentioned there being no spout and others mentioned an issue with a gasket seal. Here's what we found (photos attached.)*The box looks a little cheesy and dated and can certainly use an update, however it does arrived boxed, which makes gifting easier.*The outer shell (the part that looks like a lens) seems to be all one piece with the exception of the focus and zoom rings- those are rubber bands that do tend to slide up or down a little with excess handling. We thought the macro indicators were just fancy stickers at first but they actually seem well set and inlaid into the plastic mold, if they are. I was a bit disappointed some of the switches (like the AF/MF) weren't moving parts, but that's just the geek in me. All in all, it looks a lot nicer than I expected for a $10 price point.*The tumbler inside the lens shell (I say shell but it is all one piece, they don't remove from one another) is high quality stainless steel and holds 11oz of fluid. This is a little smaller than I like for a tumbler- if you're a photographer you probably take more than 11ounces out on set/location. In any case it's overall presence is about accurate to a real lens.*The cap has a threading in which it attaches to the inner lip of the stainless steel mug. There is a notch to slide up or down to drink from and the lid comes off fairly easy with a twist to remove format. Because the interior is stainless steel we expect it to hold heat and keep cold things cold for a very long time- but, alas, this is a gift so I can't truly attest to that.*If the capacity isn't quite enough for you I'd suggest taking the lid off and using it on your desk for pens, SD cards, film collection, etc- it would make a wonderful nic nack for any photography fan.Having said all this- I m very critical of things looking cheesy or cheap- I wish this was advertised as being made in the U.S.A., but there's little I can do about that. I paid $7 for our mug (I got a very small discount in hopes I'd share our honest thoughts) and I am quite content giving it as a gift. It's quite clever and well designed in my opinion- I have added the Clear Lens version of this mug to my own wish list!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RDONZ903H1A1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RNNEVRK#wasThisHelpful","R3RDONZ903H1A1","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We own several backup battery banks and 'lipstick chargers' and they all seem to come with their own perks and quirks. I still remember shelling out $60 for my first 10000mAh power bank, and I have to admit it's a bit silly how affordable anything under 15000 mAh is today! That being said, I was skeptical of a 20800mAh power bank for just $35, but our familiarity with the brand's other tech devices made the gamble worth the plunge. We were mainly attracted to this bank because of the bright (top facing) LED indicator lights, dual charging potential, large capacity and secondary flashlight feature. Here's how it stacked up for us:Yays:*We liked the sleek look and rounded edges. It feels soft and easy to grip in the palm and the blue LED lights on the top are very bright (you really can't miss them, they're almost blinding.) While the size may seem big, it's actually equal to or smaller than some of our 15000mAh power banks and the rounded edges make it much more comfortable to carry around in a pocket or handbag.*The dual charge feature is great. We love that we can charge both of our devices while in the car, or at a restaurant, the output can handle both 1A and 2.1A USB output. Along a similar line the intelligent technology built into this power bank helps sense maximum output, depending on the device being charged, and automatically adjusts so as to not over charge.*The front light feature is a nice add on though the blue LED indicator lights almost seem even brighter! The light will function just like a flashlight and has no timeout until manually turned off by holding the power button down for an extended period of time. We own a smaller version of this power bank and have had issues with the buttons sticking and turning the light off. We're happy to report that this model seems very well polished in use from button sensitivity and responsiveness to port fits.*The battery came with a full charge (per the indicator lights.) We usually suggest draining the power bank entirely before charging it further to avoid ghost memory issues and maintain the integrity of the battery's memory- however, in our case, since the battery pack indicated it was full we began out testing immediately.*You can charge the battery pack AND a device at the same time. Naturally the power bank will charge much slower if this is the case. This is convenient if you have a long time and only access to one outlet (or you forgot your phone charger AC adapter at home,) otherwise it's not a huge selling point, just plug your phone into the wall and the charger into another outlet, in our opinion.*The included carry pouch is more of a sleeve and fits a little snug, but there is plenty of room at the top to use the drawstring. Charging cables do fit inside with the bank but the lovely exterior, black, grip materials tends to scuff and mark if given the chance to rub.*This power banks security protection design is intended to prevent against over charging and short circuit, as noted above.*Charge time is fast- from 3% battery health on our Samsung Galaxy S4 to full in just under 45 minutes- which is about  5 inutes more than direct AC output for our Samsung Galaxy S4. This device seems to charge at a slightly slower rate when connected to our iPad.*We clocked 7 full charge cycles and about 87% on our Samsung Galaxy S4- As the Galaxy S4 has a 2600 mAh battery which is about a 97% efficiency rate. This is really one of the devices biggest successes, as more banks tend to average 90% efficiency in this price range.Mehs:*The device comes with a micro to USB adapter but no AC adapter. This is pretty standard as far as power banks go, but it still would be nice to see one with an AC adapter someday. You can easily plugin to most standard smartphone chargers or your laptop to charge.In all, this has quickly become one of our favorite power banks with it's high capacity output and flashlight feature. We feel this will be a great safety aid for the house, let along any professional who commutes or travels a lot. I will update this listing to see if it loses charge memory over time- so far no issues. For the price at the time of this review ($35) we consider this a solid buy worth investing in- and easily on of the best power banks we've tested in this price range within the 15000mAh-20800mAh range. I received a discount in hopes I would share my honest thoughts and experiences, which I have done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTG5YJCI49U0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHWXZUY#wasThisHelpful","RTG5YJCI49U0U","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We own a few oven and grill gloves but I was particularly drawn to the unique NOMEX fibers used in the exterior Kevlar weave of these. Many other gloves advertise that they can handle temperatures up to 600F, but in fact have disclaimers about how long they can carry such heat. In our experiences, Anything above 425F usually is too much for 'bargain brand' cooking gloves. Here are our thoughts:*These came to us packages in a clear plastic bag with minimal tags and literature. We like to gift items like this, and the packaging isn't very presentable so they'd have to be bundled with other cooking items, as in a gift set.*These are large. We both have long slender hands and usually order large sizes in gloves and mitts, but there was extra wiggle room for both of this. While this wasn't to the point of making things clumsy, I could certainly see how anyone with petite hands might have difficulties. Word is that the brand is creating a sizing system and a smaller size is on the way.*Some of our other oven/grill gloves have strips of silicone gripping that can make grasping and mobility a bit awkward. The dot pattern used on these gloves helps increase mobility and seems to add extra heat protection and grip over our other pairs. For example, some of our 'strip' styled gloves allow for the side of pans and dishes to slide between the grip material and can build up heat in extended use. The grip pattern is so dense, yet flexible, on these that they are easily some of the most versatile heat resistant gloves we've used.*Speaking of build- The inside is a cotton material which doesn't cause sweating and is actually very comfortable to wear for extended periods. This is especially nice when you're playing grill master. Equally important is the extended wrist design which helps protect forearms from the heat of open flames (when turning steaks at the grill, etc) or carrying large casserole, pie, and roaster dishes from the oven. In all the extra 3 1/2"" of coverage is a real selling point for us, as we do a lot of heavy lifting at the grill and in the kitchen.*These washed beautifully- I was hesitant to do a machine wash, per the instruction options, but they did not seem to shrink or warp on a standard wash cycle, air dried.*For those new to the concept of grilling gloves- Heat resistant means that immediate contact with up to 662F will not be felt, however, there are 'bleed' times and consumers should always be aware that these are not intended to be worn for extended periods of contact with hot surfaces. In our experience we were able to comfortably grip a pie dish direct from 460F heat for 18 seconds before feeling warmth come through, and 25 seconds before we felt we should place the dish down. While that may seem short, it's really quite a long time to get what needs to be done, done. You should also be aware that these are still made of fabric, and that contact with water, while in the kitchen can result in burns, so always exercise caution as you would with any potholder/mitt/glove around heat.In all these have performed the more organically in the kitchen, with the versatility and flexibility range exceeding our other mitts. We love that this enable enough dexterity to re-wrap foil on a roasting pan after checking the temperature with a probe. We also love that the extra long wrist protects us when flipping burgers over an open flame. Our only grumble is that they do not come packaged nicer, or in a secondary (smaller) size. We received a product discount in exchange for our honest thoughts and experiences, which we have shared here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W4Y50U0BKG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QU8V7JO#wasThisHelpful","R7W4Y50U0BKG8","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Traditionally I've avoided headbands and relied on hair ties or clips to hold my hair back when cooking or working out because the majority of the fashion bands on the market tend to give me pressure headaches. However, I can't sleep with my hair tied back or in a clip, as I've begun wearing my hair up due to the Summer heat. These seemed like a plausible solution with their unique extra long shape and ability to be layered.Yays:*I actually like that there is no sewing or finishing on the edges of these headbands- I think that makes them more comfortable to wear and do not mind that they curl a little after multiple uses or washing. These are very long and can be doubled or trippled over as an actual headband so they seem they will always be useful for that.*After hand washing and air drying they did not seem to shrink, fray, or thin. There was a little noticed curling on the edges.*The material is very stretchy and very breathable. I noticed NO odors, at all- and I sniffed them- even over my nose as mask I couldn't detect any artificial odors. I found this material quite comfortable to wear and triple rolled into itself a suitable headband for holding hair in place, while still being comfortable enough to lay down or nap in.*These fold up flat when not in use- so they are easy to store in a purse, glove compartment, or gym bag. They do not bunch or wrinkle.*The packaging has several graphics for use/wearing instructions I found easy. I'm not very creative when it comes to that sort of thing and actually loved the idea to twist it overhead and double it down to wear as a beanie. I think this will come in handy to keep my ears insulated under  biking helmet during the Fall months.Mehs:*I'm not crazy about the patterns- I usually love colorful but the multi-color prints in the 6 pack are just too loud and very Rastafarian.*The carry pouch they came in came with a busted zipper so it was pretty much useless out of the gate.*I'm on the fence about the price- if I was going to buy these I'd expect to pay about $3-$3.50 a piece. The 2 pack at $10 is a bit more than I'd like to fork over given the nature of what the product is; a long headband that can be worn multiple ways.My thoughts overall? Buy the 4 pack, it works out cheaper and is a truly great deal for your money- I only wish I could choose the designs included. It does look like the designs shown on each listing are the ones shipped in the package though. These are definitely multi-functional but they are, at the end of the day, long headbands. They breath well, are comfortable to wear, and do not cause headaches.

"There seem to be a lot of glowing reviews, and some really negative reviews on this product so I was skeptical when first considering whether I should give this power bank a shot. It's a shame that so many reviewers who review in exchange for discounts post glowing reviews that are basically a regurgitation of the product specs. I've been reviewing products for years and maybe 1 in 25 purchases will arrive absolutely perfection with no notes for improvement- and even then, there's always more a product could have or offer. All this being said, it's hard to decide where product quality lies when looking at a product in this price range, now so far from it's original list value when the negative reviews clearly received defective products and many of the glowing reviews do more than boost star ratings and say things like 'it's really neat,' 'I'll use this a lot' and 'a great deal.' That being said here is our nitty gritty good and the bad after several charge cycles and drains:The Yays:*The complimentary carry case is a gorgeous poly woven charcoal color that fits the power bank with a little extra room. Some of our other chargers and speakers have cases that fit tight like a sleeve and can be a pain to get on and off. I do with the drawstring on this pouch was a little longer though.*It is stylish, which seems to be the main selling point of the brand. Indeed the design is crisp and we love the hex-weave facing on the top and bottom. Unfortunately, this material also seems to love lint, which clings to it a lot so storage in the carry case is a must. I wish I could say that the '8 level' power bar indicator excited me- but, for the 15000 mAh it doesn't seem as necessary as it would be on a 20000+ mAh device. That being said the blue indicator lights are vibrant and easy to see and read in any lighting situation.*Dual charging- We've come to learn not to use cords included with these sorts of devices as the quality tends to not be great and the cords are often short. While the included cord did work for charging purposes we used the cords that came with our devices originally for the majority of our testing. Instead of labeling the class of USB outputs the brand has decided to merely put 'in' and 'out' in the ports so it is hard to judge what should be expected in charge speeds. All this being said, we have times charges for our Samsung Galaxy S4 under the following circumstances with the following results which ranks the speed of dual charge second best out of 6 dual chargers this capacity or higher owned by us:-Single Charge, 1 Port- 3%-100%: 50 minutes-Dual Charge, 2 Ports- 0%-100%: 63 minutes, 74 minutes (it's worth noting that, for some reason, despite both batteries being dead, one charged faster, we assume this has to do with the individual batteries ghost life)-Control: AC Samsung USB Adapter- 0%-100%: 37 minutes*This came with 3/8 bars charge, out of the box. We always like it when a product is able to be tested immediately upon unpacking.*We noticed that this power bank seems to sense it's charging progress and slow or halt charging output once the attached device has reached full capacity. This is especially useful for maintaining the bank's maximum reserve charge as devices that continue to draw or trickle energy on a full battery will eventually deplete reserves.*We clocked 5 full charge cycles and about 58% on our Samsung Galaxy s4- As the Galaxy S4 has a 2600 mAh battery which is about a 95% efficiency rate. This is really one of the devices biggest successes, as more banks tend to average 90% efficiency in this size and price range.The Mehs:*The packaging looked like it had been sitting in a storefront with UV exposure- it was a bit faded, which tends to make me think I received an older model or make. I'm not sure what could have caused this but it's the sort of small thing that weighs heavy on a first impression.*The cord included with this power bank was short, as they usually are. It was also white- which is confusing when we ordered a black power bank....why include a white cord? I know the brand offers this bank in white, but it seems like a small cost to match cords with bank colors. Furthermore I wonder if I will ever see a dual charger bank with 2 charging cables.... Also, as so many of these banks- you do not get an AC-USB wall plug adapter.*The brand offers a pretty impressive 2 yer warranty outside of Amazon and appears committed to customer service. Having said that, it seems they should invest in a customer care team that speaks fluent English if they wish to continue to deal with a customer base primarily in the U.S. Many of the customer concerns and questions on this listing are not addressed properly or to the point due to a language barrier. Customer support seems to be more of a 'replacement' policy which I suppose is fine in the long run, but not truly customer support.The Nays:*Like others have said this power bank is big- it weighs near a pound and is 5 1/4"" in length, and a bit thick. We normally cheer products that have heft to them as representing quality materials and build but a power bank that seems to be from this year (as we couldn't find reviews that went back past May 2015) should ideally be more compact for it's 15000 mAh capacity.  We own several 2300 mAh power banks and they are all smaller in footprint than this.*Despite the brand touting that 9 hours is a normal charge time for a power bank of this size, 9 hours is exceptionally long. Yes, you can charge this overnight, and more people will, but we own multiple 15000 mAh power banks that fully charge in 6 hours or less.The bottom line- After going through all these points there are clearly some pros and cons, as you'll find when comparison shopping any power bank. Power banks of this capacity are a dime a dozen and range from $10-$100 on Amazon. It's best to know what is most important to you and make a buying decision based on this. We rate this high for measured efficiency- not because it looks cool or has 8 indicator lights. If you are most concerned with a compact power bank in the 15000mAh range, this is not the device for you. In addition, the 9 hour bank charge time should be taken into account. While we did receive a discount on this product initially, we did pay more than a few pennies for the device and I have invested a great deal of time into honestly testing and providing feedback for potential buyers- please drop a comment or question if you have any concerns when considering this device. We have tested many and are happy to help you find the right power bank for you!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26266J9CDRSC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFI9XYK#wasThisHelpful","R26266J9CDRSC0","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone who was forced to take a tablespoon of cod liver oil a day, growing up, I rebelled against the idea of fish oil supplements, when suggested by my doctor for omega-3 benefits and to aid in the lowering of my bad, LDL, level cholesterol. As someone in their late 20's who has made several lifestyle changes to ween off of Lipitor- I knew I had to do more than change my diet and activity levels to keep my hereditary issues at bay. For the past 2 years I have been taking 1000mg Nature's Bounty Fish Oil capsules- these are large horse pills that are NOT friendly for people with pill taking issues, and cause 'fish oil burps' several hours after initial consumption. I'd read a lot of articles, and consulted with my doctor, about Krill oil benefits, over fish oil, which led me to this product.*One bottle contains a 1 month supply, when 2 capsules are taken daily by an adult. Per the label this provides:300mg Antarctic Krill Oil (EPA- 43 mg, DHA 26mg)200mg Sardine/Anchovy Fish Oil500mg Primrose OilI've noticed on many Fish Oil supplements the EPA and DHA are not specifically called out, and generally lumped into generic claims about the oil's potential benefits and measurements.*These pills are very thick gel capsules- I actually bit into one for 1.) an overall taste test- after all its the fish oil pills releasing in your stomach acids that cause the infamous fish burp phenomenon, and 2.) because the gel capsule itself seemed very very thick. I realized the contents were very mild in taste and odor and no more offensive than a piece of sushi. I assumed the thick gel coating is what, in part, causes the lack of fish burps causing absorption to be delayed and take longer.*While these capsules are not fun to take, for someone who has issues taking pills, they re smaller than many fish oil supplements.*I have been very pleased with the absolute lack of presence of side effects and fish burps. There is no aftertaste and no sensation or aromatic impact in the hours that follow taking a serving.*While I am not a doctor, I have been taking omega 3s for years now and seen noticeable drops in negative LDL cholesterol levels. As my physician advised that Krill Oil will offer up to 3 times the impact per dose, I am excited to update this review with my follow up blood work with Fall.*The bottle is a basic screw top cap- if you are concerned about children getting into it you will want to change storage methods or store it out of reach of small hands.*I have noticed a decrease in swelling and joint stiffness due to physical activity in my left knee, which has experienced severe swelling and stiffness at times due to an old injury in the joint tendons. Again, I am not a doctor, but I have also read further into Krill Oil benefits and it seems this might be the cause.In general, as someone who has been relying on Omega 3 supplements for years, I am relieved to have found a quality Krill Oil supplement and alternative to Fish Oil and fish burps. I will update as I continue through several months of this product and let you know of my sucess in blood work numbers. I received a product discount in hopes I would share my honest thoughts here, which I have done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R347C62SVEZ5GK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLA1FT4#wasThisHelpful","R347C62SVEZ5GK","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We own several selfie sticks and they all seem to have an array of different quirks and different positives.  In general, there are 3 types of commercial selfie sticks: direct connect audio jack, remote triggered by Bluetooth, or built in Bluetooth. Let me tell you, once you've tried a Bluetooth capable selfie stick, you will never go back to the wired varieties. That being said, we've tended to lean towards remote based triggers in the past, as this seems to enable a steadier image capture- it's a rare selfie stick with a built in trigger button that does not cause jumping and focus issues when depressed. Here's a little about our experiences with this particular self-portrait monopod:Yays:*First out of the box I noticed how slick this selfie stick looked. The adjustable mount/head seemed very durable and offered a wide range of motion and angles to capture the perfect shot, while the rubberized handle was great for gripping and the trigger button was inlaid beneath the surface material so minimal pressure was required to engage it. Where the design fell a little flat for us was the telescoping portion, which seemed almost to have a plastic shell- this looks a little cheap up front.*The materials are very lightweight being primarily aluminum, so this stick doesn't feel heavy on the wrist when fully extended. This is important not only for comfort, but for a steady, clear, photo opportunity.*Our unit did not come with a charge out of the box- which is something we look for in electronics such as this- however, it did charge in just over an hour and allowed us bout 30 minutes of Bluetooth connective time on that charge.*Bluetooth connection was straightforward and came up on our device as 'iSelfie' in the Bluetooth device menu. We've found about 1 in 5 pairs that our Android phones will not label the device by name, merely a series of numbers and letters. However, unless you're trying t pair several items at once, this is of little consequence.*There are 5 different length settings for the telescoping rod, up to almost 3 feet in length, so you can get that perfect intimate selfie, or scenic panoramic and group shot, all from one device.*The grasping harness at the end of the selfie stick has great range and extends to over 3 inches, making it capable of taking most small end phablets and all current Galaxy and iPhone models. For us, this was one of the biggest highlights of the phone- this joint, it's secure hold on our device, and the numerous angles which we could arrange it while still being able to securely lock it in place for photo-taking. This unit is all one piece and securely affixed to the rest of the device, so it is not removable or interchangeable with other style mounts (such as GoPro) or able to be transferred to singular mono-pods and photography stands. It's our opinion this singular one-piece build makes the unit stronger as a whole and more likely to hold up over time as you don't have to fear parts stripping and becoming weak.*This selfie stick comes with an included wrist strap which actually fit quite snug around Jay's wrist, and a little looser around mine. This device also comes with a carry case that seems to be made of durable nylon.*The device folds up rather compact, as the bracket at the very end actually tucks down along the base making it one of the more compact self-shooting aids we've seen. A device like this should be functional first, and portable second, so we're quite pleased with how small it folds up and how easy ti is to transport.*There is a threading on the base of the stick/handle to mount the device onto a secondary photo aid/tripod- though the bluetooth function must be triggered by the buttons on the handle- so this is only of use to stabilize the image when deing standard/traditional phone photography.Nays:*We had a hard time getting the telescoping shaft to extend and to lock. Even with the twisting motion, which seems quite intuitive, it took two of us to fully extend and lock this selfie stick initially. Because of this I worry that it might lose some of it's stability and ability to lock over time- though we we have not noticed any issues with the joints yet.*The side charging port, located near the trigger buttons, is very tight and at first we couldn't get it to engage properly and charge. Perhaps this is because there is a slight lip where the port is inlaid? While this is an inconvenience, so long as you verify charging status, after plugging it in and, before walking away it's a minor issue.*Not compatible with Window's phones- so it would not be appropriate to gift unless the recipient uses an iOS or Android device.In all, this is our second most used selfie stick in our collection, and a great bargain for the price. We've yet to find another self-shooting aid with such a sturdy mount build and Bluetooth connectivity that offers such portable and discreet transportation. The black finish and design is equally slick and could even pass as professional (rather than touristy) which is important when gifting. We received a product discount in exchange for our honest thoughts and experiences, which we have shared here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R54PPZEO8S4KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZRE71GA#wasThisHelpful","R54PPZEO8S4KM","A14OGV4C8KQ86F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14OGV4C8KQ86F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the WHITE Touch Professional Scale (as shown in our photos,) this product also comes in black and red: We have bought several scales for gifts and use in our own home through the years. Many of our small 'kitchen' scales wind up going to use in the office for packages and postage measurements. When we saw this scale in person, I immediately knew I'd be keeping it in the kitchen for everyday use with ingredients and food portioning.The Yays:*At just under 9"" at it's longest, and 3/4 of an inch in thickness this scale is very low profile and easy to store in just about any space. Because of the gorgeous tempered glass top I don't feel comfortable storing it on it's side in my kitchen, but it easily could be tucked away with cutting boards if desired.*2 AAA batteries are included in the box, so one can begin using their new scale right away.*This scale has a great range, covering 4 different measurement units. My Ozeri scale, I've been using up until now, tops out around 10lbs, so the 15lb weight limit here makes a big difference and the wider platform (plus reinforced tempered glass top) make this the perfect versatile scale for use in the home and kitchen. I was impressed that I could actually get it to measure and read out a quantity as low as 3 grams.*Highly accurate- I measured an apple alongside two other kitchen scales and all 3 read out identical. Make sure you always use your scale on a hard, flat, surface. There are gripping feet on the bottom of this scale but it will not measure accurately if on fabric (such as kitchen towels.)*Not only does the tempered glass top make this scale look elegant, it is impressively easy to clean and keep sanitary. I love that all buttons are touch operated and there are no cracks/crevasses/protrusions to collect direct and grime.The Mehs:*The packaging is nothing to write home about- if anything it does this product a disservice- The packaging could use a modernization to make it more appealing and gift friendly.*Okay, the 'no screwdriver needed' easy off battery backing- it looks pretty cheap. I used a butter-knife to wedge it off, with some effort- and after two time it's got some scuffing and deformation at the compartment notch. It just doesn't seem up to par with the rest of the scale.*I wish the back of the screen was back-lit.*While the scale will auto-time out after a short period not in use, I would like to see an on/off switch.I don't give a lot of 5 star reviews, especially when I have previously owned such a wide range of products in higher price points, but this scale is a bargain for the money. I would really love to get my hands on a red one to match my KitchenAid mixer!

"I invested in these hoping I could improve my efficiency in the kitchen through an increased confidence in my knife skills- If I'm not focusing so much on not cutting myself then I can cut my fruits and veggies faster and more precise. I ordered a Large, as my hands tend to be long and slender and these arrived true to the advertised measurements.*The packaging is nothing special and these look quite underwhelming when they arrive- I wouldn't gift them, but they are suitable for home use.*The materials seems to be woven with some intensity and overlapping but is not heavy or tough to manipulate. Naturally, the first thing I wanted to go was run a sharpened blade along them. I was quite surprised that I could even recreate the product photo and grasp the blade. The gloves didn't seem to snag at all.*There is a rather large sewn in tag that was pretty bothersome when cutting, which I promptly removed.*The buyer needs to have accurate ideals about this product's protection level and experience; as the listing says t is not puncture proof. I have a knife similar to the product images and the very tip does poke and hurt when it runs directly into the glove. Do not use serrated knives with these gloves, and do not try to re-purpose them for gardening.*These gloves fit very snug, making them easy to manipulate, use, and wear when handling food. I've found I can keep them on to handle pots/ladles/lids in between kitchen prep.*I tested these with strawberries to see how well the fabric would hold up to stains. After rinsing in hot water the material's integrity seems in tact but there is a faint discoloration where the strawberry juices especially soaked in. It's not a big deal for me, as these are for kitchen use- but it's worth a note as I know some more pricey gloves and different materials are stain resistant.In summary, for the price point these are a great pair of cut resistant gloves for the home cook and casual chef. They allow maximum mobility, but could use a larger size to account for the tight fit. I'd like to see the product tag sewn in or 'tagless,' and it would be nice to see some stain resistance. These certainly do the job and are a great tool to have on hand.

"Whenever I review an electronic, especially one dealing with audio output, people always wants to compare a high end unit to a value brand, when, in fact, its apples to oranges.I don't use my Infinity One portable speaker for the same sound output, situations, or locations as I do my JBL Charge 2. While part of it has to do with one being valued at almost triple the other- the majority of my reasoning is in the strengths one device has over the other. And yes, even in a much lower end device you are bound to find applications more suited to a $100 speaker than a $300 one. While one may deliver crisp expansive audio, the other may have a significantly longer battery standby life, for example.Primarily, for us, this bluetooth speaker has an appeal in the range of features it boasted at such an expendable price point. No one wants to hear their product is 'expendable,' but our brand loyalty to Sentey comes mostly from their execution of easy to use, functional, gaming products under a $50 price point. The convenience of Bluetooth devices lie in the portability of the product, and the vary nature of being portable puts a tech device in harms way from circumstances such as theft, water damage, and improper use (especially if your devices are used in communal circumstances.) While I would love to take my Infinity One to work at the marina and in the golf cart, my paycheck can't afford any mishaps around water or sticky hands from teenage skateboarders. In that case, I desire portable audio that is quick to setup, long lasting in life, and durable in design- with a price point under $50- so here we are testing the Sentey Bluetooth 4.0:Yays:*We always start with packaging- This speaker looks like it could have just come off Best Buy's shelf- It was packaged in a sturdy box inside an outer packaging sleeve. Not only did the box seem like it could withstand shipping and even continual storage, it was colorful and informative, something you don't often see in a value tech brand.*The design is very attractive- many 'bargain' bluetooth speakers come in bright gaudy colors that look and feel cheap- or targeted towards tweens. The slick black facing and 360 speaker design is very modern and style friendly for any geographic or setting. I love how the buttons on the top are inlaid under the rubber coated material so the speaker's operation is quite intuitive and seamless. While this speaker is not waterproof in a sense it could fall into water, the buttons on the top are all beneath the facing, so one could handle it with damp or wet hands without worry (this would be great in a kitchen when working on a recipe.)*This speaker includes a complimentary carry case, which you will want to use because the rubberized top and bottom coating seems to scuff easily. The case fits a little snug and has a drawstring close.*A big plus for me was the ability to play while plugged in- and the device even seemed to maintain or gain a charge while playing and charging. This mainly means I can use it as a stationary speaker in my office for an entire day without having to fuss with it.*Bluetooth pairing was quick, my devices located it on the first scan and there was no searching or fancy button configurations- simply turn it on and put your streaming device in Bluetooth discovery mode.*The product advertises up to 33 feet of connection thanks to Bluetooth 4.0 technology. This is a direct line of path claim- with minor obstructions such as furniture and a dresser, we maintained about a 15 foot connectivity. I COULD keep connectivity through the wall but this was a pretty direct proximity, best estimated at 8 to no more than 10 feet. When outside with no obstructions we successfully measured 30 feet of crisp, uninterrupted transmission.*I like that there is a direct on/off switch so there is never confusion about whether the speaker is on or off- this helps save battery life.*Speaking of battery life- This DOES have exceptional battery life for the value and clarity. On a full charge of Bluetooth wireless radio app streaming we've clocked 7 hours and 50 minutes play time.*The sound is stereo with 2 5 watt drivers for 10 watts total at about 125-250hz audio output. The bass on this speaker is fairly impressive for the price and size but not the same caliber as high output speakers you'd find over $200. In general, this speaker does beautifully with layered audio and instrumental heavy tracks- vocals can sound a little tinny at times (illustrated on the devices bluetooth calling feature) but in general what this device lacks in precision clarity (and don't get me wrong, it's great audio for the price range) it makes up in volume. Oh so very much volume. I can fill an entire veranda or pool deck with the output from this single portable speaker.Mehs:*While it seemed to turn 'on' out of the box, it would not pair- This is because it had no prior or residual charge. In general it's a pet peeve of mine when electronics don't include batteries, or a partial charge. No one wants to open a gift and have to wait hours to play with it.*Charge time from empty to full was long for a device of this size and output- it took nearly 3 hours (2 hours 45 minutes) to charge out of the box.*The upper and bottom material is a rubberized grip that is soft and slick but seems to scuff very easy.*The included cables aren't the highest quality or length. If you are an audiophile you likely have better quality cabled laying around- the charging cable, in particular fit a little snug for my liking. We use our own cables for aux and charging.*This claims to deliver big sound without the bulk- I feel it is one of the more bulky bluetooth speakers I own, especially for amp and bass output. Bulky can be a good thing, especially when you plan on using the speaker outdoors ad in social stations often. Bulky, in this case, also means it has weight in the hand and feels like it is built well- however, it certainly is not a dainty speaker.*It's hard to determine when you are done charging the speaker, and there's no real way to know how many hours or what percentage of battery life you have left. A visual queue or different colored light/patterns would be nice.In summary, this product performs at a believable range for it's list price of $69, and we've found it a great deal for the current asking price of $34 with prime. I like that this speaker has more of a presence than some of other other 'micro and portable bluetooth audio options and feel confident enough in the product that I would gift one to any casual to moderate music lover.

"I bought these so I could transplant some of my bounty of baby tomato plants and expand my harvest... Each of my tomato pods produced 4 sprouts and so when I went to thin them out, I thought why not transfer the extras into spare pods and put them in my other AeroGarden.... Well it worked a treat.  I carefully split the roots and planted them in two of the pods and put them on growth mode in my spare garden.  I expect a bumper crop.

"I love that this case matches my Chiaogoo Interchangeable sets.  I own the regular 5"" red set and a custom 4"" white set that I use to make hats and sleeves.  I decided I wanted to make myself a set of larger dpn's because I do make a lot of hats in the winter and it seems like I am always hunting down my needles.  This case fits the bill perfectly.There are 6 slots... my first slot actually holds both my size 4 and 5 dpns, then 6 and 7 on the left side in their own slots... the right side holds 8, 9 and 10, even though the 10s are in there very snuggly, they do fit and the case zips up.

"So many reviews complaining about how small they are when the dimensions are right there in the description, the measurements are accurate.  Good thing tiny is exactly what I wanted and needed for a formal occasion I was invited to.These are NOT too small for an adult woman, they are petite and understated, and don't call attention to themselves even though they do catch the light a tiny bit, they are not sparkly at all... better than a naked earlobe or a tiny gold stud.  They cling closely to the earlobe but there is room between the lobe and earring that allows movement, they don't pinch, they don't get caught in my hair or pull.I am an older woman with multiple piercings... I will probably use these on an upper hole later on instead of my lobe, but for the occasion I bought them for, they were absolutely perfect....

"My figure is quite lopsided - size 22 on top and size 16 on the bottom... I usually am forced to buy for my bust size when purchasing dresses and it leaves me looking/feeling fat even if I add belt to gather in all the extra fabric below, or if I try on something closer to my waist size, my cleavage come flying out at the wrong time.. It is VERY rare I find a dress that flatters my shape and still corrals my breasts in an attractive manner.This dress does it.  I bought it to attend a memorial service and it was totally appropriate for the occasion.  I moved and bent and socialized all day without any bunching or readjustments or discomfort. The neckline looks nice on me, interesting and yet classic. I wore a simple strand of pearls and they were framed perfectly, this dress will easy to dress up or down with different jewelry...  The sleeve length is nice too.  I felt like I looked great all day long and never once worried about my appearance... Better yet, I looked shapely and beautiful in all the family photos.Now for the best news... I am sure this dress runs just a little large.  It's drapey and stretchy enough to hug the curves in a pleasing way.  I would have been better off with one size smaller, but even then, since this is a true wrap dress, it fit me fine and I was able to cinch it up to make my waist well defined even though it was a little big.  This dress travels in the suitcase very nicely too, no wrinkles or fold creases at all. I do plan to wear this dress quite a bit as my ""little black dress"" over the upcoming holidays.  It looks great on me.Bottom line is that I do think it's a little overpriced for what it is and what it's made of.

"This fit is amazing.  It's snug and form fitting but not tight and restricting.  The mid rise is exactly right and hits me at a perfect spot. This is the exact amount of bootcut I like too.  I don't have ""mom butt"".  They don't slice me in half when I sit or eat.  I think I look great in these!  WILL BUY AGAIN!!But these are long long long, the other reviews weren't kidding.  I'm 5'10"" and these drag the ground when I am in my stocking feet.  Usually when pants say tall, they hit me at the top of my foot, skim the top of my shoes, but so many reviewers said these were too long so I figured they would be the perfect length.  Nope, these are super long, so I won't be wearing flats with these, and that's OK.  Next time I order these I'll try for the regular length and see how that goes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20XKZC6LDQVM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDTNX8A#wasThisHelpful","R20XKZC6LDQVM6","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know why this has all these glowing reviews??  I bought 12 of these to replace the ""kiddie alphabet"" snap together blocks I had been using.  I found that some of those had color transfer onto the towel I used to cover the surface.  I always wondered if one day they might transfer onto my knitting... I had just finished a beautiful pi shawl so I decided to reward myself with new tiles.I originally chose these over some of the other professional blocking tiles because a) they had a printed grid, which I think will be necessary and b) you could buy them singly and not be tied into into multiple sets of 9 and c) Boye is a brand I have heard of and thought would be a decent quality product....Reality is different - first off, these tile reek - and not just a little, it's overpowering.  Each one is sealed tight into it's package and it just keeps the chemical smell fresh from the factory straight to your craft room.  I have tried washing them and airing them outdoors, but the smell still lingers.  Worse yet, it attaches itself to your knitting.  I piled towels over the surface before I blocked, but once it's wet it just permeates the whole stack... And piling towels sort of defeats the purpose of having grids.Secondly, these are way thinner and/or less dense than they ought to be.  Even pinning at a severe angle away from your knit edge or blocking wires won't keep the T-pin embedded into the tile (see my photo).  It will not stay taut and wants to creep toward the center of your work which sort of defeats the purpose of blocking, and it's not that I'm blocking tight or overly stretched, it's normal wet blocking that I've done time and time again.  The tiles themselves also tend to bend and bow at the interlocking seam under normal amount of pressure.  I think these were never intended for larger projects like sweaters...  Those pin holes won't heal up either... once they're there, it's always there and very conspicuous.... The only advantage of these thin, light tiles it that they take up very little room in storage.I invested so much money and thought in choosing and buying of these tiles, thinking they would last me for many years to come, but I just cant wait to get rid of them.  I may keep one or two of them to block small kitchen knitting like dishcloths, but never again for a big project like a shawl.  I can't believe that my cheap old playroom tiles are better than these tiles that are made specifically for blocking - I'm very disappointed... My next tiles will be plain white interlocking floor tiles, at least 1/2"" thick... anything has to be firmer and denser than these things.  I think I've decided that the grid feature is not worth it after all.BTW - the blocking wires I use are Inspinknity brand flexible blocking wires - They are pretty much perfect in every way.  I love them!","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CNC3YQAGBVZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESL5YHQ#wasThisHelpful","R3CNC3YQAGBVZK","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My big winder was out on loan so I bought this one to wind several lace skeins.  The price is excellent and I do not plan to use it often.  I normally use a U-nitt Jumbo ball winder - I highly recommend investing in that large winder if you regularly wind anything over 50g of yarn... They say this one is good up to 4oz (113gr), but that's really pushing it... Smaller balls, this one is perfect and fast.First task once this winder is out of the box is to take an emery board and file off all the sharp and rough plastic bits and edges.  Once this smoothing is done, the winder is fairly wonderful.  Several reviews complain about the eye not staying upright and I found that to be true as well until I figure out that I had not pulled it out far enough to fully secure it into place.  If it seems like it is out as far as it should be, but it is still a bit floppy, pull out just a bit harder and it works better.  Once I did that it stayed firmly in the upright position perfectly through all the rest of the skeins.... I attached mine to a wooden cutting board instead of a table and did many skeins right there from my lap while I watched a couple of movies on TV.Use a swift to keep the tangles at bay, then crank slowly and smoothly and it winds just fine... as expected.  Nice, neat center pull balls, nothing got caught in the gears or went astray.  The key is slow and even cranking while you keep a gentle tension on the yarn while feeding through the eye.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16IRKEP02FOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DKW9F6A#wasThisHelpful","R16IRKEP02FOO","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally bought this as a joke birthday gift for my son who is a huge Nirvana fan.  Well the jokes on me because he uses it and likes it and loves going around asking girls to smell him and guess what he smells like (yeah yeah -- I know, I'm not proud of this behavior - If the girls would stop burying their noses in his neck and chest area he would stop using this cheesy pick-up line).The smell is sort of like berries, not overly feminine or flowery.

"I got my piercing 3 months ago and was finally ready for a new stud, so this is the one I chose... I love it!  It's discrete and yet sparkly.  Many people don't even notice it's there unless it catches the light.I had never tried to put a pigtail stud in before (my original stud is just a straight bend).  Getting the screw in really didn't work well for me and hurt a LOT, but a friend had the solution.  She told me to take my smoothest pliers and gently straighten out just the end so the curve is not so tight.  It worked a charm, and went right in, and rested nicely on my nose.  It feels very secure and looks exactly like I envisioned it ought to.  I'm so pleased with how this looks that I'm not changing it out for a long time.The bonus of this purchase is the darling box the stud came in... It's a little pink drawer with some black foam in the bottom.  Cute cute cute!!  I'm planning on storing my future new studs in this box until I have too many, which may take awhile.  Easy to keep them all in one place and looks sweet sitting on my dresser.  It would be a nice gift box too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34FPTY35XNPQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009H7VEZC#wasThisHelpful","R34FPTY35XNPQO","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love these.  Easy to customize.  It doesn't mention it in the description, but each one comes with two clear, tabbed dividers too.I put a ponytail elastic around mine to keep the cover shut, and that works very well for me.  It tends to not want to ever stay closed.This size fits nicely in my bag for easy access to my notes any time I need them.  Each binder can hold *almost* 150 cards if you smush them in tight.  Plenty of room to snap a pen into the binder rings before you fold it up.  Keeps it handy.My one and only complaint about this Oxford line is that the refills they expect you to use with this are lined on one side only.  The cards that came in the binder are printed on both sides, but the refills are not the same index cards at all.

"I always wondered why my brewed iced green tea never tasted like the green tea from the restaurant or from a bottle.  I wanted to drink it for the health benefits and stop drinking so many carbonated drinks...

I started buying several different brands, but I never did make a nicely brewed iced green tea that satisfied me, until now.... Cold brew!  I don't even have to think about it.My daughter swears *only* Luzianne teas when she makes her (simple syrup based) sweet tea, but I had never tried it before this purchase.  I normally used PG Tips, which makes a wonderful hot tea, but not so much for iced tea... This cold brew turned out perfect the very first time I tried it.

"These are beautiful, but getting that ribbon wound round the invitation correctly and staying in place was a nightmare.  I eventually gave up doing it their way and decided to double up the ribbon, twist it a bit and glue it to the band, then offset the pearlized bow and forget about the X shape... Good grief. However there is PLENTY of ribbon to do whatever you desire on that band, so be creative. The little pearl bows are not so great, be prepared to hot glue them back together because they seem to pop apart very easily, but they sure are pretty once they are together properly.Printing was insanely easy.  I downloaded the Word templates off the Wilton website and they works perfectly in every way even though I am running Open Office for Mac instead of Word - It integrated seamlessly and produced a perfect invitation on my laser printer..  I was very pleased with the printed invitations.  They all turned out great.  I tried using Wilton's online template, but I found it fiddly to work with and unreliable in printing... the Word templates were so much easier.Be aware that the little pearl poking up inside your envelope will raise the postage quite a bit because they need special handling and can't go through the machine... but the happy part of this, is that the post office has some gorgeous wedding stamps that are the exact amount you will need for this size/shape/weight of envelope.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDELRWLUYTZ1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042VJST2#wasThisHelpful","RDELRWLUYTZ1I","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The best part of this set is that silicone mat, I've never used one before, but in my mind it ought to be an essential item for every glue gun... I had dozens of little bows and flowers and ribbons and organza bags to decorate as wedding favors.  I glued the flowers and the bows and laid them on that mat.. they cooled there so nicely and didn't stick.  Then I rolled the mat into a tube and put it inside each little organza bag so we could glue it all together with no mess and no fuss and no sticking to themselves.  They looked great... easy and fast.  We did the whole wedding decorations and items very quickly with very little mess.  But I could have used two of those mats (grin)This is a nice medium sized gun that has a precision trigger and gets really hot.  So much better than the teeny gun I had before.

"I bought this for my daughter who is a beginning knitter.  I have made several of the BSJ and she wanted me to teach her and her dorm-mate how to do this simple little jacket so they could give them as gifts to friends who were new mothers.She came home from school and we never got around to knitting, so I bought this DVD as an alternative that she can do on her own time... she loves it and has already completed one little sweater in time for a baby shower she was invited to.  It was easy for her to rewind and go back to see any technique that she had questions about (without calling mommy!)I did watch this DVD myself before I sent it off to her and it is absolutely perfect.  Meg is such a loving and patient teacher who makes the knitter feel confident in their technique and their project.  She makes it seem easy for anyone, because she shows some common mistakes, she laughs them off and shows the knitter how to easily fix the problem without any care or fuss....

"This is a wonderful set to try out the Knitter's Pride needles before you commit to a full expensive set that you may or may not like.  I applaud the company for putting this unique idea into the marketplace.

I also purchased the Comby 2 set elsewhere (not Amazon)... That set is also worth a look if you are in the market for new needles.I'm not going to say exactly which needles I liked and which I did not like because that is such a personal preference for each and every kntter.  Even my daughters and I disagree on what type of needles and features we like, so it's impossible to say one is better than the others.... I can say that I am glad we tried out these samplers and I do wish that more companies would follow Knitter's Pride's lead and make needle and cord assortments for knitters to try out, and play with, before they invest in a full set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18VWXH2NW0WOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006R9JGMG#wasThisHelpful","R18VWXH2NW0WOG","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend recommended this pillow.  I already had a (very expensive) neck supporting memory foam pillow, but I was still having neck pain and back pain every morning because it was uncomfortable to me and held my head at a weird angle.  I'm sure my other pillow was meant for a back sleeper and I am a side sleeper.  This pillow is perfect for sleeping on my side... either side.I have been using this pillow for months now and I love it.  I never wake up with neck pain any more and that is great.I do find myself flipping the pillow a couple of times a night because of the warmth factor, but that's just my personal preference for a cooler pillow.  This one seems to trap heat a bit and I like the fact I can just flip it over and it's the same support and comfort level on both sides.  It's easy on my neck and cradles my shoulder exactly as it should.... When this one loses it's memory, I will buy this same pillow again.However, the smell of the new pillow right out of the box is horrendous... I ended up putting mine on the dryer rack and running it on the ""no heat"" setting for quite awhile with some Bounce sheets, and that helped.  I suppose you could get the same effect by placing it near a fan for a couple of days.  It just needs aired out.

"My property backs up onto some state land that has a large feral cat colony back there (please do not suggest I contact the authorities - been there, done that, city county and state, nobody cares). Three to four times in the kitten season, I try to trap and spay/neuter/inoculate as many as possible on our fence line so OUR property and yard is not overrun with stray cats who wander in if they get too overpopulated in their colony.... We have been doing this for many years now. Plus I try to get as many young kittens out of there as I can, so they can possibly be tamed and adopted.... even so, lots of the ferals I trap are just too unhealthy and have to be put down, which is sad. It seems to be a never ending problem for us.  Feral cats are wiley and fertile creatures.I think the Havahart is the best trap out there right now. We have tried plenty of other brands over the years and Havahart is the only ones I keep using and buying. I got this particular trap from the vine program and have ""field tested"" it for the past two weeks and it has performed well. This model has trapped two problem cats we have not been able to catch in our other traps which made me insanely happy because there will be no more midnight yowling and fighting from these two overly aggressive toms.Bait... I just smear the cheapest, stinkiest, moist cat food I can find over the plate and it has done the job nicely.  I try to put plenty of food in the trap in the mornings I set them just because I might not go check them until afternoon.  Then I set them all off before dinnertime so I don't accidently get a skunk (ick).I have to say I love the big handle. It's sturdy and there is no danger of hurting your hand. But I worry a bit that some people might not take the care to wear good work gloves when they are handling this trap just because the handle is so easy. *You should ALWAYS wear work gloves when handling a trap*.My favorite feature is the one handed setting lever. No more fiddling around with the plate or messing with the little pegs that have to be lined up just so. It is quick and easy to set up and go.  The only problem I have with this lever mechanism, is that I could not set and leave the trap with a covering (small wool blanket) on it like I sometimes do in rainy weather.  I'm still considering some kind of tenting option for fall weather.I like this size... It's perfect for both cats and kittens.  The plate on this one seems quite sensitive, but time will tell if it triggers for tiny kittens, I'll update the review and adjust my stars once I know.  It is currently the wrong season for trapping the little ones (and just in case you were wondering, we always let the obviously nursing mothers go free).I only found it triggered and empty once, so that seems pretty good accuracy compared to some of my older traps I use.  I am well pleased with this trap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L8UNQ5ZKTRTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QP328I#wasThisHelpful","R3L8UNQ5ZKTRTM","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I had the pleasure of reading this edition aloud to my teenage boys (who complained at first when I asked them to indulge mommy, but they ended up listening to the whole thing and enjoyed it).  This classic, well written story is as timeless as ever, and I am happy it is being re-introduced to a new generation.I feel like this book will never lose it's appeal (unlike many of the modern *blockbuster* YA books being released)It is obvious from the ads in the book that this edition was published to promote it's companion book Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Flies Again and these vine offers were timed for the release of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and the Race Against Time.

The rotation is nice if that is all you want and the vibration is good for the front, but if you prefer vibrations inside and out, this is not the toy you want.It works, it's well made and confirmed water-proof.I like Doc Johnson Lucid Dream 48 Squirmy Vibrator, Purple, it's a simple design but does the job.  And if you like the same fingers on the front vibrator that this one has, Doc Johnson Lucid Dream 32 Squirmy Vibrator, Red has the exact same front (which is lovely) with an additional vibrating head on the shaft.  I own both these and like them both.  I bought this white one to mix it up a bit, but it's not ever going to be one of my favorite go-to toys.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZGZNJRPMESBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JVCCGU#wasThisHelpful","RZGZNJRPMESBB","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I specifically got this for my disabled relative.  She often complains of being cold and achey when she sits still and I thought this would take care of her.  This wrap is the size of of a large bath towel and it fit on her lap and down her legs perfectly and keeps her toasty clear to her toes.  The low setting is warm enough for her and I know it won't burn her.  The wrap has never overheated or become uncomfortable for her and the timer works perfectly.The bonus for her is that the kitty now comes to snuggle in her warm lap and she is enjoying that company very much.This wrap has amazing cuddly softness... Softer than I thought it would be.  I did have to wash it once, I followed the instructions and that turned out just fine and came back just as soft as it was originally.  I like the fact that the cord disconnects from the wrap and occasional wipe-up is easy.  This wrap has worked very well for our needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIGO43E5LJ4A1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HIQD5Y#wasThisHelpful","RIGO43E5LJ4A1","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a little Biore party with my daughters and we had lots of fun comparing how disgusting and full of little spikey pore gunk our strips were.  It is odd how much time we spent looking at the strips after we peeled them... eww[...]  The strips do a great job, they stung just a little on me and my skin was a little itchy afterward, but both my daughters were fine and didn't experience any irritation at all.I like the way the nose strips fit our noses.  I used the other strip my forehead and a half a strip on my chin, so obviously I would prefer a combo pack that would include twice as many facial strips.  I will buy these again.UPDATE JULY, 2013... These are still five star strips and they work well, but if you can find the Ultra strips, try those.  I have older skin and I think they get my teeny blackheads cleaned out better than these do, plus they added Tea Tree oil which feels really fresh on my face.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNFR2PV6X1NLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0068G8EZ8#wasThisHelpful","RNFR2PV6X1NLK","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a light read, it went very quickly, humorous, well written, with cute illustrations.  I have so enjoyed the adventure of Tibby and Fibby. (and Caroline and Wendy too)I too have lost a precious kitty friend before.  He disappeared for an entire year, and yet somehow, he found his way home, showed up on the porch for breakfast one day like he had never been gone.  I couldn't believe it.  I am still mystified over where he went for such a long time, how he got lost in the first place, and how he found his way back.  I loved that this author chose to find out about her cat's disappearance and to track her cat to see a glimpse into a cat's world.  I think it is something we all wonder at times.I also currently have a (collar-free) stranger cat who comes right into my porch every morning, eats with my cats, gets petted for awhile, then he parks himself on the swing cushion with my Calico, and they sleep there all afternoon.  Around dinnertime he disappears again, and I assume he goes home, where his owners probably wonder where he has been and what he has been doing all day... After reading this book I am planning to send them some kind of note so they know what a boring life their baby actually leads in my yard.Overall this was a delightful peek into the lives and habits of the felines we love.  I am planning to buy several copies of this book to gift to my cat loving friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OKTTLL3W67W0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608199770#wasThisHelpful","R3OKTTLL3W67W0","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for a 12m baby that was coming over to my house to visit for the holiday.  She loved it.The colors are bright and inviting, the crinkles and noises are not annoying at all and actually kept her attention, everything was well attached and the fabrics were interesting to her small hands.  They are easy to cuddle and carry and easy to clean.My Princess does not have a white ring attached to her head at all and I am kind of pleased that she doesn't.  Princess got 5x as much play as the Pony did, but that's OK.  If I had it to do over again I still would have purchased the set instead of the Princess alone....

"I bought this brand as a more affordable alternative to the organic raw sugar I usually used in my Water Kefir and it turned out great.  I am well pleased with the results.  The flavor is quite strong and very molasses like, so if you don't like that taste, take a pass on this product.  The texture is quite different too, but it dissolves nicely in liquid so that is not an issue.I also started using this on my morning oatmeal and occasionally in my tea and I love it.  I have yet to try it in baking and I probably won't because I am sure the molasses taste will overpower whatever else is in there.

"I'm not really sure how long this paint will last because as I was removing the plastic (which is very sturdy), specks and tiny bits of paint came peeling from many of the license plates.  It's not enough to make them unrecognizable, but it's enough to make them look like they are not fresh and new.  I expect the board to have a similar fate once the plates are turned 20-30 more times.  Since this will not be played with too often, this is not an urgent problem.  It is not a real issue, just a minor annoyance.This is a nice big board, the elastics seem to be tight and secure and that is a nice feature because there is nothing to get lost and the pieces stay in proper play when they are turned.  I love that, because there are no arguments over which side is up.  I don't really like the 'who saw it first' aspect or the team play, so we use it as a cooperative game instead of a competitive game.  I suppose if I had to redesign this board, I would make the plates slightly smaller so that more of them would actually fit on their state, instead of so many of them out in the ocean with arrows pointing into land.I think this is probably the best made license game out there right now.  The parental frustration factor on this game is close to zero just for the simple reason that riders of ALL ages can easily play, the entire vehicle can be involved in the fun, it can be put away and picked up later with no loss in game progress and the pieces never get lost.  Easy to stash away in the car pockets.  Do not get the magnetic games.  Get this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AF5JP3OOKXOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006HMQTKA#wasThisHelpful","R2AF5JP3OOKXOB","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought several of these to hang along my office window to catch the morning light.  I have had them up for 10 days now.  These are a nice size, heavy, well cut, about as big as a golf ball and the color is not too watery... it looks very nice in the sunshine.They look so pretty and sparkly hanging there, pink and shiny and beautiful, but for the most part these balls fail at sending out the prism rainbows onto my walls like I wanted and expected them to.  The few sparkles I get are very small and not very bright.  I have tried them at different levels on the window and at different times of day without any different results, so I have just decided to hang them there as a beautiful decoration and love them as light 'catchers' instead of light 'diffusers'....I did not receive any little crystals attached to mine, so it must be different sellers send different versions of this crystal.

"I got two of the Lilac in my pkg instead of one Raspberry and one Lilac.... This kind of upset me because different colors would have been cute to differentiate between mine and a guest.  The description is not clear that you get one OR the other and have no choice of which one it's going to be.These are much stiffer/sturdier than I anticipated also. They fit nicely on a straight sided mug but not so well on a teacup (mine have a bit of a scallop shape down the sides which would not be a problem for a softer plastic or silicone).

"My property backs up onto some state land that has a large feral cat colony back there (please do not suggest I contact the authorities - been there, done that, city county and state, nobody cares).  I try to trap and spay/neuter/inoculate as many as possible every summer so OUR property and yard is not overrun with stray cats who wander in if they get too overpopulated in their colony.... We have been doing this for many years now.  Plus I try to get as many young kittens out of there as I can, so they can possibly be tamed and adopted.... even so, lots of the ferals I trap are just too unhealthy and have to be put down, which is sad.  By now, I consider myself somewhat of an expert on traps and what works and what doesn't, and I LOVE this trap!I think the Havahart is the best trap out there right now.  We have tried plenty of other brands over the years and Havahart is the only ones we keep using and buying.  I got this particular trap from the vine program and have ""field tested"" it for 12 days now right next to our regular traps and it has performed very well.  It is certainly different from the older models I own.  This has some features on it that I actually prefer to the older traps we have been using. (please see my uploaded photos of side by side comparison)I have to say I loved the handle right from the start.  It's big and sturdy and there is no danger of hurting your hand.  But I worry a bit that some people might not take the care to wear good work gloves when they are handling this trap just because the handle is so easy.  *You should ALWAYS wear gloves when handling a trap*.  But it sure was nice having that big handle with solid metal underneath while trying to carry a angry struggling cat to the garage... So much easier to keep control of the trap than the old wire handle.  It wasn't swinging around wildly and nobody got clawed or hurt, including the cat.My favorite feature is the one handed setting lever.  No more fiddling around with the plate or messing with the little pegs that have to be lined up just so and might trigger with a strong breeze or a mousey passing by.  It was quick and easy to set up and we never once found it triggered and empty just because some critter was sniffing at it from the side and set off the plate by accident.  It was also SO much easier to release the cat into the carrier we use for transport.  I just butted the two openings together, pulled the lever and emptied the cat out just as easy as can be.  Way less trauma for the cat too because we weren't fumbling with the lock while the cat was twisting around banging into the door.  It was so much more pleasant for all of us, including the trapped cat.  I may start using the trap itself for transport just because it was so easy to release, but I like a solid bottom carrier in the car because they always manage to defecate during the car ride to the vet.  I'm still considering that idea.The only problem I see with the lever, is that we could not set and leave the trap with a covering (small wool blanket) on it like we sometimes do in cooler weather or in rain.  That seems to be the only real downfall of this design.I like this size... it was big enough that the kittens we caught felt safe enough to go in and get some of the delicious goodies inside and yet it was small enough that we didn't accidentally get a skunk or a raccoon, which is something that happens occasionally.... The plate was sensitive enough that we caught 2 tiny kittens who looked to be about 4-5 weeks and were quite small and light.  Normally we catch them at about 8-12 weeks when they are a bit heavier... I was pleased that we got some young ones because they often get away without setting off the trap and they are the ones who benefit the most from being caught and socialized.... the older kittens are harder to tame and less likely to be adopted.I like this trap so much and it has been so effective for me in the few days that I have used it, that I am planning to get a couple more with the easy lever and donate the other small traps I have to the animal shelter in town.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9UCHUCDQNX9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UFLIA0#wasThisHelpful","R9UCHUCDQNX9F","A1OD5F83ZA8O95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OD5F83ZA8O95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is certainly unique.  I have not seen anything quite like it on the market, so I was anxious to try it.I don't (yet) have regular hot flashes during the day, maybe just a little twinge of one here and there.  My big problem is waking in the middle of the night feeling like I just sat in the sun for an hour.  I normally get up and take a cold drink or grab a cold washcloth to take care of it, but that doesn't always help, and it sure disturbs my sleep.I have used this product for several days/nights now.  I put it on my bedside table, and when I wake up overheated, I go ahead and apply it to my neck, upper chest and wrists as the package recommends.  It does have a cooling sensation right away in those areas and I found if I calmly wait instead of getting up, it actually does seem to help and to cool me down faster than I would have been able to do with just the damp cloth on my forehead.  Maybe I will try a combination of both in the future.I like this type of roller too!!  It rolls easily, it is wide and cold... it applies the gel smoothly and evenly.  It has never been messy even when I am fumbling with the tube in the dark.  I also like the fact that it is designed so it has never caught any of my tiny skin hairs in the roller.  Quick and easy to use.The on and off twisty cap is great.  But I do wish the *on* letters and possibly the large arrow too were a different color or marked in a different way so those of us who need glasses up close can actually see which one is lined up, or to be able to see it lined up in low light situations.  That would be nice, especially since this is marketed to mid-life and older women.  Or possibly have the little clicker inside the twisty cap have a different sound for on?Do remember to turn the cap to off and roll out the rest of the gel before you put the lid on though.  That can be messyThe smell is pleasant, feminine, not overly perfumed and it does not linger.  It does not dry out the areas I apply it to like some of the sprays on the market right now.  I like that the tube is small, doesn't leak and would fit easily in a purse or drawer.

You don't really notice them until you really look, but it's a nice detail.  It fits my Pandora perfectly, no issues there.My biggest problem with this bead is that it rides upside down ALL the time, all I ever see when I glance down at my bracelet are the tires.  If I want to show this particular bead to anybody I have to turn it over.  I wish they had designed the hole in a slightly different place so it would either spin or stay upright instead.... balanced it differently or something.But of course, this is a ""Jeep thing"" and I try to laugh it off.... Whenever anyone asks to look at my various charms, I joke that that whoops, I 'rolled my Jeep', then I flip it over and show it off... but then as my friend is looking at the other beads, the Jeep rolls wheel side up again...

"Received this in a timely manner, with a coupon for a % discount on my next order... nice!The stones are well set, plenty of shine and light comes through.  The color is very true to my actual aquamarine ring, not too blue and not too watery looking.  The stones are very translucent, shiny and real looking.  The settings seem tight and secure and none of my stones are set off-kilter which pleases me very much.As a previous reviewer said, the bead is slightly larger than a genuine Pandora and the center hole is HUGE compared to genuine Pandora.  It shows that size difference in the product picture, but it didn't really register in my brain until I actually saw it on my bracelet.I do wish the hole was a little smaller because the bead tends to flop over a bit and poke up over the other beads occasionally when I am wearing it, but I suppose if the hole was smaller it wouldn't catch and reflect the light as well as it does, so I kind of understand why it is this way.... And I anticipate when my bracelet is full it might not wobble about as much as it does now.

"I bought a couple of these to keep my desk accessories tidy.  For some reason things get borrowed off my desk and don't get put back into the proper spot, these little caddies ought to help with that..

So far they are all holding tight.I like these so much I am going to buy one to hold pens at my house.UPDATE March 2013... The clear command strips gave out, one of my caddies dropped to the floor, and chipped a huge chunk out of the bottom.  That one still holds my stapler just fine (but not pens) so I decided to stick it back on my desk hutch with a regular white command strip I had left over from a big hook.

"I placed this on the sidewall under my desk, sort of up and back where it is not obvious to people walking near my area.  I don't have room in my desk for my purse, so I used to keep it near the side of my chair where it was always in the way of my feet and chair wheels.

"I have never written a review for something like socks, but for these I am making an exception.I wear a size 7 shoe.  These fit perfect.  Reason for review is that these socks were comfortable from the moment I put them on.  Normally I don't like to wear socks, but with these, I wore them all day into middle of night and they were still comfortable.No stretching, no sweating, no sliding around in shoes, not tight.  Just perfect!Love the variegated black/white color.  Have worn them with black shoes, black/white and white.  Really a very nice color blend and I could not be happier with the quality.  At $12 per two sets of socks, not exactly low price, but so definitely worth it!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28PAGEF2JEBNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHVOI5W#wasThisHelpful","R28PAGEF2JEBNP","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't really want to rate this item.  For others it might be perfect, for me, just didn't work out.I thought about keeping it.  I cut a piece of cardboard to fit the bottom to keep it from collapsing.  Didn't look great, but it worked.  However, and this is the main reason I returned it:  None of the child cups I had fit in the drink holder.  I could BARELY fit a water bottle in one of the pockets.  Both pockets were different sizes, so only one could actually be considered a drink holder.  Too difficult to get the cup or bottle into it, so I knew the kids wouldn't use it.If they made it so the bottom was firmer and increased the size of BOTH drink holders, and a divider added, would have been a fine product.  As it is, I returned it and found one that had exactly what I wanted.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39BG0KOQMG5TZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NMP6IG#wasThisHelpful","R39BG0KOQMG5TZ","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Worked perfect!  Bought this for a long car trip that we went on with other families.  Our car did not have a DVD player, so we brought along the iPad and purchased this headrest mount and it worked great!  Had no problems placing the iPad in or getting it out.  The bottom did move about some, but only if going over a bumpy road.  I'm only mentioning that because someone in a review said they attached a band or something to the bottom.  I can see why they did that and it is a great idea.  However, we found we did not need to do that.  Very glad I found this!One more thing:  I did had the iPad 2, but it started acting weird, fading in and out, so I bought a new iPad air 2.  Mentioning this because both iPads fit in this holder.  I bought a Snugg case for the new iPad and for my old iPad I had case very similar to the Snugg, and again, they both fit in this headrest mount.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DXTN0CALHPBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041GKBXU#wasThisHelpful","R2DXTN0CALHPBR","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this for a recent long car trip bringing along a five year old boy.  It stayed on the seat without moving around.  He was able to put his books, his Kindle, snacks, stuffed animal and other things in it.  He loved that he had his own 'space' for his things.  It kept everything in his reach, and from moving around on the seat.  Very convenient and well made.I purchased a different brand prior to this, and drinks would not fit in it.  So I returned that and purchased this one and very glad I did so.This one has nice mesh pockets on each side, and each hold a sippy cup or a bottle of water.  Note:  the pockets are not actually pockets, they are placed to put cups, meaning they are 'open'.  However, my fear that the water bottle would slide down did not happen.  Drinks stayed put.  Two large sections, helped divide food and books.I keep it in the car at all times now, between two booster seats.  Another nice thing about this, is that it does fold up if you want it to, but it does not collapse if you don't want it to.  Stays put.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J6G38P9B3BQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WNGV2Y2#wasThisHelpful","R3J6G38P9B3BQZ","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't have this item in front of me, nor can I give you the exact model mobility carts I purchased them for, but I can tell you these worked perfect for our needs.I recently took four disabled people to a theme park.  We brought two scooters with us, one was a Shoprider Cooper, and the other was very similar in size, but a different maker.  We also rented two mobility scooters at our destination, both of which were larger scooters, yet still 3 wheel.With the Cooper we already had one bag, so I purchased three more.  The bags fit all the scooters without problems and I am so glad we had them.  The baskets in most scooters are very small.  With these bags, we were able to put jackets, purses, kids spare clothes, etc...  No problems with getting them on or with them staying on.  Very well made.  The one we already had, we purchased a few years back and it is still in fine shape.So whether for your own mobility scooter or for a future rental, this really helps out a lot.  We brought the extras home and will save them for a future trip.  Money well spent!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29ALI0RSRE85Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00134FZOS#wasThisHelpful","R29ALI0RSRE85Y","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I do not claim to be an expert on car seats or booster seats, and others have left much more detailed reviews.  However, I thought I would add in my opinion to further help someone who is trying to decide on a booster seat.The measurements are approximately:  outside edges: 18 1/4 wide, by 16 1/4 deep.  The area where you actually sit, from inside of arm rest to other inside of arm rest: size is 9 and 3/4 wide, and widens out a little at the leg area.Why I like this booster seat over ALL the others I have purchased:First, it is really sturdy, feels and looks like quality and at a very affordable price. (in my opinion).Second, the CUP HOLDER!  Yes, that's in caps for a reason.  If you have never purchased a booster seat before you may not get why this cup holder thrills me.  With other boosters seats I have purchased, the cup holder has either consisted of an area with a piece of elastic holding (or in reality) NOT really holding the drink in place.  Kids lean over, there goes the drink.  Kids get out of seat, there goes the drink.  Or they have holders that stick out to the side.  Same problems along with they are usually shallow.THIS cup holder is to the side, but it does not stick out, and it is a molded piece of plastic that is deep.  I tried it out with sippy cups, cans, fast food cups, water bottles, etc...  They all fit in there nicely, enough depth so that the cups etc... did not fall over.  For that reason alone, I am sold on this car seat.That said, it really is sturdy, looks nice and from what I have been told, is comfortable.  I purchased several of these for three different cars.  For three kids, ages 4, 5, and 7.  These fit in both Honda and Toyota cars, and a Honda minivan.I have purchased other brands/models and none of them lasted very long.  Those covers are just sort of 'there', whereas with this booster seat, it has elastic all around it.So due to the quality, the cup holder, the way the cover is on (and yes, you can remove to wash it), and the price, this is a winner!I purchased both the Pierce (tan/black), and the Sailor (blue/black)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SP9NHG83YQWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8MSLE0#wasThisHelpful","R1SP9NHG83YQWF","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several pairs of these glasses as does my husband.  Handy to keep in my purse, or my pocket, or a small carry clutch.  I have them stashed around the house for when I want to grab a pair of glasses, that I might have to store in my pocket.  Perfect for putting in your pocket to go walking if you might need a set of 'eyes'.They are very well made, and very clear.  No blurriness and I have yet to have them get scratched up, and haven't had any break on me yet either.  I have taken these on car trips, theme parks, out to dinner, you name it.  I always get asked where I bought them.I have them in different colors, but I think I like the red the best.  Not as red as I had feared.  Very subtle.  They are smaller than normal size glasses, so I don't use them for all day reading.  But I don't like to put regular size glasses in my pocket.  So these suit their own purpose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K8LA7DX0RDXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J3TAYW#wasThisHelpful","R1K8LA7DX0RDXP","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just received my order today so not sure how long lasting these are, but I thought I might be able to offer some help to those who might be having some issues.  First, I think it might depend on seller, so I'm not saying that all orders received will work.  But from experience with using solar lights (tiki), I might be able to help.By my experience with the tiki solar lights:  After removing the plastic strip, you put the battery back in, and sometimes it can take a day or so for the battery to get charged.  All depends on how much charge the battery had before shipment and how much direct sunshine you have in your area, because these are solar.  Second, I have used both rechargeable batteries in my tiki lights and regular batteries.  Rechargeable batteries are the best because they last so much longer and if you ever need to recharge them yourself (like in winter time), you buy a charger.  Again, with the tiki lights, you can also use regular batteries and the lights will (or SHOULD) go off when it is light outside.  Or inside, if you have a lot of lights on.Now another experience I have had with this very type of light string, but not hooked up to solar.... the light strings I already had, use strictly batteries and they don't last long.  Using regular batteries without a solar panel will really eat up this light string.  So if you are using regular batteries, OR rechargeable batteries and do not have the solar panel in direct sun, you might have to keep replacing the batteries a LOT.Mine worked right from the box after removing the plastic.  I still went ahead and placed it outside to get a full charge.  It's very pretty inside the mason jar, and I do plan to order more.  I hope this helps.If it quits working, or any issues, I will update this review.  10/8/2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TOBFMS2FOATN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3MDE3Y#wasThisHelpful","R2TOBFMS2FOATN","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't taken a photo yet of any loaves I have baked, so I'm not expecting a lot of 'helpful' remarks from people.That said, I LOVE this pot!!  I love all my Lodge cast iron pots, but this has become my favorite.  I have been using it almost every day to bake a loaf of Artisan bread.  I use the basic recipe from the book ""The New Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking"", 2013.Using the recipe from that book, and this Dutch Oven, I haven't baked a bad loaf yet!  The recipe calls for just over 6 cups of flour (I use the weight instead of cups, but stating to give you an approximate idea). I use half of the recipe for one loaf.  I place baking parchment in the pot, push it down, cut to fit up to the edges, place the dough in the pot to let it rise, place pre-heated lid on the pot, and I cook it that way at 450 degrees for 32 minutes, then remove the lid, and cook for 13 more minutes, remove the parchment let it sit in the toaster oven until it cools.I have a Breville Smart Toaster Oven, the largest size (and I think is the MOST AMAZING appliance ever!!).  This pot fits in it just perfectly!  I had purchased this same pot in a larger size for my regular oven, but got tired of heating up the house every time I wanted a loaf of bread.  Using this pot in my Breville has turned out to be perfect.  I have fresh bread when I want it, and my house doesn't heat up and it uses little energy.  I never wash the pot, as I always use baking parchment (From King Arthur flour).  Not all parchment is equal when comes to baking so do your own research and buy what you feel is best.  I am not an infomercial.  Just trying to give people an idea of what worked for me.So to answer some questions, this pot with lid will fit in a very large toaster oven.  It will cook a perfect size loaf of Artisan bread (round shape, and approx. 3 cups of flour).  Bread turns a nice golden color, isn't soggy on the bottom.I just purchased a second one as I keep having to give one away every time I bake a loaf.  With two pots, while one is cooking, the dough for the second loaf can be rising.  I have been doing without a second pot, but having that extra will help this coming winter, when I have 3 families all wanting fresh bread.  Which by the way tastes SO much better and SO much fresher than a local grocery store loaf and if you don't feel like driving, all you need is flour, water, salt and yeast.  Easy items to keep on hand.  Also, it makes a very good loaf for stew, soup, chili, and sandwiches.Sorry for what seems like a bread review.  Just wanted people to know how well this bakes bread.  I'm sure it would cook other items just fine, but I have only used this size for bread.  It is a very decent size pot that sits on my gas burner just perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11LM85HGYDL52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008GKDU#wasThisHelpful","R11LM85HGYDL52","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just like with the Liliane dish towels, I am very impressed with these handkerchiefs.  I purchased them for my dad, as he is always asking for them at Christmas or his birthday which is coming up soon.  He always has a couple in his pocket, and he doesn't like to use tissues.I had a difficult time finding them locally last year but was able to at the last minute.  Plain old white hankies, and not great quality.  When I saw these, I didn't hesitate to order them.  I love that they have a pattern without being fussy.  The colors are perfect.  The quality is wonderful.  Not overly thick and not super lightweight.  Really the perfect Handkerchief material.  Very nicely packaged!!I received a code to buy at a discount, but I would like to emphasize that I do not leave glowing feedback for items unless I am seriously happy with the item and that I have a need for it.  I have purchased many sets of Liliane kitchen towels at full price and I tell myself every time I use one how wonderful they are and how I am very happy to have found them!!!!!I will be ordering more of these to give my dad for Christmas.

"UPDATE:  Had the family over to swim and they tried these out.  I'm upping my review to FIVE stars now.  Older people in their 70's, younger toddler kids, all loved this item.  Said it was much easier to get on it, much easier to keep your balance on.  So this item is a keeper!!!I have the Aqua pool saddle float from a different maker.  It has a shinier finish, very well made, but can get uncomfortable after awhile and not so easy to balance on.This float does not look as pretty, not shiny, doubt it will hold up as long.HOWEVER, it works better!  Much easier to board this thing and stay afloat.  Almost like sitting in a chair.  Doesn't require the almost constant balance adjustment.I am upset that I ordered one, then the price went up by $5.00 a piece.  I relented and purchased 3 more.  Now the price went back down.  AND most upsetting is that it is being listed on Amazon, sold by Amazon, yet two different prices.  So do a search of this WOW float and look for the best price.  It changes throughout the day, daily basis.My rating is based on the float.  My warning is so that you can find the cheapest price for this item.  I expect it to last a couple of summers and if so, worth the price.  Kids will have fun with them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJW6K1IRLJAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JA0OC7I#wasThisHelpful","RJW6K1IRLJAC","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a professional piano player.  I taught myself, and then took a few lessons, so I am not an expert.  The only reason I am leaving a review is for others like me who simply want a nice sounding piano.  Since the cost varies quite a bit and there is a wide variety available, it can be difficult to narrow down a decision.So my take on this piano is: I love it!!I had a Kimball acoustic piano that was over 25 years old.  I had it tuned twice, but couldn't justify the cost of tuning it every year since I was the only one who played it and then not all the time.  We moved a few years ago and I insisted on moving the piano with me, I didn't want to be without a piano.  After having it moved, what a mistake.  VERY HEAVY to move!!!Then I never played it, because it was badly out of tune.  MANY years ago I had a small digital piano, didn't sound great or play great, so I didn't want a digital piano.  However, I came to realize that the reason why was because it was a very cheap old digital piano.  They have really improved the quality over the years.So I gave away my acoustic piano and bought a Kawai.  Beautiful piano, loved all the features, but it just didn't sound right.  My husband agreed, we brought in friends who DO KNOW HOW TO PLAY VERY WELL and they also agreed, just sounded like an out of tune acoustic piano.  Which didn't make sense.  So we boxed that piano back up, sent it back to Amazon and purchased this Yamaha.  WOW!!!Seriously, night and day sound.If you are into serious classical music, and/or are very picky about the sound, then don't buy a piano online.  Do like others have said and go try them out in a store if at all possible.If you have always wanted a piano for personal play, or to replace an old acoustic, then you might be very happy with this piano.  All digitals sound different just like acoustics.  But digital pianos shouldn't sound like they are out of tune and this Yamaha doesn't.Summary: if you are on the fence trying to decide on keeping an acoustic piano or simply buying a piano for the first time and don't know if you should go with acoustic or digital:  Go with a digital piano.  Weighs so much less.  Takes up less space.  Doesn't need tuning.Another reason I liked this piano was due to the base.  It has a more finished look to it than other bases out there.  Less like a digital on a stand and more like a piece of furniture.  It's easy to play, sounds beautiful, I couldn't be happier with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JSQQS87YL29Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KVKT0C#wasThisHelpful","R1JSQQS87YL29Y","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is excellent!!  Wish I had found this one years ago!I read a review that stated if you purchase well bound books, you will not have a problem with keeping them open.  To me, that is not a practical statement.  If you want a certain cookbook, or any book, and it comes bound a certain way, you either buy the book or don't; but you can't (usually) find it in a different (better) binding.I have SEVERAL cookbooks of all sizes.  Most of them I have a difficult time keeping open.  I have tried everything, including even flattening them as much as possible by pushing on the spine, putting heavy objects on them, bending them backwards.  YES!  The Horror because I love books.I have used cookbook holders in the past, but not all, so I can only base this review on my experience and most importantly on the product itself.It works!!  I have tried it on my America's Test Kitchen books, my bread books, most of my big thick heavy books or the ones I had the most problems with.  This this works, seriously!  I will try to include a picture or two of it with one of my thick cookbooks.  Hopefully it will load.Okay, here's the thing.  It does not cover the entire book.  If it did, I would give it higher than five stars.  It will however hold a book at any page.  You know how some big thick books might open in the middle pages, but in the beginning and end nothing keeps them open?  This gadget does just that.All you have to do to change a page is pull the plastic towards you, move page, push plastic back.  Simple!  Takes not much more effort than flipping the page and having to try and get it flat again.  No matter what size book, the holder doesn't fall forward or backward, it is very steady.  Even my husband said ""WOW, that's pretty cool!"".I do wish it were bigger.  If they come out with one bigger I would buy it because I would love for the entire book to be covered.  But until they do this a must have for me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS1YTLFDWM1EO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UEA0CM#wasThisHelpful","RS1YTLFDWM1EO","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think I'm like many people who have or are thinking about purchasing this.  I hate getting batter all over the muffin tins.  I just don't like the mess.What I like about this: Pour batter into this dispenser.  Use one hand to pull the dispenser lever and the other hand to push the batter around with a skinny spatula.  You pull the lever, release the batter, stop pulling, move to next spot, pull the lever.  As you get closer to the bottom or if you have a thicker batter, use the spatula with opposite hand to guide batter down into the hole.If you can use two hands like that, you will find this is a dream to work with.  Really easy to clean, just pour soapy water into it, and open lever, turn upside down, back again.  Yes, that requires work.  But so does washing whatever you use to pour the batter.  I have scoops, very messy.  I've tried straight from bowl.  Very messy.This is not perfect, but it does work.  I haven't had it leak yet.  I have not used it for pancake batter, just for cupcakes.  The thicker the batter, the longer it takes to release it and the more work it takes with the second hand using spatula.  But out of multiple times, making two batches per, I have maybe just a couple of spots where I missed the mark in pouring.

In the end, he offered to put me in touch with a service person if that was what I wanted.  He could not figure out by way of email how the problem might be solved.  I do understand the limitations of that.  However,  I am stating here for others to know,  is that there apparently is no patch; he had not heard of a problem like I am experiencing.**I originally was going to purchase the Casio Privia 860, as I had a chance to play one that belonged to a friend.  However, I did some research and decided on this Kawai CE220 instead for a few reasons.  The size on this is bigger than the Casio, and I wanted it to fill the space that I used to have an acoustic piano in.  Another reason I chose this was due to the mechanism.  From what I read this model Kawai should last up to 15 years as opposed to the Casio and others made like it.  There were also a few more bells and whistles, so I figured give this one a try.I loved the sound of the Casio 860, and the look of it.  If it had been larger I probably would have still gone with it, especially at almost half the price.  After receiving my Kawai, I wish I had.  And here's why....It's a digital piano.  It's not supposed to be out of tune, but the one I received is.  The sound is off, the lower keys are off tune, and some of the chords are not harmonized.  The only way I can explain it is that is simply sounds out of tune.  I am not a professional musician, but I can hear an off pitch.  I had two friends take a look at it who are musicians and each of them confirmed that the sound was not right.  Both suggested I see if there was a patch for it, and asked if I did a factory reset.The answer is, I did do a factory reset, and that helped, but it didn't fix.  When I first received it, several of the upper keys were just horrible.  After the reset, those keys sounded better, but it still sounded like an out of tune piano.So.... I called Kawai directly, to see if there was a patch for this model.  Both phone numbers are out of service.  I sent an email, no response as of yet.  I called the company I purchased it from on Amazon.  I called five times, each time has me on hold for 3 minutes, then switches me over to leave a voicemail.  So I left a voicemail.  And sent an email.  No response.It worries me that the numbers for Kawai are not in service and that the company I purchased this from does not have anyone answering the phones.  When I was originally overcharged on sales tax, it took a few days to get that adjusted.  Since there is a limited time frame to return this, and since customer service for this piano seems lacking, I am returning it and will be purchasing the Casio 860.If you aren't into serious piano playing, meaning a casual at home user, both pianos seem very similar to me.  It depends on style of piano and what type of bells and whistles you want.  I personally just want one that doesn't sound like an out of tune acoustic piano.  It seems I got a lemon.  Others seem very pleased, so I wish I had gotten one that sounded right.One more note, one of the pieces of the stand had a slight crack in it.  No biggie but just to note.  You can't see it, so if piano had sounded correct, would have kept it.I gave it three stars because it is a nice piano.  If it had sounded 'in tune', I would have given it four.  I didn't want to rate lower because it is a nice piano. If it is working properly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37MGJ1XOBLU5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OY0CVW#wasThisHelpful","R37MGJ1XOBLU5H","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just received this music book yesterday and love it!  There are a variety of songs, the print is big, the pages bright white.  The print goes well into the center of the book, so you have to press down hard on the spine at each page to get it stay flat and therefore readable.I own MANY music books I have collected over 40 odd years.  I have found that bound books do not stay open the thicker they are.  With books like this you really have to NOT try and keep them in AS NEW condition.  You have to flatten them out and sometimes use a clamp.  I wish all music books came in a spiral binding.  Sheet music is fine, but books need a spiral binding.That said, you can flatten this book out so it will stay open.Also, the version I received is the 2005 version.  It has about 60 less pages than the 1999 version.  It is still available as USED on Amazon, and yet Amazon is combining the reviews for both versions.  The newer version has less songs and has a blue cover.  The older version has a beige cover.  Same Characters on each.  Later I will post a photo of the table of contents.  I really hate it when a music book is available for sale but there is no listing of songs.  That's why people are buying music books.  There are a ton out there!  Most people are looking for a combination of the level of playing and the songs.NOTE: I tried to upload two photos showing the table of contents but for some reason Amazon is not allowing my photos to upload","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TI9IEO6BT2IB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0757937632#wasThisHelpful","R1TI9IEO6BT2IB","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great assortment of colors, gives me a variety for various projects.Each roll is supposed to be 60 feet which is 20 yards.  So for the price you are getting 240 yards total of ribbon in 12 different colors.  I said supposed to be, because I actually did unroll an entire spool just to be certain it was indeed 60.  (No, I do not have too much time on my hands, but I was putting off a different project so I spent useless time doing this.) Also, because the rolls looked so small, it didn't look like there could be 60 feet on the roll.  And there wasn't.  There was 59 and a half feet.  I'll take it.If you need a lot of ribbon in one color, this is not the purchase for you.  Yes, you can definitely purchase larger rolls for a very good price.  The point is, this is an assortment.  So if you wanted a little of one color, a little of another, you can purchase this assortment and not have to purchase larger rolls of each color.It all comes down to your needs.  If you want a variety of colors and don't need a whole lot of one particular color, this is a very good deal.I purchased this assortment for two parties I have coming up.  I wanted different color ribbons to tie onto balloons.  I also have larger spools of ribbon as well.  This assortment will allow me to add more color.  I also plan to use these for package tying.These are basic curling ribbons.  Not high gloss or anything different.  Plain old curling ribbon.  If you can find the color you want at a local dollar store, then go for it.  I have purchased some at the dollar store that run $1.00 for 400 feet.  So that would be $1.80 for 720 feet as opposed to this item that is approx. $9.00.  They usually sell them in a lot of 4 colors.  Sometimes pastels and sometimes brighter colors. I like this assortment because it has the variety I was looking for.Very pleased with this purchase and would buy more if needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VD25ZCDANKN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BD9T06#wasThisHelpful","R1VD25ZCDANKN2","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review based on having for a short period of time.  However, here is my opinion so far....I am comparing this to the Hurrycane.  I purchased the Hurrycane for my dad last year.  He liked that it stood up on its own as opposed to a regular cane.  He liked the base of it because it felt sturdier than a regular cane tip.  However, it didn't always stand up, quite often it would fall down.His Hurrycane recently broke, so I did some more research and decided to try this Hugo Quadpod instead.  I am SO GLAD I did!  He loves this cane so much more than his previous Hurrycane!It stands up so much better than the Hurrycane.  He also loves the handle on this cane better.  In fact, I did too.  Right out of the box, my first impression was that it was a really nice handle.  It widens out toward your palm, so it gives you more area to place your hand.  He said that made it so much easier to use.  The Quadpod is very nice.  Not too large, not too small.  He doesn't trip over it, which is what I was worried about at first.  it is larger than the base of the Hurrycane but not as large as the base of other types of Quad bases.The con part:  It doesn't fold and his Hurrycane did.  So I purchased the Hugo folding cane and the Quadpod base and thought I could put them together.  I didn't read much about it before purchasing or I would never have ordered them.  You cannot put a Quadpod base on a Hugo folding cane.  Just to be sure I called the company and they confirmed that.  So that was a somewhat expensive lesson for me.I gave the folding cane the base to someone else and purchased another Hurrycane.  That one will be kept in his mobility cart and the Hugo Mobility Quadpod will be the one he uses regulalry.It costs less (than the Hurrycane), is sturdy, has a nice handle, and stands upright better.  I hope someday they will make one like this that folds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PWGWHA5AHDND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IV0BJ6#wasThisHelpful","R1PWGWHA5AHDND","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LOVE these Wilton Icing bag ties!!I do not have a need for these on a regular basis, but occasionally I do want to use an icing bag for cupcakes, or cakes, or deviled eggs, things like that.  I am not the most adept at using pastry bags.  I hate filling them, I don't like to get frosting on my hands.  I almost always end up with frosting/filling coming out the top.It required a lot of effort to hold the bag, manuerver the filling, and direct the filling where I wanted it to go.  With these ties, I placed it at the top of the bag and did not have to worry about the filling oozing out the top.  I was able to guide the filling down the bag and use the other hand to direct the flow of the filling.  Before I always felt like I needed a third hand.I debated as to whether I would really use these, wasn't sure if it was a luxury, or a useless 'gadget'.  SO GLAD I BOUGHT these!!  Wouldn't want to use pastry bags without them anymore.Easy to use!  Just wrap the band around the bag, and loop the arrow through.  I only had to wrap it once.  I wasn't able to slide it down the bag, but I didn't need to.  I just wanted to ensure that the filling didn't leak out.  I used these with bags thicker than the Wilton bags.

"I don't have a need for using these bags on a constant basis, but when I do want them, these will be excellent!I have used the Wilton bags in the past.  While they are nice bags, they are not as thick as these bags.  I have had problems with seams bursting on the Wilton and they required constant refilling.I just purchased the DayMark 18"" bags for the first time.  I wasn't sure if they would be too big or even if I should go larger and purchase the 21"" bags.  I already had some 12 inch Wilton bags, so decided to splurge and buy these in the 18"" size and I really am glad I did!I used these for whipped cream topping and they worked perfect!  Held an entire double batch of homemade whipped cream, more than enough to frost 24 cupcakes (with some left over for tasting purposes of course).The bag was sturdy; the whipped cream went in easily and straight out through the tip.  No breaking of seams, no refilling needed.  I used a Wilton tip and coupler.Side note:  I also purchased: Wilton Icing Bag Ties.Wilton Icing Bag TiesThey worked with these bags perfectly!  I have had problems in the past with frosting getting past my hand and oozing out the top of the bag.  With those ties, I just placed one at the top of the bag, and then used one hand to squeeze the frosting and the other to guide it.  Didn't have to worry about frosting oozing out so made the job MUCH easier.The bags are in a box like you buy cling wrap or foil.  You roll out the first two bags, detach one off of the other and detach it from the base of the bag connecting it to the roll, very easy to do.  It's like a square that is divided.  You can leave the second one attached to the roll, or you can detach both and tuck one into the box.  I'm stating this because others have asked if they come out one at a time.  No and yes.The bags are NOT like the same shape as a Wilton bag (which is a banner pennant shape).  These have an angle to them.  Very thick.Summary:  VERY GLAD I PURCHASED these!!!  Also, like a few others also stated, you could if you needed to, wash and reuse.  But then you could buy reusable bags if you wanted to do that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M25NBF6CGX8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009YM776U#wasThisHelpful","R1M25NBF6CGX8L","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not nearly as gold as it looks in the ad description.  Has a sort of bronze gold appearance, so if you place it next to something shiny gold, like jewelry, or gold foil paper, it looks faded?  pinkish?  bronze?  Not sure the color.

"Just okay.  Very expensive for what it didn't really do very well.  This was my first purchase of this item, so I have nothing to compare it to as far as a different 'batch'.I would not buy this product again.

"My husband purchased the Lady small size pink for me for Christmas and I love them!!I had purchased a different pair on Amazon last October from a different maker and they did not work at all, did not do what they claimed, couldn't even hold a cookie sheet.  So I returned them.  I was hesitant to buy another brand as they all looked similar, but really wanted something that could handle the heat.I do a lot of cooking with cast iron, as well as baking with various pans.  I was always getting burned when cooking with my cast iron.  The pans are heaving, and I kept hitting my hands on the oven burners, etc...So my husband bought these for me and I have to say it is one of THE BEST GIFTS I have ever received.  I had used these gloves to remove my hot cast iron pans from the oven.  I have used them for cookie sheets.  And lately I have used them for removing my very hot pan from my pressure cooker.The heat will get intense if you stand there holding the hot pan.  But it doesn't get hot just removing pans and moving them around.  Long enough to cover my wrist area.  Not too bulky, slide on and off no problems.  I have yet to drop a pan with these, which I cannot say the same for regular pot holders.These are my go to gloves every time when I bake now.  I will probably buy a second set for when the first set needs washing.  I lost the instructions for washing, so I washed with other pot holders and towels, then dried them flat.So if you are looking at a lot of different brands out there, quite honestly, this brand really works well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J4YTEU8DH0OE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J17ZG4I#wasThisHelpful","R3J4YTEU8DH0OE","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read quite a few reviews before purchasing these gloves and it seems like there was a variety of reasons why people wanted them.  So my first suggestion would be to do a search of the reviews for this product with what you need them to accomplish and go by those reviews.MY REVIEW is based on the need I purchased it for, which might not be the reason you need them.We have a pool with a leaf skimmer that needs to be emptied on a regular basis due to quite a few trees.  In order to empty the skimmer you have to put your hand down into it, which means very cold water.  It was so cold that our hands would freeze very fast, making it almost impossible to clean the skimmer.  Searching for gloves that weren't too tight or too loose, that provided a good grip and help with the cold, is very difficult.I took a chance on these, gave them to my husband and said TRY THEM PLEASE!  He was skeptical, but they worked.  Quite often I hear him telling me how much he loves these gloves and how did he manage without them.So they work for our situation.  Putting our hands into freezing water during the coldest months, and even the warmer months because the water is still chilly.  No more feeling like we were getting frostbite.  I can't attest to how they work for other situations, but if you have to plunge your hands into buckets of ice water, this will help.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R272H4LPX9IOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ELYHYU#wasThisHelpful","R272H4LPX9IOS","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchased for a gift for someone who loves butterflies and takes their lunch to work every day.  (Purchased the bright all over butterfly print).Upon receiving I was a little apprehensive, as the bag was very small (folded up) and lightweight.  So I opened the package and opened the bag and I was impressed.  It seemed very well made, beautiful vibrant colors, exactly as described.  Zippers worked great, no problems.Perfect size to toss in a wallet, lunch bag, a book (or Kindle), magazine, sweater etc....It's not too large, but not too small.

"I don't always review the clothes that I purchase on Amazon, but I feel this one deserves a review.  Please don't slam my review as not helpful, I'm only trying to give others an idea of how this top fits, since there are no other reviews as of this posting.The outer top and the tank top portion are completely separate, only connected by a small string at each shoulder.  You can leave them connected, or cut the string, your choice.I purchased both the black and the red versions of this top (as well as the solid tank in a different listing), both wash well, and fit the same after washing as before.  Note, that I washed them in warm water, and removed while still slightly damp though almost dry.I love tank tops but most usually have huge armholes, so I have a love/hate thing going on.The reason I purchased this style was because I could wear the tank top, then toss on the outer shell if going to a meeting.  It dresses up the casual tank style.  I purchased this during the winter knowing I will wear it come Spring/Summer.  It is lightweight, can be worn separately.  The armholes are not huge on this top, covers nicely.I purchased this during the winter because last summer I needed outfits to wear that were dressier than a plain shirt but the weather was over 100 degrees and I was miserable!  This gives the effect of a cardigan or blazer over a top.  It doesn't look like you are wearing a tank underneath unless the sides move away from body, but it still looks nice either way.  You can wear the tank alone, or the outer part with a different tank or shirt.  Both are very lightweight, making a perfect hot weather outfit.  Another note, the tank is NOT see through, so for a modest covering this is perfect!Perfect for PTA, court, casual evening out, meetings, etc... And you cannot beat the price on this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KVA4PZB1MZZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYC5R9Y#wasThisHelpful","R2KVA4PZB1MZZY","A3A8SY8X1J2AX8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8SY8X1J2AX8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bottom line, not a book I really enjoyed. I do not share the same view of Scripture author Hamilton does and I found this got in the way. Having said this, I think the book gets in its own way. The front inside book jacket states that Paul ""is second only to Jesus in his influence on Christian faith."" What exactly does Hamilton mean? Well, we find out that Hamilton means exactly what he says and nothing more. What we find is that while Hamilton acknowledges influence, he doesn't seem to acknowledge much more than that. I guess it's Hamilton's liberal Christian leanings. As I don't share his theological assumptions, it was hard for me to get past Hamilton saying in the Introduction that while he admires Paul, he sees Paul as a man of his times and disagrees with him.To my mind, that makes Paul just another preacher-commentator. And if this is the case, then why is he in the Bible? But if he is supposed to be in the Bible then what does this say abut the Bible? I know where Hamilton is going and i choose not to accompany him on his journey; Scripture is far more to me than the writings of smart people and nothing more than that.I also had a problem with Hamilton showing up far too much in the book. Maybe I'm being a bit snarky here, but the title of the book perhaps should have been, ""The Travels of Paul and Adam.""Finally, as one other reviewer has noted, the photos are horribly reproduced as very low pixel, black-and-whites. Looks cheap.I see why so many reviewers rated the book 4 or 5 stars. But I also see why some went 3, 2, or even 1 star. So you - prospective reader - might enjoy.

"This is a delightful book. While the ""7 Secret"" paradigm is a bit forced, the material presented is both easy to read/understand and absolutely helpful.I suspect ""7"" was not picked randomly. ""7"" is often described by Christian (and Jewish?) theologians as the number of completeness. If so, then by working through these seven steps the suggestion seems to be that the reader/couple will have both completed the ""coursework"" and ""perfected"" the marriage. Though I may be getting a bit too esoteric here, I did not like the use of ""7"" with steps that were labelled ""Secret."" Seems to gnostic to me and a good, healthy marriage should not be the result of some secret knowledge.In any event, the ""secrets"" (as you surely have guessed, I prefer ""steps"") are sequential and start with stopping destructive, negative behavior. So while Secret 1 would have the couple ""stop,"" Secret 2 has the couple ""Start"" (in this case, start putting God first, spouse second, and by implication, self third). This should make absolute sense to any couple, but certainly to a couple that embraces Christian beliefs: Jesus told us that the first and greatest commandment to to love God and the second is to love one's neighbor (in this case, the spouse).Step 3 is about ""connecting"" (i.e., learning the skills of being present and active listening; as a grad student just about to complete my professional counseling degree program, I can tell you that few people are as present and listen as actively as they think they are). I had some difficulty with this chapter because I think communication styles can impact how one views how well the other person is actively listening and/or being present (and sorry, but it is not always the guy's fault). Step 4 logically speaks about ""Engaging."" Once properly ""connected"" engagement becomes the next challenge. The author rightly points out that good connection does not always lead to good engagement. So in this chapter, Dr. Kimberling addresses the delicate subject of ""fighting right."" Yes, we can have disagreements and yes, we can lose our patience with our other, but we need to learn how to do it in a healthy manner. The authors offers several ""steps"" and I think the first two are very much worth highlighting. First, ask God into the conversation before any tough discussion takes place. Besides the Christian belief that when two (or more) are gathered in Jesus' name, there He will be also, bringing God into the discussion before difficulties start means that there is less of a chance that all hell will break loose. Second, very few problems come about solely from the efforts of one of the partners (this is not an absolute; there are many examples where one party is primarily responsible for the difficulty, but we're not addressing those here). So while it may be tough to swallow one's pride, eat some humble pie prior to arguing. It's good for both the belly and the mind.Secret 5 is all about ""balance."" In this case, the author addresses finding a balance among one's life's responsibilities so that the spouse doesn't become third-string. There's quite a bit of good stuff in this chapter, but I think it could have used a short discussion of one more aspect of balance: our emotional balance. Broadly speaking, it does seem that in each marriage one partner seeks to balance out his/her deficiency with a partner who is abundant in what is deficient. All in all, the see-saw is generally balanced, but when the balance is the result of two extremes it's not a healthy balance. So I think the chapter could have addressed this idea a bit (more).Secret 6 speaks to ""mingling."" ""Mingle"" in this sense has nothing to do with getting out and making the rounds on the party circuit. Instead, Dr. Kimberling uses this chapter to address sex. Some will find this chapter full of new insight, others will see it as the weakest in the book. Regardless of where one stands, this is a necessary and important chapter to read.Finally, ""Fight."" Nope, this chapter is not about arguing. Instead, it's about expending effort (and lots of it) to keep on fighting the good fight. And what is the good fight? Well, working together as a team to stay a team. (or partnership or whatever else you might like to call it). Good chapter, if only from the perspective that far too many couples give up the fight far too soon. Too many couples fight and watch their marriage fail instead fight for the marriage.All in all, a really good little book. Has this stuff been written about elsewhere? Yup, and in spades. But what it has going for it is its conciseness, its gimmick (but very useful) packaging of Seven Steps (okay, Secrets), and its unabashed pro-marriage view. Probably best used as a pre-marital counseling aid, but worth a read whenever you are in your married life.5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U0IHXS6AZGG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310342279#wasThisHelpful","R3U0IHXS6AZGG9","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have wanted to start toying around with gadgets like this (at the intersection of computers and music). But I am quite the newbie. So to get a review that does this DJ Controller justice I lent it to one of my kids who plays with these sorts of things so he could put it through its paces. Here are a few of his comments....- The look and feel of this product is great. The design turned out to be a bit more compact than anticipated, but nothing felt crowded. Nothing cheap about the controller as the ""feel"" is very refined; all of the buttons, knobs, and turntables are polished and well manufactured. Bottom line, it seems well-built and likely to withstand many long nights of music and mixing.- The software was very easy to install (Mac OS X). I demo'ed the product in laptop mode (will probably install the iOS mobile sometime down the road). The interface, while very detailed, is laid out in a fashion that one can understand in no time at all. The computer screen mimics the physical controls on the board to a tee.- To begin mixing I uploaded all of my music from my iTunes library. Be warned; it does take some time for track info (i.e., bpm, key, etc...) to load. Also, you will need a pair of headphones and an external speaker (not your laptop speakers) to fully use this product.- At first glance, the potential of this product seems limited to scratching and mixing one track into another. However, if you take some time, scheme up some clever song medleys, the possibilities are really endless. For starters, slice loops in one track and work them into another. Record this new mix and then extrapolate from there. Then further tweak some EQ's, add some effects, and now you're really going. You really are only limited by your creativity.- The Hercules Universal DJ controller has been really fun to use so far. Though it's a bit time consuming getting all of your timing down, the end result is pretty fun and creative. Going to have to see if my dad will let me borrow this for a bit longer...!Well, there you have it. I probably would have given it 4 stars based on quality of build and what I thought I might be able to get out of it. But my son sees it as a solid 5-star bit of kit.

"The $595 list price is ridiculously high. At the same time, the actual sell price ($61.00 here on Amazon at the time of this review) is equally ridiculous - low, that is. Frankly, this watch is a steal for that price.The watch looks really good on the wrist. Very large, very heavy, and very stylish, this watch will send a message (just exactly what that message is will probably be determined by the person you are and the group(s) you tend to hang with!).The knob on the left side of the watch (seven o'clock position) controls the ""count-up"" bezel (or ""diver's bezel). The bezel is probably best used for things other than diving as I really don't feel comfortable wearing this on a dive (even though the manufacturer claims water resistance to 330 feet). The 3-position middle knob on the right side (3 o'clock) controls time and date adjustment. The upper right and lower right buttons control the stop watch functions (stop watch time is viewed on the watch face using the left mini-dial (minutes) and lower mini-dial (seconds)). The right hand mini-dial displays the hour in a 24-hour format. The date is displayed at the 4:30 position between the right side and lower mini-dials.In the end, this is a really nice watch with a really nice link band (comes ready to fit King Kong's wrist so be prepared to take some time to remove links (not at all difficult if you're familiar with Seiko or other stainless steel bands)). It's amazing that a watch this nice can be bought for the price Amazon is offering it at: years ago this watch would have gone for several hundreds of dollars (meaning a real heap of change in today's dollars).My only complaint is that this beautiful watch is packaged in a hideously yellow and ugly (faux-?) leather box. The box (I don't care if this is an Invicta tradition) makes you feel like you've bought a $5 wind-up. But get past the box to get to a really nice watch.

"If you are expecting a full-fledged devotional to use during apregnancy you'll be disappointed. But if you're looking for a book that is essentially ""thought of the day"" // ""fact of the day"" you'll be thrilled (as the back cover states, this a is book of ""short, inspirational readings"").The layout is quite cute; each day's entry contains a thought and a Bible verse and every once and awhile there is a scientific/medical factoid. I really liked how the authors worked in ""the count-down"": while the weeks count up, the days count down.Nothing really complicated here, but quite delightful. If I had any complaint it would be that the book's small size leaves little room in the page margins if one wanted to journal as part of the journey.In the end, a delightful, five-star, little bundle to read and contemplate as you wait for the day when your truly delightful little bundle arrives.

"So I pick up this book on authentic living and open to find that it is a book on faith (and what faith can do in our lives). Frankly, not at all what I thought I was going to see.By no means do I have a problem with a book on faith. But I do have a (slight) problem with a book that advertises one thing but delivers something else completely (or fails to make a connection between title and content). (Though to be fair, I guess if I had paid more attention to the inside cover page I would have seen ""Faith-Walkers"" clearly displayed between the title and sub-title.)Quick comment regarding ""Faith-Walkers."" I honestly have no idea who or what they are. But I understand Bill Blankschaen is a key figure in the group (did some research and read some of his posts on the Patheos blog). I guess if I had known some of this beforehand then some of my confusion would have been mitigated....This is not to say that the book is bad. It isn't. It's an apologetic of sorts for faith and its importance in building a life that is meaningful. And not a bad one at that. But field guide? Just not seeing it.In the end, if ""this"" is what you looking to read up on then by all means have at it. It seems like an excellent resource if this is where you are in your life and as a result find this to be an important issue. But while faith has always been and will continue to be an important part of my life this book's presentation of it wasn't something that attracted my interest or demanded my attention at this point. Who knows, maybe some time down the road. Just not now.Summary: 3 stars. Not because it's ""bad""; rather, because it just didn't resonate with me on any level or from any appreciable perspective.

"I understand that one of the reasons books are successful (or not) is how well the author connects with the reader. So a horrible book just might do well if it's written in a way that grabs its readers. Likewise, a wonderful book may not do as well as it might if the author-material-reader connection doesn't quite click.""Joy"" - fortunately - is not in the former category. It is in no way a horrible effort. Quite the opposite. Unfortunately, for me anyway, ""Joy"" is in the latter category. Interesting, informative, easy to read, but not a book that I felt any connection to or with.I was provided an advance reading copy so a few of my concerns may have been addressed in the final publication. First, I wish the foot- / end-noting had been a bit more comprehensive. Second, given the repeated theme of ""appearances"" throughout the book, the book deserves far, far more photos than were provided (this is not an effort where ""orientation photos"" suffice; this book should have been jammed full of photos of all the characters we read about). Speaking of characters, as they come in and go out of the book the author identifies certain characters as important, but more often than not I didn't really get a sense of why they were important. Finally, some passages come off as frustrating ""non sequiturs"" or contradictory (perhaps upon rereading it might not seem so, but I really don't look forward to rereading a book in the hope that it will make more sense the second time around (unless the material is so dense as to demand a second look)).The author wanted to make a very complex woman accessible to a target audience that adores the husband and longs to know more about the enigmatic wife. So the book is written less as a serious, academic life study and more like a popular one (or very long or serialized magazine essay). Okay, no problem. But with the accessible style came a style that I felt was less than tight. I found myself becoming bored and disengaged (and often struggled not to put it down), a surprise given the intensity and complexity of the book's subject. As such, the book could have benefited from a more rigorous editing process. But I concede this might be unfair criticism: I can also see the book's style as indicative of the author's attempt to forge a friendship between herself, the subject, and the book's readers (the book seems to come across as more of a conversation over coffee than a serious biography).This is not to say the book is ""bad"" or deficient; rather, only that I didn't fall head over heels with it (didn't love it, didn't necessarily like it; it was okay). On the plus side, this book should serve as an excellent introduction to Joy Davidman. But ""definitive""? Hardly; that book is waiting to be written. As such, it would be a crime if all the material she uncovered and (supposedly) had first access to never gets the opportunity to be mined further. So I hope the author considers one (or both) of the following: either write a second book that goes deeper or help ensure this material gets to other researchers so that they can do so. Joy Davidman lived a full life and as such deserves a fuller treatment.Summary: 3 stars. Good introduction to Joy Davidman Gresham Lewis. But I did not connect as well as I had hoped I would to the subject, the author, or the material. Finally, not definitive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JC9UOBWPVURY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151013713#wasThisHelpful","R2JC9UOBWPVURY","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am of two minds regarding this offering from Carolyn McCulley and Nora Shank (hence, the three stars). On one hand, the book is well-written, the points are concisely presented, and the authors' assertions seemingly sound. But the book seems like two essays mashed into one book. I enjoyed the first essay (essentially, a look at the history of ""wifehood""), but felt flat reading the second essay (essentially, a series of metrics to help a woman know she is ""successful"").More importantly, however, the book seemed disconnected from...I don't know, but something. Then I remembered reading in the Preface that this offering is essentially the third book in what amounts to a de facto trilogy. Not having read the first two books I guess I can see why the book seems disconnected; it's connected to books I've yet to read. Perhaps if I had read the other two this book would rate higher (in fact, a quick review of some of the other reviews seems to show that those who are familiar with the authors rate the book more highly).Anyway, even though I gave the book 3 stars, that doesn't mean it's not worth one's time. I'm sure there will be many critics, but I suspect these critics will be coming from a different historiographical perspective or hermeneutic. In the end, I enjoyed the authors' perspectives and did learn a few things. I've passed the book over to my wife; it will be interesting to hear her thoughts on it.Summary: 3 stars. A short read. Interesting in places (1st part), boring ""same old-same old"" in others (2d part). Perhaps best read after reading the authors' first two books (Did I Kiss Marriage Goodbye?: Trusting God with a Hope Deferred and Radical Womanhood: Feminine Faith in a Feminist World).

"There's quite a bit to like in this new offering from David Hawkins. I'm not sure that you'll never fight again after reading this book, but there are a bucketful of good nuggets and take-aways. The Carrie Fisher quote to open Chapter 5 is a hoot (and will find a place in my office at some point). The chapter on ""power plays"" is good reading as well.I do agree that much of what plays out as marital conflict is actually a symptom of unresolved, personal, internal conflict. As such, chapters 5-8 are key (and the main reason why I can recommend this book whole-heartedly).If I have to nit-pick, I would say that I didn't necessarily agree with his assumptions about anger, conflict, negotiation, etc. I do not subscribe to the view that conflict is never good, negotiation is usually another form of power play, etc. Here's an example. At the start of Chapter 8, Hawkins writes that ""Fighting, as you recall, occurs from a sense of self-righteousness, entitlement, outright selfishness, and resultant anger."" Really, all fighting stems from these issues? There's never a time where fighting is either necessary or a result of some other factors? In the end, I just don't enjoy reading such blanket statements (and there are many throughout).But my objections to the book are, in a way, unfair. I'm complaining that the author doesn't take in-depth looks at all the issues he introduces. In a way, I'm complaining that the book has neither the length of ""War and Peace"" nor the depth. But the author never intended it to be a deep, philosophical treatise on marriage; instead, the author delivers to the reader what amounts to a handy workbook/study guide that I can see doing a heap of good for couples in trouble. So, in one sense, you can just sweep my objections aside...!Summary: Okay, look. The book is good, but there's nothing really new here (despite the eye-grabbing title). You can find this stuff on marriage and marital counseling in a myriad of other places, books, etc. Biggest benefit is that the book delivers ""good stuff"" from a respected author in the field of marital counseling in a handy, little package.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDS42X68PYGM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426773854#wasThisHelpful","RDS42X68PYGM1","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I find myself in full agreement with the other 5 star reviews. This may not be an important book (in that you could and can find much of what Goldsmith writes on elsewhere), but it is an excellent book.Goldsmith writes in a style that allows the book to be used in multiple settings. You're from a business setting? You'll like how Goldsmith applies principles to business. You're from the mental health field? You'll like how Goldsmith breaks down and discusses the ABC's of Cognitive-Behavioral theory. You're looking for a self-help book that explains why our good intentions rarely/never result in lasting change? You'll like how Goldsmith discusses the never-ending battle between planner and executor that goes on within each of us.This is  book that you will find yourself going back to time and time again. You'll find yourself rereading it from cover-to-cover. You'll find yourself popping it open for a quick refresher.  You'll find yourself underlining, highlighting, and writing notes in the margins. You'll probably find yourself recommending the book to family, friends, and colleagues.  You may even find yourself buying additional copies to lend or give as gifts. Yup, it's that kind of book. It's that good.Enthusiastic 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B0932FD3910V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804141231#wasThisHelpful","R3B0932FD3910V","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I expected a mattress protector like the ones I was familiar with back when I was growing up (or my kids were). Fortunately, technology has really moved forward and that was a pleasant surprise.The Perlux protector is soft, does not crinkle like cheap plastic, and does not smell like rubber or feel rubbery. Actually, it feels quite nice. So my first impression was a really positive one.We washed it prior to first use according to the instructions. It didn't really feel that much softer (but that's not a ding on the product: we thought it pretty soft to begin with). The mattress protector fits our queen-size mattress without problem. So my second impression was positive.I know there are folks who prefer a warm/hot bed. But I can only sleep (well) when cool. For example, I cannot sleep on foam-style mattresses except in the coldest winter months as these mattresses trap and keep body heat. And here's where the mattress protector ""fails"" me: it's too hot.So it seems to me it comes down to this: if you are a ""warm"" sleeper you probably will love this product, if you are a ""cool"" sleeper you'll probably have a tough time liking this item. I did not test the waterproof claim, but have no issue in that if it's not entirely water-proof I'm sure it will be sufficiently water-resistant. That would be enough for me for the use we need the protector to meet.Summary: A 5-star product that is docked 1 star (down to 4) because I'm a ""cool"" sleeper and this protector doesn't let me do that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S0IAUNSEIG5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2W7WJA#wasThisHelpful","R3S0IAUNSEIG5E","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book finding it very informative and very accessible (i.e., the authors chose to write in a manner that is very understandable to the lay reader). My first impression was that the book was a long essay masquerading as a book (seemed quite repetitive). But upon further consideration I realized the authors were addressing the book's main actor - your gut's microbiota - not in a repetitive way, but from different angles.First, the authors address the declining number of species of bacteria in the typical Westerner's gut and why this may be a very bad thing. They then tell us not only why diversity in the gut is important, but also why gut bacteria is important in the first place.The authors then discuss how we ""get"" bacteria in our gut and why some of today's health fads are getting in the way of good bacteria getting where they need to be. I was floored about the authors' comments on society's overuse/improper use of anti-microbials (and antibiotics) and how our phobia of germs may very well be making us less healthy. On the flip side of the coin I also appreciated how the authors explained why ""eating a peck of dirt"" may actually be good for you and why you might not want to wash your hands all the time (something most parents when I was growing up knew to be true). But I was most floored by the short discussion on non-emergency caesarian deliveries and how they too might be making our children unhealthy. These three discussions alone are worth the cost of the book.There is an interesting (though ultimately unfulfilling) discussion on probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics (unfulfilling because I wanted a definitive answer and the authors demonstrate there is no definitive answer: every individual's microbiota is unique and as such no pro/pre/synbiotic can be manufactured to meet every individual's gut's requirements). But they do (helpfully) offer general suggestions (e.g., why fiber is important and the different types of fiber, why bacteria-fermented foods such as yogurt are important, etc.).Anyway, take a look at the table of contents and I think you'll be intrigued (if this is something you're interested in):- Chapter 1: What is the Microbiota and Why Should I Care?- Chapter 2: Assembling Our Lifelong Community of Companions- Chapter 3: Setting the Dial on the Immune System- Chapter 4: The Transients- Chapter 5: Trillions of Mouths to Feed- Chapter 6: A Gut Feeling- Chapter 7: Eat Sh!t and Live- Chapter 8: The Aging Microbiota- Chapter 9: Managing Your Internal FermentationThe book contains about 40 pages of recipes that include/use food items the authors say (throughout the book) are beneficial in establishing and maintaining a healthy gut ecosystem. There is also an excellent presentation of end notes for the references the authors refer to throughout the text.In the end, my gut tells me the authors are on to something, that they are correct in their assertions, and that time will bear out their arguments. But I'm no expert. I do know this is no ""fad"" book.  As such, even if you choose not to embrace the dietary lifestyle they espouse the book deserves serious consideration.Summary: A solid 4+ stars deservedly rounded up to ""5 stars.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNG61RQDUU60B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594206287#wasThisHelpful","RNG61RQDUU60B","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live right on the line between Scotts ""North"" and ""transition"" zones. As such, this perennial rye mix may not have been the best choice for a grass seed. But we'll see....As has always been the case when I use Scotts lawn seed, the seed grows quickly into a nice, thick patch of grass. Within days (I exaggerate, but only a little!) it began to look full and fabulous. And I'm sure it will stay so throughout the remainder of the Spring. Where I've had problems is when the late Spring direct sun starts to beat down on the grass. It's not the heat or the humidity; rather, it's the sun. When it starts blazing the grass starts withering and no amount of water helps.This time I'm using the seed in an area that receives far more shade than where I've tried it previously. We'll see if that helps. In the end, I can't fault Scotts if this doesn't take and hold, it will probably be a result of buying a seed that was better suited for a location further north. But so far, so good.Summary: 4 solid stars. I have been a die-hard fan of the company's products since I was a wee, ""lawn-mowin' for pocket change"" kid. Scotts products are always first-rate and reasonably priced. Bottom line, Scotts products are low on hype and high on performance. This grass seed is no different.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JY9P9D202L21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ZXLA5U#wasThisHelpful","R2JY9P9D202L21","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a ""cut and paste"" of the review I did on the Reebok ""high boot"" version (Reebok Men's Rapid Response RB8895 Safety Boot). Having tried both, the comments equally apply. Here goes....These boots are really, really nice and very comfortable. I wasn't sure if I would like the side zipper, but it works well. The ""pull-on"" loop on the back is helpful.But if you have narrow feet you will find your feet swim in the forefoot unless you ""pad"" with additional (or thick) socks. If Reebok would make a ""narrow"" version (these ""medium width"" boots felt very much like ""wide"" boots), then we would have a SIX-star review. I've found that the 5.11 Men's 6"" Taclite  Boot is a better fit for my narrow feet (they are equally as comfortable, but lack the zipper). Size of these Reebok boots is about 1/2 size big (I wear size 11, but needed a 10.5 in the Reeboks (the 5.11 Taclite boots ran true: I wear 11 and the boots were an 11)).The zipper makes all the difference in what boot lace-up system is used. You'll note that the 5.11 Taclite boots use eyelets in the fabric while the Reeboks use plastic eyelets. If the Reeboks didn't have the zipper I would not ever touch them because the plastic eyelets are a highly possible point of failure. Given that most will lace up the Rebooks and leave them laced (using the zipper to take off and put on the boot) this is not too much of an issue (ergo, no plastic eyelets on the 5.11 Taclite boots).One other observation. Reviewers have complained that there is no steel toe but that the boots are advertised as safety boots. This is neither misleading nor incorrect. Yes, they are safety boots and yes they do not have a steel toe. But the product literature tells you that Reebok chose to not use steel so that there would be no issue with metal detectors, etc. In any event, the toe may not be steel, but it still seems to offer significant protection. In the end, if you're a lumberjack or the like and need real steel toe protection then these are not the boots for you. But if you are a soldier (etc.) these are perfect boots (and as a former armored vehicle crewman I can tell you not having steel toes is a plus: I remember having a pair of steel-toed boots and they helped my feet to freeze in the winter and roast in the summer).Reebok has done really, really well in these boots.

"Vine reviewer J.S. Dean wrote an excellent review and really does cover just about everything you might want to know about this unit. So allow me to echo some of his comments and perhaps add one or two of my own....The shipping box this unit arrives in is SO heavy that if you're not a weight lifter it would be best to have a dolly on-hand. As reviewer Dean noted, the box arrived absolutely battered and opened in several places. But he is correct; there is a nice layer of Styrofoam around the unit parts such that (frankly, unbelievably) nothing was damaged (at least that I've been able to see).The build is straight-forward and like just about every other slap-together, particle board piece of furniture. Again, as reviewer Dean noted, the item moves about very easily because it is essentially two items (a stand and a rolling drawer). That's convenient, but also makes the unit less sturdy. Though it looks solid, when you pull out the drawer you see the unit stands on three relatively unsupported legs (see Dean's second picture); I would have really liked it if there was a bottom piece to tie the sides and middle piece all together (instead of relying solely on the back panel). My point is this: if someone accidentally pushed the drawer in too fast and too hard against one of the side pieces you could break the side away from the top and cause the whole thing to come crashing down. This is not far-fetched; I did this once to a piece of particle board furniture. So I respectfully disagree just a bit with reviewer Dean on this point.As such, I don't feel comfortable using this as an AV stand with TV, video gaming system, BD player, etc. Instead, I now think I'll use it as an office printer stand for my multi-function laser printer. Paper and toner cartridges in the rolling drawer, accessories on the shelf, and printer up top.I agree about the roller/casters, but fortunately mine is on a wood floor. I too like the idea of nylon feet to keep the board up off the floor; I plan on using more than a few (probably three each on each side and on the middle piece).In the end, this is not a bad piece of kit. Reviewer Dean thought it relatively sturdy, but over-priced. I thought it less sturdy and at $160 or so not unreasonably priced. But I think we both agree that you are getting what you pay for. In this case that means you get a unit that is a bit bare and lacking in a few things that would make it a nicer unit (like a backing that backs the shelf, a bottom that makes the unit sturdier, and more than casters).As far as ""best use,"" imo it's probably best-suited in a home office, a kid's room/kid's romper room, or a dorm room.Summary: Not super excited about it, but neither am I disappointed. So 3 stars, perhaps even 4 stars. Certainly, no more. Probably cheaper options out there, but it's not bad.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R215LSCAA7HS81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTQCZ96#wasThisHelpful","R215LSCAA7HS81","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As such, I have generally been satisfied in the past with whatever I could get my hands on (so long as it was of reasonable quality).Anyway, Griot's Garage certainly delivered on their product promises.

We put it through its paces this past weekend washing several cars and we were very pleased with how they all turned out.I cleaned ""more car"" using less soap than I usually do. So this jug should last a while. That means it is probably less expensive in the long run than other initially cheaper products.

"At $199 this microwave is priced about right. It has Samsung's high quality of build, numerous features, and sharp looks. And it does what it claims: microwave and grill cooking.It looks like a typical microwave, but if you look inside the cooking compartment you will see a grill element (like those found in electric ovens) on the roof of the microwave. It doesn't have the convection cooking feature, but the addition of the grill element means the microwave oven is far more versatile than a simple microwave-only appliance. The addition of the cooking rack and cooking plate adds to the unit's versatility.And therein lies my problem. I would love to use this oven as my ""main"" cooking appliance, but I can't. I find the compartment too small and the wattage too low. I love the look of the machine but it is about 2 inches too small in every dimension (height, width, and depth). It just doesn't fit all the things we would love to stick in it.My wife and I compared this 1000-watt unit to a 1,250-watt unit and there is a noticeable, appreciable difference. It took almost 30-percent longer to heat a cup of water in the 1000-watt Samsung unit than in our 1,250-watt unit.  This was pretty much the result we encountered in every use.The grill element works as advertised. Very cool. We are still experimenting with it, but initial results have been promising. One reason it's been slow going is that the included manual is simply awful (don't look online for an expanded version; the online manual is the same as the one in the box). There are a number of places in the manual where (to us) the directions are unclear, ambiguous, and confusing. We are still experimenting with the ""instant cook"" feature (i.e., preset cook times); it's not working as we thought it would, but again that could be an issue of us not understanding the manual.We like the ""Eco"" feature (allows you to turn off the clock/counter LED; no light and no vampire power drain). We didn't like the lack of rubber feet on the bottom. And we didn't like how cheap the door release felt (too much slop). But it does look nice and performs well.Summary: 4 stars. Nice, but not perfect. Wish it was a little bigger, wish it had a little more oomph, and wish there was a little more attention to detail (e.g., user manual, latch slop, rubber feet).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKNGAXZGHKBVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXRHIO8#wasThisHelpful","RKNGAXZGHKBVV","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again NOCO delivers a very high quality product at a very reasonable price ($17.95, retail). This is not mandatory in any sense of the word, but if you decide you do need it it makes for a wonderful, high quality accessory.A typical use would be to route the engine block heater plug to this port so that the three prongs of the plug a) do not stick out of the vehicle's front grill and b) do not rust. Routing the block heater plug to the NOCO port protects the block heater's plugs and makes for a far more aesthetically pleasing solution. Another possible application is to ""clean up"" an installation of a (NOCO) battery charger permanently mounted near an RV's house battery set. It really, really looks sharp.The plastic of the port is high quality; I do not think it will be affected by the sun at all (or, if it is, not for a long, long time). The rubber port cover fits very snugly. The 16-inch cord is long enough to be helpful, but not so long as to get in the way and require ""coiling."" The wire gauge is appropriate: at 13 amps it will carry the same current as the extension cords most of us will run out from the house to the port. It feels substantial and well-made.I am a huge fan of NOCO's products. I have several of the company's battery chargers (which I use to keep the batteries in my emergency generator, lawn tractors, etc. charged) and find them easy to use, rugged, reliable, and priced at a very fair price point.

"This is one of those items where the rating depends on whether it works. Flonase is not for everyone; as with most medications much of the effectiveness depends on the person using it. In this field, it is not so much that Product X is better than Product Y; rather, it comes down to whether it works and whether it works depends on whether the med ""connects.""I have had excellent luck with Flonase, but not because it has been effective as the occasional go-to product; it's not a rescue med and you will be utterly disappointed if you are trying to use it as such. Being a steroid, the mechanism of treatment is long-term relief of irritation and swelling. Long-term relief does not come immediately; instead, it takes several days (at the absolute minimum) to begin to take effect.I use Flonase as the med to relieve chronic inflammation due to ""sinus disease."" For allergy relief (immediate and long-term) I have to turn to other products.Some reviewers have complained about the floral smell of the product. I can understand the objection, but for me the scent is helpful: it reminds me I've used the product.Competing products have also noted that Flonase contains alcohol. That's true. Whether that is a problem, I don't know. But someone who needs to avoid alcohol might want to know this in order to make an informed decision.At $25.00 per 120-count spray bottle, that's $0.21 per spray. If you spray once each nostril twice a day, that's a bottle per month. Not cheap, but not unreasonable. So it appears this might be a win-win for both the manufacturer and the consumer.In the end, Flonase is a 5-star product as it does what it says it will do and does it well. BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK FOR EVERYONE. So go into the purchase with your eyes open, use it as you're supposed to and evaluate afterwards.

"After using Zagg screen protectors for years on my phones and tablets (though - caveat - I use the Moshi-series of screen protectors for my Kindle Fire tablets) I didn't think the product category could be improved upon. But I was wrong. This is a fantastic screen protector at a fantastic price (about $22 on Amazon at the time of this review).No joke, the screen clarity is amazing. And the install process is far easier than the flexible film/plastic types. There's no squirting and squeegeeing. The screen lays down cleanly with a minimal of bubbles. Just make sure you clean the screen with the included wipe and line up the protector correctly. It took me three attempts before I felt the screen had lined up correctly on the S4. But once down and the few bubbles pressed out, it fit perfectly and looks simply amazing. And it's not at all thick and/or cumbersome: the Otterbox Commuter case went back on without problem. There have been a few low-star reviews for this screen protector (e.g., lots of bubbles, too big for the S4), but I encountered none of these problems.Frankly, I'm stunned at how good this accessory is. This is a fantastic product that is backed by Zagg's unconditional replacement policy. Not sure how one can go wrong.Love it.

"My first foray (about a year or so ago) into Powerline Ethernet technology was with the ZyXEL PLA407 HomePlug AV 200 Mbps Powerline Wall-Plug Adapter (Starter Kit - 2 Units). In the end (and I still can't quite figure out why) I could never get the adapters to work correctly.It was then with trepidation that I took a stab at this Netgear kit. My experience with these adapters couldn't be more different than the one I had with the Zyxel kit. It really is as simple as plug the adapters in, connect them to the router and device to be networked, and watch the magic happen. Within two-three minutes the adapters had recognized each other and a connection was established between the device I was connecting (A WD NAS device) and the network router. I was moving files to the NAS shortly thereafter. The transfer rate was only slightly less than transfers that used only the Ethernet cabling; in other words, moving data using the home electrical system causes only a slight degradation of speed.Powerline adapters add an encryption feature because theoretically (actually, more than just theoretically) they open your private wired network to the world via your house electrical circuit. So using the encryption feature is more than just a convenience; in this day and age it is a necessity. And it is here where the Netgear package stumbles. The install manual states that one shouldn't push the ""encrypt"" button (located on the side of the unit) until the ""Pick A Plug"" LED is blinking. The system has now been up and running for quite some time and still no blinking ""Pick A Plug"" LED. Running out of patience I eventually pressed the ""encrypt"" button (for 2 seconds) and as expected the ""Pick A Plug"" LED went dim. Before the allowed 2 minutes were up, I pressed (for 2 seconds) the ""encrypt"" button on the other adapter. As the directions state, the ""Power"" LED will start blinking showing that an encrypted connection is being established. Within a few seconds both ""Pick A Plug"" LEDs were fully green. So here's my quibble: after looking through the install booklet, the user manual, and (online at) Netgear support I still can't find anything that tells me I have established a secure, encrypted connection between adapters. For all I know I have exposed my network and the data on it. Simply put, unacceptable.I'm going to email Netgear to see if they can help. If they can clarify the encryption procedure or tell me I do have an encrypted connection (and what I should see to confirm this), then we will have a serious 5-star product (and I'll update this review accordingly). Until then, even though it looks good, functions well, and is priced right it will remain a 4-star product at best.One final thought. It occurred to me that I might want to give the Zyxel adapters a try again. I'm guessing the Zyxel adapters will not be compatible with these Netgear ones. Would certainly like to know if anyone has a more definitive answer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMNI9Y1C5ISAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4UJOS6#wasThisHelpful","RMNI9Y1C5ISAY","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again OXO hits a home run. The quality of build, ingenuity, and price point are right on target and in line for what OXO seeks to accomplish/achieve.The stainless steel feels really nice and there were no obvious weld points. The plastic tray is equally nice and sturdy. The suction cups are really cool: just wet and push down to achieve a solid lock and seal. The padded hanger fits the shower pipe snugly. And it's HUGE; it really seems that you can easily store 6-7 sizable shampoo, body wash, or the like on the shelf and have no fear that the whole thing will come tumbling down.Though I gave this product 5 stars, it's not perfect (at least in my view). First quibble: it's HUGE! Aesthetically, it really takes over the shower. And it is so big that I felt I could use it as a book shelf! I guess if one wanted to have a water-proof radio or bluetooth speaker in the shower but had no place to put it this shelf would do the trick.One further quibble: we put the soap on this shelf, so I wish there was a third hole in the middle (where we put the soap). Right now the soap scum(?) collects on the shelf and we have to remember to wipe nightly.And one final quibble. This shelf could really use a hook (or something) to hang face cloths or back scrubbers (etc.). In the end, I think we would be better served (and get more use from) this OXO product: OXO Good Grips 3-Tier Shower Caddy.Quibbles considered, this is still a solid offering from OXO and fully deserving of a 5-star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11WS7ZKUQHQSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X5I2W#wasThisHelpful","R11WS7ZKUQHQSP","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very pleasantly surprised when I finally got this product in my hands. I expected that the display rail would allow for a single row on the top and one on the bottom for securing notes, envelopes, photos, etc. But the film (the material that acts to hold/catch whatever one is seeking to display) is ""looped"" so that there is actually two channels each on the top and bottom.The rail is constructed of a very nice feeling plastic and seems to be quite well made. The film loop seems like it will not degrade over time (but only time will tell if it, in fact, does stand up). I like the ""command strip"" Velcro-type attachments: the rail need not be ""stuck"" in any one particular location; you can have several mounting locations (we have one location in our kitchen and a second in a travel trailer).So what we have is a really neat product that fits in any number of categories: home organization, business, memento display, etc. To me, then, it comes down to cost: is $21.50 (at the time of this review) money well-spent? Probably (it's in line with comparable products), but I would prefer to see the price about $5.00 cheaper (in the $15.00-16.50 range). It's still a 5-star product, but would be a slam dunk 5-star product if it could be offered at a bit cheaper price.Nice job, Post-It folks!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RETAD7EBEBENO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY7Z31M#wasThisHelpful","RETAD7EBEBENO","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm afraid I cannot share other reviewers' enthusiasm for this product. At almost $10.00 (at the time of this review) the product simply fails to deliver. At $5.00 maybe, but $10? No.Unless the material used is some form of ""super fiber"" that I'm not aware of, this sleeve looks and feels like a cheap vinyl/plastic throw-away item. It feels awful and looks equally so. The zipper is cheap and doesn't work very smoothly. The exterior mesh pocket is essentially worthless as the Velcro tab used to close it off covers only the middle third of the opening. The ""Five Star"" logo was silk-screened crookedly.But what I dislike the most is that though the product description says it will fit a 7-inch tablet the reality is not so straight-forward. It depends on which tablet and which case (if any). For instance, this sleeve does not work with my 7-inch Kindle Fire HDX unless I take off the Fire HDX out of its Atlas Waterproof Case for Kindle Fire HDX 7"" by Incipio, Black (which pretty much defeats my protection scheme). In the interest of writing a relatively comprehensive review I did remove the Fire from the case and found that it swims in the sleeve (which then makes it far more likely to fall out). The Kindle Fire HDX fits fairly well if it's in a Belkin Chambray Cover for Kindle Fire HDX (will only fit Kindle Fire HDX 7""), Blacktop. Interestingly, it almost fits my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (8-inch): while it's a bit too short, it holds the Tab far more snugly than the 7-inch Kindle Fire. In other words, whether this bag will work for you really depends on what you do with your tablet: with no case, your tablet will swim in this sleeve, with some cases you'll get a ""just right"" Goldilocks solution (the Belkin case), and with others it just won't work (the Atlas Incipio case or OtterBox Defender Standing Case for Kindle Fire HDX 7"", Black). But I guess that's what you get when you go with a generic solution: something that's neither fish nor fowl.Being generic I can't fault it for really not fitting any of my devices. But I can fault it for being too cheap a sleeve at too high a cost. Either give me a better solution that's worth the money or price it accordingly. Given that I generally like and purchase Five Star's products (I've found that they do generally deliver good value for the dollar), I was hoping for much more and it's only my like of Five Star that keeps this from being a 1- or 2-star review.Summary: this sleeve is a bust and something that I can only grudgingly give 3 stars. Not a fan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16LFBUMZJ441Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M2ULL40#wasThisHelpful","R16LFBUMZJ441Z","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was first introduced to ""dry"" lubes when I started using Park Tool CL-1 Synthetic Blend Chain Lube Bottle (4 oz) to keep my bike chains lubricated when I went out for a ride in wet or other sloppy conditions. After only one or two uses I became a believer: this stuff works. So when I found out about this 3-in-ONE dry lube I had to give it a try. And I wasn't disappointed.My usual go-to product for door locks and other items that needed lubrication was WD-40 Multi-Use Product Spray, 3 oz.. But WD-40 evaporates relatively quickly and can leave an oily residue. So while I love WD-40 as a ""break free"" application and quick squeak silencer, I wasn't completely satisfied with it as a longer-term lubricant. Enter this 3-in-ONE product.Over the past several weeks I used this dry lube on exterior door locks, a quick lube on a bike, and on several items that needed a bit of lube/squeak silencing. Absolutely excellent results. The locks work more easily (even in the recent cold [below freezing] weather) and there have been no ""runs and drips."" All-in-all I'm very satisfied. It's not so good on a bike chain that I will put the Park CL-1 aside (the cost differential is not so much as to cause me to put aside an excellent specialty product for a cheaper general one), but as a quick fix this dry lube does the trick.As the president of that hair club used to say, ""I'm not just the president, I'm also a client,"" in this case, ""I'm not just a Vine reviewer, I bought one too!""Summary: 5 stars.

"The TP-LINK Archer C20i dual-band wireless router is a very nice, very reasonably priced multi-standard router. The box contains the router, AC adapter (110v dual prong), ethernet cable, and Setup (mini) CD.The router can be initialized either by using the CD or by logging in to the router via web browser. I found basic initialization far easier if the the mini CD is used. Advanced settings are accessed via web page log-in after basic setup is completed.I've been using Netgear and D-Link routers for years and have grown accustomed to their menu skins. I may now have a new favorite; I thought TP-Link's setup wizard and menu layout really pleasing to look at, logically organized, and easy to understand (the help panel (on the right side of the screen) offers some of the best help that I've seen lately).Just about ""everything"" is customizable, so given the opportunity I did quite a bit of customizing. Nothing fancy, but I feel like I have a router that is ""mine."" For instance, (and I admit right up front that it may be a silly thing, but) I like that I can change the router settings log-in username from ""admin"" to a username of my choosing.I had absolutely no problem completing the setup and putting the router into service. The (standard) 2.4 GHz band worked flawlessly. A few reviewers have noted issues/problems with the 5.0 GHz band, but none so far for me; when I have had 5.0 GHz issues (with other routers) it has always been traced back to an intermittent issue with the wireless card on one of my laptops. Turning off the wireless function (leaving the router to solely manage the 4 wired ethernet ports (on the back side) is as easy as it should be: flip the switch on the right side (right above the power button)).Adding a network storage device via the single USB port was a bit of a challenge as accessing the device took a bit of reading (whatever documentation you need can be found on the mini CD or on TP-Link's support page for the Archer C20i; go here: http://www.tp-link.us/support/download/?model=Archer+C20i&version=V1). I downloaded & read through the Archer_C20i_V1_Storage_Sharing_Application_Guide and found (using Windows 7) I had to open the ""Run"" application and type ""\\tplinklogin.net"" in the dialog box. Once I cmpleted this simple step it was easy to see and access the attached USB drive.Because USB setup wasn't as intuitive as other aspects of the set-up routine I'm ""forced"" to deduct a 1/4 star. The other 1/4 star is admittedly a matter of preference: I really do not like the form factor (preferring, I guess, the more traditional ""slab"" form factor (see, for instance, the Netgear WPN824N N150 Wireless Router)).In the end, I really like this router and (if you like the looks of it) recommend it. It's easy to set up, it does what it is advertised to do, and is not at all expensive. At least 4.5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EUYHMX0G2F37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2RO8JC#wasThisHelpful","R2EUYHMX0G2F37","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are already a number of excellent reviews for this product (e.g., ""zhabazon"" and ""G. Hearn""). ""Zhabazon"" points out that this dispenser has siblings in the OXO family and provides suggestions for flushable wipes, while ""G. Hearn"" adds additional points and suggests other wipes. So there's no need to say what has already been so well said.I pretty much agree that this dispenser is really nice and pretty much a 5-star product. Well-made, good-looking, and at a reasonable price point, what's not to like? Honestly, very little. But there are two things that I feel need to be pointed out. First, it's much larger in the hand than in the product pix. I had hoped to put this in the bathroom on a small shelf above the toilet, but it's too big (i.e., too deep [front to back]). I thought it would be about the same size of the wipes we use, but the wipes are just swallowed up by the dispenser. Not a big deal at all, but something I think one should know about....Second, I can't get past how distracting the gap is when the lid is closed. Compare the product pic for this dispenser and the product pic for another OXO dispenser (OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Aqua). With this product there is a gap between the lid and bosy when closed whereas in the other (OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Aqua) it appears that there is no gap. Every time I look at this reviewed product I keep thinking either the lid is busted or not properly closed. It's neither and no real big deal, but (for me) it's utterly distracting....In the end, what a nice dispenser. Looks good in the bathroom, at the dinner table (when having juicy/greasy finger foods), or in the baby's room. Large size means it will fit just about any size wipe, quality construction means it will last for quite some time. Another top-notch OXO product. If they would only fix that gap...!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L0FTDI3VA6V3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9X5W9G#wasThisHelpful","R1L0FTDI3VA6V3","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom line, my wife says that this ""serum"" doesn't do much more than (lightly) moisturize. She never felt that the product burned (as some reviewers have noted), she saw no elimination of age lines (as others have triumphantly noted), and no real ""green apple"" smell (disappointing, as both of us really like green apple). Maybe my wife (or her skin) isn't old enough to see any difference, but after using this ""serum"" for several weeks she feels more than comfortable going back to her favorite and far less expensive moisturizer.The cosmetics industry is notorious for making claims that have absolutely no basis in objective truth/reality; beyond a certain level of performance, customers are paying for nothing more than hype. Not saying that's the case here, but truth be told I am leaning strongly in that direction. Take, for example, the copious use of the word ""organic"" on the product packaging. What's that mean? In the end, what we have is a marketing ploy as the manufacturer wants the buyer to equate ""organic"" with ""healthy."" Maybe so, but ""organic"" really means that something has carbon in it (like gasoline. Or charcoal). Continuing in this cynical vein, I would also be curious to see how well the manufacturer's claim (that the product has been ""clinically validated"") would stand up to rigorous scrutiny. I suspect the claim's suspect: go to the product's webpage (http://www.juicebeauty.com/about-us/clinically-validated/) and decide for yourself.Anyway, having had the opportunity to witness the use of this product for several weeks it seems to me that a sizable percentage of the claimed results are at best temporary fixes and more likely ""placebo effects"" (roughly, you can believe/will an absolutely inert product into working (at least to some extent)). The ""age defy"" aspect probably isn't so much an actual change; rather, it's probably the result of a positive application of ""you're as old as you feel."" So if you believe you are getting at least some of the promised benefits and feel comfortable spending $59 (at the time of this review) for them, then go for it: the ""placebo effect"" may be just that, but it is real!Summary: 3 stars because this ""serum"" does at least moisturize.

"Short and sweet: not bad/really nice (I try to write for both the ""glass half full""/""glass half empty"" crowds!).Buying polymer Backup Iron Sights (BUIS) means you save on weight and cost over a metal BUIS system. These polymer sights weigh less than half than my ""iron"" BUIS (in fact, both the front and rear weigh less than my metal front flip-up sight alone). And they cost about half of what you would pay for an ""iron"" set (compare with Diamondhead FRONT & Rear Combat Sights - Integrated Sighting System (I.S.S.) w/ Diamond (Black) (Sold as Set) (Flip-Up) - LIFETIME WARRANTY). You don't have to settle on the feature set because it's a polymer BUIS (e.g., the rear aperture on this set is metal and not plastic). (Speaking of features, I don't have a PhD in ""gun stuffology,"" so I defer to the product description and other reviewers for the more esoteric details. After 30 years in the Army, iron sights are, well, iron sights: point rifle downrange, put your target inside the circle and above the post, and pull the trigger. Up to 300 yards the result was usually bad for the target and good for me. I'm so old school Army that I am only now making the move to scopes, still like the A2 carry handle, and find the lack thereof on an AR platform disconcerting!) Anyway, so far, so good.Back to the BUIS. If your front sight mount sits on a gas block these sights (at least the front one) are not for you: says right on the package that the sight will melt. Speaking of heat, I wonder if the opposite also holds true: will they crack in cold weather? Not sure, but it's one reason I'm leery of plastic; having spent an entire career among fellow G.I.s, there's a reason why things in the military tend to be made of metal: metal doesn't break so easily. Probably an irrational fear, but I'll take metal (if I can afford it) over plastic almost every time if the item is a mission-critical one. And now that they are in my hands I must admit I'm not too keen on the angled (as opposed to rounded) approach Diamondhead took (to my mind, the sights looked cooler in the pictures than they do in my hand). But that's really a matter of aesthetics (a secondary aspect) and not one of function (the primary concern (I think) one should have in buying a BUIS.In the end, I put this Diamondhead polymer BUIS set next to my ""competing manufacturer"" steel/aluminum BUIS set (roughly similar to Troy Industries Inc. Front Folding HK Style Battle Sight and Troy Industries Folding Battle Sight Rear) and find that in almost every way I like the steel set more (to include the rounded geometry). For me, this BUIS will be a BUBUIS. But that's not to say the Diamondhead BUIS set is second-rate or substandard. It's not, the set is actually quite nice. Reasonable cost, good feature set, and well-manufactured, this BUIS set has only a few minor drawbacks (i.e., polymer limits application and I wonder about durability). If you have an application that will support polymer, are careful that the sights are polymer, and dig the diamond-shaped approach you can't go wrong. And as I mentioned at the beginning of the review you'll save a bunch of cash ""going polymer"" over steel/aluminum. This BUIS set is fully deserving of a solid 4-plus star rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L7ED2CN2UIWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JM6RDZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1L7ED2CN2UIWX","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unless a rectangular paper plate is an absolute necessity (and I can see that it might be in a cutting board) I'm really finding it hard to justify the cost of this item. At $0.20/piece it is just about three times the cost/piece of the circular, yet comparably-sized Dixie HD Paper Plates, 10 1/16 Inches, 240 Count (Packaging May Vary).I can see uses for these plates - er, cutting boards - er, serving trays. With a waxy surface, they're fairly heavy duty, not unpleasant to look at, and useful. I guess the idea of a disposable cutting surface/board so that cross-contamination doesn't occur makes sense. But they are flimsy (flimsier than many paper plates we've used), the dish of the tray/board is not very deep, and the bag they come in isn't even resealable (important if we're talking about sanitation being a top concern). But it's the cost - my, oh my, I can't get past the cost.Bottom line, unless shape matters I can't see any reason whatsoever to buy this (rectangular) item over a far less expensive (circular) paper plate.

"My wife has had the opportunity to put this baster through its paces and finds she absolutely loves it. Here are her observations....Angled baster tip is a real plus. That it is removable for cleaning is an excellent bonus. The tip has a rubberized connection, so even though it is removable it does not leak.The stand (near the baster top; see photo) keeps the baster from rolling around. Put it down, it stays where you put it. (As an aside, I too found this feature really cool: during the very few times I've used a baster it always seemed to roll around and usually off the counter top! So yes, a simple idea that should have been self-evident a long time ago.)The baster bulb is ""perfectly"" sized (at least for my wife's hands). Not too squishy, not too inflexible. It also removes easily for cleaning.The included baster brush means that not only is the baster easy to clean you get the correct tool to do the cleaning.

"Honestly, I didn't know what to make of this when it arrived. A flexible silicon ice tray, my first thought was - considering the price - that this was a solution in search of a problem. But it's really not fair to review/rate until the product is actually used, so in with the water and into the freezer.The next day we had six ice cubes. It did just what it promised to do, but is it worth the cost or space? In the end, I kinda think so. I do like that the ice/water is enclosed so that it doesn't pick up unwanted odors/flavors. I do like that the flexible silicon allows for very easy removal of the ice. I do like that the trays can be stacked. I think it will clean very easily. I like how you know how much water to add: hold the tray upright (with the opening up) and fill to the marked ""fill line"" on the side of the tray (when you move from the vertical to the horizontal the correct amount of water fills each of the cube ""slots"").Not so sure I like how small the cubes were or that each tray takes up more room than they should. As such, I would like to see a tray that makes more than 6 cubes and one that is half the height. Then one would get the benefits of both a traditional ice cube tray and this item.Finally, I'm not sure a $10.00 price point (Amazon price at the time of this review) makes for an attractive purchase. Unless silicon is really far more expensive than I think it is, $7.50 is at the very top end of what I would happily pay (perhaps 1 at $7.50, 2 for $10.00?). The product would also be a bit more attractive to buyers if various colors were offered.In the end, this is a very cool little gadget that - if money and size are secondary to function - should serve as a nice addition to anyone's freezer. Since price and size are important to me my first inclination was to say it was okay and give it 3 stars. But I can see the value in it, so let's bump it up to ""I like it!"" and give it 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L5TM7P7KGX4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOPV4KI#wasThisHelpful","R2L5TM7P7KGX4J","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I started playing high school soccer back in the early-mid 1970s the mindset seemed very much to be on the offense. Back then the preferred formation was 5-3-2 (5 forwards, 3 midfielders, and 2 fullbacks)! On the front line there was a left & right wing, a center, and an inside left and an inside right. ""Attack!"" was the motto of the day and even the formation listing listed the offense first. In this mindset, the 5 attackers attacked and the opposing team's 5 defenders (the 3 midfielders and 2 fullbacks) defended.Sometime between then and now coaches at all levels realized that while winning meant their jobs might be safe, losing meant they definitely weren't. So the emphasis slowly shifted from winning to not losing. And the point structure helped: if a coach knew his team stood a slim chance of winning, he could be rewarded for ""packing the box,"" hunkering down, and leaving the stadium with a point. In the end, that one point might just have been what the coach needed to keep his job. That this was so was reflected in the change - at some point - from an offense-oriented formation formula (e.g., 5-3-2) to a defense-oriented one (e.g., 4-4-2).Fast forward to today and we see - for a variety of reasons - a slow switch back to the offense. The boxes are still packed (coaches can ill-afford to give up a goal), but it's no longer enough to do simply that. Team formations still reflect an emphasis on the defense, but finally we are seeing coaches thinking about getting goals too (and not just talking about getting them).Here's where this book comes in. The book seeks to introduce an offensive mindset from the goal line forward. We have chapters on generating offense from the mid-field, from the defensive third, from the goalie. We even have chapters on generating offense off of the opponent's set pieces. Chapters generally start with a short ""philosophy"" essay that introduces drills designed to generate the ""offense always"" mindset. Not bad.For a book that has just been published, some of the essays contain some out-dated factoids (e.g., people being in certain jobs: one essay still had Kenny Dalglish managing Liverpool FC). Annoying, but minor. So no ding.If I have to complain, I would say the book would really benefit from an introductory chapter that addresses offense ""as a whole,"" as a coherent, over-arching game strategy. It's great that there are chapters on ""offense in the midfield,"" ""offense in the defensive third,"" etc., but it would have been nice to see all of it tied together and introduced in one essay right up front (even if it would seem somewhat redundant). Coaches first, and then players, need to know from the start (i.e., page 1) that the best soccer/football, most exciting soccer/football, and potentially most successful soccer/football is ""full participation"" soccer/football (where everyone is involved in every phase of the game: the offense, the defense, set pieces, etc.). This book is, thus, much needed and more than a step in the right direction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M6UXZ8BN7GJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1450422403#wasThisHelpful","R3M6UXZ8BN7GJ5","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this (Camco) stand to go with the Camco 40631 EVO Premium Water Filter. As the stand looks to be a perfect companion to the EVO Premium Water Filter I bought it without hesitation. But they are not perfectly mated.On the plus side, the stand is really well-constructed. I like the foot rung: it provides both a way of getting the stand into the ground and keeping the stakes in line. The zinc coating should keep the stand from rusting.BUT THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE FILTER HOLDER IS FAR LARGER THAN THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE EVO FILTER UNIT! So the only way the filter stays in the stand is by resting on the inlet and outlet hoses! I could understand this if I was using a non-Camco stand, but I'm not. IMHO, either Camco needs to rethink the size of this item or sell one mated specifically to the EVO unit.Bottom line, pay attention to the second photo for this product (which shows the EVO unit in the stand) or the photo for the EVO Filter itself. I didn't and wish I had; not sure I would have bought this if I had been more attentive. In the end, it's easier all the way around to keep the stand (rather than return it) so the next step is to figure out a better means of supporting the filter in the stand (one possible solution: use the filter wrench provided with the EVO unit).","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FA4K4QKMRNIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0024E6V9E#wasThisHelpful","R1FA4K4QKMRNIL","A33WFRICMYRPT6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33WFRICMYRPT6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't looking for these name tapes to go on a uniform or battle rattle. As I just needed to mark a couple of private-use rucksacks, I wasn't expecting much. And that's pretty much what I got.I agree with reviewers Lance H., Gordon, & B. Meade: these name tapes are of a much lower quality than the buyer should expect (lettering crooked, thin material). Also, the ""coyote brown"" is much, much darker than what you will see on your computer; so dark, in fact, that it is difficult to see the black lettering used for my name. I should have went with ""coyote tan.""I was drawn in by the ""free shipping"" and as such failed to realize that I probably wasn't going to get the same quality as from the Marine Corps Exchange (something's gotta give, right?

"Saw these at a local discount store and tried them on. I wasn't too sure what to make of them at first since they basically look like imitation Converse Chuck Taylors. However, the price at $20 and initial fit and comfort is what sold me. After two weeks on wearing them during Julyaround NYC I've found these to be better for fit, comfort, quality, and price than any Converse sneakers I've owned in the past.In fact these Levi's Stan Bucks reminded me of the original MADE IN USA Chuck Taylors that sold for $20-$30 back in the 1980s/1990s before Nike took over Converse raised prices of shoes and moved manufacturing to China.The quality is much better. Stitching is precise, the fabric and rubber are put together very well (no glue smears or loose threads). I also find the rubber soles and toe rand doesn't get dirty or wear down as quickly as Converse.With regards to price: for $20 to $30 these shoes are a steal. I honestly feel Levi's could sell these for $70 to $100 and at that price it would be a bargain.The comfort is way better than Converse Chucks. I can walk all day in these with or without socks and I have cool dry feet even on the hottest day. The foot bed is actually a foot bed with arch support and not a flat canvas sheet-glues-to- rubber outsole combo that Converse employs on their Chucks. So you don't have that bare feet feeling with these Levi's that you normally get from wearing Chucks. Also the rubber toe rand cap is tailored wider than Chucks so there should be no hard rubbing against your toes.Fit is also exact for the size and Levi's include half sizes for a better fit. Converse tends to fit big with little access to half sizes for many shoes. Here it is easy to get an exact fit.At the end of the day you can't go wrong for the price. In fact I am so impressed I came online to buy at least another pair of these which is why I am here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PCS3RIFZ72X2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IV3BDBI#wasThisHelpful","R2PCS3RIFZ72X2","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very good quality lamps! I just replaced the original Philips DS2 in my 2001 BMW 330i.I believe those were the original factory bulbs that came with the car and they lasted 15 years.I was looking to get the same Philips DS2 that cost much more than these Kensun bulbs but theAmazon reviews were better on these bulbs. So my choice was based on reviews before the price.After two weeks of usage I am pleased to say that these 5000k Kensun's are a great replacement to the factory standard.They appear brighter on the road than the slight-yellowish 4000k factory HIDs. The bulbs themselves look pure white in the lenswith a slight-blue tint. My car is topaz blue so it is a great match.I've had them in my car for two weeks and I have had no issues what so ever. The BMW E46 Xenon HID lowbeam replacement is really easy, requiring no tools at all, and foolproof, requiring absolutely no technical skills or knowledge.The BMW and Luxury car dealerships charge over $1,000 to replace bulbs and diagnose lighting issues. Do it yourself in mere minutes with these Kensun bulbs and save yourself the money, hassle and time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18UJ05AHKZQUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EECLVXA#wasThisHelpful","R18UJ05AHKZQUQ","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"7/25/2015 EDIT: This ONLY works with the newer 9/2001 E46/ 3 Series BMW cars and I assume the later years after 2001 BMW vehicles. The seller offers NO refunds but refuse to properly list what cars this part will work with. I would have NOT made this purchase had I known this information. Even with the correct 9/2001 module I could not get it coded for my car. It is easier to get your insurance company to replace your windshield at the BMW dealership instead of Safelite (which uses aftermarket windshields) so that you can get this part for free as it already comes attached to the BMW OEM windshields.ORIGINAL REVIEW: If you have an older 1999 to 2001 pre facelift 3 series then you need to upgrade the rain sensor module. This only fits the newer rain sensor modules. Other than that shipping was quick and professional. Everything arrived as described. This is only the hard plastic purple sensor lens and not the actual hardware sensor module so as long as you install it correctly and your sensor works then it will work","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I7P2CZ03J6KX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Q608YA#wasThisHelpful","R2I7P2CZ03J6KX","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this style so much I went back and bought this Mazarine 3D Riley after owning the Comfort Pint Arc 3D Zip Jacket for a few months. I own the Comfort Pintt in an XL which fit my 5'8""tall/155lb frame perfect with lots of room to layer medium-weight sweater underneath (Basically XL fits like a medium 38R in this style). But I was only able to find a L in this Mazarine fabric thinking it would fit slim and look good with only a thin t-shirt underneath. I can barely get into this jacket with just a thin t-shirt it fits that small. The shoulders and armpits are very tight and worse the Mazarine denim fabric is 100% stiff cotton so there is absolutely no stretch or give to the fabric when putting it on or moving your arms above your head.Great style and color but sizing should be more accurate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20WGS4M07D50U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELCGS5E#wasThisHelpful","R20WGS4M07D50U","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the slowly disintigrating Zagg for a full year before it fully broke on it's own.  That keyboard had a lot of issues some of which included normal wear ""rub"" damage to the chrome edges of my Note 12.2. The Samsung keyboard is a much better choice and the only issue I have with it is that Samsung and Best Buy didn't announce that this was coming out when I got the Zagg. I only discovered its existence when I walked into Best Buy to look at the Galaxy Note Edge phone. Even then at the time (Fall 2014) they only had the white color keyboard available. Very frustrating for someone  with a black Note 12.2.Overall the Samsung keyboard is great. I wished the keys had more travel to them but they are comfortable during long bouts of typing.  The weight of the entire thing is heavier than the Zagg but it is a heft that exudes more quality that bulk. It feels like you can throw it across the room and it will still work fine and come out unscathed.  The Bluetooth connection is much quicker and autonomous than the Zagg.  With the Zagg you have to confirm the connection every time or ESC the pop up box telling you the Zagg is connecting, here the Samsung just connects. As for battery life these keyboards are really good. As for the case function when the tablet is closed inside the keyboard the locking tabs at the corner is weaker than I would like. It is not a firm clip in.  There is also no sleep function for the tablet when nestled in the shell. As far as I can see the screen is still on when you close the tablet in the case. At least the keys don't seem to touch the screen like it does on the Zagg.Two things I would add: Firmer locking tabs and a sleep function!Nevertheless I turn off the tablet and I use a padded laptop carry sleeve when toting around the samsung tablet & keyboard in my briefcase.The asking retail price is $99.99+ which is a lot to pay for what you get but many online stores and Amazon sellers sell these for half that retail price. Definately worth the buy especially if you do heavy typing work on your tablet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B79QVQGFX8KK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JI9HH2I#wasThisHelpful","R2B79QVQGFX8KK","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This jacket was a spontaneous buy for me. I didn't need it since I just got the similar Kenneth Cole Moto Jacket but it was on sale for $63.99 one-day sale at my local G Star boutique. Even if it was $200 or $300, after trying it on I couldn't leave the store without it. The Forc Across looks way better in person than it does in any picture you will ever see online.At $63.99 this jacket was a gift.I especially lucked out because the only size left was a LARGE which fit my medium 5'8""  160 lb frame perfectly.I can wear just a T-shirt or a T-shirt/medium sweater-combo underneath and the Forc still fits and looks the same. The faux fabric has a bit of stretch to it so the jacket wears comfortably independent on how many layers you wear underneath it.One potential concern I had early on was discovering the sleeves on the Forc were not articulated (which means whenever you move your arms above your head or when driving a car the jacket can ride up and bunch up around your torso). This worry was quickly quelled because the fabric does stretch along the arms and back so it compensates for the lack of articulation when you move your arms around. It doesn't ride up or bunch up that much.The outer pockets all zip close and the one interior chest pocket button-snaps to close. I would have wanted another interior chest pocket but all the pockets are cavernous and comfortable.The jacket does not have an insulation fill between the cotton inner lining and outer faux leather. As a result I did not find it to be warm in temperatures below 45 F degrees. It is also not all that windproof so even on a windy 50 to 60 F degree day you will be cold if you do not layer well underneath or wear a scarf. The neck collar has a wool/acrylic fleece lining that can work to keep your neck warm when the jacket is zipped up and the collar cinched closed. That is the only protection against the cold you will get so prepare to layer up and put on a scarf if you tend to get cold.The cotton inner fabric collects a lot of lint. I would have preferred a polyester or nylon lining.I also own the Kenneth Cole Reaction Moto jacket and I found that Moto jacket to be much warmer and more wind resistant since it has a quilted polyester lining with an insulation fill inside.The plus side to this for the G Star Forc is that I found in temps above 70 F to 85 F degrees that I did not overheat or get hot at all. The jacket vents/breaths very well in warmer temps even when zipped up. So this is an ideal Spring into Summer season jacket whereas the Moto (or similar jackets) are mainly Spring up to Summer jackets.For my tastes I prefer the G Star Forc jacket. It looks very slick since it is not riddled with zippers and pockets and of all the Faux Leather bikers it's leather quality looks the richest and realest.$310 retail is asking a lot for it but even those paying that price will be VERY HAPPY with the product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3677I9AKZ1EZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU82QKQ#wasThisHelpful","R3677I9AKZ1EZM","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really great piece of denim!The Comfort Delm fabric feels rugged yet very comfortable when worn. It has a bit of stretch to it so it wears very well. The Dark Aged finish is notas dark as I would like but it is more of a medium denim wash exactly like the pictures show.Unlike most of G Star's fancier fare this stretch mid-weight denim is easy to wear in literally any situation. Put on some tan suede loafers, chukka's or oxfords with a baby blue sheen business shirt and you will fit in amongst the trust fund folks brunching life away on Madison Avenue. Put on a pair of Timberlands or Air Jordan's and a G Star hoodie and you will find yourself on stage rapping next to Bobby Schmurda!All Radar Slim fit slimmer than your average G Stars. I'm normally a 32 x 32 but sized up to a 33 x 32 in these for an exact fit. They do have a bit of stretch so it would be okay if you get your exact size for a tighter fit. It would not be un comfortable at all.Definitely a great piece of denim for everyone's G Star Collection.One thing I noticed when looking for these online is the European Product Code is listed as 50740.6083.89 while the North American/USA Product Code is 50740-6083-020 for the same New Radar Slim Comfort Delm Denim Jeans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35YGHL61I2AFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHPZX12#wasThisHelpful","R35YGHL61I2AFI","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First pair of G Star Jeans I owned that I sized down from my normal G Star size  32 x 32  to a 30 x 32. I won't say they fit big but it seems 32 x 32 , 31 x 32 and 30 x 32 all fit the same!Yeah I was lucky enough to find a couple of these left at my local Lords & Taylors for $60 on sale. For me I could have bought any size but I found the 30 x 32 to fit the best with the Slim Taper cut.The Taper style for this 5620 3D tend to fit slim on the waist, baggy in the thigh and slim in the calf and ankle. I'm not sure if I got an irregular but the Taper 30 x 32 in these particular pants fit exactly like a Slim 32 x 32 in all my other Slim Fit G Stars.That said I am extremely happy with the over all style and function of these 5620 3D although I won't  buy anymore of this Taper 5260 3D. It is not really my style compared to Arc 3Ds, Radar Slims and the Attacc/Nattacc. Stylistically 5620 3D seem boring and dated by comparison. Actually had I not found them for $60 I definitely would not have bought them over any other G Star jeans at their original $180 retail price tag.One thing to add I've notice the dark blue dye on these particular jeans comes of much easier than my other dark blue dyed G Stars. I haven't washed them yet but I expect them to most likely fade in time.Remember G-Star says to never wash their dark denims but if you do turn them inside out and  use ONLY ice cold water (literally put ice cubes in the machine if you have to) and hang dry in a dark place.Over all I am happy I got these even though they are not my favorite G Star jeans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HNEQ0KVVDUF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DF77GSE#wasThisHelpful","R1HNEQ0KVVDUF7","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful piece of denim! The pictures do not give justice to how amazing this denim wash is. These look absolutely amazing when you put them on. The blue color here is the most perfect wash of indigo blue I have ever seen on jeans in all my life. I don't think G Star or any other top denim maker will EVER procure a more brilliant indigo blue denim wash. The whisker and fading patterns are simply electrifying when seen in person. These would be the perfect jeans except for two things;1. The Nolds fabric is a really thick and rigid 13 oz weave and as a result I needed to size up from my normal G Star size 32x32 to a size 34x32 just to get a proper fit in the waist. G Star recommends the normal size because even though the first wear will be tight as heck their fabrics all stretch out or break in to fit to your body in time. With the Nolds I really did not feel this thick of a weave would ever stretch out.2. If I was rich I would have kept them but for $300 I found the price to be extremely high relative to other Arc 3D denim that G Star sells.I replaced these Nolds with the Wisk Medium Aged Arc 3D and the Neill Dark Aged Arc 3D and still had money left over to buy a couple of G Star t shirts.I think later in the year if I can find these Nolds on sale for cheaper or when my tax returns come in and I have cash to spare I will buy these again.The denim wash color of the Nolds will leave you speechless.It is a joke how the pictures on Amazon don't do these pants justice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YTWZJOUM8LLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LO0ZGFY#wasThisHelpful","R2YTWZJOUM8LLK","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great phone. If you have this phone and also carry something like an iPhone 5 or Samsung Android Galaxy 4 then you would literally have the most powerful pairing in mobile telephony in your pockets.PROS:> All 9790s come factory unlocked to accept Sim cards and work anywhere on this planet!

"This is a book that I often re-read every few years as a reference guide to ideas that are still important today.  Some of the points in this book have been upgraded over the years but the ideas in it are still relevant and thought provoking. The organization of this book is also very well done so it makes it a perfect companion piece to anyone doing research on some of the issues discussed.The writing is a little chunky at times and the author sometimes go off on a tangent during crucial explanation of advanced subjects but  if you stick it out most readers without a scientific background or education will understand what is what.Those that enjoy this book should definitely check out Borderlands Of Science by Charles Sheffield for a broader, albeit older, scope of what this book discusses. Also `13 Things That Don't Make Sense' is another similar book that tries to explain the many ideas and mystery involved with modern science.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BAKM4S439DC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300119984#wasThisHelpful","R3BAKM4S439DC9","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this Calibre H610 Chrono Time AT series. In a light weight, relatively inexpensive package, Citizen stuffs a lot into this movement. You get sapphire glass, a slide rule, atomic radio updates, perpetual calender, 26 city world time, chronograph, alarm, automatic DST and a 24 hour sunrise/sunset indicator. All powered by the sun. I have been wearing this H610 movement on other watches and I have been very happy with it. The alarm chime could be louder but it is a flawless, trouble-free, easy to use watch.One neat little trick is when pulling up functions that require reading of the sub dials the main dial hands move out of the way so you can see the sub dial info until the function is read or completed.  I also read online that Citizen builds in a shock detection system that protects the internals during a fall.I already had the blue face BY0000-56L and the two tone BY0006-50E when I came across this Limited Edition BY0003-07E. It was offered at such a great deal I had to get it even though I didn't need it or even wanted another H610 watch.This one comes in a swag wooden coffin box replete with a white leather lining, cushions and a hidden compartment for keeping the manuals, warranty cards and the setting instructions CD disc. In the packaging is also a plastic certificate card signed by the Citizen President/CEO. The card states which watch you have of the 2500. Which is cool.What is not cool is the Crocodile strap that this 07E comes with. It flimsy thin sort of cheap looking AND worse of all the lug end of the strap is not curved to hug the watch case so it leaves a nasty gap at the lugs. Being a thin flat strap it also makes the watch face appear more bigger than it needs to look.I love this watch but I really hate the Croc strap.  On an $850 watch Citizen could've done a better job with the strap. I am in the process or replacing the Croc strap with a Citizen 22mm Rubber-Black-59-T50668 strap. This rubber strap is off the BY0005-01E brother watch to this BY0003-07E.The rubber strap is curved and sits flush against the case thereby making the overall look of the watch balanced (and not top heavy).I also intend to use this BY0003-07E watch as more of a sporting watch (traveling, beach/park , cruise vacationing, city life) than a theater/dinner dress watch. So the rubber strap will be more suitable and also MORE modern on this watch.These originally retailed at $850 which is a bargain for what you are getting. Also considering the regular mineral glass and steel BY0000/BY0006 versions cost between $650 and $750 retail this BY0003-07E watch is a steal!Citizen no longer makes these anymore but you can find these used at a few online retailers. There is also a silver/black strap edition for those that don't like the gold tone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GP5PG9C38W4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030FAVJC#wasThisHelpful","R3GP5PG9C38W4P","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have three pairs of Snake River I (SR1) shorts and I am 5'9"" 150 lbs/33"" waist and a Small/11""inseam in the SR1 fit me perfectly which wasn't cool since I normally wear a medium in every other brand.This year with the Snake River 2 (SR2) Columbia shortened the inseam to 9 inches and made the sizes more tailored to fit how they ARE SUPPOSED TO FIT. So now with the SR2 shorts I wear a Medium/9""inseam and they actually fit perfectly. In fact the SR2's Medium fits slimmer than the SR1's small.So diehard SR1 folks may want to size up when buying SR2 shorts-also the tags on the SR2 clearly says 'Slimmer Fit' in big bold print to let you know to try them on before ripping all the tags off.Columbia made the fabric and stitched-seams thinner on the SR2 so it dries much quicker than the SR1.  Because I also use my SR shorts for hiking and rock climbing I quickly realized the SR2's are not as durable as the SR1's but if you are buying these mainly for water sports or the beach then they will be fine for that.My biggest gripe with the SR2 is pockets. All of them are smaller than the SR1. Except the back pocket which is actually bigger/deeper but my gripe here is the back pocket is no longer a  zippered pocket. It has a flimsy patch of Velcro barely keeping it closed so you can no longer keep valuables in there.  The SR2 no longer has the hidden coin/key pocket inside the mesh lining that the SR1 had.Over all I like the SR2 shorts for the better color options, fit and lighter fabric but I will definitely be keeping and wearing my SR1 shorts whenever I can.AUGUST 8, 2013 EDIT: After a month or two with these SR2 shorts I've come to really NOT like the pocket situation. Especially the main hand pockets. Columbia made the openings narrow and vertical so putting your hands in them or putting in and retrieving stuff is slightly annoying (normally the pocket openings are slanted or angled forwards for easy access). Even worse is I started to notice the pockets are stretching out and tearing at the bottom corners. This is the inevitable result of them stretching out every time I put my hand in them or use them to hold stuff.Also like I said before I use these shorts for hiking and trail biking and I'm definitely started to notice that they are not as durable as the original SR1 shorts. I only wear them on weekends and some Friday afternoons but I doubt I can pull more than two summers off with these shorts before they will need replacing.I would have knock my review down to 3 stars but these are still a bargain at $20 to $40. Technically they dry really fast and they wear very comfortably so I'm keeping the 4 stars out of 5 BUT I'm being very generous with that since I'm reviewing these shorts from the perspective of a user who wears them beyond their intended use. If you only need them for the mild beach visitation, 30 minutes at the gym or at the pool/hot-tub then these are basically 5 star shorts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQZITHRF71F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APH6XSQ#wasThisHelpful","R3AQZITHRF71F4","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1. Definitely not the cute Boyfriend Watch that your girlfriend would wear:If the essence of the male species were to be captured in one watch it would be this brolic, robust chunk of white steel famously known as the Calibre 2100. The package does indeed carry a lot of heft for it's size. So much so that when you first pick it up it will feel like the weight of its retail price in nickels (that is $595 in nickel coins by the way). But it is a good solid build that you will grow on you and that you can wear comfortably all day long whether stuck at an office desk or working in the outdoors all day. Compared to the biggest watch in my collection, the 46mm Chrono Time AT BY0000-56L, this 44.5mm sized Calibre 2100 feels twice as heavy when you pick both watches up at the same time.2. Discussing overall quality:The design quality is extremely well done and in fact I read an old online article from 2006 stating that the advent of the Calibre 2100 series was one of Citizen's first progression into using better materials for their watches as well as heralding the expansion of the Eco-Drive technology for all their watch movements.The quality of the lume (luminous phosphorescent)is also second to none. It is bright needing only a few seconds of sunlight to glow in a partly sun lit room. If you need it to shine thru the night just expose it in a few minutes of sunlight. I have never seen a better, more consistent, lume.However, my praise stops short at the design quality. By contrast the build quality is a love/hate relationship for any 2100 owner. The USA/North American market's Stainless Steel/Mineral Crystal AV0031-59A 2100 watches are prone to show visible scratches even after the slightest wear. The steel bracelet and clasp picks up scratches easily and the mineral crystal glass WILL scratch if you are not careful.I always wrap my stainless steel clasp in clear scotch tape to keep it from scuffing against my office desk when I'm working long hours at the computer.Citizen does have several better quality European and Asian market White Panda Face 2100 versions. Notably the AV0030-60A (also called the AV0030-51A) that has Sapphire Crystal on Stainless Steel cases and bands. Then there is the ultra rare AV0020-55A that has both Sapphire Crystal on polished Titanium case & band with Carbide Coating.In the USA and North America those are rare market versions of the 2100 and obviously will cost more to buy online shipped from overseas but if you get an opportunity to order one of those from overseas online from a reputable seller, even if it is $200 more than the sale price of the steel/mineral 2100, then jump on it quickly.For those of us already stuck with a AV0031-59A don't despair. Some North American Citizen Service Centers, at the time of this writing, will replace your AV0031-59A's Mineral Crystal with Sapphire Crystal glass for around $69 to $100 (pricing depends on which center you use, when you use the service and your location). This Sapphire replacement service is NOT a warranty service but replacement of a scratched Mineral Crystal glass with new Mineral Crystal glass 'may' be a free warranty service. However at the time you are replacing a broken or scratched Mineral Crystal glass UNDER the free warranty they 'may' upgrade to Sapphire for a discounted fee or free if you ASK.I have used Citizen Service Centers on many occasions since 2006 and I have found that is always best to call your service center, be as friendly as possible and ASK for what you want. Usually they are super friendly and will work with you in making you a happy customer. Still NOTE that Citizen Service and Warranty terms are always subject to change and what I am writing here is ONLY true at the time of this review (May 2013) and can change or cease all together in the future.Another thing that gets scratched easily but CANNOT be replaced is the polished bezel frame that surrounds the crystal glass. My service center said it could not be replaced and that they could not (or rather would not) polish the scratches out. So keep that in mind when buying used 2100 watches. A scratched Mineral Crystal glass and scuffed bracelet can be replaced but you can't replaced that scuffed polished bezel ring.That said, I'm on my second AV0031-59A 2100 watch. My first one purchased in May 2011 immediately got scratched on the glass because I had no idea of the sensitivity of the mineral crystal and was not careful. I replaced the mineral crystal at the Hurley Service Center in Atlanta GA but found out the scratched bezel ring was irreplaceable so sold it off in May 2012 to buy my current AV0031-59A 2100. Since I've been careful with the crystal I have not had any damage on it so far.3. Discussing the 2100's face:Compared the all the 2100 series the white color panda face dial is by far the easiest to read at a glance. It is the least busy and cleanest in design. There is not much to say. The main hands are hour, minute, and fly back-chronograph seconds with the red arrow being the alarm location (when the hour hand enters the red arrow the alarm chimes). The sub dials are 3 o'clock for the chronograph minutes, 6 o'clock for the time keeping second hand and 9 o'clock for the chronograph hours (yes this guy does up to 12 hr chrono which is amazing) with the massive 12 o'clock sub dial displaying the current solar charge situation.4. Discussing the functionality of the Calibre 2100's E210 movement:The e210 movement's main feature is the powerful sweeping fly-back chronograph. Pressing button A starts and pauses the chronograph. Pressing button B, after button A pauses it, resets the chronograph. The chronograph can record up to 12 hours which is a feature unique to this movement.The e210 movement also has an alarm chime and a date window. It is not perpetual calender movement and will need to be adjusted every month depending on if the month has 31, 30, 28 or 29 days. There is a massive sub dial for power reserve indicator and a passive Tachymeter scale framing the entire face. Everything works as should and all the movements are spot on accurate.Because of it's ease of use and readability, I have found that the e210 movement is more of an everyday working watch than a specialist watch or a passive dress piece. The chronograph is useful for sporting events, productivity tasks or activities where one is tracking or timing something for periods longer than the basic 60 minute limit your get with regular chronographs. I could see the e210 movement being a perfect compliment to any profession where keeping tabs on activities lasting more than an hour is vital.5. What I would change:I am not a fan of the steel bracelet. The bracelet linkage on the 2100 is a clunky, chunky and rattly affair.On hot days the steel bracelet can feel cumbersome and often times at the end of a tedious work day I find myself removing the watch to let my wrist breathe and relax. Similar to taking off heavy work boots and putting on flip flops or tennis shoes for the long drive home after work.I wish the links were closer spaced, a bit wider (24mm instead of 23mm) and slightly thinner (like it is on the BY0000-56L's bracelet). The bracelet on the Calibre 2100 watches are NOT interchangeable with leather/fabric straps or other bracelets.A major unexpected issue that many first timers will have is with the removable links using the sleeved style pins that make bracelet size adjustment impossible without a proper watch tool (you can easily buy one off eBay from 99 cents and up) or a skilled watch technician nearby (most watch shops or sellers will re-size the bracelet from free to around $5.00).When attempting to adjust the bracelet and the sleeved pins are pushed out the miniscule sleeves detaches from the pin. These tiny sleeves serve as friction devices holding the pins firmly inside the link holes. Without the sleeves the naked pins will just slide out of the link holes and the bracelet falls apart.The issue is that once you remove a pin and the sleeve comes off that pin it is impossible (as far as I can tell) to put the sleeve back around the pin without advanced watch tools.That is if the miniscule sleeve didn't already roll off your table top and already got lost . These sleeves have a tendency to disappear once you start pushing your pins out.The ONLY way I found to reuse a naked pin is to bend the pin slightly in the middle so it holds in place when inserted back into the linkage hole.Overall I would have preferred the much easier to use self locking V (wedge) style pin that go in and out of the linkage holes on their own.That said, the one positive here is the bracelet clasp has a 3 range micro adjustment extension or retraction for making the bracelet slightly bigger or smaller. Micro adjustments can easily be done with a pen tip, paper clip, safety pin or similar object.Third gripe: For the retail price of $595 I would expect Citizen to use Sapphire Crystal in the USA models.The Mineral Crystal glass will scratch if you are not careful. Also the matte steel bracelet and clasp picks up bruises and scuffs easily compared to other steel clasps I've worn. Furthermore the shiny caseback also scratches and fades away overtime from normal wear.Finally (and this is not my personal gripe but it should be noted here) the Alarm Chime is not loud at all. It is more of a light reminder-chime than a loud, wake-me-up-alarm chime. I didn't buy this for an alarm clock but I expect many souls will see the alarm/chronograph stamped on the box description and plunk down $595 expecting to be awoken from this watch. They will be very disappointed. For me I have a $5 alarm clock in my bedroom and a 99cent alarm clock in my travel kit to wake me up so I don't expect wake up duties to be held by my wrist watch.6. Final word:If there is one watch that you will buy in a 10 year period that you will find extremely hard to flip or part with it would be this Panda Face Calibre 2100 series. It is a timeless piece of business in terms of design and performance quality. It is also easy to wear as a day to day watch going with just about every get up from business attire to sports wear to beach wear, etc... I've seen wedding pictures with Panda Faces clinging to the groom and I've seen this watch countless of times at the gym. That lets you know the 2100 is all about the business and not just about the show.Get the Sapphire Crystal AV0030-60A(or AV0030-51A) version or call your Service Center and get the Sapphire Crystal upgrade and you will be very happy in doing so. Also the resale values of a used condition AV0031-59A 2100 with or without Sapphire are off the scales. These watches keep a decent value even though Citizen USA still carries this very same original panda face 2100 on their website today and you could still buy them online or brick and mortar retail. Still buyers and eBayers hunger after used 2100s as if these watches are rare discontinued items.Now that tells you when a watch has a good demand value. Get one and you will be happy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWTQII2VDC5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EQTXXA#wasThisHelpful","R2GWTQII2VDC5I","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been watching TV Sci-Fi since the 1980s. I'm in my 30s now and I'm not at all impressed by this show. I totally get what they are trying to do but the execution leaves a lot for the imagination. I barely made it thru the first episode where all the good guys look like J-Crew fashion models and all the bad guys are an assortment non-white minorities, hippies, and women who clearly look like lesbians. Also for some reason these same bad guys who are able to manipulate time travel and return from the distant future are not too bright when sticking to their main plan, or when caught up in a good old 21st century gun fight or when trying to outmaneuver the local police.Sci-Fi aside none of the basic plot is credible. A random woman with no ID is walking in the middle of a bomb explosion crime scene that is clearly blocked off by the investigating officers and she is not only greeted by the lead detective but invited back to the precinct and pretty much given a gun and badge simply because she tells him that she a police officer from Portland. Can you imagine this happening in 2013 USA? Well I can't.Welcome to Plot Convenience Theater where everything is made up as the story goes along. If these writers can't make a basic scene where the main female character meets another character credible then you know the Sci-Fi is NOT going to be written very well.I doubt I would want to even give the other 9 episodes a chance even then I feel I've seen this 'Time Cop' plot too many times before and they are much better similar themed shows to watch right now.If you think this show is good then previous (similar) time travel/ time blip shows like Journeyman and Daybreak will make your head explode. Even simple episodes of Red Dwarf where they time travel back and forth is more intriguing and more original than this tawdry affair called Continuum.I would leave this 'Continuum' series for the Tween audiences. Or rather if you grew up on Sharknado, Twilight and the Harry Potter movies for your Sci-Fi then this series will be enjoyed by you.Grown ups look elsewhere.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HAO848Z4NZXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APRBBBK#wasThisHelpful","R3HAO848Z4NZXP","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1. Love at first sight:I was surprised by the stunning beauty of this watch when I first opened the box. I've heard it said before but it really does look much better in person. I  got the blue face 56L stainless steel version, instead of the 56E, and was expecting a heavy watch but it is lighter and flatter than it appears in the video reviews and pictures. The lightness is mostly due to a thin but durable bracelet and the case housing using thin layers of steel. The bezel is thin as the mineral glass extends all the way to the face's edge. So less steel is used while the real estate is well used to display as much information as possible with no 'blank' zones found anywhere on the watch face.2. Discussing build quality:I will actually start by praising the steel bracelet. This is one of the best parts of this watch. Because of the ultra flexible linkage, this bracelet is one of the most comfortable steel bracelets I've worn. The links are tightly bound and hugs your wrist flush with no spacing or pinching. The links are also easy to modify (they use the easy in-and-out v pins and not the hard-to-remove sleeved pins). The bracelet and clasp are also very scratch resistant compared to my Nighthawk and Calibre 2100 bands. Also unlike those heavier bracelets (especially the chunky ones found on the Calibre 2100 series) the relatively light bracelet here can be comfortably worn all day long without feeling cumbersome on your wrist.I was considering getting the more expensive BY0010-52series titanium version but the steel version here is just as light and durable. Also I realized the USA titanium versions is a big waste of money since they are not Duratect treated and will scratch and wear worse than steel overtime.I was also concerned that the single locking clasp would not secure firmly compared the double, latched, clasp but it does the job well.I have NOT had any bad experiences with Citizen's Mineral Crystal easily picking up scratches. For some reason I used to work under the hood of my first car frequently whiles wearing my mineral crystal Nighthawk and over a 7 year period I only got one small hairline scratch on that crystal. That happened while yanking the Alternator off the engine block which also left a gash in my forearm. So for most of you that work and live in normal conditions the Mineral Crystal should be durable enough.There is an option to get the Titanium BY0010-52series if you really need the Sapphire Crystal but even Sapphire Crystal can scratch just as easily as Mineral Crystal under certain conditions.You can also contact one of the USA Citizen Service Centers to replace the Crystal. Under warranty they usually replace the crystal for free (or $60 to $80 out of warranty).Also for a fee ($60 to $100) they do upgrade the Mineral Crystal to Sapphire Crystal if you ask them to. This is only true at the time of me writing this review and it may change or cease all together in the future. Not all service centers offer this upgrade service so call around first.Overall I really love the appearance of this watch. It stands out in a good way when worn correctly. The polished steel bezel and bracelet trim look classy and expensive.If I had to buy this watch again I would DEFINITELY buy the steel over the non-Duratect titanium.3. Discussing the H610's face:The 2 o'clock sub-dial serves as a 24 hr time indicator. The 11 o'clock sub-dial shows the current solar charge and records the chronograph's minutes. The 6 o'clock sub-dial displays the Time Keeping seconds and also your Atomic Time location when the watch is in Receiving mode. The 4 0'clock date window shows your selected choice from a list of 26 cities with the current date.The tiny red markings NO RX H M L between the 11 and 1 o'clock markers give the atomic time information when the lower button is pressed.The red markings ON *ALM* OFF on either side of the 2 o'clock indicates if the alarm is on or off during the alarm set mode when the crown is pulled out two clicks.Between the 7 and 9 o'clock markers, the red markings AU *SMT* MA and AU *STD* MA here indicate the current daylight savings setting during the time set mode when the crown is pulled out on click.The white numerical bezel markings are all to do with the slide rule.4. Discussing the Calibre H610 functions:The BY000-56series ONLY looks intimidating but basically this watch does three things.1. Time keeping/Alarm - simple to set and easy to use. One click outwards of the main crown allows you to set the current city and when that is done everything else self adjusts to match your time zone. You can also use the two upper and lower buttons to manually set the time. Alarm is set with two crown clicks out and by turning the crown. With the crown out two clicks the buttons turn on, turn off and confirms the alarm chime. The calender, once set, is perpetual.2. Chronograph/Slide Rule - simple to grasp. In Time Mode the upper button starts and ends chronograph. Lower button resets it. The lone crown at the 8 o'clock works the slide rule inner bezel.3. Atomic Time Keeping - Automatic Receiving happens every night sometime between 1 AM and 5 AM. I've had several atomics come thru my collection over the years and this one is of the better ones when it comes to ease of use and having a strong appetite for receiving updates automatically (Citizen usually makes good atomics).Manual Receiving is as easy as HOLDING DOWN the lower button for 3 seconds to start Receiving. PRESSING the lower button checks when the last signal was received and also shows the current charge level. I have experiences with other Atomic watches (notably Casio Protreks) where the Manual Receiving is a tricky process. Here on the H610, as a credit to Citizen, it is simple and easy to use and the radio antenna is very strong and capable.Generally Atomic Time Receiving will be hit or miss for you depending more on where you live less so than the quality of the watch. Myself being in New York (right at the 1,900 mile radius from the Fort Collins, CO source) I never had good experiences with Atomic Time Receiving on watches since the signal starts dying at 600 miles out from the source and completely dies out from 2,000+ miles out. So whether you get a proper signal or not is a critique of where you live and not the watch itself.That is the entire description of this watch. It is simple, brilliant and everything works in harmony.5. What I would change:The first thing I would change on this time piece is to swap out the 24hr sub-dial for a day of the week indicator. For me personally this is more of a feature for feature swap since days of the week would be useful for me, a non-military/non-traveling American, than a 24 hr indicator. I guess the 24 hr dial will eventually come in handy for me when traveling in Europe this summer.The second issue is a slight design flaw with the hardware. The main crown wheel is by default loose and tend spins freely even when it is in the closed down. The connection between the crown, crown stem and case is very frail and the crown itself is quite flat and large and sits low on the case rim. Because of this the bottom edge of the crown wheel extends below the case-back where it sticks out. This design makes the already frail crown stick out leaving the poor thing exposed to getting caught on clothing or other wrist jewelry and breaking off if pulled hard. I would have made the crown centered on the case wall and smaller with a fatter stem connection. In fact, I've seen lots of used BY0000-56L and 56E watches on eBay being sold with missing crowns. Now I know why.6. Final word:My first Eco-Drive 10 years ago was a SS Nighthawk (BJ7000-52E) which is said to be one of the best, if not the best, watch that Citizen has ever made in terms of simplicity, practically, durability and looks. Since my Nighthawk I've had several Citizens most notably the Calibre 2100 (AV0031-59A) and the Calibre 9000 (BL9002-02A Minute Repeater).This BY0000-56E is right up there with those classics. It is a timeless piece that will wear well and look fresh for the next 20 to 100 years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CZ06BBJTL0CY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HT5QXS#wasThisHelpful","R3CZ06BBJTL0CY","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Installed this last week to enable my old Dell Dimension 5100c (XPS 200) desktop to work via HDMI on a recently bought Samsung HDTV T27A950 Hybrid Monitor. It has been working flawlessly!The HDMI input worked instantly the minute the card was installed but I had Overscan/Scaling issues where the computer display resolution did not full out the entire 27 inch monitor screen.With a quick google search I realized I had to visit the AMD (ATI) website, download and then install the lastest drivers on my PC to access the CCC (ATI's Catalyst Control Center) which automatically enables the Overscan feature that scales up the display resolution to fill out the entire monitor.The fan is quiet and the card does not get hot relative to heat output of the four 1GB memory sticks banked above it insid ethe slim tower of the Dell Dimension 5100C. These HD 5450 are very low power consumption video cards that remain quiet and cool under normal working or light gaming conditions.I don't play video games on my PC (a 7 year old Dell slim tower at that) because I have a PS3 but so far for intense web browsing, netflix and youtube on WinXP it is working great.Best of all it uses 1 GB Hypermemory which borrows ram from the motherboard when needed. So instead of 512MB it performs as if it is 1GB video card.Not sure why it wasn't packaged as a 1GB ram card since this is what most users will see when using this card.At under $50 price tag, with superb performance minus all the drama that more expensive gaming cards have this is a really great bargain.I 100% recommend this 599981-001 card for folks with older towers that want to attach up HDTVs or HDMI monitors!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NIQIN3JEFG7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZK4KWO#wasThisHelpful","R1NIQIN3JEFG7G","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"March 18th Update: Our Cable service had a brief power outtage over the weekend in our area and we ended up using some of the Apps on this BD-D5700's smart hub and they were excellent! We used the BBC and CNBC apps for news and they both streamed seemless and felt almost as if we were watching normal TV.There are still a few other apps that we didn't use yet but they seem great so far.We bought this for two reasons - As a Christmas Gift to add Netflix to my Mom's bedroom TV and because the unit was only $40 brand new at a local store closeout sale.After 2 months of usage here is my take;1. When you first take it out of the box  before you do anything you MUST go to the Settings Menu connect the unit to your wifi internet and immediately let it update for both the unit's firmware  and the smart hub apps.Even if you find your unit has the latest firmware make sure the smart hub apps also have the latest updates.Our unit was updated as of 10/12/12 but the smart hub and apps all took about 20 minutes to update themselves to the latest firmwares.Once everything is updated ONLY then can you really get the most out of this player and ONLY then can you have any sort of legitimate gripe about this BD-D5700 performance. Even so firmware updates can be an ongoing thing as issues are constantly being fixed and new stuff is added on.2. The WiFi hardware inside these players are not the best and many companies have been found out for using inferior antenna parts during production in  Chinese factories. I'm not sure if Samsung is one of these companies to use cheap parts but it is obvious that the antenna in this player is not the best and, like another reviewer said, there is no firmware update that will ever fix cheap hardware.That said, the player is on the 2nd floor of my Mom's house with her Netgear Wifi Router down in the basement and the player still gets a good to strong signal (most likely due to a really good router). But we did notice that if the microwave oven is on or if there are lots of devices (iPads, laptops, etc...) in the vicinty using the internet (especially for strenuous high data streaming stuff) then this player will not hold a good signal and will repeatedly freeze during long-playing Netflix movies. For me this is where the player lost one star. The antenna for what this player costs retail should be better.3. As a Blu-Ray/DVD player this unit is awesome. The remote control and touch screen interface is simply amazing.  The remote is easy to use and having a big bright red Netflix short cut key is very helpful considering my Mom, like most folks, is not tech savvy and don't like journeying thru menus and submenus to get to Netflix. With a dedicated Netflix button accessing Netflix is as easy as changing a TV station from one channel to the next (Netflix).We sat her 4003 LED Samsung TV on top of the player and it blends seamlessly together (see gallery pics). The 4003 led TV is super light so there is no issues of crushing the player. That said it is a great looking player that plays BD and DVD discs seamlessly. I don't believe it is an ALL Region player but since all regions player usually say they are all regions I did not buy this expecting it to play DVDs bought back to the USA from Uzbekistan or Brazil.4. If you are buying this to use solely for Smart TV apps and you expect it to perform like a Smart TV then stop. I found apps like YouTube to be archaic compared to my T27A950 smart tv and even my PS3's smart hub layout. Here on the BD-D5700 YouTube looks like it is on a Windows 95 interface with simple menus and when a video is played it is limited to a small low res 480p player window that does not fill up the entire TV screen(as far as I can figure).The positive of this simplified YouTube interface is finding and scrolling thru YouTube searches are simple and faster than the current complicated Smart TV layout. I haven't used Hulu or the other apps. keep in mind, however, the apps within the smart TV hub may have their own individual updates.5. Netflix is so-so ONLY because the player has crappy WiFi antenna hardware. I found big hi-def blockbuster movies, like Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, to have longer load times (2-3 minutes) and have the most vulnerability to momentarily freezing (for like 1-5 minutes) to reload or load during the streaming. For example while watching Ghost Protocol my fiance went downstairs to microwave some popcorn and the minute the microwave started the movie stopped and froze for 3 minutes then reloaded for another 5 minutes. This let me know that the wifi antenna is very sensitive to interference .On the other hand TV shows, sitcoms and short movies have no issues with load time and give no problems freezing. In fact load times of sitcoms and TV Shows and short movies were as fast as the best Smart TV or a PS3.Bottom line: I think if I had paid the original sticker of $179 for this player then I would have returned it for the weak WiFi being an issue that results in laggy Netflix playback. Also I love YouTube more than Netflix and this Win 95 YouTube interface is not cool for me at all. My Mom doesn't even know what YouTube is so for her I kept it to 4 stars but it would have been 3 stars if this player was bought for my TV.For what its worth if you get one of these for $40 or less then you can't really complain. The remote control alone is worth $40!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DLGJX0BDXJDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004N85YB0#wasThisHelpful","R3DLGJX0BDXJDV","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the price of $1299 retail that the T27A950 cost a few years ago you can spend the same money today and buy three things: a 32 inch Samsung 1080P HDTV, a decent 27 inch Samsung PC Monitor and a Samsung BluRay/HD-wifi Smart Hub Player. Funny enough these the the very three things that this Samsung monitor promises to replace. My review will be based on whether or not this monitor does this.I was lucky that I only paid $400 for my brand new T27A950 at a close-out sale last month. However, I kept wondering if I had $1299 to spend on an all in one monitor would I still buy this T27A950 over the three things it replaces.Here is my experience using on this pricey monitor:1. Before anything else read every page in the instruction booklet when you get this monitor. Never before have I seen such complicated settings for just the picture quality. Menus are buried deep within other menus. Menu Setting options disappear or reappear depending on what Source you are in.  It gets extremely confusing and reading the set up instructions was a MUST for me. I don't think I ever had to do that for a TV or PC monitor before. It was a good thing though because it gave me a full grasp of what this T27A950 can and can't do. Having a remote control with this monitor is a MUST and you will find that even if using it as a PC monitor you may still want to use the remote control for basic adjustments. Another note about the manual is that Samsung put it on a CD disc instead of a paper manual. So if you throw out the CD thinking the quick start pamplet is a manual then you will have screwed yourself.2. There is absolutely NO WiFi or Internet out of the box! This isn't clear beforehand on the box or the website that unless you place the TV next to your LAN modem and connect with an Ethernet cable then the ONLY way to get the Smart Hub access the internet is thru a rather expensive Samsung WIS09ABGN USB Wifi Dongle! It ONLY works with Samsung's proprietary WiFi dongle which cost anywhere between $60used and $140new. This is not cool considering your basic WiFi dongle starts at 99 cents on eBay and the European versions all come with the Samsung WiFi dongle for free in the box.3. The 2D and 3D Picture quality in the HDMI-TV/DVD source are ABOVE AND BEYOND EXCELLENT! Even the old school co-axle TV tuner input here will beat out most LCD TVs running HDMI sources. The 3D up-convert works amazingly well. I wasn't expecting outstanding 3D results from this TV since all the online reviews did not favor the 3D picture effect. 3D just looks beautiful! You can watch anything from the 5 o'clock news to HBO movies in 3D!  Even better is that this is not the dark shaky 3D you get in movie theaters but a clear and bright 3D effect.What is important to understand is the 3D up-convert ONLY works thru HDMI source mode AND ONLY works for HD sources. So if you have basic non-HD cable or a non-HD DVD player then you will not get the best, if you do manage to get any, of the 3D effects.In Europe and the UK some TV channels offer 3D specific programming that will work on 3D TVs and from what I hear that is where a monitor like this would come in handy.Second thing to note is the 3D glasses use batteries that die quickly after a 2 or 3 movies viewings. However, I ordered a replacement of 20 batteries (two packs of 10 cells) off the internet for less than $5 shipped. So that is not an issue for me like most reviewers who griped about it. Also, once the novelty wears off, I don't expect to use the 3D glasses that much but I still love that it actually works.Another thing about the HD picture quality is that it appears to have a very high Frame Rate so HD movies and TV shows coming thru the HD cable box have that 'Soap Opera' effect where every pixel is super clear and clean and there is little to no motion blur. I'm not sure if this a going to be a good thing or bad thing for me because it deletes all the magic out of the movie watching experience. For instance I just watched the French Connection (1971) and The Adjustment Bureau (2012) and both movies look like they were shot with the same home hi-def video camera. Costumes look like costumes, Make Up look like Make Up, Characters look like Actors because everything is shown super smooth and clear relative to what they would look like on a normal TV. This effect only occurs for movies and Prime Time TV shows on an HD source but everything else (regular non-HD tv, game shows, talk shows, news, live sports, older syndicated shows, music videos, reality tv, etc...) look normal.4. PIP/PBP is both good and bad. It is not clear on Samsung's website but you can ONLY PIP or PBP between HDMI-TV/HDMI-PC sources and the Co-axle TV-input. Where the HDMI sources are main and the PIP is the co-axle source. Not sure why Samsung didn't extent the PIP at least to Component-AV for older DVD players and game consoles.  My old 2003 Samsung SyncMaster 192MP offers the PIP over a range of sources that included Component-AV as well as Co-Axle-input. In 2013 the only things that have co-axles are 'some' cable TV boxes or analog/digital TV boxes. I figured Samsung knows 99% of most media is viewed over the PC or Smart Hub and all cable tv boxes have co-axles output so PIP on HDMI/CoAxle would be fine for everyone. The bad for me was no dedicated PIP button on the remote.5. The sound quality is amazingly good.  I don't understand how many people complain about the sound but once you get it set for what you want it to do then it is rich and loud. It is important to realize that the speakers are in the base and if you have anything blocking the base or there is clutter around the base, like a keyboard or books or dvd player, then it will block the sound.6. The remote control is really good. It has automatic back lighting, braille, short cut keys for the smart hub, and easy to hold. My one gripe is there is no direct PIP control button on the remote. You have to go thru at least three menu pages to get to PIP options. My older SyncMaster 192mp had a PIP dedicated button and optimization section on it's remote. Which brings me to note that my 10 year old SyncMaster 192MP remote control works button for button with this newer TA27950 monitor. Strange but cool.7. Lack of extra HDMI inputs and/or a specific DVI input makes the T27A950 utterly USELESS as an All-In-One  monitor!  Having only 2 HDMI ports is not cool when you have a video game console, a PC, a HD-Cable box, and a HD-BluRay player that all need to get hooked up to the T27A950.  I have a feeling those HDMI multi splitter hubs may not work here since the T27A950 is very specific on how it allows it's HDMI ports to be used. For instance there is a mandatory 'Naming' option where you have to tell the T27A950 what is connected to that input. So for HDMI-1 you can name it TV or DVD/BluRay, etc... but not both at once. HDMI-2 can also be renamed for PC, DVD or Game Console or other but not more than one at a time.The best way around this is ...well there is NO BEST way around it outside of getting a second unit that will serve solely as your HDTV or your PC which is what I ended up doing. I'm using my old SyncMaster 192MP for PC and component DVD purposes and I am using the T27A950 two HDMI inputs for HDTV-Cable and a PlayStation 3(which provides my BluRay, Gaming, and a second Smart Hub).Samsung does offer the cheaper S27A950 alongside this T27A950. The S27A950 is the same monitor as the T27A950 with the exception that the S27A950 has PC specific DVI inputs and deletes the TV tuner/co-axle input with PIP/PBP function. These trade offs you get between these two brother monitors are revealing of the short comings each monitor has in terms of trying to be an all in one. These are not 100% All-In-One monitors.So at the end of the day 5the T27A950 does NOT come close to being an able body ALL-IN-ONE HDTV Monitor!FINAL VERDICT: This T27A950 will NOT replace your current PC Monitor and HDTV at the same time! Especially if you have a game console and a couple of Blu-Ray DVD discs laying around.For $1299 (or even the current $980+ refurbished) price that this T27A950 cost I would have recommend buying a 32 inch 1080P HDTV ($499), a separate 27 inch PC monitor ($299 to $499) and use the change to buy a Blu-Ray HD Smart Hub Player ($89).However if you can get this T27A950 for under $600 and plan on ONLY using it an HDTV with Video Game console connection then you would be happy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25Z5DEVVCZOU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Z75LSA#wasThisHelpful","R25Z5DEVVCZOU5","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"-No Spoilers!This is literally the best 178 minutes of airtime that I have seen on my Television in a longtime.Red X is very very very good. End of review.Seriously I really enjoyed this even though I went into it not knowing what to expect. Back To Earth was very different in tone than past Red Dwarf stuff. Where as Season 8 of Red Dwarf was bigger and wilder than the previous Red Dwarf stuff.Red X goes back even before Season 8 and trims down the fat of that Season in favor of the tightly paced storyline that engulfed us during the mid 1990s (Seasons 4 thru 7).In X we get the same great adventures and plenty of proper laughs but now we get it from mentally matured versions of the same characters we have loved over the 25 year period.Speaking of 'matured' I have to add that the costumes, make up and set lighting in this series makes the crew look younger and fresher than they looked in Back To Earth and maybe even season 8.The production quality alone is 5 stars in itself! When you see the making off in the extra DVD chapters then you will realize how gray and old everyone has gotten. Yet on screen Cat looks like he was cut and pasted from Season 1 cat and Rimmer and Dave look as young as ever.I will add that having the laugh track/live audience in X was a blessing! I understand in Back To Earth it was dropped for budgetary reasons but it never bothered me in Back To Earth because that show was very serious in tone and theme. Honestly adding a laugh track on Back To Earth would have been like adding a laugh track at a funeral progression.Here the laugh track is fresh, appropriate and makes the viewer feel like they are inside the ship with the crew. Most new viewers to Dwarf will not understand nor appreciate the laugh track since laugh tracks have been long abandon in many modern day sitcoms since the late 1990s (you have the advent of annoying Reality TV shows and faux Reality Sitcom Shows, like Modern Family, to thank for that).As an long time fan of the show I welcome the laugh track!I don't want to give any spoilers but I will add that my one minor gripe with X is I sort of wanted at least to see Lister's love interest appear during Red X. Back To Earth ended with her being important to the existance of Lister and I wanted that story to be revisited.Still it was a very good season and perhaps one of the best. Looking forward to XI!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDRMM8UGALRL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009Z5BPYG#wasThisHelpful","RDRMM8UGALRL7","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this thinking it was a fleece jacket (similar to the Patagonia R2 or R3 jacket). It is more of a fleece baselayer shirt with a central zipper. It is a thin single fleece layer with some stretchy bits under the armpits and down the torso flank. I can't say much about it other than it is easy to wear, very comfortable and the sleeves are well articulated. Also the pockets are really big and are also ventilation pockets.This is more of a Summer fleece layer (to put over a t-shirt at base camp after a long day hike as the night chill sets in) than something that could be worn as an outer layer during Fall or Winter outings. It can also work great as an outer layer or mid layer (under a wind/rain shell) during cold weather running or strenuous cold weather snow shoeing and backpacking.AN IMPORTANT NOTE about the sizing: A Millet Medium is a France Medium which is a USA Small. It says this on the paper tags and the collar tags. So if ordering online make sure to ask the Seller which size they are sending you. If there is any doubt then size up.My one gripe is the central metal zipper pull tore right off the slider head on the first day I wore it. Not sure if I got a fluke item but I did notice after replacing it that the new jacket had the same 'soft' zipper and it would only be a matter of time before it either came loose or broke off. I just yanked it off and inserted my own key chain loop as a zipper pull.Other than that as long as you are not expecting a heavy fleece jacket you will  be happy with this item considering the low price and high quality of the tailoring and design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1725Y3WPHCYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00734183E#wasThisHelpful","R1725Y3WPHCYD","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I normally do not write reviews for movies where the obvious expectations are low budget silliness.However, I enjoyed this movie's new spin on alien invasion. Here the concept is brilliant: aliens, whom are vaguely hinted to have seeded the earth with humans, have returned to harvest their food (us). When you think of it this scenario makes the most sense of all the various alien invasion found in movies today.The most popular of this are invasions were huge barbaric insects capable of interstellar travel come to enslave us or take resources. Those plots make as much sense as Bill Gates flying  his private jet to a Trailer Park Community in West Virginia and trying to enslave the local population into making computers and software. Said and done, there is only one burgeoning resource in this Solar System worth the hassle and expense of Interstellar Travel: HumanMeat.Any alien race running low on food will find plenty of people here to munch on and, according to this movie, they will also find it really easy to genetically modify humans to breed more food in mass.In Alien Armageddon the aliens are gooey phallic worms come here to possess our bodies and to eat us. This is literally the entire plot of this simple and silly story but nevertheless there is an entertaining and unique concept behind it.Praise aside, the story is poorly told and the film editing and effects were done on a Windows 95 computer. No joking there.There is also no main character for us to follow or relate to. The movie makes everyone disposable especially women. Lots of tough female characters (played by double D toting Playboy mansion retirees) appear for their minute of screen time and then die off quickly. It happens so often that I think the movie is making a point of sarcasm against heroines.There is also no real climax to speak of other than the moment the two remaining female lead opposing characters decide to work together, make up to become BFFs and then these two women, against the run of script, start kissing and make out. huh?Many lazy watchers won't realize it but 90% of this movie was clearly filmed in someone's basement apartment and complex stairwell. No joke. Then there is a bunch or driving around scenes thru retired old westerns movie sets that is being passed off for the USA after the Armageddon. The movie earned a star for the original spin on invasions but also earns a secondstar for one of the squirmiest scenes I've seen in a longtime. Human womenblinded and bred like factory cattle, or rather Hens, to birth out pieces ofchunky meat that is fed unknowingly to other enslaved humans. That was one of the best scenes in this movie and a very bold interpretation of the themes used in the Soylent Green and Cloud Atlas movies. Also that scene says a lot about our own livestock industry practices and ignorance regarding genetically modified farm animals specially bred for the sole purpose of feeding humans.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYF9WYKKUQ9ZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005P7XE24#wasThisHelpful","RYF9WYKKUQ9ZE","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FEB 04, 2013 UPDATE:Over the weekend I had to get my original watch exchanged due to what I thought to be a factory defect (a black spot on the lcd).To my surprise the replacement watch I got is MUCH BETTER! The LCD Crystal is clearer and sharper (I don't think it is the same mineral crystal like before. Could it be Hardlex or Sapphire?) and the Backlight is now a bright Blue-green and not the dim Green like the original PAW1100T that I originally reviewed. I assume this is a changed or improved 2013 edition to the PAW1100T.So I'm wondering if Casio updated the PAW1100T recently? I added a lot of hi-res pictures to the product gallery and you can clearly see that it is a different watch than the one I originally reviewed!That said, I would have changed my 4.5 stars to 5 stars but I still have my issues with the atomic update feature and half the screen being empty space in the time keeping display mode. However most customers new to Casio Pathfinder or A B C watches will easily find te PAW1100T to be a 5 star watch_______________________________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW:If this PAW1100 will be your first Casio Protek Pathfinder then you will be very pleased with it since in my opinion it is the best looking, most useful and easiest to wear of all the current PAW/PRG Casio Protrek Pathfinders.However this review will compare the PAW1100T against other Casio Protrek Pathfinders (mostly the PRG40T which this watch descended from) and we will see how it stacks upI previously owned the PRG-40T since December 2002 that I sold last month Dec(2012) after 10 solid years of great service. I only got rid of it because I was tired of replacing the four very expensive pacemaker/hearing aid batteries ($40 with new seal) that my PRG40T was devouring every 2 to 3 years.Coming from the PRG-40T, the PAW1100T seemed the best replacement in terms of appearance, functions and maintenance (free solar power and atomic updates).Below is my take on the PAW1100T-7V:1-Great Size, Fit and Superb Build Quality- The PAW1100T 'feels' smaller on my wrist than my old PRG40T even though on paper it is a bigger watch. The PAW1100 is sleeker due to the flat thin aerodynamic design and most of my jacket and shirt cuffs can fit over the face unlike the PRG40T. However, with this being solar powered watch, Casio recommends the watch is worn outside the cuff and NOT under it. I've found this watch to lose power very quickly if it does not get a daily dose of Vitamin D compared to my Citizen Eco Drive watches.The buttons are all firm and solid on the PAW110T with no looseness or play in them. You push them in firmly and they do what they are assigned to do. By comparison my PRG40T and lesser watches the buttons around the bezel would have a little play in them. On the PAW1100T this is not an issue. Also the resin plastic on the body and crystal glass are very durable.The only thing that seems to be susceptible to any type of scuffing is the shiny bezel ring-which is not a rotating ring but a fixed  frame around the glass display. However, this seems to be a replaceable thing on this watch.  Other than that everything is solid on this watch. I'm sure you can drop it off the top of a 5 story building onto concrete pavement and it will still work fine.Casio used the titanium very well and the band runs all the way up to the bezel where it offers more protection around the face than the PRG40T.The downside of this is the lugs are very stiff compared to the jointed and loose lugs of the PRG40T. For the first couple of days the knuckle on my wrist was sore from the stiff lug rubbing against it. It does `seem' loosen up overtime (or rather my wrist got use to it). If your wrists are smaller than 6.5 inch circumference then expect the lugs and watch body to over hang around your wrist. It is NOT a heavy watch and that makes all the difference. The paradox in this is the PAW1100T will be both the biggest/bulkiest watch and also the lightest watch in your collection!2- No Demo Function on the PAW1100- One of my favorite features of the PRG40T was the Demo 'screen saver' Function that scrolls thru all the A, B and C displays while showing accurate readings of temperature and some static A and B readings in the screensaver. It also looked really cool with overlay of the compass sweep.3- Issues with the Back-light on the PAW1100- First issue on this watch is when you attempt to look at the watch in the dark while taking one of the A B or C readings the effect of the back light turning ON stops the A B or C reading that you are taking. It not only stops your reading but you may have to start the reading all over again and wait until it is done reading before turning on the back light to see the screen in the dark. The back-light also stops the atomic time update as well. My PRG40T watch did not have this shortcoming and all the A B and C functions worked with the back light on.Second issue with the PAW1100 back-light is I didn't realize how nicer and brighter the ice blue back-light of the PRG40T was until I got this PAW1100 (see pictures I put up in the gallery). The green back-light of the PAW1100 is dimmer and the effect looks like a $10 drugstore Timex. I don't too much care for it but most users new to the PAW1100 won't even notice or care. Former PRG40 owners brace yourselves because the green ain't pretty.4- Lots of blank real estate on the display when watch is in basic Time Display Mode- My PRG40T used every square micrometer of its display to show all types of information in the Time Display Mode. In contrast, the PAW1100 has a lot of empty space on the display particularly the left side. I assume this space reserved for the 24 hour format and extra on screen characters for the A B and C modes. In Time Display Mode, which is what will be on the display 99% of the time for most of us, it just looks like empty space that could be better used to show BOTH the day of the week and the calendar date - month/day (even the year would fit). Currently the PAW1100 can ONLY show either the day of the week OR the calender date but not both.5-The Atomic Update Feature on this watch is more hassle than gimmick and more gimmick than useful- First surprise is the 3043 module booklet says for North America the signal updates are ONLY guaranteed within 600 miles of the signal source at Fort Collins, Colorado. Once outside the 600 mile radius from the source the watch is NOT guaranteed to receive a signal and 'may' only receive updates after midnight and before 5.00 am. Once you go beyond 2,000 miles from the signal source then the watch will NOT receive updates. This 600/2000 mile limit is also true for signal sources in Asia and Europe.The watch will ONLY update outside the house or on a large open window sill. It will NOT update inside a car, inside a high rise office/apartment building, at the base of a mountain range, near power lines, if you have a cell phone nearby, if there is a turned on TV/Microwave oven/Computer in the same room or nearby anything metal. It will also not update in bad weather. That right there is about 90% of the daily environment for 99% of the population in the USA. I've had other radio watches that have way better receiving prowess. So if you are craving the PAW1100 thinking atomic updates are as simple as pushing a button anytime anywhere and it simply updates itself in seconds then you need to look elsewhere.Second issue is the Atomic Auto Update turns itself OFF (without letting you know) when the time or time zone are manually set something we ALL do when we take it out of the box for the first time. This gets confusing because the watch will still show Auto Update is ON but it will NOT update and the receiving indicator bars will remain blank (meaning the radio is not receiving a signal). This is not explained well in the booklet but what is clear is the ONLY way to get the Auto Update to turn back ON and the receiving bars to reappear is to do a Manual Update. In my experience Manual Updates are tedious requiring many trials and errors before working. You MUST take the watch off and put it down on a window sill or put it down on the ground outside away from metal. Once your Manual Update is successful the bars come back and Auto Update turns ON. This mandatory process defeats the purpose of having an user adjust option for turning Auto Update OFF or ON.A final note about Auto Updates, especially the first time you take it out the box, you will noticed the watch may have 10% to 50% power left or L to M on the power scale. If you fail to charge the watch fully during the first day of wearing it and the Auto Update attempts to update that night then there is a good chance it will drain the battery. When an Auto Update fails it reattempts the updates thru out the night. If you are like most people and forget to put it on the window sill then you will wake up to find a blank screen. That said, I set Auto Update to OFF and do a Manual Update once a month if need be.The PAW1100T is a digital watch after all and daily Atomic Time Updates are way more useful for day/date analogue watches that usually lose or gain a month day (31st or 30th) at the end of each month. After the novelty wears off it is more of a hassle than something I need on this watch. There is the cheaper PRG80T which is the same watch as the PAW1100T sans the atomic radio feature.6-The Solar Power Feature is Average- The first time taken out the box the power will be L to M. Even if the meter says H it will certainly be a low H. What I find is when not fully charged this watch will go from H to M quickly and M to L to 0% power in one night especially if an alarm is set and/or atomic update is turned ON but not receiving so it spends the night doing multiple reattempts. I think Casio says it takes a day of full exposure to sunlight for this watch to get a full H but in my experience it was more like a week of full days with this watch exposed to daylight to get a solid H.7-Lifetime Longevity Expected - Without batteries to replace and daily automatic time updates (thru 1/1/2099) this watch is virtually a perpetual beast that will outlive your great great great Grand-kids.8-A(altimeter) ,  B(barometer) and C(compass) Functions are actually Very Good!- It has been said that the Casio Pathfinders are not as accurate on the A and B as other watch brands but out of all the Pathfinders the PAW1100T/PRG80T is said to be the most accurate in the family. So far I've found the Compass, Barometer and Temperature to be all SPOT ON accurate.  The Compass does take about 3 to 5 seconds to show a reading (see my review videos). On my PRG40T watch, and from what I seen on many other Pathfinders, the compass starts displaying readings within 1-2 seconds.Another gripe on the PAW1100 is the A B C functions all turn off after a minute and return to the Time Display Mode. My PRG40T did not do this and kept the A B C readings on screen until you decided to return to the Time Display Mode. This isn't bothering me as yet but I can see how it would be annoying during a long backpacking trip where keeping tabs on A and C  readings are important. That said, I don't usually use Altimeter or Barometer functions much. If I need to rely on those functions in a life or death situation then I bring a proper Garmin Trail GPS unit.VERDICT: Overall this is STILL a great watch! But in retrospect most of us buying the PAW1100 could totally do without the Atomic Update Feature especially if you live outside the 600 mile radius of Fort Collins Colorado! The PRG80T which does not have the Atomic Update Feature is the identical lower priced version of the PAW1100T. So those of us outside the 600 mile radius of a signal source may find the PRG80T to be a much better value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJEQBIDMJHTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00134QM9K#wasThisHelpful","RRJEQBIDMJHTC","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After falling in love with the SyFy show I had to get this book which I thought would be a continuation of the series. However, I was in for a few surprises. Here is my take:1. This book is a two layer alternating prequel to the SyFy series. The first story, told in the even numbered chapters, occurs in the past when Riese is 16 years old. The second story, told in some of the odd numbered chapters, takes place in the present time, 10 years later, leading up to where the SyFy series start when we meet Riese on the run. This works well in giving us a broad view of the back stories involved in the development of the characters. Riese at 16 years old living in the Palace is a totally different Riese than the 26 year old we meet during the SyFy show running thru the woods. Those buying this book for a continuation to the SyFy series will not get that here. However, as a prequel, the story is still really good and pulls us deeper into the world of Riese. If you like the SyFy series then you will enjoy the story in this book.2. This book is written for Young Adults (12 years+). I was not expecting this. As a result the writing style and dialogue bits are tremendously simplified to cater to preteens. I'm upset that they decided to do this since the subject matters of genocide, war, famine, racism, religious extremists, beheading of children, torture, etc... are a big part of the story. The simplified preteen writing style does not match at all and, by keeping the storytelling simple, many character developments are not properly conveyed in the writing. Antagonists, much like on the SyFy show, remain one dimensional as a result. I especially wanted more development of the Herrick and Amara characters since their back stories and motivation are the driving force in the SyFy series.3. Dreadful dialogue! This follows from the writer dumbing it down. I am not sure who he had in mind for his audience but most 12 year old kids in today's world of iPhones and school shootings can comprehend adult situations without the need to over simplify every verse to them. The dialogue, or rather the scenes with extensive and expository dialogue, are generic and cardboard-ish. In one scene Riese is talking to her mother and Amara and it literally reads like 3 of the same personalities. There is no dialogue distinction between the 16 year old Riese, her 25 year old cousin and her 40 year old Mom. They all sound like bickering teenagers. That said, dialogue thru out this book was wordy and could have been pared down. The best literature says the most with less. For example one line in on eof the early chapters sums up (26 year old) Riese's entire situation after someone ask her for her name and she thinks to herself ""That was a secret too dangerous to share with anyone"". Brilliant!4. My issue with Greg Cox - I didn't know who he was until I got near the end of the book and decided to Google him. His bibliography was extensive showing he has written hundreds of Science Fiction-based stories and books since the 1980s. I've been an avid reader of this genre since the 1980s so I was curious to see what books he wrote. It turns out a good deal of  Mr. Cox's employment comes from writing, or rather transcribing, popular Hollywood disposable movies into unpopular disposable paperbacks that you would find at an Airport Newsstand before a long flight. His latest works include the Christopher Nolan movies Dark Knight and Man Of Steel. His most famous works involve Star Trek books and the Underworld movie books. This is what he does and presumably what he is good at. That said, as you read this book you will get the sense that Mr. Cox was just doing a job. They showed him the SyFy episodes and asked him to write a prequel for it. Then they cut him a check and shook his hand when he was done. This fact comes out in the writing. It does not read like a book written by the story creator or a fan that loves Riese. It reads like a brochure quickly written to explain the story of Riese. There is no prose or poetry or art inbedded in the writing. That is not to call Mr. Cox a bad writer since he was obviously hurrying to finish this job to get his hands on writing the Dark Knight and Man Of Steel books where the bigger paychecks were. Sigh.5. I wanted more aggression from Riese. Someone that has been thru that much in a world they once loved, a world now virtually on fire and broken, should be flat out angry and blood thirsty. At the end of Star Wars Luke confronts Darth Vader. We get to see how angry Luke has become as he wails his light saber down on Vader. Luke's development is much like Riese. Luke grew up in a world that was taken from him by the Empire (which is The Sect in Riese). At the end Luke has lost everything he loved and is left to confront the very figure that epitomizes his lost. What does he do? He tears away at Vader (Herrick in Riese) with blind passion and anger. I wanted the same from Riese towards the end of this book. What we get is generic watered down action sequence that show little character & skill development in someone that would have been fighting for her life on a daily basis in the cold fruitless wilderness of Elysia for 10 years. In fact AFTER reading this book I am disappointed that Riese was not more aggressive on the SyFy show. I'm not saying I wanted Xena but during most of the SyFy series Riese looks fragile and lost. With what we now learn in her back story it makes no sense why she would be fragile or confused at the time the SyFy show begins.6. I expected a picture insert of the map of the Kingdom somewhere in the book. As you read the book you will realize, much like the show, that geography is VERY important to the story and at times I found myself looking back at the screen caps of the map on the show just to get my bearings of where everything and everyone was in the book. This is not cool considering this book costs $17.7. Negatives aside, I really liked the story especially of young Riese dealing with day to day life preceding a war. By the end of the book there are no surprises because you already expected it all as it happened but the journey was nice. I also like the handling of the war between the kingdoms of Nix and Elysia and how the Sect manipulates everyone. The story around the war was very intriguing and a joy to digest. Also the injection of Steampunk into a dying Medieval culture was awesome. After the war ends we see a Riese bolder and mature which is to be expected. The book also streamlines into where the show begins perfectly and it isn't obvious until the final page of the book. For me this was good.8. Future developments - I'm not sure where they can take this story now. After considerable thought I don't think this would work as a TV show. The best is to make it into a Trilogy of movies. The first movie being the story in this book (Kingdom Falling). The second movie (call it Kingdom On Fire) would be the movie version of the webisodes story and the third installment (call it Kingdom from Ashes) being the continuation of where the webisodes left off as Riese is about to face off with Herrick and eventually Amara to reclaim her throne. The inevitable Riese vs Herrick battle is long over due.Have Peter Jackson (or Josh Whedon) direct it (no 3D gimmick/48fps crap) and hire a proper writer (or Josh Whedon) for the script. Any amount of money invested will be generously repaid in double or triple as target audiences that no longer have the Harry Potter, Twilight, or Lord Of The Rings series to throw money at will now flock to see the Riese Movies.Also Steampunk in storytelling and movies is yet to be done (and done well). The general interest in Steampunk culture has tripled in the last couple of years so this should be a no brainer for any Hollywood producer to invest in.To conclude my review of this book I would recommend you see the SyFy webisodes first to get a sense of your bearings then read the book or you will not like or understand the story very much.Overall the story was definitely worth the read (most fans will love it) although I found the technical writing and writing style choice could've been better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AV9XBGCGE2ZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442429690#wasThisHelpful","R2AV9XBGCGE2ZV","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this vest. It is very lightweight windproof and sturdy at the same time. It completely replaced an older heavier Arcteryx Gamma SV Vest I've been wearing since 2006. At $60 (on sale from $150) it was cheaper and is lighter at 7 ounces than the over priced Arcteryx vest.My favorite feature is the chest pocket. A lot of vest (fleece and softshell) delete the chest pocket for weight saving purposes. However I find it useful since most backpackers use vest as an outer layer and having an extra zippered pocket above the hipbelt but under the sternum strap is very useful.PROS: Light, Durable and windproof. Tailored to fit over a lot of layers but at the same time there is no overuse of fabric nor is the cut too generous. Price was really good. You can also find a lot of Berghaus products on sale at great discounts overseas at many webstores that ship worldwide. i got the bright green color and was worried about it picking up dirt and neck grease easily but Berghaus uses a coating on their windstopper that make the fabric smooth and dirt repellant. I have been wearing this vest for about 6 months before the pictures were taken and I only washed it once or twice in that time. So I expect it to last a long time as it is definitely a quality pieceCONS: The logo zipper pulls that come on this vest are excessive, bulky and get in the way. I cut off ALL the zipper pulls and I think I reduced about 25% of the total weight by doing so. No Belay (2-way) main zipper so you have to wear harnesses and hipbelts over the vest. Hand pockets are too low down and get covered over by a hipbelt or climbing harness. Also they are NOT hand warming pockets but ventilation pockets. Over all I did not find this vest to be very breathable and any strenuous hiking is weather that is sunny and above 70 degrees and you will be sweating. This is mainly a result of the use of Gore windstopper and not a flaw in the design of the vest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I8TQ5TDQNJ5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AF7KJYK#wasThisHelpful","R2I8TQ5TDQNJ5C","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*(Those who did not see this yet is DO NOT read other reviews online, or even google the movie title. Every review and search I came across was filled with spoilers and tend to explain the entire story thru to the end in order to prove why Winter Sonata is the best love story since Shakespeare penned ""Romeo & Juliet"". Winter Sonata is long, beautiful and intense, yet so simple enough that it can be explained and spoiled in a few sentences. I have included no spoilers in my review and kept to the technical reasons of why everyone should see this amazing work of art)This DVD was introduced to me by a friend who suggested that it was the best thing she'd ever seen. It sat around my living room for a few weeks and then I read the back of the DVD box, where I got the first spoiler-but still started watching it anyway. After 30 minutes I was hooked. I had never seen anything like this before and at one point wasn't sure if it was a movie, a sitcom or a soap-opera. I even googled the actors just to be sure it wasn't some sort of Korean reality TV gimmick. That is how great the acting is! Between the two main characters, this is hands down the best acting I've ever seen anywhere!As for the technical details;STORY: Very original and absolutely not a single minute in 20+ hours of drama is wasted or dead. Every scene from minute 1 to the last minute (I really mean the last minute) tells the story with a high level of intensity. Even though the story is simple and easy to follow, there are twists and surprises that come when least expected or are so well engineered into the plot that you will want to watch certain parts a few times over ""just because"" you can't believe they did that!Over all: A+ story!CHARACTERS: We follow the 5 or 6 main characters with their families over a period of 13 years, we watch them interact and grow. What I liked here is that the characters are not easy to love, hate or understand-even after you know them. Everyone in Winter Sonata retains a high level of complexity, even the peripheral characters like parents and co-workers carry their own weight to the screen. This was new for me and I liked it because every scene where characters met and dialogue occured you had no idea what would be said or done.DRAMA: By far this was the MOST remarkable show I've ever experienced. At one point towards the end, it just becomes unbearingly hard to watch. In fact, Winter Sonata was both the hardest and most beautiful story I've ever seen. It provides great scenery, amazing romance, and lovable characters, but at a price. And you pay it in full with every range of emotion possible. Never have I been so angry, happy, depressed and giddy from one show before and I loved every moment of it. WARNING: The intensity here is at a whole new level not seen in film before. Some parts of Sonata will make any hardcore serial killer/convict cry their eyes out whiles other parts will make a soft hearted person like Mother Theresa or Ghandi curse at her TV and want to kick in the screen!CINEMATOGRAPHY: It was the first thing that caught my attention. I'm still not sure how it was shot, or what kind of camera was used. But it has this reality TV look and feel to it, overlapped with dreamy, ethereal scenes that rivals any Wong Kar Wai movie. This was my personal favorite thing about this movie, the cinematography was very good. Frightenly Good!OTHER THINGS: Every single element came together perfectly. Even when you think the story is about to run out of ideas or fall apart, it picks up new speeds and unforseen directions. For something so long, you would expect sluggish editing, slight imperfections or inconsistencies with acting and direction, but when it comes to Winter Sonata, Production, Direction and Execution are all seamlessly tight to perfection from beginging to end.WHAT I WOULD CHANGE:1. The Theme Music! It's a nice song that comes in at just the right times, but after the first 3 DVDs of it looping over and over again it gets tiring-and by the last hours of the show the song by then associated with so many different emotions and scenes that it becomes schizophrenic and you don't know if something tragic or happy is coming next. I did realize some scenes in restaurants or bars they would play other kinds of music (rock, soul and pop)and it is then you realize that you've been listening to the sonata looping for the entire show. Not that this is bad or ruins anything, but I would add about 4 more variations to the background theme music.2. The spoiler description on the DVD box! Why? O' Why must the entire story be explained for us on the back of the DVD box and inserts? Also the DVD Play & Scene Menus have these selections boxes that automatically previews upcoming scenes for you which also have spoilers! Why?! Normally these things would totally ruin a movie for me but this is a testament to how great Winter Sonata is. I was still impressed thru every moment until the end, even though I sort of knew what was coming. Also everytime I googled Winter Sonata, every blog there is for it and reviews is brimming with spoilers! If you are going to watch this make sure you stay away from ALL spoilers. It's my only regret.3. The Pacing During The Last Two Hours: You won't understand why the pace seem to slow down until the very last minute of the show. And its frustrating, because the anticipation builds up slowly and creeps up on you. I may be wrong, but the final scenes seem to hang on forever and didn't get to the ""real"" ending until the final minute. I'm literal when I say the ""final minute"". I understand now why the pace slows down at the end, to build up the finale, but I didn't think it was necessary because the story is so strong and powerful on its own that the climax doesn't need to be meticulously built up. Then again, after sitting in front of Winter Sonata for 20+ hours and going thru every emotion I could possibly go thru, I was so eager to see how it turned out that every second seem to drag getting there.I completely recommend seeing this show! It is in my all time top 3 of personal favorite movies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18VN13UD91Q41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ML04WE#wasThisHelpful","R18VN13UD91Q41","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the worse product I bought in 2012. I paid $7.99 for these at a Target Black Friday sale and at that price these are not even worth it. With the short winters days I expected these LED Walking Poles to be perfect for our winter backpacking trip this year. I used them during a 30+ mile hike of a section of the Appalachian Trail in December and literally wanted to leave them at the trail head with a note saying ""Merry Christmas Free Hiking Poles"" but these things are no gift to someone looking for serious hiking poles.I'm not sure if NB intended for these to be used on treadmills at the gym but they are useless for trail hiking.1. They are heavy and the hand grips are thick and not well shaped to be gripped for long periods. Remember hiking is an all day activity where you need to hold the poles anywhere from 6 to 12 hours of straight walking thru uneven terrain.2. They have no spring shocks in them (like hiking poles are supposed to have) and the result of this is they sound like hollow metal cylinders every time they contact the ground. They are loud on the trail and my wrists felt every shock and vibration during the excruciating 30 mile hike.3. The wrist lashes are overly complicated and kept getting loose and needed two hands to tighten.4. The LED is a silly gimmick that only works well to make the poles super heavy AND make the grips sloppy and over sized. Even WORSE is that the on/off button is on top of the grip so expect to press them on and off a million times during the day. On the third day of backpacking one LED was dim and the other was dead. Also each LED uses four LR44 batteries that can be rather expensive to replace. (See my pictures in the customer gallery).For the first time in writing a review I have absolutely nothing positive to say about these poles. Be sure to check out my posted customer pictures in the gallery which back up ALL my negatives.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PSF77G8S8RMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y7QS4S#wasThisHelpful","R1PSF77G8S8RMC","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"11/8/2014 EDIT:After two solid years with these boots I've returned with an update. These boots have served me well in ALL conditions and  have worn-in perfectly.The biggest gripe I've been dealing with is on down hill descents. The heel and heel box does not cushion as well as other boots. There is absolutely no shock support  when hiking down hill for long stretches. Without much success I've played around with various insole inserts over the years but I think the problem is the outer sole. It seems like the outer heel is stiff metal and not a springy rubber so I've usually ended my hikes with sore knees. I don't get blisters but I do feel sore in my knees after long hikes. Originally when I had this issue I assumed the boots needed a bit more break in time but after two years and hundreds of miles I had to take a star off from the original 5 star review for the lack of support and comfort.These are great boots for ascents where rock and talus scrambling require sticky/sturdy toe rands but for long distance hiking over hard ground I did not find them ideal.ORIGINAL REVIEW:After 30+ miles on the Appalachian Trail these are my favorite boots of all time. I was worried about the blister situation and packed extra insoles just in case and found that the supplied peel away split insole that these come with either made the boots fit snug or too loose. So in the end I just used my old stillflex insoles (from an old Dolomite boot) and had no issues with blisters. I also use liner socks and pre-applied my own homemade anti-blister balm just to be safe and had no issues with blisters. The break in time for these boots took just the morning on the first day.My favorite feature is that the rand and under-soles stick to everything. We were hiking late December and there were wet leaves, wet rocks and ice everywhere and I had no issues climbing over anything.My one gripe is these are not the most cushioned boots I ever worn and downhills you tend to feel it more especially on worn down trails. But this can easily be fixed by inserting beefier cushioned insoles.In closing I will sum up the awesomeness of these boots: In the last 10 years of hiking the first thing I always want to do when getting back to the car is throwing off my boots and getting into some dry cotton socks and sneakers or flip flops for the drive home. Last night was the first time in 10 years that I kept my boots on during the two plus hour drive back home. That is how comfortable these Salewa are!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K0WDPUFIUWDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YXB9LY#wasThisHelpful","R1K0WDPUFIUWDA","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At best the are good for first year hikers that only hike in fair sunny weather and hike on trail.I get why this is the most reviewed boots out there and perhaps the most loved Merrell boots; If you never hiked before then  you will love these boots.Beginners worry most about comfort, in regards to footwear, when starting out for the first time.Hiking is tedious on virgin feet. Before weather conditions it is usually comfort, or rather lack thereof, that turns most beginners away. The feet comes first and if at the end of a 5 mile hike your feet are in pain then most likely you may not want to ever hike again.With these boots easy to moderate hiking in fair weather (which is the condition that 99.999% beginners start in)is a joy. They are durable for most terrain as long as you stay on trail and don't bushwack.The Moabs are perfect because they can make any trail seem like you are walking on carpeted pavement. The removable insoles are very soft and flexible and the outsoles are more like something you would find on sneakers than mountain boots. Hence the rave reviews for comfort. But for me the positives stop there especially when discussing the quality of the uppers.The Moab upper is a cheap glued together construction of faux suede leather and nylon mesh that say MADE IN CHINA.  My toe rand started to peel off after a few wears (which was how I saw it is glued on and the stitching tracks are for fashion) and the eyelets for the laces at the toe end somehow kept digging into my feet everytime I flexed my feet while walking  uphill(I will put some pictures up).The reason I say these are not 'exactly' waterproof is because the outer mesh fabric soaks up water like a sponge and water clings onto the boot for a duration of time until the boots dry out. So your feet inside remain dry, due to the GoreTex XCR lining, but will feel wet and cold. The cause of this effect is the breathability disappears on a soaked boot and your feet starts sweating on the inside.This is why some folks claim their feet get wet in the Moab XCR. It is not water getting in but the outer fabric soaking and losing breathability causing your feet to sweat buckets of water inside the boots.The Moabs are good boots for fair weather trail-only hiking and I get the idea that Merrell intended these Moabs to do just that. In that regard they will make most beginners happy for the sub $100 price. However if you want to go off trail or want to overnight, regardless of weather conditions, then look elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AFDJ1DVK4ZXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RJ25CU#wasThisHelpful","R3AFDJ1DVK4ZXG","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure why I had the impression that all Clarks are made in the UK but these Clarks Norse Tip shoes are not made in the UK!Instead they come from China. In saying that, I strongly believe the $140+ retail asking price for these are too much. Sure these are quality shoes perfect for daily 9 to 5 wear but they are not dress shoes. In fact the Norse Tips has that rugged clean charm that looks best at the cuff end of corduroy pants worn by College Professors and Teachers.The Norse Tips are comfortable, with a cushioned removable footbed, for all day wear but I found them to be on the heavy side for this style of shoes.I'm not sure but I think the outsoles have thick wood layers running thru them which could account for the heft.I normally wear size USA 11/EU 44 and found that I had to size down by 1/2 a size to get a better fit. The size 11s were not only loose in the ankle box and toe box put also heavy and I felt as if I was wearing bricks. I noticed other reviewers experienced the same scenario. Size 10.5 is equivalent to a EU 45 according to the shoe box detail for the Norse Tip.In terms of the upper leather and weatherproofness these excel and the leather materials used are high quality and very durable. You will not get cold toes or wet socks when it rains or snows. Also the leather doesn't wrinkle up and loose shape like cheaper shoes.The break in time is longer than on other shoes but once you break them in you will get about 20 plus solid years out of these. I'm actually looking to buy a second pair to keep in storage they are that good.Just be sure to get them on sale if you can. I think $140 is way too much to ask for daily work shoes however at that price you still won't be robbed because they will last a long time.Would have been 5 stars had the retail price been lower and the fit was more exact. These Norse series also come in about 4 to 5 different variations which was a smart thing for Clarks to do in terms of catering to it's customers wants and likes. Still the Norse Tip are my favorite for that clean rugged look","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21HMEI3AYCCY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00762NHWS#wasThisHelpful","R21HMEI3AYCCY2","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main confusion here, in light of all the negative criticism, is due to the misunderstanding that viewers think this is a movie. It is NOT a movie but rather a collection of Steampunk web episodes created and released online in 10 short segments during late 2010. Collectively it is nothing more than a prequel meant to spawn a TV series on the SyFy Network. For some reason the network never took it on and expanded it from what we see here: a collection of short episodes, some as short as 6 minutes, seamlessly joined together to look like a movie. This series also spawned a book which further prequels this story here.For what it is Riese is visually unique low budget fantasy that has the charm of a RPG video game replete with lingering narration, the heroine on a quest of self discovery who defeats her obstacles by using elements around her, gathering information, helping others along her journey. Eventually she meets up with others who she needs to help her defeat the big boss and reclaim her throne.My only gripe is the pacing. It slows down in the middle for a good 25 minutes where nothing really happens. But then it picks back up with action and new revelations that sweetly set up the final showdown preparing for what would have become a brilliant TV series.Christine Chatelain does well in fleshing out the main role and making Riese gritty yet angelic. She easily could have gone overboard and go Xena-Warrior Princess or worse yet go all Damsel-In-Distress but Christine balances the role a strong woman who can handle herself but is still vulnerable in a world and to situations she does not understand very well. Christine is no Meryl Streep but she does a brilliant job of making her role believable and her character's world believable. Sadly, everyone else comes across as campy actors hamming it up. But to their credit the villains are one dimensional.The map of the kingdom and naming of towns and characters were unique, very well done and creative. However the religious bad guys calling themselves The Sect and the exiled good guys call themselves The Resistance is very cliche.The Steampunk costumes and set are exquisitely done considering the small budget and dubious long term commitment that would have been on the mind of the production team.Overall, I liked this series and as a result I would definitely go read the book to see how it all concludes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MMMZ9NPWT2JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CD7OHS#wasThisHelpful","R1MMMZ9NPWT2JF","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't really wear this brand anymore but once I tried on this Atom LT vest at the local outfitter I had to have it. It is warm for the pack weight yet thin enough to fit inside the slimmest of Softshells. Even so it is still lofty and snug without being too tight but just remember, unless you have a basketball player sized torso, to size down.At 5'9""/155lbs I usually wear medium in everything but the small Atom LT vest fit me. The tags even read next to the Small that it is equivalent to a Men's 38R which is a Medium in the USA.Note: there is no hem cinch and the hemline has an elastic band that hugs your belt line when you zip it up so it is better to make sure the vest is not baggy when you buy it or the hem will just hang loose and cold air will blow in from the underside.My only gripe is these are so limited in quantity that I had to wait an entire year for my size and color choice to return once the Fall 2011 stock had sold out. And yes by Thanksgiving pickings will be slim on these so it is pointless to wait for them to go on sale because they will already be gone or they will immediately disappear from existence the minute online retailers send out the annual Arcteryx Sale email.Even at $144 the price is not so bad considering all of Arcteryx other vest items start at $199 (and those are all non-insulated fleece vests).It is important to note that by 'design' the Atom LT vest is meant to be and works best, in my opinion, as a snug fitting mid layer and NOT an over sized outer layer!The nylon outer shell material is super soft and wont last past a morning of mild bushwhacking.Also yes it does have three generous pockets: two bonafide great hand-warmer zippered pockets and one deep zippered internal chest pocket.This makes the entire piece a great deal considering...","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MGPPNQ4F3Q8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DJXVU4#wasThisHelpful","R3MGPPNQ4F3Q8U","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"NOTE: I ordered the N2472202 model that has only one shotshell 12 gauge logo on the buckle strap. Please see my customer gallery pictures in my profile picture section. Those pictures reinforce my feelings about this belt and back up all the statements in my review.I was extremely disappointed by this belt. The BIGGEST surprise out the box was the MADE IN CHINA stamped on what was advertised as an ""All American Classic Western Belt"" to me. The entire website made me think Nocona belts and Nocona leather goods were hand made and crafted from good quality leather stock in the heartland USA. This was not the case. It is made in China and looks and feel like a belt that is factory made on a budget and shipped out in mass.I also own Orvis, Filson and Royden USA made leather belts and this Nocona belt is inferior on all counts. I'm not even convinced that the Nocona belt is even real leather. When you fold a leather belt is always makes a U especially when new and the leather is still stiff. The Nocona belt makes a V and creases at the fold like construction paper. Then when unfolded the inside leather must be painted on because the brown color flakes off. Not cool at all. See the pictures I put up in my profile gallery.Another huge annoyance is that the advertised 'distressed' look of this belt should feel genuine and unique but the distressed pattern seems printed on and comes across as a machine-made effect instead of a natural distressed pattern that you get with good quality leather.I ordered a 34 belt size for my 32/33 waist and the Nocona belt I got had 34 stamped right below the MADE IN CHINA but definitely fit like a 32 belt size. I even measured it against my other 34 sized belts and the Nocona was an entire inch shorter at the end with the notch holes punched-in a shorter distance to the buckle. I was contemplating exchanging it for a 36 size but the over all quality for the price I paid is very lacking compared to other similar leather belts I own.That said, this is a belt one would expect to find at Kmart/Walmart/Target or even Walgreens for $9.99 and not the $30 to $50 price tag that webstores want for it.One positive about this belt is the shotshell 12 gauge detail is very well done (one of the best I've seen) and the brass buckle is removable and is securely locked into place with three sturdy snap buttons. Quick note on the buckle is that in reality it is more of a dull dark brass finish than the pictures make it out to be. The Amazon pics show a brighter 'gold' brass buckle but it is actually a duller finished brass.When you can pay a little extra for a better USA-Made belt from Orvis, Filson or Royden Leathers I cannot recommend this Nocona belt!","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MHYHNJYBUFBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SK6J5I#wasThisHelpful","R3MHYHNJYBUFBV","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been wearing Beauforts since my Dad handed down his original Dress Gordon-lined A150 Sage Wax to me when I was 17 years old. 17 years later today the Beaufort is a completely different item. Although they are still hand made in England the quality has slightly diminished and the tailoring is not as it used to be.

I'm still shocked that I'm now a size 36 in Barbour but wear a 40R suit normally!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSFZBEAFSC7XA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003D77XX4#wasThisHelpful","RSFZBEAFSC7XA","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this a month back online over two other bags I was looking at; the higher end Coach 70313 Thompson Slim Messenger and the slightly cheaper eBag's Colombian Leather Messenger. With the Risky Business my initial concerns from looking at the online pictures were the cloth fabric strap being cheap, the magnetic closure snaps not working, and the quality/durability of the leather overtime.However, regardless of my concerns I was surprised that the Risky Business has the MOST buyer reviews online and the MOST positive 5 stars reviews online of any messenger bag. It is like buyers were so impressed that even the non-reviewers that never return to write reviews had to say something. So I went ahead to see what all the buzz is about.There are a billion positive things that could be said and has been said about this bag so for sake of brevity I will discuss the Risky Business from the perspective of my three initial concerns and how those concerns turned out to be big positives:The Strap:The cloth strap is actually a durable canvas cotton blended with some sort poly-nylon weave that makes the strap feel secure and comfortable. I also own a Tumi T-Tech Houston Portfolio Computer Bag w/ a ballistic-nylon strap and a Filson #256 Original Twill Brief w/ a leather strap and the Risky Business has by far the best strap for comfort, wear-ability and load stability. It is just the right width that the load is stabilized when worn over one shoulder or across the chest. Also the strap extends down the sides and underside of the bag wrapping around the interior load so the burden is evenly distributed around the bag and onto the strap. I don't know who came up with this idea but it is sheer brilliance.The Magnetic Clasp:When the flap is put down the little dots magically line up and click-close every time. Accessing the bag is easy since there is no zips to undo each time you want to change a track on your iPod. When the bag isn't overstuffed the flap stays shut during wear. The magnetic dots while obviously not strong at all basically ONLY serves to hold the flap in place (it keeps it from sliding around). It is NOT meant for 'locking down' the bag so if you are Spider-Man and that is something you need then look elsewhere. Non Superheros will be happy with the magnet dots.  That said, the main pocket and two front pockets are deep enough and the leather is firm enough that nothing will slide out or ride up and out of the bag. It is true that if the bag is stuffed to the brim the flap will not reach down far enough to the magnetic dots. So to say the flap is unsecured when the bag is stuffed is also saying you are not supposed to stuff the bag to begin with.The Leather Quality:Real leather that is rich and desirable is not perfectly smooth, shiny and clean. It should have a rugged distressed,  pitted appearance to it and it should smell like leather instead of chemicals. The risky business meets all the requirements of real leather that is rich and desirable. The online pictures may make it look like smooth patent, fake leather but when you unbox it the bag will be leather. I know there have been a lot of complaints, in fact the only complaints I've read, that bags arrived scratched up, pitted, creased and distressed when unboxed. Well guess what people?! real leather isn't made in a computer machine that prints out perfect sheets of it. It is stripped off an animal and cured and processed and dyed and it goes thru a myriad of complex processes before it is tailored to the end product, made into a sweet messenger bag and shipped off to you. That said, the leather quality is top notch to the point that it has a hand-made feel to it which I love. In a month of using my bag to carry books, a Thinkpad T61, an iPad, Groceries, mail-parcels, wet umbrellas, etc... thru the gritty environs of the NYC Subway system the leather and the bag still looks brand new. I also did not have any issues with the brown dye rubbing off.POSITIVES: Great bag for the price. It is very light weight for a leather bag. There are lots of 'useful' interior space for everyday basic use. In 2012 with Tablets, Smartphones and iPads outselling slow bulky notebooks computers normal commuters and internet cafe slackers no longer carry around the big laptops. So lack of space is not a negative. The cloth fabric strap due to design and weaving outperform bags costing twice as much in categories of comfort and durability. Not making the straps leather also makes the bag much lighter.NEGATIVES: I'm not a fan of leather piping trim and this bag has it. Piping was big in the 1970s on my granddaddy's car seats and my grandmother's furniture. It doesn't quite belong here. But unless you are OCD like me it is not noticable. The tiny leather grab handle is utterly useless and looks like it will rip off at any moment. However, because the main cloth strap is so great you will never notice or use the little frail thing. The bottom section should have been reinforced with a tougher leather. For some reason the leather seems softer on the bottom panel of this bag than every where else on the bag. If you tend to drop and drag your Risky Business on the NYC Subway floors or in your Classrooms you may want to glance under there to see what I mean. Again I baby my bag when traveling and it is always on my lap or on the seat next to me so I'm exempt from such tragedy.That's it for the negatives and those were tiny negatives that 99% of casual users will not even notice in the years of owning this wonderful bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R208NXTQX4R9VL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VECWXG#wasThisHelpful","R208NXTQX4R9VL","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Alp Trainer Mid GTX have a very comfortable foot bed and secure lacing system that makes the boot feel broken in on your first time wearing them.I have medium-narrow size 44 feet with skinny ankles and these boots hug me ever so comfy from my toes to well above my ankles. The fit is exact to smallish so if you have wide feet and thick ankles size up by half a size.The only flaws is the lack of availability in sizes and widths and also colors. The low top versions come in all colors and shapes but these high top GTXs come in two colors dirty mud brown and ghastly neon yellow. Which brings me to my next flaw. Dirt. These boots are a dirt magnet. The Sulfur neon yellow suede will bring back all the trail dirt with you when you get home. Also the flank material along the side is a type of mesh knit cordura that , whiles durable, gets dirty/dusty and is hard to clean. In saying that I do not want to sound vain but in 20 years of outdoor activity I've found that clean gear and gear that is easy to clean at the end of a trip last longer than gear that gets dirty quickly and stays dirty after cleaning.The rubber toe rand has questionable long term durability but this is a flaw I find with many glued-on toe rands on sub-$200 boots.Overall I would say these are decent 3 season weekend/weeklong boots that will be comfy especially for novice hikers and kids.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OAPKL4J78MCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VZKVO0#wasThisHelpful","R1OAPKL4J78MCL","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4 Stars for this brilliant unit!I understand why many people have had issues with docking their iPod/iPhones. I have several devices around my home and car that use iPod docks and the DC315/37 has one of the most trickiest dock plugs ever.The dock plug on the DC315/37 that goes into the bottom of your iPod/iPhone is really frail, thin and hard to seat an iPod/iPhone on. I broke the plug the first time around and replaced the unit right away. The second unit had the same issues but I knew better than to force the device on there to get it seated firmly.The trick is to play with it and to use the little screw on the back that ejects a back brace that holds your iPhone/iPod to the dock.Also if your iPhone/iPod isn't seated properly the DC315/37 will not read or charge your iPod/iPhone at all. So a word to those that find their iPhone/iPod aren't playing right away is to keep trying to seat it correctly on the dock plug before complaining.My favorite feature is the Aux In and the fact that it came with the cable so this way you could play Angry Birds, browse YouTube, or view pictures on your iPod Touch/iPhone (or even iPad) whiles using the Aux In to play sound thru the speakers. I keep an AC charger plugged in for my iPhone by my bedstand so this way I can just use the Aux In to play music from YouTube all night long.I also love that this Philips dock has a sleep timer, am/fm and alarm function. All of which I find that I actually use. The AM/FM comes in handy in the mornings when listining for traffic and weather updates and the FM as well for talk radio.My only gripe is that there is no remote control for it and you have to be near the device to turn it off/on or shuffle tracks on your iPhone/iPod.Other than that I love it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OTILQFS3Y4G2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002IT1BFO#wasThisHelpful","R2OTILQFS3Y4G2","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oxford Murders was one of the worse movies I have ever seen.Within the first 30 minutes you lose interest because nothing makes sense! Like Wood's character just getting off a plane from Arizona where he lives, which is enforced by the worse photoshopped picture of trailer home parents standing in a desert, but Woods has pale white skin, European teeth and a British/Hobbit accent. Also for example in an early scene out of no where Wood's character is playing racquet ball. We are not sure where it is because he has vandalized the entire court with mathematical markings showing where the ball will land providing it has bounced off a certain X on the wall. It is assumed that this scene is entirely done to show Wood's as a math genius but we have no clue why racquet ball predictions is relevant to his Oxford studies. Then a random hot chick walks by and all of a sudden they flirt, become a couple and have sex in literally the space of two scenes. Then we find out this random chick is important to the entire plot.Even as far as bad movies go there is no entertainment value to watching Oxford Murders. Like how Nicholas Cage's ""Knowing"" or ""National Treasure"" movies are all bad movies but at least they have some popcorn excitement when you watch them. Also those flicks don't take themselves too seriously or pretend to be Masterpiece Theater material. Here in Oxford Murders you get all the boring pretense, that is never followed up, of old spies, cold war decoders, scrabble pieces as clues, math & philisophical jargons that have no relevance in the film, and a main mystery sequence of clues that is abandoned midway in the movie then picked up again for plot convenience at the end of the movie.Needless to say it was hard for me to dedicate my attention while suspending my common sense to watch this thru to end. I had hopes that the ending would provides some sort of nice tie-it-all-up feeling but sadly the ending of the movie is literally one of the worse endings you will ever see with one of the worse explainations for all the mystery and intrigue that any movie pretends to have. The last lines of the movie will leave you thinking if the movie ever took itself seriously at all.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F59BVIS97H6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003X82CZ2#wasThisHelpful","R2F59BVIS97H6E","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been wearing 527 since they were sold alongside 567 as a modern departure from both the adolescent silver tab line and the old school 501 line back in the early 2000s. In the last couple of years Levis dropped the 567 line (or at least toned down production of 567s) and focused a lot of their new designs, colors and cuts on the much more modern fitting slim boot fit style 527.That said, you get a lot of variation in colors and style choices on the 527 line. The flip side of this is you also get a variety of cuts that following certain colors and styles. I own almost ten pairs of 527 denim and even though I have them all in 34 waist/30 inseam they all fit and look differently based on color and style. These 527, with the slanted slimline pockets and rear zip pockets are what seems to be the slimmest cut of the 527 line.I am 5'8"" tall and 160 lbs and I am a size 32 waist/30 inseam for most pants but I wear 34/30 in all my 527 jeans to get a right fit. However in these particular 527 jeans the size 34/30 were not only tight around my legs but very short on the inseam as well.My remedy was to get size 34/32 and this not only made the length long enough but also provided some extra space in the thigh and crotch region. I believe these 527s are meticulously tailored so that a longer inseam translates into more room elsewhere.That said my only gripe with all Levi's products from low end $29 denim to high end $249 denim is that if you do not follow the washing/care instructions to the letter they will not last long. I've had denim fade from rich dark blues to gray blue because I washed them in lukewarm water and machine dried them.So make sure that you ALWAYS use an ice cold wash and hang dry these in a dark room somewhere in order for that nice blue denim color to last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UF727QVUHWCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052BQILM#wasThisHelpful","R2UF727QVUHWCX","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I get why people like this movie-given the budget the action when it occurs has a well done realistic POV grittiness-something rarely seen in movies anymore. I also understand why people dislike it-this movie is obviously is not a documentary and it may be offensive to Danish history.  However, I dislike this film for another reason: the dire direction, the lack of editing and the poor pacing.This movie is 2 hours but there is 19 minutes collectively of action at the start and 16 minutes towards the end. It would be generous to say there is an additional 25 minutes of screen time that advance the plot, enhance the characters and make the story somewhat interesting. Where the poor directing and pacing comes in is during the 60 minutes of this movie where nothing happens. At the simplest explanation: the good guys of 20 or so men sit in the castle while waiting for the 1,000 bad guys to attack again. Why the bad guys are waiting when it is obvious another 2 or 3 attacks will win the keep is never explained. To sum up how boring the middle of the movie is there is a scene where the good guys are starving while fortified in the castle during the course of the winter months. The bad guys are feasting away merrily every night in front of the castle. The Templar decides to steal their food on a solo stealth mission. For 20 minutes nothing exciting or plot propelling has happened on screen so you would think we are due for some action or intrigue. Nope. Instead we only see 3 bad guys chasing the Templar from a safe distance back into the castle after he steals two sacks of food. Next scene we are back to doing nothing plus now everyone is eating and being merry.What really pissed me off is that this movie is advertised as a Dark Ages version of Magnificent Seven or 13 Samurai. It is not. There is just the one Templar Knight who is too introspective to be relatable on any level above slinging a sword around. The merrymen that accompany him are thinly drawn characters; honorable thieves and ready to brawl bar men who commit their lives, fight clumsily, but don't promote any of the warrior's philosophy that made the 13 Samurai so good. Even 300 had a clear battlefield  philosophy which was exemplified thru the character's interactions and circumstances. Here we see our good guys sitting around doing nothing for most of the movie. There is a super silly scene around the 80 minute mark where our supposedly skillful Templar mounts his horse and blindly charges a cluster of armed men in a very tight space. The horse is bombarded and the Templar clumsily falls to the ground at the feet of the arm men who are about to gore the hell out of him. Before that happens the horse regains its balance magically finds space to escape and drags our not so graceful hero to safety. The sheer absurdity of this made me want to press the DVD eject button but regretfully I was committed to seeing this joke of a movie to the end. In all earnest, stronger direction and not more money would have made this movie an instant classic like Braveheart was.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EZRO5VEA9YGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X1Z14C#wasThisHelpful","R3EZRO5VEA9YGM","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With 256MB being rare and 128MB being standard. This is not a gaming laptop.- Screen brightness is not as crisp and luminous as newer models.

"In 2004 my weekly hair cuts in NYC was approaching $20 + tips and to save money I bought this clipper for $25. My purchase was on a trial basis because if I couldn't learn to use it without butchering my hair it was getting returned. The Wahl HomePro Adjustable was very quick to learn and is very easy to use for regular folks cutting their own hair in their bathrooms.Every Friday morning I've used it to cut my naturally short and curly hair during the last 7 years without any issues. Even when I went to London and Paris in the summers I took it along with a travel adapter. In Paris it worked but in London the AC/DC current was different and the Wahl would vibrate super fast to use safely. So I bought a comparable European clipper at Boots Pharmacy that I keep at my Aunt's house in North London.During the previous few weeks my Wahl was not cutting sharp like it used to. I unscrewed the shear plates and cleaned it out with clipper oil. Still the shears were hardly cutting my hair because it had gotten dull from 7 years of continuous use. I un-boxed and starting using an Emerson clipper that my brother got me a few years ago for Christmas. It was then that I realized how good my HomePro Adjustable was. The Emerson felt like a plastic toy in comparison. I went out and bought another Wahl Homepro brand clipper but found it impossible to use because it lacked the adjustable lever. So I came back to amazon and bought the exact model I had before.After 7 years of use it has proven to be the best thing ever and I 100% recommend it.At $20 + 5 tip x 52 weeks x 7 years I saved $9,100 on account of spending $25 to buy the Wahl HomePro Adjustable.PROS:-Has a nice hefty weight to it which gives it a good balance and feel in your hands.-Super easy to use, blades are smooth and comfortable to the touch.-Comes with adequate attachments and instruction VHS.-Shear blades dismantle easily and quickly for cleaning and replacement.-Easy to travel with.-Proven Lifetime quality.-Great price and value for what you are paying for.-Adjustable Lever makes a HUGE difference for fine tuning your hair cuts.CONS:-I couldn't find replacement shear blades anywhere for this particular model and the ones I did see for other Wahl models cost as much as an entire new Wahl clipper.-Over the years I learned Clipper Oil is crucial to the performance of the blades but the kit comes with a one-time use miniscule tube of clipper oil. Some other clippers come with free big bottles of the stuff but you will have to buy your own here.-Did not work in the UK because of the AC/DC current differences.-I wished the power cord was longer but if you get an extension cord you can easily remedy this.-It is not a quiet clipper but it is not super loud either. I noticed some folks commented on newer model clippers being silent.This is not a con for me but still it will be for those that like to cut their hair in their local Library.-For those looking to cut the hair 'down below' keep in mind this is not a small clipper. It vibrates quickly and is louder than smaller clippers. Also the edges of the shear blades protrude out some and are pointy and sharp. So any soft and sensitive areas below your belly button and above your knees you may want to approach with caution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R273FZU55BOFJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008XP0B#wasThisHelpful","R273FZU55BOFJQ","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If Al Bundy made a Lesbian movie this would be it: lots of random sex scenes with little dialogue.That said, the scenes are taseful and well shot. Nothing too over the top and everything is well crafted around the love making. For example the shower scene was one of the hotest scenes in the movie and Jessie is fully clothed in it. So it was more than just about making a sex scene it was creating a moment of genuine spontaneous lust and love.I'm surprised this move is 81 minutes long because there is literally about 10 minutes of dialogue, 5 minutes of story and 2 minutes of plot. However the movie does have some tension scenes where you wonder when and if they will get caught. Also there is a journey of Chloe and Jess that you become invested in during the movie and it commits any avid watcher to seeing it thru to the final minute. Nothing edge of your seat or of the heavy emotional drama here, just red hot fun with consequences.Also, like many other Lesbian dramas, the movie doesn't pretend to be more than it is or promise anything more than it delivers so I had to give it 5 stars.I like the guy that is selling his used DVD copy of this movie on Amazon for $129. Hilarious considering you can easily and legally rent it or watch it for free anywhere on the internet! I won't even recommend buying the DVD.

"When my fiance offered to get me an engagement item I mentioned the ""original"" Calibre 2100 watch. Funny thing was the hotel we stayed in during our engagement weekend at Mohegan Sun, CT had an official Citizen Dealership in the lobby. This was July 4th weekend and they told us they no longer carried the ""original"" 2100 and had the new version on sale. I was excited to test the waters and jumped right in the pool.That weekend I spent some time wearing this ""facelift"" version to the original Calibre 2100 that I always wanted. I also own a steel Citizen Nighthawk and a gold/brown-leather-band Citizen Minute Repeater Calibre 9000. So I'm no newbie to their amazing watches.Compared to the original 2100 this new version immediately looks cheaper when you put it on. The design is not original at all. It looks like it belongs on a Walgreens watch display carousel next to the reading glasses.The bracelet, the crown and the push buttons all felt loose and cheap.  The semi-square bezel and monster size lugs seems to suggest that the watch can't make up it's mind on whether to be classic or modern.The fit on my wrist compared to other watches was difficult and most guys that have medium sized or smaller wrists like me will find a hard time fitting this watch to wear comfortably. The issue for me is the shape of the face and bezel being long and wide relative to the band so there is this feeling of imbalance between the hefty 44mm case width (approximately 1 3/4"") and super thin bracelet.That said, feature wise the watch didn't impress me when compared to what the original 2100 offers. The only issue the original 2100 had was the mineral glass would scratch easily. On this new 2100 a scratch proof sapphire crystal glass is used. This is basically the only improvement over the original model.However, those that are considering buying the original version over this new version should rest assured that Citizen will replace the mineral glass on the original version 2100 watched with the sapphire glass for a fee of $100+ and a turn around of 2 weeks.So instead of paying the list price of $699.99 (or the actual retail of $500+) for this facelift 2100 watch it would be wise to get the original 2100 that still sells brand new on some online retail sites for as cheap as $259 and then paying $100+ extra to upgrade it to the sapphire crystal.BOTTOM LINE: If you can get past the odd look and awkward fit then you may be happy with the features of this watch. For me Citizen has ruined a classic watch with unnecessary modern touches and no real upgrade to the features that the original had. Also it just felt uncomfortable on my medium wrist because of its design. I had to leave this monstrosity back in CT. Even as a gift I couldn't accept it for the price paid because I would never wear it. This watch gets only 1 star from me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D2RCPDD1MV6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SB4OI#wasThisHelpful","R2D2RCPDD1MV6K","A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"By now there's not nearly as much disagreement regarding what happened to John and Robert Kennedy as major communications corporations would have you believe. While every researcher and author highlights different details, there isn't any serious disagreement among, say, Jim Douglass' JFK and the Unspeakable, Howard Hunt's deathbed confession, and David Talbot's new The Devil's Chessboard.Jon Schwarz says The Devil's Chessboard confirms that ""your darkest suspicions about how the world operates are likely an underestimate. Yes, there is an amorphous group of unelected corporate lawyers, bankers, and intelligence and military officials who form an American 'deep state,' setting real limits on the rare politicians who ever try to get out of line.""For those of us who were already convinced of that up to our eyeballs, Talbot's book is still one of the best I've seen on the Dulles brothers and one of the best I've seen on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Where it differs from Douglass' book, I think, is not so much in the evidence it relates or the conclusions it draws, but in providing an additional motivation for the crime.JFK and the Unspeakable depicts Kennedy as getting in the way of the violence that Allen Dulles and gang wished to engage in abroad. He wouldn't fight Cuba or the Soviet Union or Vietnam or East Germany or independence movements in Africa. He wanted disarmament and peace. He was talking cooperatively with Khrushchev, as Eisenhower had tried prior to the U2-shootdown sabotage. The CIA was overthrowing governments in Iran, Guatemala, the Congo, Vietnam, and around the world. Kennedy was getting in the way.The Devil's Chessboard depicts Kennedy, in addition, as himself being the sort of leader the CIA was in the habit of overthrowing in those foreign capitals. Kennedy had made enemies of bankers and industrialists. He was working to shrink oil profits by closing tax loopholes, including the ""oil depletion allowance."" He was permitting the political left in Italy to participate in power, outraging the extreme right in Italy, the U.S., and the CIA. He aggressively went after steel corporations and prevented their price hikes. This was the sort of behavior that could get you overthrown if you lived in one of those countries with a U.S. embassy in it.Yes, Kennedy wanted to eliminate or drastically weaken and rename the CIA. Yes he threw Dulles and some of his gang out the door. Yes he refused to launch World War III over Cuba or Berlin or anything else. Yes he had the generals and warmongers against him, but he also had Wall Street against him.Of course ""politicians who ever try to get out of line"" are now, as then, but more effectively now, handled first by the media. If the media can stop them or some other maneuver can stop them (character assassination, blackmail, distraction, removal from power) then violence isn't required.The fact that Kennedy resembled a coup target, not just a protector of other targets, would be bad news for someone like Senator Bernie Sanders if he ever got past the media, the ""super delegates,"" and the sell-out organizations to seriously threaten to take the White House. A candidate who accepts the war machine to a great extent and resembles Kennedy not at all on questions of peace, but who takes on Wall Street with the passion it deserves, could place himself as much in the cross-hairs of the deep state as a Jeremy Corbyn who takes on both capital and killing.Accounts of the escapades of Allen Dulles, and the dozen or more partners in crime whose names crop up beside his decade after decade, illustrate the power of a permanent plutocracy, but also the power of particular individuals to shape it. What if Allen Dulles and Winston Churchill and others like them hadn't worked to start the Cold War even before World War II was over? What if Dulles hadn't collaborated with Nazis and the U.S. military hadn't recruited and imported so many of them into its ranks? What if Dulles hadn't worked to hide information about the holocaust while it was underway? What if Dulles hadn't betrayed Roosevelt and Russia to make a separate U.S. peace with Germany in Italy?  What if Dulles hadn't begun sabotaging democracy in Europe immediately and empowering former Nazis in Germany? What if Dulles hadn't turned the CIA into a secret lawless army and death squad? What if Dulles hadn't worked to end Iran's democracy, or Guatemala's? What if Dulles' CIA hadn't developed torture, rendition, human experimentation, and murder as routine policies? What if Eisenhower had been permitted to talk with Khrushchev? What if Dulles hadn't tried to overthrow the President of France? What if Dulles had been ""checked"" or ""balanced"" ever so slightly by the media or Congress or the courts along the way?These are tougher questions than ""What if there had been no Lee Harvey Oswald?"" The answer to that is, ""There would have been another guy very similar to serve the same purpose, just as there had been in the earlier attempt on JFK in Chicago. But ""What if there had been no Allen Dulles?"" looms large enough to suggest the possible answer that we would all be better off, less militarized, less secretive, less xenophobic. And that suggests that the deep state is not uniform and not unstoppable. Talbot's powerful history is a contribution to the effort to stop it.I hope Talbot speaks about his book in Virginia, after which he might stop saying that Williamsburg and the CIA's ""farm"" are in ""Northern Virginia."" Hasn't Northern Virginia got enough to be ashamed of without that?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K1CP59C1NF3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062276166#wasThisHelpful","R3K1CP59C1NF3G","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're into quaint, you can visit a historic village, restore some antique furniture, or for far less trouble pick up a mainstream analysis of the U.S. military from 40 years ago or so.I just happened to read a 1973 book called Military Force and American Society, edited by Bruce M. Russett and Alfred Stepan -- both of whom have presumably updated their views somewhat, or -- more likely -- veered off into other interests. The problems and trends described in their book have been worsening ever since, while interest in them has been lessening. You could write a similar book now, with the numbers all larger and the analysis more definitive, but who would buy it?The only point of re-writing it now would be to scream at the end "". . . AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A MAJOR PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH URGENTLY!"" Who wants to read that? Much more pleasant to read this 1973 book as it was written, with its attitude of ""Welp, it looks like we're all going to hell. Carry on."" Here is an actual quote from near the end of the book: ""To understand military expansion is not necessarily to arrest it. America's ideology could involve beliefs which are quite true and values which are quite genuine."" This was from Douglas Rosenberg, who led up to that statement with 50 pages on the dangerously delusional myths driving U.S. military policy.An earlier chapter by Clarence Abercrombie and Raoul Alcal√° ended thus: ""None of this should be taken as an indictment . . . . What we do suggest is that . . . social and political effects . . . must be carefully evaluated."" Another chapter by James Dickey concluded: ""This article has not been a call for relieving the army entirely of roles with a political context."" Of course, it had been just that. Didn't these people realize that humanity just might survive for additional decades, and that copies of this book might survive as well, and that someone might read one? You can't just document a problem and then waive it off -- unless you're Exxon.The heart of the book is data on the rise of the permanent war economy and global U.S. empire and arms sales with World War II, and the failure to ever return to anything like what preceded World War II. The authors worry, rather quaintly, that the military might begin influencing public policy or conducting foreign policy, that -- for example -- some officers' training was going to include studying politics with a possible eye toward engaging with politicians.The warnings, quaint or not, are quite serious matters: the military's new domestic uses to handle ""civil disturbances,"" the military's spying, the possibility that an all-volunteer military might separate the military from the rest of society, etc. Careful empirical studies documented in the book found that higher military spending produced more wars, rather than foreign dangers producing higher spending, that the higher spending was economically damaging, not beneficial, and that higher military spending usually if not always produced lower spending on social needs. These findings have by now of course been reproduced enough times to persuade a climate change denier, if a climate change denier were to hear about them.The real quaintness, however, comes when this group of authors in 1973 tries to explain militaristic votes by Congress members. Possible explanations they study include constituent pressure, race and sex of the Congress member, ideology of the Congress member, and the ""Military Industrial Complex,"" by which author Wayne Moyer seems to mean the Congress member's affiliation with the military and the level of military spending in the member's district or state. That any of these factors would better explain or predict a Congress member's vote on something militaristic, than a glance at the war profiteering funding used to legally bribe the member in recent election ""contributions"" seems absurd in 2015.Yet, there is of course a great deal of truth to the idea that Congress members, to one degree or another, adopt an ideology that fits with, and allows self-respect to coexist with, what they've been paid to do. Campaign ""contributors"" do not just buy votes; they buy minds -- or they select the minds that have already been bought and help them stay that way.To understand all of this is not necessarily to arrest it, but it damn well should be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OQIJUQ58PQ6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061393657#wasThisHelpful","R2OQIJUQ58PQ6W","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought Deepa Iyer's new book, We Too Sing America: South Asian, Arab, Muslim, and Sikh Immigrants Shape Our Multiracial Future, would be about positive and jarring cultural contributions from immigrants, how their literature, music, myths, cooking, clothing, and cultural practices are merging with and influencing wider U.S. culture. I think that would be a good book. Maybe someone's written it.This, too, is a good book, and I recommend it. But it is mostly about the all-too-familiar story of post-911 prejudice, racism, violence, and police profiling and abuse, with a particular focus on South Asians. As an opponent of murder in any form, my first response to this topic is usually: Take the guns away! Hatred doesn't kill people -- hatred in people with guns kills people! But of course I'd love to take the hatred away as well and get the gun deaths down to accidents, suicides, and non-hate crimes.I admit some uncertainty as to how we can identify a gun murder as free of hate. Here's how Iyer describes hate crimes:  ""Hate violence affects everyone in America. A hate crime affects not only the person being targeted but the entire community to which that person belongs. Acts of hate violence can disrupt and affect even those who do not belong [to] the community being directly targeted, as we witnessed in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, where non-Sikhs also experienced fear and anxiety in the wake of the massacre.""Of course, that sounds almost identical to the effects of a non-hate school shooting. A value to be found in distinguishing crimes motivated by, for example, hatred of Muslims, lies in the consequent ability to report on and know how widespread that phenomenon is. Does badmouthing Muslims encourage shooting them? Does shooting them encourage discriminating against them? We cannot study and address these matters if we don't identify them. And of course, fearing being shot for living in a country whose government has been purchased by the NRA, is not exactly the same as fearing being shot for being a Muslim and living in a country whose government has been purchased by the NRA. Hatred of part of your identity can make you want to hide that identity and/or resent the suggestion that you should do so and/or internalize the idea of inferiority, etc.On the other hand, hate crimes laws don't just produce data. Neither do they do anything to reduce racism or other bigotry or to address underlying insecurities and grievances. What they do, as Iyer points out, is increase long sentences in the U.S. mass incarceration system.Much of the work that Iyer describes being undertaken by community groups in support of abused minorities and crime victims involves attempting to tweak the flood of sewage spewing forth from the corporate media. She urges reporters not to talk about non-Muslim people having been mistaken for Muslims when they've been attacked. Her reason is that this could be taken to imply that it's all right to attack Muslims. That sounds crazy, but of course she is right that that could happen. Why, then, does locking people up for additional years or decades because they killed while racist not risk implying that it's OK to kill while not racist? It seems no more crazy.The permanent U.S. war on the Middle East has fed the streams of both private and police hate crimes, and that war has trained many to believe that, in fact, it is OK to kill only while believing in racism and bigotry. Members of the military cannot avoid thinking that, while killing was wrong all through their childhood, something has suddenly made it acceptable when they are ordered to engage in it. For many the dehumanizing tactic that allows them to obey their orders is racism. Such racism at home, Iyer argues, enables the United States to keep going to war.And what about the endless FBI frame-ups, the profiling, the deportations, and all the racist abuse by ""law enforcement"" -- why aren't these hate crimes? Don't they set examples and influence the broader culture? If someone in Germany proposes immigration policies resembling those of the United States they are immediately denounced for racism and hatred.Iyer's book is full of heart-wrenching stories of raging racist hatred and violence, and the suffering it creates. She also proposes some good ideas rarely heard about in the corporate media, including reparations for the victims of post-911 state bigotry, on the model of reparations for the victims of the Japanese-American internment camps.What really breaks my heart in reading so many accounts of the sort of nastiness that has just helped lead that young man whose school clock project was labeled a bomb to leave the United States for someplace less hostile, is the focus of the corrective work on trying to influence the corporate media. We all know how awful the corporate media is, how little it is turned into a force for good, and what minor partial tweaks are proclaimed as victories by activists.We need a communications system that ceases to condone hatred or violence, that includes all voices in its communications, and that condemns cruelty -- whether public or private -- without exception.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XXB2BO23T8TS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620970147#wasThisHelpful","R2XXB2BO23T8TS","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To the genre of war abolition treatises that everyone should read add A New Era of Nonviolence: The Power of Civil Society Over War by Tom Hastings. This is a peace studies book that truly crosses over into the perspective of peace activism. The author addresses positive trends with neither rose- nor red-white-and-blue-colored glasses. Hastings isn‚Äôt just after peace in his heart or peace in his neighborhood or bringing the good word of peace to the Africans. He actually wants to end war, and thus includes an appropriate ‚Äî by no means exclusive ‚Äî emphasis on the United States and its unprecedented militarism. For example:  ‚ÄúIn a positive feedback loop of negative consequence, the race for the world‚Äôs remaining fossil fuels will produce more conflict and require ever more fuel to win the race . . . ‚Äò[T]he U.S. Air Force, the world‚Äôs single largest consumer of petroleum, recently announced a plan to substitute 50 percent of its fuel use with alternative fuels, with particular emphasis on biofuels. Yet, biofuels will be able to supply no more than roughly 25 percent of motor fuel [and that‚Äôs with stealing land needed for food crops ‚ÄìDS] . . . so other regions where oil supplies are available will likely see greater military investment and intervention.‚Äô . . . With the growing scarcity of oil reserves the U.S. military has entered an Orwellian era of permanent war, with hot conflict in multiple countries constantly. It may be thought of as a giant raptor, fueled by oil, constantly circling the Earth, seeking its next meal.‚ÄùA lot of people in favor of ‚Äúpeace,‚Äù just like a lot of people in favor of protecting the environment, do not want to hear that. The U.S. Institute of Peace, for example, may be thought of as a wart on the beak of the giant raptor, and would ‚Äî I think ‚Äî see itself sufficiently in those terms to object to the preceding paragraph. Hastings, in fact, illustrates well how Washington, D.C., thinks of itself by quoting a fairly typical comment, but one already proven flawed by well-known events. This was Michael Barone of US News and World Report in 2003 before the attack on Iraq:  ‚ÄúFew in Washington doubt that we can occupy Iraq within a few weeks‚Äô time. Then comes the difficult task of moving Iraq toward a government that is democratic, peaceful, and respectful of the rule of law. Fortunately, smart officials in both the Defense and State departments have been doing serious work planning for that eventuality for over a year now.‚ÄùSo, not to worry! This was an open public statement in 2003, like many others, yet the fact that the U.S. government was planning to attack Iraq for over a year before that continues to be ‚Äúbreaking news!‚Äù right up through this week.That wars can be prevented even in the United States is clear to Hastings who would agree with Robert Naiman‚Äôs recent objection when CNN suggested that having opposed the Contra war on the government of Nicaragua should disqualify someone from running for U.S. president (particularly someone standing next to a shameless warmonger who voted for the war on Iraq). In fact, Hastings points out, huge efforts by the peace movement in the United States at the time very likely prevented a U.S. invasion of Nicaragua. ‚Äú[H]igh ranking U.S. officials with access to [President Ronald] Reagan and his cabinet were speculating that invading Nicaragua was almost inevitable ‚Äî and . . . it never occurred.‚ÄùHastings examines causes of war outside of the Pentagon as well, tracing, for example, infectious disease back to the common cause of poverty, and noting that infectious disease can lead to xenophobic and ethnocentric hostility that leads to war. Working to eliminate disease can therefore help to eliminate war. And of course a small fraction of the cost of war could go a long way toward eliminating diseases.That war need not be the result of conflict is clear to Hastings who recounts excellent models such as the popular resistance in the Philippines from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s. In February 1986 a civil war began. ‚ÄúThe people interposed between two armies of tanks in a remarkable four-day nonviolent mass action. They stopped an emerging civil war, rescued their democracy, and did all this with zero mortalities.‚ÄùA danger lurks in the growing recognition of the power of nonviolence that I think is illustrated by a quote from Peter Ackerman and Jack Duvall that I‚Äôm afraid Hastings might have included without any sense of irony. Ackerman and Duvall, I should mention, are not Iraqi and at the time of making this statement had not been deputized by the people of Iraq to decide their fate:  ‚ÄúSaddam Hussein has brutalized and repressed the Iraqi people for more than 20 years and more recently has sought to acquire weapons of mass destruction that would never be useful to him inside Iraq. So President Bush is right to call him an international threat. Given these realities, anyone who opposes U.S. military action to dethrone him has a responsibility to suggest how he might otherwise be ushered out the back door of Baghdad. Fortunately there is an answer: Civilian-based, nonviolent resistance by the Iraqi people, developed and applied with a strategy to undermine Saddam‚Äôs basis of power.‚ÄùBy this standard, any nation possessing weaponry of use only for foreign wars should by default be attacked by the United States as an international threat, or anyone opposing such action must demonstrate an alternative means of overthrowing that government. This thinking brings us CIA-NED-USAID ‚Äúdemocracy promotion‚Äù and ‚Äúcolor revolutions‚Äù and the general acceptance of provoking coups and uprisings ‚Äúnonviolently‚Äù from Washington. But are Washington‚Äôs nuclear weapons useful to President Obama inside the United States? Would he be right then in calling himself an international threat and attacking himself unless we could show an alternative means of overthrowing himself?If the United States were to stop arming and funding some of the worst governments on earth, its ‚Äúregime change‚Äù operations elsewhere would lose that hypocrisy. They would remain hopelessly flawed as undemocratic, foreign-influenced democracy-creation. A truly nonviolent foreign policy, in contrast, would neither collaborate with Bashar al Assad on torturing people nor later arm Syrians to attack him nor organize protesters to resist him nonviolently. Rather, it would lead the world be example toward disarmament, civil liberties, environmental sustainability, international justice, fair distribution of resources, and acts of humility. A world dominated by a peace maker rather than a war maker would be far less welcoming for the crimes of the Assads of the world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S83TR2ZIF4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078649431X#wasThisHelpful","R2S83TR2ZIF4X","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is entirely possible that President Al Gore would not have attacked Afghanistan or Iraq. President Henry Wallace might very well not have nuked Hiroshima or Nagasaki. President William Jennings Bryan almost certainly would not have attacked the Philippines.Presidents are pushed into war and held back from war all the time, but they also do some pushing and pulling of their own. Within days of Germany's surrender in World War II, Winston Churchill proposed recruiting German troops into a new UK/US war on the Soviet Union. The idea went nowhere with his own government or allies, except to become the Cold War. But every crazed idea he'd had for years prior to that moment had been deemed acceptable and acted upon, and someone else might not have had the same ideas.Do the sorts of powerful insiders epitomized by the Council on Foreign Relations usually get their way? Is the United States an oligarchy? Are small differences between electoral candidates magnified and exaggerated? Do both major political parties in the United States back essentially the same sort of militarism? Does a quasi-permanent shadow government within the Pentagon, CIA, State Department, etc., sometimes circumvent and overrule presidents? Yes, of course, all of those things are true. But individuals also matter.They would matter less in a democracy. If Congress decided on war as the U.S. Constitution requires, or if the public voted on war as the Ludlow Amendment would have required, or if the United States gave up war as the Kellogg-Briand Pact mandates, then the militarism in the mind of one individual would not decide the fate of so many lives and deaths. But that's not reality now.A President Lincoln Chafee or a President Bernie Sanders or a President Jill Stein, rather than a President Hillary Clinton or a President Donald Trump, would be one factor among many weighing to some degree against the likelihood of more and larger and more dangerous wars. Whether the chance and possible benefit of electing a better president is worth diverting resources from other anti-war work into the national circus of election obsession is a separate and much more complex question.This point, that individuals matter, is made in the new book Why Leaders Fight by Michael Horowitz, Allan Stam, and Cali Ellis. They go up against the academic tradition of attempting to explain war decisions through whatever process can most resemble the physical sciences. That tradition has steered far clear of anything as messy as a human being, preferring to ponder game theory or to hunt for non-existent correlations between war and population density, resource scarcity, or anything else that can be quantified.Having brought the individual back into consideration, the authors of Why Leaders Fight immediately attempt to make that resemble as closely as possible a mathematical equation. Was this national ruler someone who had been in the military, and was he or she in combat? What was their first experience with war? What is their education level? What is their age? What previous job did they hold? Were they raised by good parents? Were they raised wealthy or poor? What was their birth order? Et cetera.Will all such data ever allow a calculation to reliably predict war mongering or peacefulness? Of course not.  Will examinations of enough past leaders along these lines open our eyes to some areas for concern or reassurance? Perhaps. But can such scientistic studies reach the level of being a better guide to what a political candidate might do than is an examination of what that candidate has done and said? I doubt it.A careful reading of candidates' platforms, speeches, and casual remarks, including what is given prominence and what is omitted, and weighed against what they've actually done in the past, takes one quite far. Add in who's funding them, what party they've sworn allegiance to, how they relate to government and media insiders, how they relate to foreign leaders, how they handle mistakes, how they deal with crises, and one can -- I think -- predict fairly accurately which candidate is going to be a minor or major weight against a war that powerful interests demand, and which candidate is going to be easily pushed into war or, in fact, rush to create one at the earliest opportunity. It's not as though George W. Bush and Harry Truman and William McKinley hadn't advertised what sort of things they planned to do.Academics bent on making the social sciences into real by-god sciences left out more than the individual politician after all. They left out the wider culture. An older politician eager to make his or her mark before their time is up won't create wars in a culture that honors making peace. An official whose childhood and background statistics suggest they will take great risks would have to take none at all to go along with the routine militarism of the current U.S. government, but would challenge the whole military industry and the whole communications industry by attempting nonviolent solutions to crises. Disarmament is considered risky in U.S. culture, making questionable the expectation that risk-taking personalities will promote militarism. In other words, the interpretation and weighting of the data has to change so drastically with the culture that one is better off just looking at the culture.President Obama would have heavily bombed Syria in 2013 if not for the weight of U.S. culture against it. President John McCain would not have been free to develop a kill list and a drone murder program without the sort of intense public opposition that meets Republicans who do such things. There can be no question that individuals matter, especially large numbers of individuals actively demanding something. Nor can there be any question that one of those individuals who matter is you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QM78SXUBWGWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1107655676#wasThisHelpful","R3QM78SXUBWGWH","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As documented in Douglas Blackmon's book, Slavery By Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II, the institution of slavery in the U.S. South largely ended for as long as 20 years in some places upon completion of the U.S. civil war. And then it was back again, in a slightly different form, widespread, controlling, publicly known and accepted -- right up to World War II. In fact, in other forms, it remains today. But it does not remain today in the overpowering form that prevented a civil rights movement for nearly a century. It exists today in ways that we are free to oppose and resist, and we fail to do so only to our own shame.During widely publicized trials of slave owners for the crime of slavery in 1903 -- trials that did virtually nothing to end the pervasive practice -- the Montgomery Advertiser editorialized: ""Forgiveness is a Christian virtue and forgetfulness is often a relief, but some of us will never forgive nor forget the damnable and brutal excesses that were committed all over the South by negroes and their white allies, many of whom were federal officials, against whose acts our people were practically powerless.""This was a publicly acceptable position in Alabama in 1903: slavery should be tolerated because of the evils committed by the North during the war and during the occupation that followed. It's worth considering whether slavery might have ended more quickly had it been ended without a war. To say that is not, of course, to assert that in reality the pre-war United States was radically different than it was, that slave owners were willing to sell out, or that either side was open to a non-violent solution. But most nations that ended slavery did so without a civil war. Some did it in the way that Washington, D.C., did it, through compensated emancipation.Had the United States ended slavery without the war and without division, it would have been, by definition, a very different and less violent place. But, beyond that, it would have avoided the bitter war resentment that has yet to die down. Ending racism would have been a very lengthy process, regardless. But it might have been given a head start rather than having one arm tied behind our backs. Our stubborn refusal to recognize the U.S. civil war as a hindrance to freedom rather than the path to it, allows us to devastate places like Iraq and then marvel at the duration of the resulting animosity.Wars acquire new victims for many years after they end, even if all the cluster bombs are picked up. Just try to imagine the justifications that would be made for Israel's attacks on Palestinians had World War II not happened.Had the Northern U.S. allowed the South to secede, ended the returning of ""fugitive slaves,"" and used diplomatic and economic means to urge the South to abolish slavery, it seems reasonable to suppose that slavery might have lasted in the South beyond 1865, but very likely not until 1945. To say this is, once again, not to imagine that it actually happened, or that there weren't Northerners who wanted it to happen and who really didn't care about the fate of enslaved African Americans. It is just to put into proper context the traditional defense of the civil war as having murdered hundreds of thousands of people on both sides in order to accomplish the greater good of ending slavery. Slavery did not end.Across most of the South, a system of petty, even meaningless, crimes, such as ""vagrancy,"" created the threat of arrest for any black person. Upon arrest, a black man would be presented with a debt to pay through years of hard labor. The way to protect oneself from being put into one of the hundreds of forced labor camps was to put oneself in debt to and under the protection of a white owner. The 13th Amendment sanctions slavery for convicts, and no statute prohibited slavery until the 1950s. All that was needed for the pretense of legality was the equivalent of today's plea bargain.Not only did slavery not end. For many thousands it was dramatically worsened. The antebellum slave owner typically had a financial interest in keeping an enslaved person alive and healthy enough to work. A mine or mill that purchased the work of hundreds of convicts had no interest in their futures beyond the term of their sentences. In fact, local governments would replace a convict who died with another, so there was no economic reason not to work them to death. Mortality rates for leased-out convicts in Alabama were as high as 45 percent per year. Some who died in mines were tossed into coke ovens rather than going to the trouble to bury them.Enslaved Americans after the ""ending of slavery"" were bought and sold, chained by the ankles and necks at night, whipped to death, waterboarded, and murdered at the discretion of their owners, such as U.S. Steel Corporation which purchased mines near Birmingham where generations of ""free"" people were worked to death underground.The threat of that fate hung over every black man not enduring it, as well as the threat of lynching that escalated in the early 20th century along with newly pseudo-scientific justifications for racism. ""God ordained the southern white man to teach the lessons of Aryan  supremacy,"" declared Woodrow Wilson's friend Thomas Dixon, author of the book and play The Clansman, which became the film Birth of a Nation.Five days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government decided to take prosecuting slavery seriously, to counter possible criticism from Germany or Japan.Five years after World War II, a group of former Nazis, some of whom had used slave labor in caves in Germany, set up shop in Alabama to work on creating new instruments of death and space travel. They found the people of Alabama extremely forgiving of their past deeds.Prison labor continues in the United States. Mass incarceration continues as a tool of racial oppression. Slave farm labor continues as well. So does the use of fines and debt to create convicts. And of course, companies that swear they would never do what their earlier versions did, profit from slave labor on distant shores.But what ended mass-slavery in the United States for good was not the idiotic mass-slaughter of the civil war. It was the nonviolent educational and moral force of the civil rights movement a full century later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A4RZWBJZ84I3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385722702#wasThisHelpful","R2A4RZWBJZ84I3","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There were a lot more war abolition books in the 1920s and 1930s, and of course there was a much bigger peace movement in the 1960s than now, but I think it can safely be argued that a new trend is emerging in opposition to the institution of war, a trend possibly brought on in part by the end of the Cold War and by the 8-year reign of a Republican U.S. President (or was it Vice President?) who engaged in aggressive war with unapologetic rhetoric and extremely careless propaganda. Certainly the end of the (Bill) Clinton years was not greeted by the publication of a pile of books seeking to rid the world of war. Some of the books above are quite explicitly reactions to the George W. Bush wars, some include misguided apologies for the Barack Obama wars, some claim weapons companies can coexist with peace, some suggest that women must end the male scourge of war, some condemn capitalism as a root problem, some are religious, some focus on scientific studies. No two agree with each other on every point. They all ‚Äî certainly including mine ‚Äî have flaws.But the cumulative effect of these books is bound to be more persuasive than any one of them. They all or virtually all point to the current understanding of pre-history as a time free of war, slavery, major agriculture, cities, and other accouterments of ‚Äúcivilization,‚Äù although not, of course, free of violence or anger. All of these books recognize war and these other developments as relatively new in human existence and argue that if some can be ended (such as slavery, which few now dispute can be ended) then war can be ended too. All make the case that war since World War II has killed primarily civilians and cannot be morally defended. All make the case that war while nuclear weapons exist risks human annihilation. All argue that developments in peace studies and nonviolent action render war obsolete as a tool for political change. All point to examples of ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù and ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù cultures choosing to live without war for centuries on end. All point to examples of particular wars being prevented, and ask ‚ÄúIf that war could be stopped, why not every war?‚Äù All strive to identify some of the factors facilitating war (cultural attitudes, profiteering, corruption, propaganda, etc.) and to propose courses of action that will move us toward abolition.Roberto Vivo‚Äôs book is no exception. Its initial sections are among the best I‚Äôve read on the evitability of war, the evil of war, and the unjustness of war. The whole book is full of intriguing nuggets for further exploration of other authors, ancient Chinese philosophers, and anecdotes from centuries gone by. The third of the four sections of Vivo‚Äôs book seemed rather irrelevant to me. We read about George Soros‚Äô late-in-life discovery that self-identified ‚Äúdemocracies‚Äù use propaganda; yet we read page after page about the development and politics of democracy ‚Äî always credited ultimately to the ancient Greeks, never the Iroquois. And I think the short section in which Vivo claims that weapons industries can coexist with peace while generating economic benefits ought to address the serious arguments that the weapons industries are actually an economic drain, that restraining them is not easy, that they want their weapons tested and demonstrated, and that they want their weapons eliminated and replaced.Vivo‚Äôs final chapter looks at slavery, torture, and racism as practices that are being ended ‚Äî or at least we hope so, and I think the arguments used are good ones despite the significant comeback for torture in recent years. Vivo sees part of the solution to war as resting in criminalizing it. He‚Äôd like to transform the International Criminal Court into an independent and effective institution with the ability to prosecute what he calls ‚Äúaggressive war‚Äù and what I would call ‚Äúwar.‚Äù Vivo accurately identifies the United States government as the major force working against such application of the rule of law. But he writes about the idea of criminalizing war as if it‚Äôs never been done, and claims that the effort to prosecute the crime of starting World War I failed because it has always been believed that no single individual could be held accountable for something so enormous.But in fact roughly half the world is represented by governments that are parties to a treaty banning all war, and it was the existence of this treaty that allowed the United States to claim that war was a crime when it was committed by Germany and Japan (though, for some reason, not when it was committed by the victors of World War II). This treaty, which did not exist when World War I was launched, is called the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and I wrote about it in When the World Outlawed War. Vivo‚Äôs nation of Uruguay is not a party to the Pact, but its current president seems just the person to change that. Were Uruguay to send a letter to the U.S. State Department joining the Kellogg-Briand Pact, it would then be a party to it. That‚Äôs all that is required. Uruguay might then send a note the following week respectfully urging the United States to comply with the treaty.Of course, bringing the nations of the world together to create something like the Kellogg-Briand Pact from scratch would work just as well, but no single country could do that alone, and no group of countries could do it in this day and age without some sort of magical powers. The victors of World War II, also known as the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, think they have got a good thing going. Why would they choose to put themselves on an equal level with others and ban all war when they can maintain impunity and choose which wars are ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù and which are ‚Äúauthorized‚Äù?The secret of Kellogg-Briand is that four of the big five are already on board with banning all war and just need to be reminded of it. Wouldn‚Äôt it be wonderful if Uruguay were to play that role?Wouldn‚Äôt it be fantastic if war abolition literature were read, studied, discussed, refined, and acted on?","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N8DI7Z0UZINO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRBGBDA#wasThisHelpful","R3N8DI7Z0UZINO","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This happened some 63 years ago, but as the U.S. government has never stopped lying about it, and it's generally known only outside the United States, I'm going to treat it as news.Here in our little U.S. bubble we've heard of a couple versions of a film called The Manchurian Candidate. We've heard of the general concept of ""brainwashing"" and may even associate it with something evil that the Chinese supposedly did to U.S. prisoners during the Korean War. And I'd be willing to bet that the majority of people who've heard of these things have at least a vague sense that they're bulls***.If you didn't know, I'll break it to you right now: people cannot actually be programed like the Manchurian candidate, which was a work of fiction. There was never the slightest evidence that China or North Korea had done any such thing. And the CIA spent decades trying to do such a thing, and finally gave up.I'd also be willing to bet that very few people know what it was that the U.S. government promoted the myth of ""brainwashing"" to cover up. During the Korean War, the United States bombed virtually all of North Korea and a good bit of the South, killing millions of people. It dropped massive quantities of Napalm. It bombed dams, bridges, villages, houses. This was all-out mass-slaughter. But there was something the U.S. government didn't want known, something deemed unethical in this genocidal madness.It is well documented that the United States dropped on China and North Korea insects and feathers carrying anthrax, cholera, encephalitis, and bubonic plague. This was supposed to be a secret at the time, and the Chinese response of mass vaccinations and insect eradication probably contributed to the project's general failure (hundreds were killed, but not millions). But members of the U.S. military taken prisoner by the Chinese confessed to what they had been a part of, and confessed publicly when they got back to the United States.Some of them had felt guilty to begin with. Some had been shocked at China's decent treatment of prisoners after U.S. depictions of the Chinese as savages. For whatever reasons, they confessed, and their confessions were highly credible, were borne out by independent scientific reviews, and have stood the test of time.How to counter reports of the confessions? The answer for the CIA and the U.S. military and their allies in the corporate media was ""brainwashing,"" which conveniently explained away whatever former prisoners said as false narratives implanted in their brains by brainwashers.And 300 million of so Americans more or less sort of believe that craziest-ever dog-ate-my-homework concoction to this day!The propaganda struggle was intense. The support of the Guatemalan government for the reports of U.S. germ warfare in China were part of the U.S. motivation for overthrowing the Guatemalan government; and the same cover-up was likely part of the motivation for the CIA's murder of Frank Olson.There isn't any debate that the United States had been working on bio-weapons for years, at Fort Detrick -- then Camp Detrick -- and numerous other locations. Nor is there any question that the United States employed the top bio-weapons killers from among both the Japanese and the Nazis from the end of World War II onward. Nor is there any question that the U.S. tested such weapons on the city of San Francisco and numerous other locations around the United States, and on U.S. soldiers. There's a museum in Havana featuring evidence of years of U.S. bio-warfare against Cuba. We know that Plum Island, off the tip of Long Island, was used to test the weaponization of insects, including the ticks that created the ongoing outbreak of Lyme Disease.Dave Chaddock's book This Must Be the Place, which I found via Jeff Kaye's review, collects the evidence that the United States indeed tried to wipe out millions of Chinese and North Koreans with deadly diseases.""What does it matter now?"" I can imagine people from only one corner of the earth asking.I reply that it matters that we know the evils of war and try to stop the new ones. U.S. cluster bombs in Yemen, U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, U.S. guns in Syria, U.S. white phosphorus and Napalm and depleted uranium used in recent years, U.S. torture in prison camps, U.S. nuclear arsenals being expanded, U.S. coups empowering monsters in Ukraine and Honduras, U.S. lies about Iranian nukes, and indeed U.S. antagonization of North Korea as part of that never-yet-ended war -- all of these things can be best confronted by people aware of a centuries-long pattern of lying.And I reply, also, that it is not yet too late to apologize.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EOS68JJBN20Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934733768#wasThisHelpful","R1EOS68JJBN20Q","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't mean an infiltrator planted in a nefarious plot to throw an election. I mean a green, soil-rooted, leafy plant.I've been reading Brilliant Green: The Surprising History and Science of Plant Intelligence by Stefano Mancuso and Alessandra Viola. It is at the very least a suggestive treatise.Imagine that astronauts discover life on another planet, and that the life discovered there is very different from humans. It doesn't use our sort of language or engage in our sort of thought. Yet it senses the world with many more senses than our pathetic little five. It communicates with others of its type and other types of life on the planet. Its individuals learn quickly through experience and adjust their behavior accordingly, strategizing and planning based on experience. It lives sustainably, adapts, and thrives for periods of time that make the existence of humanity seem momentary.We might not choose to call that newly discovered life ""intelligent"" or ""thinking."" We might puff our chests out proudly, realizing that while we have arrived from afar to study it, it will never study us, at least not in a way we can recognize. But wouldn't much of our pride and excitement come from recognizing the impressive accomplishments and abilities of the novel life forms? Like a prophet outside his hometown, wouldn't those alien life forms become the focus of admiring academic disciplines?Let's come back to earth for a minute. On the earth, 99.7% of the mass of living beings is plants. All animals and insects are negligible in those terms, and also in terms of survival. If plants vanished, the rest of us would be gone in a week or two. If we vanished, plants would carry on just fine thank you. When I say ""we,"" you can imagine I mean ""mammals"" or ""animals"" because during the past several decades Western people have begun to return to believing that animals can feel and think and in other ways be like humans. A century ago non-human animals were thought to have no more awareness than plants or rocks.If life forms on another planet were mysterious to us because they moved very quickly or very slowly, we would laugh at the Hollywood movies that had always imagined that aliens must move at more or less our speed. Yet, we film plants' movements, make them recognizable by speeding up the film, and go right on supposing that plants don't move.Plants detect light above the ground and move toward it, and below the ground and move away from it. Plants detect nutrients below the ground and move toward them. Plants detect other plants closely related to themselves and leave them room, or detect unrelated competitors and crowd them out. Plants persuade insects to do their bidding. Plants hunt and dine on insects, mice, and lizards above ground, and worms below. Plants warn other plants of danger by releasing chemical messages.A plant that closes its leaves up when touched by a hand, though not by wind or rain, if rolled on a cart along a bumpy road, will at first close up with each bump, but quickly learn not to bother, while still continuing to close up if touched by a person or animal.Plants see light without having eyes. Plants hear sounds as snakes and worms do, by feeling the vibrations -- there's no need for ears. Plants that are played music between 100 and 500 Hz grow larger and produce more and better seeds. Plant roots themselves produce sounds, which conceivably may help explain coordinated movements of numerous roots. Plants sense and produce smells. Plants detect the most minute presence of countless substances in soil, putting any human gourmet chef to shame. And plants reach out and touch rocks they must grow around or fence posts they must climb.Plants have at least 15 additional senses. They detect gravity, electromagnetic fields, temperature, electric field, pressure, and humidity. They can determine the direction of water and its quantity. They can identify numerous chemicals in soil or air, even at a distance of several meters. Plants can identify insect threats and release substances to attract particular insects that will prey on the undesired ones.Plants can manipulate insects into assisting them in numerous ways. And if we weren't humans, we could describe the relationship between certain food crops and flowers and other plants, on the one hand, and the humans who care for them on the other, in similar terms of plants manipulating people.In 2008, the Swiss Federal Ethics Committee on Non-Human Biotechnology recognized plants as possessing dignity and rights. Also in 2008, the Constitution of Ecuador recognized nature as a whole as possessing ""the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes.""In 2008, the United States endured what at that point amounted to a truly outrageous presidential election circus. That was then. This is now. Imagine that scientists discovered the Fox News Presidential Primary debate. Here, they might observe, are life forms that wish to destroy life, detest the females of their own species, seek out violence for its own sake, reject learned experience through the bestowing of value on ignorance and error in their own right, and generate ill will in an apparent attempt to shorten and worsen their existence. Tell me honestly, would you be more impressed and pleased to stumble upon such a thing or to walk into a garden?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OUI7A4XKWYSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610916034#wasThisHelpful","R3OUI7A4XKWYSZ","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If Jesus lived in Galilee in recent decades he would live in a world alive with Palestinian traditions clinging to a long-rooted history but struggling through the aftermath of the never-ended ethnic-cleansing operation that spiked in 1948.Hatim Kanaaneh has written a fictionalized account, Chief Complaint: A Country Doctor's Tale of Life in Galilee, based on his experiences as a village doctor during the past half-century, a doctor who traveled to the United States for his education and returned to Palestine to practice his craft. His dialogue-heavy stories reach back to before 1948, merging folklore with myth and legend, featuring in the opening vignette a larger-than-life comedic but sensitive giant as short on wits as he is strong of muscle and heart.Often in this wonderfully entertaining book a straightforward account will quickly become a rumor, a legend, an event infused with more meaning than might have been expected. After learning, for example, that multi-level homes are a sign of wealth, and that the top level is the most prestigious, we read that in one case a steep hill made it easiest to enter one home from the top floor. ""That is why Isa housed his two oxen and his donkey in the 'alali -- the penthouse -- for the first winter after it was built. . . . And, that dear reader, is how it came to be rumored in these parts that Isa had sworn a pact of brotherhood and equality with his work animals and accorded them the level of reverence reserved for the head of a family. 'If only our cousins, the Jews, would treat us that humanely!' neighbors would joke.""Chief Complaint is a bit like the accounts of the British veterinarian's tales in All Creatures Great and Small. One doctor treats non-human animals, the other human, but both treat families. A great number of Kanaaneh's patients require placebos and other psychological rather than medical assistance. Gradually one begins to gather that the lot of them, who form a tight community, are to various degrees traumatized. They are in love with land, with the agriculture of that land, with the history of that land. And the land has been stolen, is being stolen, and is being desecrated. This is a more intimate portrait of people than one would be likely to gain on a trip to Palestine/Israel, and the unifying theme at the bottom of their ailments seems to be land loss. A character is describing a wedding of the past:""Groups of men and women from all the other clans in the village would arrive every night, singing on their way over just after sundown and with many bagfuls of coffee beans, rice, sugar, and bulgur wheat as presents. Or they would have a boy dragging a lamb or a goat ahead of them. And the women would bring bundles of wood on their heads for the fire, which was lit up every night and around which the group dance and songfest were held. There is nothing like it today; since Israel occupied the Galilee, people bear only ill will and jealousy toward each other.""The narrator asks his father to sell beloved land in order to send him to the U.S. for medical school. His father throws a shoe at him. He picks up the shoe and returns it. It is thrown again. He repeats this until his sister speaks to his father who finally laughs and agrees, hopelessly, despairingly perhaps, but understanding the need to proceed.People have been modernized out of their land, overwhelmed by Western military technology and organization. But those people are more than catching up in the area of communication ‚Äî assuming that is that anyone in the West still reads.##Disclaimer: The author does work for the publisher of this book, but that work does not include book reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1XMTE2SUQTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935982346#wasThisHelpful","R2V1XMTE2SUQTO","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alice Walker explains this line, ""Though war speaks every language it never knows what to say to frogs"" in the opening of her beautiful book, Why War Is Never a Good Idea, illustrated by Stefano Vitale, thus:War speaks every language she says, because every nation has war. But of course this isn't true. Many nations that make war on others do not have war at home, not in remotely the way the nations have it where wars are fought. Anyone in the United States knows that a global war aggressor suffers, but also knows that the wars are not here, and that the difference is one of night and day. Many nations also do not make war, nearby or far off. Some nations, Costa Rica, Iceland, and lots of little nations, have no military, no war plans, no investment in future wars, and no wars. And this is why it matters that War Is Never a Good Idea, because good ideas exist as available alternatives.The frogs, Walker explains very accurately as being among the respresentatives in her book of the creatures who play no role in creating war, have no understanding of war, and suffer from war, directly from its violence, and indirectly from its impact on climate change and the natural environment.Walker's personification of war as a being that knows and thinks and does things for its own purposes is also, strictly speaking, perfectly accurate, as well as powerfully provocative. Just as a ""selfish gene"" can be understood as aiming for the well-being of the gene rather than the organism, war does not benefit its participants, its victims, its observers, or for the most part its creators, supporters, cheerleaders, or tolerators. War does not generate happiness, prosperity, fulfillment, wisdom, beauty, or sustainability. War generates more war. In the absence of war it would be quite easy to persuade enough people to nip in the bud any notion of creating it. In the presence of war, the willful delusion that war is inevitable is quite pervasive.""Though war is old, it has not become wise. It will not hesitate to destroy things that do not belong to it, things very much older than itself.""There is wisdom in that line. Not only have various nations set war aside for decades or centuries, and in some cases brought it back again, but most human cultures for most of human existence never knew war at all. It is newer than most every adaptation of human evolution, and we are unable to adapt to it, and should we do so it would destroy us.""Here war is munching on a village. Its missiles taking chunks, big bites out of it. War's leftover gunk seeps like saliva into the ground. It is finding its way into the village well.""Stop drinking the water.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S8RIMLD2UHFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060753854#wasThisHelpful","R3S8RIMLD2UHFZ","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The U.S. Senate has been very concerned not to let peace with Iran slip into place too easily, even while a new war in Iraq and Syria proceeds without the formal pretense of Congress ""authorizing"" or rejecting it.Both houses of Congress are interested in ramming through the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) on a fast track. The fast track procedure of rushing things through Congress or creating them without Congress seems to be reserved for the least popular ideas our government produces.What if, instead, a fast track were set up for those items favored by a vast majority of the public, or required for the future habitability of the planet, but which meet resistance from campaign funders, lobbyists, and the corporate media?Of course I'd rather have clean elections and a publicly accountable Congress if we can't have public initiatives and direct democracy. But in the absence of such utopias, why not use extreme anti-democratic measures to ram through the things people want rather than the things we'd protest if we found out about them? Why not slip one past the plutocrats rather than slipping one past the people? Why not go with voice votes, no debate, and no time to read the details on measures to demilitarize and protect the planet rather than on ""trade"" agreements that empower corporate lawyers to overturn laws?I recently read this in an email newsletter from peace advocate Michael Nagler: ""The other day I went to test-drive an electric car. When we got through some of the technicalities and were waiting for a red light the salesperson coming with me said, 'So what do you do?' Here it comes, I thought: 'I work with a nonprofit; (gulp, and) we're promoting nonviolence.' After a reflective pause she said quietly, 'Thank you.'""I've often had that same experience, but increasingly I eagerly reply: ""I work on abolishing war."" That's what I replied recently in a sandwich shop here in Charlottesville called Baggby's. I didn't get a ""thank you,"" but I got a question as to whether I had known Jack Kidd. I had never heard of Jack Kidd, but Jack Kidd, a retired two-star Air Force general who lived in Charlottesville, had been in Baggby's in the past debating the need to abolish war with some other bigwig general who favored keeping war and militarism going.So, I read Kidd's book, Prevent War: A New Strategy for America. Of course, I think we need a strategy for earth, not for the United States, if we are going to end war. Kidd, who died in 2013, believed in 2000, when the book was published, that only the United States could lead the way toward peace, that the United States had always meant well, that war could be used to end war, and all sorts of things I can't bring myself to take seriously. And yet, believing everything he still believed, after ""waking up"" in the early 1980s, as he describes it, Kidd came to recognize the insanity of failing to work for the abolition of war.This was a man who had bombed German cities in World War II; who believed he'd survived a particularly difficult mission during which he'd shot down lots of German planes, because he'd prayed to God who'd answered his prayer; who'd flown secret nuclear attack plans from Washington to Korea during the Korean war; who'd ""served"" as Chief of the Joint War Plans Branch and worked on plans for World War III; who believed in the Gulf of Tonkin attack; who had obeyed orders to knowingly fly his plane through nuclear clouds moments after bomb tests -- as self-human experimentation; and yet . . . and yet! And yet Jack Kidd organized retired U.S. and Soviet generals to work for disarmament at the height of the Cold War.Kidd's book contains numerous proposals to move us away from war. One of them is to fast track disarmament agreements. For that idea alone, his book is worth reading. It's also worth giving to the most hard-core war supporters as a sort of a gentle nudge. It's also worth asking, I think, why Charlottesville has no memorial to this former General who's layed out a plan for peace when it has so many to those whose only accomplishment was losing the U.S. Civil War.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LBFYDIK4GSC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0967578604#wasThisHelpful","R2LBFYDIK4GSC4","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On October 29, 1948, the Israeli terrorist group Irgun ethnically cleansed the village of Safsaf in Palestine, lining some 70 men up, shooting them, dumping them in a ditch, and raping three girls. Among the survivors who fled to Lebanon were the grandparents of a young woman in Chicago who has a talent for telling stories in pictures and words. Safsaf was called Safsofa by the Romans and can be found as Safsufa on the iNakba app on your NSA-tracking device.Baddawi is two things. It's the name of a refugee camp in Lebanon where this young woman's father grew up. The name comes from the word Bedouin, meaning nomad. ""Al Beddaoui, Lebanon"" locates it on Google-Earth. The residents have been there since 1948 or since they were born, and they are not nomads by choice. They live in a permament state of desiring to return home forever, even those who have never been home ever.Justice for Palestine is where little sparks of opposition to war can be found among young people in the militarized United States of 2015, and where their art can be found as well.The second thing that Baddawi is, is a book that tells a story of childhood in Baddawi for Ahmad, the father of the author and artist Leila Abdelrazaq.I've just read Baddawi and passed it along to my son. It's a book that tells a personal story that is also a cultural and historical record. This is the unique story of one boy, but in great measure the story of millions of Palestinian refugees. Ahmad's experiences growing up are often identical to my own or my son's, but often dramatically different. He plays the games and learns the lessons of children everywhere, but confronts the struggles of poverty, of war, and of discrimination -- of second-class citizenship in the land where Israel and its Western backers swept his unwanted ancestors.Baddawi is the story of a rather remarkable boy, but a story that conveys a sense of what life was like and is like still for a great many boys and girls who live without nationality, not as a result of choosing world citizenship but by mandate of global powers who find their existence inconvenient. And yet the story is quite straightforwardly entertaining and good-spirited. One is disappointed when it ends rather abruptly, yet heartened to gain the impression that part two may be forthcoming.I notice, incidentally, that there will be a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on June 2nd, on Israel's mistreatment of Palestinian Children, and that you can go here to ask your Misrepresentative and Senators to attend.##Full disclosure: I sometimes do work for this book's publisher, but that work does not include reviewing books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R312BE6I8VSC3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935982400#wasThisHelpful","R312BE6I8VSC3B","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Madison's Music: On Reading the First Amendment, a new book by Burt Neuborne, at first appears an unlikely work to serve much purpose today. Who wants to celebrate slave owner James Madison's view of freedom as embodied in a long outdated Constitution in desperate need of updating or rewriting? And who wants to hear it from a former legal director of the ACLU who just signed a petition supporting the hiring of Harold Koh, defender of drone murders and presidential wars of aggression, to teach human rights law at New York University, a petition by a bunch of stuffy corrupted professors countering the moral stand being taken by students?But Neuborne's main thesis is not the worship of James Madison, and he merely suffers the same blindness to war as the rest of his society, believing, as he writes, that the world is ""dependent on the anchor of American power"" (whether the world wants it or not). While legalizing murder may not be a problem for Neuborne's view of the Constitution, legalizing bribery is. And that's where Madison's Music becomes useful. Each time the U.S. Supreme Court rules in favor of plutocracy it is ruling against precedents, common sense, basic decency, and a coherent and plausible reading of the Bill of Rights that reads the various amendments as aimed at strengthening democracy.It's also ruling against a Constitution that nowhere gave it, the Supreme Court, any right to rule on any such things. While there is, sadly, no way to read the Supreme Court out of the Constitution, it can be quite easily understood as subject to the laws of Congress rather than vice versa. Not that today's Congress gets us any closer to democracy than does today's Supreme Court, but when our culture is ready for reform, the paths available will be numerous and each and every institution subject to reform or abolition.The first amendment reads: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or of the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""Neuborne, to his credit, does not choose to read this as the ACLU does, namely as including a defense of bribery and private election spending.Madison's original draft, severely edited by the Senate -- one of those institutions worthy of abolition, and one for which Madison himself was in part to blame -- began with protection of both religious and secular conscience. The final draft begins by forbidding the government from imposing religion, and then forbids it from prohibiting anyone's religion. The point is to establish, in an eighteenth century manner, the freedom of thought. From thought, one moves on to speech, and from ordinary speech one moves on to the press. Each of these is guaranteed freedom. Beyond speech and press, the trajectory of an idea in a democracy proceeds to mass action: the right to assemble; and beyond that there remains the right to petition the government.As Neuborne points out, the first amendment depicts a functioning democracy; it doesn't simply list unrelated rights. Nor is freedom of speech the only real right it lists, with the other rights being simply particular instances of it. Rather, freedom of thought and press and assembly and petition are unique rights with their own purposes. But none of them are ends in themselves. The purpose of the whole array of rights is to shape a government and a society in which popular thought (at one time of wealthy white males, later expanded) has at least some significant impact on public policy. Currently, of course, it does not, and Neuborne puts much of the blame for that on the Supreme Court's choices over the centuries, well meaning and otherwise, in how to read the first amendment.As Neuborne suggests, the right to petition the government has been neglected. Nothing goes to a vote in the House of so-called Representatives unless approved by the majority party leader. Forty-one senators representing a tiny sliver of the population can stop almost any bill in the Senate. A democratic understanding of the right of petition might allow the public to compel votes in Congress on matters of public interest. In fact, I think this understanding would not be a new one. Jefferson's Manual, which is part of the rules of the House, allows for petitions and memorials, which are often submitted to Congress by local and state governments and groups. And at least in the case of impeachment proceedings, it lists a petition and memorial (written statement of facts accompanying the petition) as one of the means of initiating impeachment proceedings. I know because thousands of us collected millions of signatures on petitions to begin the impeachment of President George W. Bush, the desirability of which also reached a majority in public opinion polls despite zero action or discussion in Washington. The public was unable to even compel a vote. Our grievances were not redressed.The right of assembly has been confined in free-speech cages, the right of free press has been corporate-monopolized, and the right of free speech has been shriveled away in the right places and expanded in the wrong places.I'm not convinced by those who argue against all limits on speech. Speech is, appropriately enough, not considered free when it comes to threats, blackmail, extortion, false statements causing harm, obscenity, ""fighting words,"" commercial speech urging illegal action, or egregiously false and misleading commercial speech. Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the United States is a party, ""any propaganda for war"" must be prohibited, a standard which, if enforced, would eliminate a big chunk of U.S. television viewing.So, we must choose where to allow speech and where not to, and as Neuborne documents, this is currently done with zero respect for logic. Spending money to elect a plutocratic-friendly candidate is considered ""pure speech,"" deserving of the highest protection, but contributing money to that candidate's campaign is ""indirect speech,"" deserving of a bit less protection and therefore subject to limits. Meanwhile burning a draft card is merely ""communicative conduct"" and when a voter writes in a name as a protest vote that gets no protection at all and can be banned. The Supremes do not allow judges to hear cases in which one litigant is a major benefactor of the judge, yet allow elected officials to govern people who buy them their seats. Corporations get first amendment rights despite lacking the human dignity to qualify for the fifth amendment's right to remain silent; are we supposed to pretend corporations are human or not? The Court upheld an Indiana voter ID requirement despite understanding that it would disproportionately harm the poor and despite not a single case of voter fraud being found anywhere in Indiana. If the right to outspend anyone else and effectively buy a candidate an election is the highest form of protected speech, why is the right to vote the lowest? Why are long lines to vote in poor neighborhoods allowed? Why can districts be gerrymandered to guarantee election of a candidate or party? Why can a criminal conviction strip away the right to vote? Why can elections be designed to benefit a two-party duopoly rather than the voters?Neuborne writes that, ""the robust third-party culture of the nineteenth century rested on ease of ballot access and the ability to cross-endorse. The Supreme Court has wiped out both, leaving a Republicrat cartel that stifles new ideas that might threaten the status quo.""Neuborne suggests many of the usual, and very good, solutions: creating free media on our air waves, providing tax credits to effectively give every person money to spend on elections, matching small donations as New York City does, creating automatic registration as Oregon just did, creating an election day holiday. Neuborne proposes a duty to vote, allowing an opt-out -- I'd rather add an option to vote for ""none of the above."" But the real solution is a popular movement that compels one or more branches of our government to view its purpose as supporting democracy, not just bombing other countries in its name.Which brings us to the primary thing our government does, which even its detractors among law professors approve, namely war. To his credit, Neuborne favors the right to conscientious objection, as well as the free-speech right of groups or individuals to teach nonviolent action techniques to groups labeled ""terrorist."" Yet he supports hiring as a teacher of so-called human rights law a man who used his law background to tell Congress it had no war powers, to legitimate a brutal and blatantly illegal attack on Libya that has left behind a possibly permanent catastrophe from which helpless people are fleeing by boat, and to sanction the practice of murdering men, women, and children in large numbers by missile from drone.I would love to see the explanation from Professor Neuborne as to how it can be the government's right to murder him (and anyone near him) with a hellfire missile, while it is simultaneously his right to be secure in his person against unreasonable search and seizure, his right not to be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, his right to a speedy and public trial, his right to be informed of the accusation and to be confronted by the witnesses, his right to subpoena witnesses, his right to a trial by jury, and his right not to suffer cruel or unusual punishment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KAYVY7C9JW16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620970414#wasThisHelpful","R2KAYVY7C9JW16","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"U.S. drone ""pilots"" refer to people they burn to death in places like Pakistan as ""bug splat"" because they look like bugs being squished to death on the pilots' video monitors and because it's easier to murder bugs than humans.Hence the need for the brilliant artwork made visible to a drone (http://notabugsplat.com).The human brain is a funny thing. Numerous human brains know that every human is a human, yet insist that various types of humans must be ""humanized"" before they can be recognized as humans. That is, even though you know someone must have a name and loved ones and favorite games and certain weaknesses and a couple of quirks that friends find endearing -- because each and every Homo sapiens does have such things -- you insist on being told what the details are, and only then readily admit that in fact this particular human is a human (and millions of others remain in doubt).A drone killer must know that children have eyes and noses and mouths, hair and fingers. But this artwork presents it to the troubled brain of the humanization dependent observer.And what if you want to know more about the humans inhabiting Pakistan? More than just a face in a photograph?I recommend reading The Upstairs Wife: An Intimate History of Pakistan by Rafia Zakaria. Rafia grew up in Pakistan and moved to the United States. She can tell you intimate details about life in Pakistan from a perspective you recognize.Central to her story of migration and cultural change and political transformation is the life of her aunt whose husband chose to marry a second wife and move his first wife to the upstairs of the house. The status of women and of religion is put into sharp relief by this sorrowful account of deep personal injury and humiliation.Yes, this is another case of religion serving to worsen people's lives in ways that possibly used to make sense but have been dragged forward into the present only by the resistance of religion to rational change.No, this is not a revelation that Pakistanis hate Americans because their religion tells them to. People who hate the U.S. government tend to object to the destruction and killing of the U.S. military.And no, your religion, whatever it is, is not better than someone else's. The problem is not the flavor of the religion, but the utilization of magical rules in guiding people's lives -- that is to say, adherence to rules that on their merits would be abandoned but that are maintained because the great Whatchamacallit decreed so in the Holy Days of Whichamawhoochee.At least that's one of many impressions I take away from the book. You may have others. It's not a sad or contemptuous story but an enjoyable and educational one. And it's complex enough to render useless any generalization about what ""the Pakistanis"" do or think at all. The people of Pakistan have many backgrounds and all sorts of unique outlooks and circumstances. They are, in fact, a lot like you, me, your neighbor, your uncle, and the woman who works in the grocery store -- just with a smaller military than ours killing people in their names.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30XAN7WSHXKFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807003360#wasThisHelpful","R30XAN7WSHXKFY","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why did the peace movement grow large around 2003-2006 and shrink around 2008-2010? Military spending, troop levels abroad, and number of wars engaged in can explain the growth but not the shrinkage. Those factors hardly changed between the high point and the low point of peace activism.Was pulling troops out of Iraq and sending them in huge numbers into Afghanistan a move the public favored? There's not much evidence for the second half of that, and it was never a demand of the peace movement at its height. Did the wars become more legal, more honest, more internationally accepted? Hardly. The United States escalated in Afghanistan and remained in Iraq as other nations ended their minor roles in those wars. The U.S. president began taking drone wars into a number of other countries with no domestic or international authorization at all, as he would later do with Libya, and then back into Iraq again (which Congress is considering possibly deliberating on whether to debate retroactively ""authorizing"").The earlier period saw obvious lies about weapons in Iraq. The latter saw obvious lies about ""success"" in Iraq and imminent ""success"" in Afghanistan, not to mention the precision nature of drone ""strikes,"" followed by lies about threats to civilians in Libya, chemical attacks in Syria, Russian invasions in Ukraine, and existential danger from ISIS and Russia.Was the difference a matter of sheer exhaustion, then? Peace activists could perhaps only keep going for so long? Actually, no, activists moved to other issues more than they dropped out, and those who dropped out disproportionately had something in common: loyalty to the Democratic Party. I don't know this because I've chatted with a few people unscientifically selected as most likely to agree with whatever I say. I know it because I've just read a new book called Party in the Street: The Antiwar Movement and the Democratic Party after 9/11 by Michael T. Heaney and Fabio Rojas who have spent years studying this question using careful surveys of large numbers of activists. Their book begins with 93 pages of scholarly theoretical framework before getting to the data. You want careful examination of the influence of partisanship on activism? This is it.""The 2006 elections and their immediate aftermath were the high point for party-movement synergy,"" write Heaney and Rojas. ""At exactly the time when antiwar voices were most well poised to exert pressure on Congress, movement leaders stopped sponsoring lobby days. The size of antiwar protests declined. From 2007 to 2009, the largest antiwar rallies shrank from hundreds of thousands of people to thousands, and then to only hundreds.""What explains this?  ""Our explanation centers on the shifting partisan alignments favoring the Democratic Party. We observe demobilization not in response to a policy victory, but in response to a party victory. The rising power of the Democratic Party may have convinced many antiwar activists that the war issue would be dealt with satisfactorily.""Is that what happened? The authors, in fact, have found strong evidence for these conclusions:  ""Partisan identification tends to be stronger and longer-lasting than movement identification.""  ""While the Democratic Party was able to leverage antiwar sentiments effectively in promoting its own electoral success, the antiwar movement itself ultimately suffered organizationally from its ties to the Democratic Party.""  ""[T]he parties agree more on the substance of policy than their political rhetoric suggests.""  ""Overall, the findings offer strong support for the partisan identification theory as a way of understanding the mobilization of grassroots activists. Partisan identification fueled the growth of the antiwar movement during the Bush years but then trimmed the grass roots in the Obama era.""  ""Antiwar leaders crafted partisan frames to help get people into the streets. UFPJ's use of the slogan 'The World Says No to the Bush Agenda,' for the protest outside the 2004 Republican National Convention is a classic example of this strategy in operation.""  ""The bad news for the antiwar movement was that activists were more likely to favor their Democratic identities over their antiwar identities. Especially once Obama became president, there were too many good reasons to be a Democrat. The country had its first African American in the Oval Office, an important symbolic outcome after centuries of struggle for racial equality. The Democratic majority in Washington ‚Äì which was nearly a supermajority ‚Äì meant that comprehensive health care reform would stand a real chance for the first time in fifteen years. Thus, many former antiwar activists shifted their attention to other issues on the progressive agenda.""Heaney and Rojas and their surveys were features of antiwar events for years. Here are hypotheses they tested and found support for:  ""h4.1. Partisan frames were more effective in drawing participants to the antiwar movement the greater the unity of Republican control in Washington, D.C. Partisan frames were less effective in drawing participants to the antiwar movement the greater the unity of Democratic control in Washington, D.C.  ""h4.2. The participation of self-identified Democrats in the antiwar movement was more likely to be motivated by partisan frames than was participation of non-Democrats in the antiwar movement.  ""h4.3. Self-identified Democrats were more likely to reduce their participation in the antiwar movement over time than were non-Democrats.""  ""h4.4. The more salient an individual's identification with social movements, the more likely that she or he maintained participation in the antiwar movement over time.  ""h4.5. The more salient an individual's identification with the Democratic Party, the less likely she or he was to participate in the antiwar movement at all.  ""h4.6 In cases of conflict, individuals participating in the antiwar movement were more likely to maintain their party loyalties than their movement loyalties.  ""h4.7. Self-identified Democratic activists were more likely than non-Democrats to view wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as being managed well by the Obama administration.  ""h4.8. After the election of President Obama, self-identified Democrats were more likely to shift their attention to nonwar issues than were non-Democrats.""Heaney and Rojas fend off some likely straw men:  ""We do not claim that partisanship entirely explains the decline of the antiwar movement,"" they write. ""There is no doubt that a long list of factors played a role. Activists were frustrated by a lack of policy success, meager resources, intramovement conflicts, and more. Many activists burned out from too many years of traveling to protests. Yet our analysis validates a very important role for partisanship in the decline. If partisan identities were not a contributing factor to the movement's decline, then we would not have observed differences between Democrats and non-Democrats in their behavior vis-√†-vis the movement.""Now to quibbling. Heaney and Rojas, I think, fail to place the decisions that doomed the anti-Republican war movement quite early enough or to adequately distinguish the extent to which partisan organizations engaged in purely anti-Republican war activism even during the height of the movement. ""[M]any of UFPJ's members no longer wanted to focus on antiwar opposition once a Democrat was in the White House,"" they write. In fact, I remember the big drop-off (whether driven by popular interest or funders or executive decisions) coming in 2007 as Democrats took more interest in electing a president than in opposing wars or building peace.""While MoveOn formally continued to hold antiwar positions after Obama's election,"" write Heaney and Rojas, ""it threw its weight behind health care organizing, rather than antiwar mobilizations."" They add: ""Neither MoveOn nor its members suddenly became 'prowar' in 2009. Instead, their issue priorities shifted with the rise of a new administration. With so many of its members identified with the Democratic Party, it was unlikely that MoveOn would maintain an agenda that was counter to the party's trajectory. Democratic identities outweighed antiwar identities within MoveOn, so, one of the leading players of the antiwar movement from 2003 to 2008 moved on to a different agenda.""But in fact, well before 2008, MoveOn was organizing antiwar events in the districts of prowar Republicans and not in the districts of prowar Democrats. In March 2007, shortly after the Democrats took power in Congress I wrote this analysis of MoveOn's refusal to lobby for peace as it had in years gone by:""The Congress that was elected to end the war just voted to fund the war. Congresswoman Barbara Lee was not permitted to offer for a vote her amendment, which would have funded a withdrawal instead of the war. Groups that supported Lee's plan and opposed Pelosi's included United for Peace and Justice, Progressive Democrats of America, US Labor Against the War, After Downing Street, Democrats.com, Peace Action, Code Pink, Democracy Rising, True Majority, Gold Star Families for Peace, Military Families Speak Out, Backbone Campaign, Iraq Veterans Against the War, Voters for Peace, Veterans for Peace, the Green Party, and disgruntled former members of MoveOn.org.""True Majority was a late addition to the list. The organization polled its members. Did they favor the Pelosi bill to fund the war but include various toothless restrictions on it, or did they favor the Lee plan to use the power of the purse to end the war by the end of the year? Needless to say, True Majority's membership favored the Lee plan.""MoveOn polled its membership without including the Lee alternative, offering a choice of only Pelosi's plan or nothing. Amazingly, Eli Pariser of MoveOn has admitted that the reason MoveOn did this was because they knew that their members would favor the Lee amendment.""Heaney and Rojas, however, emphasize popular will as the decisive factor:  ""Did the movement decline because individual antiwar activists stopped showing up at public demonstrations? Or was the absence of organizational leadership the culprit? Our evidence suggests that the declining magnitude of antiwar protests during the 2007‚Äì2008 period was in large part, if not entirely, due to decreased interest among individual activists. If anything, the major organizations and coalitions intensified their mobilization efforts in 2007‚Äì2008, reflecting their access to financial and human resources accumulated over the past few years. The institutionalized movement persisted in its opposition in 2007‚Äì2008, even in the face of declining interest among its mass constituency. Still, decisions by organizational leaders had a greater hand in the movement's decline in 2009‚Äì2010 than they had in the earlier period.""I'm not convinced. I have no doubt that public sentiment, and in particular political partisanship, was hugely important. But organizations that have been corrupted by closeness to power don't advertise their shifts in position. They ""poll"" their members and declare themselves ""member-run."" The most common comment on antiwar conference calls in 2008 was ""People are too busy with the election."" Were they? Some were, some weren't. The question wasn't really tested. The most common comment on antiwar conference calls in 2009 was ""It's too early to be seen as protesting Obama."" Was it? That wasn't tested either, but it seems easier to answer in retrospect. We're more ready to say that in fact we shouldn't have hacked our own legs off at the knees and transformed into a collective Nobel Committee handing out magical prizes. We should have demanded peace if we thought it likely, and we should have demanded peace if we thought it unlikely. In fact, Obama supporters frequently quoted him telling us to go out there and make him do it, even while advocating against going out there and making him do it. The fact that we'd already gone relatively silent in 2007-2008 tends to get forgotten.Heaney and Rojas deal in actual views of numerous actual people. So there are no imaginary master plots of deception involved. The idea is not that everyone who turned out to march in February 2003 was actually indifferent to war but using the war as an excuse to protest Bush. Rather, protesting both war and Bush were desirable to many. Then, Heaney and Rojas, argue, protesting war became less important than demanding healthcare.I think a couple of points are worth adding some emphasis on, however, that may darken the picture slightly. When the Democrats took Congress in 2006 and the White House in 2008, it became necessary in protesting war to protest Democrats. That, in fact, was a worse fate in a lot of people's minds than accepting war. Democratic politicians do not typically try to be antiwar. They just work to be seen as less pro-war than Republicans (although many exceptions don't even do that). In addition, Democratic politicians pretend to favor things when they are out of power. In 2005 and early 2006, numerous Democrats in Congress were making commitments to end the war in Iraq. But by 2007, with the majority and the chairmanships in the House, 81 Representatives felt obliged to sign a letter committing to not fund more war just prior to, almost all of them, voting to fund more war. The activists who let them get away with that before moving onto healthcare were organized by groups that took direction from those very Democrats. They were forbidden to have signs reading ""Single Payer"" at their rallies or to advocate for anything not already in the legislation. It was a completely inverted relationship with public servants telling constituents what to demand of them. And now, with the Democrats back in the minority, they're starting to make noises about favoring progressive taxation and all sorts of things they stayed away from while in the majority.Is all of this inevitable? I'm afraid the scholarly apparatus of scientistic studies tends to suggest it. Here are Heaney and Rojas: ""The greater the size of the party in the street, the more likely a movement is to evolve toward using institutionally based political tactics. The smaller the size of the party in the street, the less likely a movement is to evolve toward using institutionally based political tactics."" In other words, if you start to build numbers of people involved, they will move into lobbying and electioneering rather than nonviolent resistance or creative communication. Given that inevitability, the one thing that might seem unnecessary would be urging movements to make that turn voluntarily. Yet Heaney and Rojas have this advice for Occupy:  ""A first step for the Occupy movement might be to recognize that many of its supporters and potential supporters identify with the Democratic Party. By taking such a strong stand against the Democratic Party, Occupy cuts itself off from a key part of its support base. Instead, the movement might look for ways to recognize and incorporate the intersectional identity of 'Occupy Democrats.' A second step might be to inaugurate some institutional structures within Occupy. These structures might help to raise funds, employ staff, and regularize communication with Occupy supporters. While this suggestion is somewhat counter to the nonhierarchical ethos of Occupy, some minimal level of organization may be necessary to make any systematic progress toward the movement's long-term policy goals. A third step might be to forge alliances with genuine allies in the progressive community. While it may be that alliances with the Democrats and MoveOn are untenable, perhaps Occupy could partner with the Green Party and other political organizations whose agendas are not incommensurate with Occupy's vision.""Weighing against that advice is evidence in this very book that a mere generation back the laws of movement politics were different:  ""Public opinion was polarized according to party to a much greater degree during the 2000s than was the case during the Vietnam War era (Hetherington 2009, p. 442). Polarization was highly consequential in the formation of public opinion on the war. As Gary Jacobson (2010, p. 31) notes, 'the Iraq war has divided the American public along party lines far more than any other US military action since the advent of scientific polling back in the 1930s.' Americans often took their cues about how to make sense of developments in Iraq from their partisan identifications (Gelpi 2010). We argue that, as a result, the rhythms of the antiwar movement after 9/11 were driven by partisanship much more than was the case during the Vietnam antiwar movement.""Now, I am not proposing that we can turn back time. I have enough respect for laws of physics to discount that alternative. Heaney and Rojas cite the youth of the Vietnam-era movement as one possible factor weighing against partisanship. Clearly a draft is not the only possible way to involve youth in a movement. The contrast between war making nations with student debt and peaceful nations with free education is one possible lever. Another is education in exactly the field Heaney and Rojas have mastered. Surely if everyone in the country read this book its conclusions would be thereby rendered wildly wrong -- and in a good way. If people recognize that their partisanship is hurting the causes they support, they will surely begin to question in. I'd like to see research similar to Party in the Street but focused on those who move away from partisanship: what enables them to do that?","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZHKEA21EF4UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1107085403#wasThisHelpful","R1ZHKEA21EF4UY","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nan Levinson's new book is called War Is Not a Game: The New Antiwar Soldiers and the Movement They Built, but it left me wishing there were a ""Where Are They Now"" chapter, because it ends around 2008. The book is focused on Iraq Veterans Against the War, but includes Veterans For Peace, Military Families Speak Out, Cindy Sheehan, and others. It's a story that has been told many times during the past several years, but this version seems particularly well done; perhaps the distance helps.Of course I've met many of the characters in person and been at many of the events, in addition to reading many of the accounts. Nonetheless, I learned new things I'd never known and saw them summarized in new ways. And yet I continue to be convinced that everyone, including Levinson, has some basic elements wrong.She writes that the veterans ""brought to the antiwar movement a moral authority no other group could equal,"" and that IVAW and the rest of the peace movement failed to stop any wars, something she says peace movements seldom succeed at. She also seems to overestimate what IVAW brought to the movement and to exaggerate its demise.Let's start with the question of moral authority. I recently wrote an article comparing the movement against U.S. wars to the movement in the U.S. against Israel's war on Palestine. The latter, I realized, faces stiff opposition and charges of anti-Semitism but not charges of treason. Its setting in the United States and its distance from Israeli society perhaps combine to produce a movement that I've never heard swear its allegiance to ""support"" of Israeli troops. I've heard cheers for refuseniks, but not for Israeli veterans. A general's son who speaks against the occupation benefits from his pedigree, but never does he preface his remarks with a commitment to ""supporting"" the Israeli troops.A movement against U.S. wars in the U.S. is of course very different in this regard, often proclaiming slogans like ""Support the Troops, Bring Them Home."" So any troop, and any former troop, including those opposing a war, is given a certain authority from the fact that we are all supposed to ""support"" them. And any veteran who has been in a war has the actual experiential authority to tell others what he or she saw there. That authority is an invaluable contribution to the peace movement. So is the youth that IVAW has brought into a movement that is disproportionately old. So is the passion that comes with youth or veteranness or some combination of factors. But moral authority?Levinson tells the story of a former sniper who I know now to be an admirable and dedicated peace activist, and who some have cited as a ""real hero"" in contrast to the sadist depicted in the film American Sniper, but in telling his story of outspoken opposition to the war, which included blogging against it while on active duty, Levinson quotes him saying ""I never once slacked in my duty. Even when it resulted in killing innocent civilians, I still went out of the gate every single day and did my job to the best of my ability."" This leaves morality in a bit of a jumble, to say the least. And it can leave activism in the same state. Is demanding better armor for troops in war as good a strategy as demanding that they be brought home, even if it results in higher military funding? There is no reason to suppose that someone who has always opposed war has more moral authority than someone who has turned against it. But during the process of turning against it, the morality of the values in competition seems questionable and at least worthy of some explanation that Levinson does not offer.IVAW's core demands have in fact been absolutely right on: bring the troops home, give them the benefits they were promised, and see that Iraq is rebuilt and returned to its people. Those, however, are also the goals of the wider peace movement.What about success or failure in ending wars? There too is a topic at least worthy of debate. By the time Levinson finishes her narrative, but unmentioned by her, Presidents Bush and Maliki had signed a treaty requiring that the U.S. war on Iraq end in three years. When those three years ran out, and President Obama was unable to get Iraqi agreement to criminal immunity for U.S. troops remaining longer, the war did indeed briefly end. Iraq remained a hell on earth, of course, and at the first opportunity Obama sent troops back in. But he did so on a smaller scale, against greater skepticism, and with less expectation of being able to drag the war on or escalate it.  Heightening the public resistance is the fact that in 2013, a year before Obama managed to restart the war, and two years after he'd been forced to end it, his proposal to send missiles into Syria -- a full-scale war according to the plans unearthed by Seymour Hersh -- had died stillborn. Public opposition, built up over a decade of activism, was key to rejecting a new war, as Congress members were heard expressing their fear of being ""the guy who voted for another Iraq."" If having voted for Iraq were a badge of honor, the Syria debate would have looked radically different. Having voted for Iraq became a badge of shame, not simply due to immutable facts, but due to intense activism and education -- which has been slacking off as retroactive support for that god-awful war has been inching back upward.The fact is that IVAW and every other group and person named in this book has done and is doing a great deal of good. But IVAW didn't give birth to or transform the peace movement, or scale it back so dramatically just at the time that IVAW was, in Levinson's view, reaching its zenith. Blind partisanship and monarchism did those things. It was a movement against George W. Bush's wars that shriveled away as a movement against Barack Obama's wars. There was nothing IVAW could have done about either development. But it added wonderfully to the movement that was, and is adding remarkably to the movement that is today.It's not unusual for me to direct veterans to IVAW or VFP, as most seem never to have heard of such groups.  Their work is as badly needed now as ever.  But of course it needs to be directed against every war, and even more so against the machinery of war. Levinson remarks on the period during which a quarter of a million dollars a minute was being dumped into the war on Iraq. But ordinary base military spending in the United States is $1.9 million / minute, and it generates wars just as Eisenhower said it would. The drone ""pilots"" who are coming out and speaking against what they have been part of need to be part of the peace movement. Active duty troops need to know there are groups that support their resistance in whatever nonviolent form it can take.""The number of things activists who are basically in sympathy with each other can find to fight about is impressive,"" Levinson writes with even greater wisdom than I'd thought at first, as I've just finished finding points to disagree with in a valuable book. But I mean my arguments as constructive criticism and praise, and as examples of the thinking this book can stimulate. Also in the book are signs of enormous potential. Imagine if we had a communications system to consistently match that moment in which the television networks decided to cover Cindy at Bush's ranch:""'You never knew who would show up,' said [Ann] Wright, tearing up as she talked about the encampment five years later. 'In the middle of the night, we'd see headlights coming up this long, deserted road. Here would be a car full of grandmothers coming from San Diego. You'd ask why they were there and they'd say, ""We heard on the radio or on TV that Cindy's here. And we just had to be here.""'"" That encampment and everything else would not have been the same without Iraq and Afghan and other veterans. They bring wisdom, dedication, courage, and humor to the movement we need now more than ever. I look forward to seeing them this Spring in the heart of the empire.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJWNWMPKD7ICZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813571138#wasThisHelpful","RJWNWMPKD7ICZ","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In proposing that Congress Members boycott or walk out on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech to Congress, expected to push for sanctions if not war on Iran, activists are drawing on actions engaged in by college students in recent years, as they have boycotted or walked out on or disrupted speeches by Israeli soldiers and officials on U.S. campuses. Netanyahu's noodle-headed move -- oblivious, apparently, to the U.S. government's effective evolution into a term-limited monarchy -- may provide a boost to both the movement to free Palestine and the movement to prevent a war on Iran.Peace activists sometimes marvel at how young people have taken up environmentalist activism (with very little emphasis on the environmental destruction caused by militarism). Why, antiwar activists ask, don't young people get active opposing wars?Ah, but they do. They are increasingly active, organized, strategic, bold, courageous, and determined about opposing a particular war: the ongoing war that the government of Israel wages -- with U.S. funding and support -- on the people of Palestine.Nora Barrows-Friedman's new book, In Our Power: U.S. Students Organize for Justice in Palestine, tells their stories, often in their own words: What motivates them? How did they get involved? How do they view themselves in their activism? How do they relate to the non-activist world? We should all pay attention.Don't misunderstand the case. Most students, like most adults, do little or no activism. The movement to free Palestine is far from success and up against huge opposition. Movements against other wars exist, a movement against all war exists, and all of these movements overlap. But, relatively speaking, students are far more engaged, I think, in opposing the Israeli occupation than in halting drone strikes or the U.S. wars in Iraq or Afghanistan (if they're even aware that those wars haven't ended).  Opposition to U.S. wars tends to come disproportionately from an older and whiter crowd -- a result of the Vietnam era, of a less informed view of Israel, and/or of dozens of other likely factors. In Our Power doesn't address this question, but it provides much food for thought.It's not clear that most advocates of Palestinian freedom think of themselves as opposing war or demanding peace. Hoda Mitwally, a student at the City University of New York, is quoted by Barrows-Friedman as describing the movement for Palestine as ""one that amazingly has sustained itself in ways that other movements have fizzled out. The antiwar movement fizzled out very quickly, for example."" It seems that many demanding justice for Palestine think in terms of demanding human rights, even if prominent among those is the right not to have your home bombed. But human rights is how pro-war advocacy is framed in the U.S. media and politics. We must attack Syria because we care. We must destroy Libya to save the Libyans. Wrecking Yemen is a model of humanitarian warfare. Of course this is all a pack of lies, but it is a prominent pack of lies. Perhaps the movements for peace and for Palestinian justice, already intertwined, could still benefit from deeper exchanges of thinking, for war opposition must be a human rights demand, and unless a system of peace is created in Palestine/Israel, the human rights violations including those formerly known as war, will continue.The peace movement has put an emphasis on the financial cost to the aggressor nation, the damage to U.S. troops, the trade offs in poor schools and parks, etc., assuming that people need a direct connection to a moral atrocity before they'll act. I don't believe that for a minute, not as an absolute law. But the stories of Palestine activists do bear it out. Many of them have a direct connection and even personal experience on the ground, witnessing the horrors of what they oppose. They are Palestinian Americans or Jewish Americans or other Americans who have visited Israel or Palestine or who have close friends who have done so. Many of them have been moved by the recent Israeli attacks on Lebanon or Gaza (""Cast Lead"" and ""Protective Edge"") or by the relentless construction of ""settlements"" and accompanying ethnic cleansing. Many have experienced bigotry in the United States following 9-11 and have sought out a comforting community. As Osama bin Laden came to favor anti-U.S. violence after experiencing such bigotry, many young people engage in constructive nonviolent activism instead. They gather as Palestinians or Arabs, and then they take up the Palestinian cause.Beyond direct experience lies the factor of severity, or rather I think the combination is potent. Young people who become aware of mass murder and abuse and discrimination, especially after having been taught that it didn't exist, are likely to protest. Yet I suspect -- and this is pure speculation -- that another factor weighs heavily. That is the absence of the sort of U.S. government propaganda that promotes U.S. wars. The U.S. government does not market Israel's attacks on surrounding lands in the way that it markets a U.S. attack on Iraq or Libya. U.S. wars are marketed as patriotic duties, and as mad urgent crises that cannot wait for cool consideration. Once begun, they must be continued forever or one fails to ""support the troops."" Colleges notoriously turnover their student population every four years or so, and a movement that opposed a particular war as not a good civilized and acceptable war like the wars we really need has a half-life of about two years. Israel's war in contrast goes on and on and on, and while opposing it gets you accused of anti-Semitism, it does not get you accused of treason -- nor does it get you accused by remotely as many people. In fact opposing U.S. support for Israeli wars allows you to attack illegal and unacceptable foreign influence. So, while opposition to Israel's war may benefit from the war not being American, awareness of the U.S. government's role may actually help build the movement -- not just because people are reflexively patriotic but because they are rightly indignant about being forced to support a crime.In addition, Israel's war and occupation involve elements quite familiar to African Americans and other abused groups in this country -- including Latinos along the border wall -- to the extent that Freedom Rides on buses are created in Israel, and mock border walls are created in Arizona. Mock eviction notices are all too frightening in college dorms. The echoes of South African Apartheid inform the movement with technical details and inspire it with the idea of success. And the U.S. movement for Palestine is supported by a global network better organized than those against U.S. wars -- so far -- not to mention the strength of global public opinion.The movement for Palestine has somehow avoided the plague of frustration that has peace activists announcing that they will not attend a protest because they've attended them before and we don't have peace yet. Instead, the history of Palestinian activism going back nearly a century provides inspiration, lessons, and structures to bolster a movement driven by temporarily engaged young people, further inspired by their established understanding that the ""peace process"" has been a fraud. Meanwhile the antiwar movement seems cursed to believe every new wild justification for every new war until it is debunked some weeks or months later.None of this is to say that the movement for Palestine has it easy. When we passed a resolution in my town against a war on Iran, and then asked people to do the same in other towns, they came back empty-handed informing me that they'd been rejected as anti-Semites. If opposing bombing Iran is anti-Semitic, you can imagine what interrupting Israeli VIPs to denounce their crimes counts as. But BDS (boycotts, divestments, and sanctions) against the Israeli government are easier to advance than those against the U.S. government -- although some are beginning to talk about the latter idea and many weapons companies that sell to Israel sell to everywhere else as well.In the end, I can't claim to know why activism for justice in Palestine is showing relative promise, but I can advocate giving it all the help we possibly can, respectful of the young people who are leading the way. Read their stories in In Our Power. If they succeed, it will help millions of people. It will also help the movement to end all war. Because the myth of ancient hatred between two parties will have been replaced by the reality of war as the political choice of a misguided government.  Ancient hatreds can be sold as inevitable. Choices made by misguided governments cannot.Taher Herzallah, a young activist, explains where the confidence comes from: ""[Y]ou have all these organizations pouring millions of dollars into doing work to combat the work we do for free. . . . [T]he work that we're doing doesn't need people that are paid millions of dollars. . . . When a freshman comes out and yells, 'Free Palestine!' and that threatens the existence of the state of Israel, that shows you how shallow that narrative is.""Adds student activist Rahim Kurwa, ""The [divestment] process enforces a debate on campus. It forces people to have to look at what's going on and what they're directly investing in. Every time you have that debate, you come out ahead.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36L8VZ6465O6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935982419#wasThisHelpful","R36L8VZ6465O6D","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Murder at Camp Delta is a new book by Joseph Hickman, a former guard at Guantanamo. It's neither fiction nor speculation. When President Obama says ""We tortured some folks,"" Hickman provides at least three cases -- in addition to many others we know about from secret sites around the world -- in which the statement needs to be modified to ""We murdered some folks."" Of course, murder is supposed to be acceptable in war (and in whatever you call what Obama does with drones) while torture is supposed to be, or used to be, a scandal. But what about tortures to death? What about deadly human experimentation? Does that have a Nazi enough ring to disturb anyone?We should be able to answer that question soon, at least for that segment of the population that searches aggressively for news or actually -- I'm not making this up -- reads books. Murder at Camp Delta is a book of, by, and for true believers in patriotism and militarism. You can start out viewing Dick Cheney as a leftist and never be offended by this book, unless documented facts that the author himself was deeply disturbed to discover offend you. The first line of the book is ""I am a patriotic American."" The author never retracts it. Following a riot at Guantanamo, which he led the suppression of, he observes:  ""As much as I blamed the inmates for the riot, I respected how hard they'd fought. They were ready to fight nearly to the death. If we had been running a good detention facility, I would have thought they were motivated by strong religious or political ideals. The sad truth was that they probably fought so hard because our poor facilities and shabby treatment had pushed them beyond normal human limits. Their motivation might not have been radical Islam at all but the simple fact that they had nothing to live for and nothing left to lose.""As far as I know, Hickman has not yet applied the same logic to debunking the absurd pretense that people fight back in Afghanistan or Iraq because their religion is murderous or because they hate us for our freedoms. Hickman will be a guest on Talk Nation Radio soon, so perhaps I'll ask him. But first I'll thank him. And not for his ""service."" For his book.He describes a hideous death camp in which guards were trained to view the prisoners as sub-human and much greater care was taken to protect the well-being of iguanas than homo sapiens. Chaos was the norm, and physical abuse of the prisoners was standard.  Col. Mike Bumgarner made it a top priority that everyone stand in formation when he entered his office in the morning to the sounds of Beethoven's Fifth or ""Bad Boys."" Hickman relates that certain vans were permitted to drive in and out of the camp uninspected, making a mockery of elaborate attempts at security. He didn't know the reasoning behind this until he happened to discover a secret camp not included on any maps, a place he called Camp No but the CIA called Penny Lane.To make things worse at Guantanamo would require a particular sort of idiocy that apparently Admiral Harry Harris possessed. He began blasting the Star Spangled Banner into the prisoners' cages, which predictably resulted in the guards abusing prisoners who did not stand and pretend to worship the U.S. flag. Tensions and violence rose. When Hickman was called on to lead an assault on prisoners who would not allow their Korans to be searched, he proposed that a Muslim interpreter do the searching. Bumgarner and gang had never thought of that, and it worked like a charm. But the aforementioned riot took place in another part of the prison where Harris rejected the interpreter idea; and the lies that the military told the media about the riot had an impact on Hickman's view of things. So did the media's willingness to lap up absurd and unsubstantiated lies: ""Half the reporters covering the military should have just enlisted; they seemed even more eager to believe the things our commanders said than we did.""After the riot, some of the prisoners went on hunger strike. On June 9, 2006, during the hunger strike, Hickman was in charge of guards on watch from towers, etc., overseeing the camp that night. He and every other guard observed that, just as the Navy Criminal Investigative Service report on the matter would later say, some prisoners were taken out of their cells. In fact, the van that took prisoners to Penny Lane took three prisoners, on three trips, out of their camp. Hickman watched each prisoner being loaded into the van, and the third time he followed the van far enough to see that it was headed to Penny Lane. He later observed the van return and back up to the medical facilities, where a friend of his informed him that three bodies were brought in with socks or rags stuffed down their throats.Bumgarner gathered staff together and told them three prisoners had committed suicide by stuffing rags down their own throats in their cells, but that the media would report it a different way. Everyone was strictly forbidden to say a word. The next morning the media reported, as instructed, that the three men had hung themselves in their cells. The military called these ""suicides"" a ""coordinated protest"" and an act of ""asymmetrical warfare."" Even James Risen, in his role as New York Times stenographer, conveyed this nonsense to the public. No reporter or editor apparently thought it useful to ask how prisoners could have possibly hung themselves in open cages in which they are always visible; how they could have acquired enough sheets and other materials to supposedly create dummies of themselves; how they could have gone unnoticed for at least two hours; how in fact they had supposedly bound their own ankles and wrists, gagged themselves, put on face masks, and then all hanged themselves simultaneously; why there were no videos or photos; why no guards were disciplined or even questioned for ensuing reports; why supposedly radically lax and preferential treatment had been given to three prisoners who were on hunger strike; how the corpses had supposedly suffered rigor mortis faster than is physically possible, etc.Three months after Hickman returned to the U.S. he heard on the news of another very similar ""suicide"" at Guantanamo. Who could Hickman turn to with what he knew? He found a law professor named Mark Denbeaux at the Seton Hall University Law School's Center for Policy and Research. With his, and his colleagues', help Hickman tried reporting the matter through proper channels. Obama's Justice Department, NBC, ABC, and 60 Minutes all expressed interest, were told the facts, and refused to do a thing about it. But Scott Horton wrote it up in Harpers, which Keith Olbermann reported on but the rest of the corporate media ignored.Hickman and Seton Hall researchers found out that the CIA had been administering huge doses of a drug called mefloquine to prisoners, including the three killed, which an army doctor told Hickman would induce terror and amounted to ""psychological waterboarding."" Over at Truthout.org Jason Leopold and Jeffrey Kaye reported that every new arrival at Guantanamo was given mefloquine, supposedly for malaria, but it was only given to every prisoner, never to a single guard or to any third-country staff people from countries with high risk of malaria, and never to the Haitian refugees housed at Guantanamo in 1991 and 1992. Hickman had begun his ""service"" at Guantanamo believing the prisoners were ""the worst of the worst,"" but had since learned that at least most of them were nothing of the sort, having been picked up for bounties with little knowledge of what they'd done. Why, he wondered,  ""were men of little or no value kept under these conditions, and even repeatedly interrogated, months or years after they'd been taken into custody? Even if they'd had any intelligence when they came in, what relevance would it have years later? . . . One answer seemed to lie in the description that Major Generals [Michael] Dunlavey and [Geoffrey] Miller both applied to Gitmo. They called it 'America's battle lab.'""","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PV4WT7JYQRBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451650795#wasThisHelpful","R2PV4WT7JYQRBS","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Accepted wisdom in U.S. culture, despite overwhelming evidence, holds that the two nuclear bombs dropped on Japan shortened World War II and saved more lives than the some 200,000 lives they took away.And yet, weeks before the first bomb was dropped, on July 13, 1945, Japan sent a telegram to the Soviet Union expressing its desire to surrender and end the war. The United States had broken Japan's codes and read the telegram. U.S. President Harry Truman referred in his diary to ""the telegram from Jap Emperor asking for peace.""Truman had been informed through Swiss and Portuguese channels of Japanese peace overtures as early as three months before Hiroshima. Japan objected only to surrendering unconditionally and giving up its emperor, but the United States insisted on those terms until after the bombs fell, at which point it allowed Japan to keep its emperor.Presidential advisor James Byrnes had told Truman that dropping the bombs would allow the United States to ""dictate the terms of ending the war."" Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal wrote in his diary that Byrnes was ""most anxious to get the Japanese affair over with before the Russians got in."" Truman wrote in his diary that the Soviets were preparing to march against Japan and ""Fini Japs when that comes about."" Truman ordered the bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6th and another type of bomb, a plutonium bomb, which the military also wanted to test and demonstrate, on Nagasaki on August 9th.Also on August 9th, the Soviets attacked the Japanese. During the next two weeks, the Soviets killed 84,000 Japanese while losing 12,000 of their own soldiers, and the United States continued bombing Japan with non-nuclear weapons. Then the Japanese surrendered.The United States Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that,""‚Ä¶ certainly prior to 31 December, 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November, 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated."" One dissenter who had expressed this same view to the Secretary of War prior to the bombings was General Dwight Eisenhower.The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral William D. Leahy agreed: ""The use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender.""It was with knowledge of these undisputed but collectively ignored facts that I recently read a review of a book called The Girls of Atomic City: The Untold Story of the Women Who Helped Win World War II.  The women or girls involved did not in any way help win World War II, and the author and publisher surely know that.  These women worked in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, producing the bombs that would kill, injure, traumatize, and destroy on a scale never before imagined -- leaving us decades later in serious danger of accidental or intentional apocalypse. But the idea that they helped win or end a war is a lie.That the atomic girls didn't know exactly what they were building is no excuse any more than the Nazi's ""I was just following orders"" was an excuse.  But these women's ignorance of what they were making would, I think, diminish their heroism had they done something at all heroic.  In reality, they blindly participated in mass-murder by knowingly assisting a war effort, and were willing to do so without being given any of the details. In other words, they proved capable of doing just what millions of men have done. Should we be proud?","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAIV8BQKPFQB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451617534#wasThisHelpful","RAIV8BQKPFQB1","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So now we (or at least the 0.03% of us who care to hunt for it) discover that U.S. military spending is not actually being cut at all, but increasing. Also going up: U.S. nuclear weapons spending.  Some of the new nukes will violate treaties, but the entire program violates the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which requires disarmament, not increased armament.  The U.S. policy of first-strike and the U.S. practice of informing other nations that ""all options are on the table"" also violate the U.N. Charter's ban on threatening force.But do nuclear weapons, by the nature of their technology, violate the U.S. Constitution? Do they violate the basic social contract and all possibility of self-governance?  Thus argues a new book called Thermonuclear Monarchy: Choosing Between Democracy and Doom by Elaine Scarry.  It's not unheard of for people to see out-of-control nuclear spending as a symptom of out-of-control military spending, itself a symptom of government corruption, legalized bribery, and a militaristic culture.  Scarry's argument suggests a reversal: the root of all this evil is not the almighty dollar but the almighty bomb.The argument runs something like this.  The primary purpose of the social contract is to create peace and prevent war and other injury.  The U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 8, clause 11) bans the making of war without the approval of both houses of Congress.  This approval was to be required not just for an existing military to attack another country, but for a military to be raised at all -- standing armies not being anticipated.  And it was understood that an army would not be raised and deployed into war unless the citizen-soldiers went willingly, their ability to dissent by desertion not needing to be spelled out (or, let us say, their ability to dissent by mass-desertion, as desertion in the war that led to the Constitution was punished by death).And yet, because this point was so crucial to the entire governmental project, Scarry argues, it was in fact spelled out -- in the Second Amendment.  Arms -- that is 18th century muskets -- were to be freely distributed among the people, not concentrated in the hands of a king.  ""Civilian"" control over the military meant popular control, not presidential. The decision to go to war would have to pass through the people's representatives in Congress, and through the people as a whole in the form of soldiers who might refuse to fight.  By this thinking, had the Ludlow Amendment, to create a public referendum before any war, passed in the 1930s, it would have been redundant.Before the 1940s were over, in Scarry's view, a Ludlow Amendment wouldn't have been worth the paper it was written on, as the existence of nuclear weapons erases Constitutional checks on war.  With nuclear weapons, a tiny number of people in a government -- be it 1 or 3 or 20 or 500 -- hold the power to very quickly and easily kill millions or billions of human beings, and other species, and very likely themselves in the process.  ""We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both,"" said Louis Brandeis.  We may have democracy, or we may have thermonuclear bombs, but we can't have both, says Elaine Scarry.Each of the series of presidents beginning with Truman and running up through Nixon is known to have repeatedly come close to choosing to use nuclear bombs, something the public has learned of, each time, only decades after the fact.  No more recent president has said he didn't come close; we may very well learn their secrets on the usual schedule.  When you add to that insanity, the long string of accidents, mistakes, and misunderstandings, the damage of the testing and the waste, and the repeated ability of ploughshares activists (and therefore anybody else) to walk right up to U.S. nuclear weapons to protest them, it's amazing that life exists on earth.  But Scarry's focus is on what the new ability to kill off a continent at the push of a button has done to presidential power.While wars since World War II have been non-nuclear, apart from depleted uranium weapons, they have also been endless and undeclared.  Because presidents can nuke nations, they and Congress and the public have assumed that a president on his or her own authority can attack nations with non-nuclear weapons too.  Now, I suspect that the military industrial complex, corrupt elections, and nuclear thinking all feed off each other.  I don't want a single person who's trying to clean up election spending or halt fighter-jet production to stop what they're doing.  But the possible influence of nuclear thinking on U.S. foreign policy is intriguing.  Once a president has been given more power than any king has ever had, one might expect some people to do exactly what they've done and treat him like a king in all but name.Scarry believes that we're suffering from the false idea that we're in a permanent emergency, and that in an emergency there's no time to think.  In fact, the Constitutional constraints on war were intended precisely for emergencies, Scarry argues, and are needed precisely then.  But an emergency that can be dealt with by raising an army is perhaps different from an emergency that will leave everyone on earth dead by tomorrow either with or without the U.S. government having the opportunity to contribute its measure of mass-killing to the general apocalypse.  The latter is, of course, not an emergency at all, but an insistence on glorified ignorance to the bitter end.  An emergency that allows time to raise an army is also different from an emergency involving 21st century ""conventional"" weapons, but not nearly as different as we suppose.  Remember the desperate urgency to hit Syria with missiles last September that vanished the moment Congress refused to do it? The mad rush to start a war before anyone can look too closely at its justifications does, I think, benefit from nuclear thinking -- from the idea that there is not time to stop and think.So, what can we do? Scarry believes that if nukes were eliminated, Congress could take charge of debates over wars again.  Perhaps it could.  But would it approve wars? Would it approve public financing, free air time, and open elections? Would it ban its members from profiting from war?  Would people killed in a Congressionally declared war be any less dead?What if the Second Amendment as Scarry understands it were fulfilled to some slight degree, that is if weapons were slightly more equitably distributed as a result of the elimination of nukes?  The government would still have all the aircraft carriers and missiles and bombs and predator drones, but it would have the same number of nukes as the rest of us.  Wouldn't compliance with the Second Amendment require either the madness of giving everybody a missile launcher or the sanity of eliminating non-nuclear weapons of modern war-making along with the nuclear ones?I think the historical argument that Scarry lays out against the concentration of military power in the hands of a monarch is equally a case either for distributing that power or for eliminating it.  If large standing armies are the greatest danger to liberty, as James Madison supposed on his slave plantation, isn't that an argument against permanently stationing troops in 175 nations with or without nukes, as well as against militarizing local police forces at home? If unjustified war and imprisonment are the greatest violations of the social contract, must we not end for-profit mass incarceration by plea bargain along with for-profit mass-murder?I think Scarry's argument carries us further in a good direction than she spells out in the book.  It's a thick book full of extremely lengthy background information, not to say tangents.  There's a wonderful account of the history of military desertion.  There's a beautiful account of Thomas Hobbes as peace advocate. Much of this is valuable for its own sake.  My favorite tangent is a comparison between Switzerland and the United States.  Switzerland decided that air-raid shelters would help people survive in a nuclear war.  While opposing and not possessing nuclear weapons, Switzerland has created shelters for more than the total number of people in the country.  The United States claimed to have concluded that shelters would not work, and then spent more on building them exclusively for the government than it spent on all variety of needs and services for the rest of us.  The nuclear nation has behaved as a monarchy, while the non-nuclear nation may preserve a remnant of humanity to tell the tale.Scarry ends her book by stating that Article I and the Second Amendment are the best tools she's found for dismantling nuclear weapons, but that she'd like to hear of any others.  Of course, mass nonviolent action, education, and organizing are tools that will carry any campaign beyond the confines of legal argumentation, but as long as we're within those confines, I'll throw out a proposal: Comply with the Kellogg-Briand Pact.  It is far newer, clearer, and less ambiguous than the Constitution.  It is, under the Constitution, unambiguously the Supreme Law of the Land as a treaty of the U.S. government.  It applies in other nations as well, including a number of other nuclear weapons nations.  It clarifies our thinking on the worst practice our species has developed, one that will destroy us all, directly or indirectly, if not ended, with or without nuclear: the practice of war.The treaty that I recommend remembering bans war.  When we begin to think in those terms, we won't see torture as the worst war crime, as Scarry suggests, but war itself as the worst crime of war.  We won't suggest that killing is wrong because it's ""nonbattlefield,"" as Scarry does at one point.  We might question, as Scarry seems not to, that Hawaii was really part of the United States in 1941, or that U.S. torture really ended when Obama was elected.

"Annie Jacobsen's new book is called Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program That Brought Nazi Scientists to America.  It isn't terribly secret anymore, of course, and it was never very intelligent.  Jacobsen has added some details, and the U.S. government is still hiding many more.  But the basic facts have been available; they're just left out of most U.S. history books, movies, and television programs.After World War II, the U.S. military hired sixteen hundred former Nazi scientists and doctors, including some of Adolf Hitler's closest collaborators, including men responsible for murder, slavery, and human experimentation, including men convicted of war crimes, men acquitted of war crimes, and men who never stood trial.  Some of the Nazis tried at Nuremberg had already been working for the U.S. in either Germany or the U.S. prior to the trials.  Some were protected from their past by the U.S. government for years, as they lived and worked in Boston Harbor, Long Island, Maryland, Ohio, Texas, Alabama, and elsewhere, or were flown by the U.S. government to Argentina to protect them from prosecution.  Some trial transcripts were classified in their entirety to avoid exposing the pasts of important U.S. scientists. Some of the Nazis brought over were frauds who had passed themselves off as scientists, some of whom subsequently learned their fields while working for the U.S. military.The U.S. occupiers of Germany after World War II declared that all military research in Germany was to cease, as part of the process of denazification.  Yet that research went on and expanded in secret, under U.S. authority, both in Germany and in the United States, as part of a process that it's possible to view as nazification.  Not only scientists were hired. Former Nazi spies, most of them former S.S., were hired by the U.S. in post-war Germany to spy on -- and torture -- Soviets.The U.S. military shifted in numerous ways when former Nazis were put into prominent positions. It was Nazi rocket scientists who proposed placing nuclear bombs on rockets and began developing the intercontinental ballistic missile.  It was Nazi engineers who had designed Hitler's bunker beneath Berlin, who now designed underground fortresses for the U.S. government in the Catoctin and Blue Ridge Mountains.  Known Nazi liars were employed by the U.S. military to draft classified intelligence briefs falsely hyping the Soviet menace. Nazi scientists developed U.S. chemical and biological weapons programs, bringing over their knowledge of tabun and sarin, not to mention thalidomide -- and their eagerness for human experimentation, which the U.S. military and the newly created CIA readily engaged in on a major scale.  Every bizarre and gruesome notion of how a person might be assassinated or an army immobilized was of interest to their research. New weapons were developed, including VX and Agent Orange.  A new drive to visit and weaponize outerspace was created, and former Nazis were put in charge of a new agency called NASA.Permanent war thinking, limitless war thinking, and creative war thinking in which science and technology overshadowed death and suffering, all went mainstream.  When a former Nazi spoke to a women's luncheon at the Rochester Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1953, the event's headline was ""Buzz Bomb Mastermind to Address Jaycees Today.""  That doesn't sound terribly odd to us, but might have shocked anyone living in the United States anytime prior to World War II.  Watch this Walt Disney television program featuring a former Nazi who worked slaves to death in a cave building rockets.  Before long, President Dwight Eisenhower would be lamenting that ""the total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government."" Eisenhower was not referring to Nazism but to the power of the military-industrial complex.  Yet, when asked whom he had in mind in remarking in the same speech that ""public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite,"" Eisenhower named two scientists, one of them the former Nazi in the Disney video linked above.The decision to inject 1,600 of Hitler's scientific-technological elite into the U.S. military was driven by fears of the USSR, both reasonable and the result of fraudulent fear mongering.  The decision evolved over time and was the product of many misguided minds. But the buck stopped with President Harry S Truman.  Henry Wallace, Truman's predecessor as vice-president who we like to imagine would have guided the world in a better direction than Truman did as president, actually pushed Truman to hire the Nazis as a jobs program.  It would be good for American industry, said our progressive hero.  Truman's subordinates debated, but Truman decided.  As bits of Operation Paperclip became known, the American Federation of Scientists, Albert Einstein, and others urged Truman to end it. Nuclear physicist Hans Bethe and his colleague Henri Sack asked Truman:  ""Did the fact that the Germans might save the nation millions of dollars imply that permanent residence and citizenship could be bought? Could the United States count on [the German scientists] to work for peace when their indoctrinated hatred against the Russians might contribute to increase the divergence between the great powers? Had the war been fought to allow Nazi ideology to creep into our educational and scientific institutions by the back door? Do we want science at any price?""In 1947 Operation Paperclip, still rather small, was in danger of being terminated. Instead, Truman transformed the U.S. military with the National Security Act, and created the best ally that Operation Paperclip could want: the CIA. Now the program took off, intentionally and willfully, with the full knowledge and understanding of the same U.S. President who had declared as a senator that if the Russians were winning the U.S. should help the Germans, and vice versa, to ensure that the most people possible died, the same president who viciously and pointlessly dropped two nuclear bombs on Japanese cities, the same president who brought us the war on Korea, the war without declaration, the secret wars, the permanent expanded empire of bases, the military secrecy in all matters, the imperial presidency, and the military-industrial complex.  The U.S. Chemical Warfare Service took up the study of German chemical weapons at the end of the war as a means to continue in existence.  George Merck both diagnosed biological weapons threats for the military and sold the military vaccines to handle them.  War was business and business was going to be good for a long time to come.But how big a change did the United States go through after World War II, and how much of it can be credited to Operation Paperclip?  Isn't a government that would give immunity to both Nazi and Japanese war criminals in order to learn their criminal ways already in a bad place?  As one of the defendants argued in trial at Nuremberg, the U.S. had already engaged in its own experiments on humans using almost identical justifications to those offered by the Nazis.  If that defendant had been aware, he could have pointed out that the U.S. was in that very moment engaged in such experiments in Guatemala.  The Nazis had learned some of their eugenics and other nasty inclinations from Americans.  Some of the Paperclip scientists had worked in the U.S. before the war, as many Americans had worked in Germany.  These were not isolated worlds.Looking beyond the secondary, scandalous, and sadistic crimes of war, what about the crime of war itself?  We picture the United States as less guilty because it maneuvered the Japanese into the first attack, and because it did prosecute some of the war's losers.  But an impartial trial would have prosecuted Americans too.  Bombs dropped on civilians killed and injured and destroyed more than any concentration camps -- camps that in Germany had been modeled in part after U.S. camps for native Americans.  Is it possible that Nazi scientists blended into the U.S. military so well because an institution that had already done what it had done to the Philippines was not in all that much need of nazification?Yet, somehow, we think of the firebombing of Japanese cities and the complete leveling of German cities as less offensive that the hiring of Nazi scientists.  But what is it that offends us about Nazi scientists?  I don't think it should be that they engaged in mass-murder for the wrong side, an error balanced out in some minds but their later work for mass-murder by the right side.  And I don't think it should be entirely that they engaged in sick human experimentation and forced labor.  I do think those actions should offend us.  But so should the construction of rockets that take thousands of lives.  And it should offend us whomever it's done for.It's curious to imagine a civilized society somewhere on earth some years from now. Would an immigrant with a past in the U.S. military be able to find a job? Would a review be needed? Had they tortured prisoners? Had they drone-struck children? Had they leveled houses or shot up civilians in any number of countries? Had they used cluster bombs? Depleted uranium? White phosphorous? Had they ever worked in the U.S. prison system? Immigrant detention system? Death row? How thorough a review would be needed? Would there be some level of just-following-orders behavior that would be deemed acceptable? Would it matter, not just what the person had done, but how they thought about the world?","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFTS7RUU3YPVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031622104X#wasThisHelpful","RFTS7RUU3YPVB","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fats: In the family jewels?Gary: In the family jewels, man!Wyatt: Worst pain there is.Gary: Broke my heart in two!Fats: She broke more than your heart.--Weird ScienceIt turns out that procreation of secretive criminal government agencies doesn't require a male or a female, and family jewels have little to do with it. The CIA (short for Criminal Implementation of Arrogance) calls certain reports on its immoral and illegal activities its ""family jewels."" John Prados, author of The Family Jewels, the CIA, Secrecy, and Presidential Power, calls all of the CIA's outrageous secrets its family jewels.  But the CIA reproduces itself whether or not its secrets are exposed, and if it's a family we might just all end up dying from a bad case of family values.Prados' book recounts various CIA abuses from the 1970s through today, with chapters on domestic surveillance, detention and interrogation, and assassination.  Of course, the abuses predate the period focused on in this book, go back to the origins, and could fill much thicker volumes.  If the CIA has a problem with bad apples, we're talking about orchards full of them.  The vicious power-mad bursts of criminality do seem to come in historical cycles, peaking every 60 seconds or so for the past 60 years. There's no record of the CIA functioning in ""proper"" manner without the atrocities that are its bread and butter.  A CIA history is a history of relentless destructiveness -- relentless but worsening.""What are we talking about, here?"" asked Senator Frank Church, back in the day. ""Agencies of the government that are licensed to undertake murder. Is the president of the United States going to be a glorified godfather?""Today that goes without saying, although I'm not sure opinion polls wouldn't find the mafioso godfather to be the more glorified of the two, presidential drones or no presidential drones.One problem, Prados points out, is secrecy.  ""Not only does secret knowledge have extremely seductive power, when spooks walk on the dark side they experience the greatest invitation to excess, believing that security classification shields their actions from scrutiny.""Prados quotes Harry Howe Ransom: ""At the level of representatives of the people -- executive and legislative -- the problem is primarily how to control a dimly seen instrument so hot that if not handled with great skill it can burn its user instead of its adversary.""(You may take a moment here to remember President Kennedy if you are so inclined.)Secrecy is a source of evil, but not of its procreation.  The way the CIA keeps going is through the granting of immunity for its crimes, the glorification of its culture, the Hollywood propagandizing of its purpose, the cowardice of Congress members, the complicity of media types, the indifference of millions, and the repetitive-to-the-point-of-insanity push to reform the unreformable.It ought to be abolished.As someone engaged in the very useful work of exposing secrets, Prados seems at least as outraged by the CIA's reluctance to reveal its secrets as by the murderous horrors from which those secrets are constituted.  But if the secrets are exposed, they'll still be horrors, and -- frankly -- they'll be nothing entirely new.  If the United Nations sees the details on every drone murder, the United Nations will become a more openly pro-war institution, but the dead will still rot, their loved ones will still wail, and the CIA will still be seen as some mixture of necessary strength, heroic cool, and occasional unavoidable excesses so common that we get tired of hearing about them. Unless we decide that enough is enough.It ought to be abolished.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LIC43ALAUE51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0292737629#wasThisHelpful","R2LIC43ALAUE51","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"President Dwight Eisenhower is often admired for having avoided huge wars, having declared that every dollar wasted on militarism was food taken out of the mouths of children, and having warned -- albeit on his way out the door -- of the toxic influence of the military industrial complex (albeit in a speech of much more mixed messages than we tend to recall).But when you oppose war, not because it murders, and not because it assaults the rights of the foreign places attacked, but because it costs too much in U.S. lives and dollars, then your steps tend in the direction of quick and easy warfare -- usually deceptively cheap and easy warfare.President Obama and his subordinates are well aware that much of the world is outraged by the use of drones to kill.  The warnings of likely blowback and long-term damage to U.S. interests and human interests and the rule of law are not hard to find.  But our current warriors don't see a choice between murdering people with drones and using negotiations and courts of law to settle differences.  They see a choice between murdering people with drones and murdering people with ground troops on a massive scale.  The preference between these two options is so obvious to them as to require little thought.President Eisenhower had his own cheap and easy tool for better warfare.  It was called the Delightfully Deluded Dulles Brothers, and -- in terms of how much thought this pair of brothers gave to the possible outcomes of their reckless assault on the world -- it's fair to call them a couple of drones in a literal as well as an analogous sense.John Foster Dulles at the State Department and Allen Dulles at the CIA are the subject of a new book by Stephen Kinzer called The Brothers, which ought to replace whatever history book the Texas School Board has most recently imposed on our children.  This is a story of two vicious, racist, fanatical jerks, but it's also the story of the central thrust of U.S. public policy for the past 75 years.The NSA didn't invent sliminess in the 21st century.  The Dulles' grandfather and uncle did.  Cameras weren't first put on airplanes over the earth when drones were invented.  Allen Dulles started that with piloted planes -- the main result being scandal, outrage, and international antagonism -- a tradition we seem intent on keeping up.  Oh, and the cameras also revealed that the CIA had been wildly exaggerating the strength of the Soviet Union's military -- but who needed to know that?The Obama White House didn't invent aggression toward journalism.  Allen and Foster Dulles make the current crop of propagandists, censors, intimidators, and human rights abusers look like amateurs singing from an old hymnal they can't properly read.Black sites weren't created by George W. Bush.  Allen Dulles set up secret prisons in Germany, Japan, and the Panama Canal Zone, the MKULTRA program, and the Gladio and other networks of forces staying behind in Europe after World War II (never really) ended.The Dynamic Dulles Duo racked up quite a resume.  They overthrew a democratic government in Iran, installing a fierce dictatorship, and never imagining that the eventual backlash might be unpleasant.  Delighted by this -- and intimately in on it, as Kinzer documents -- Eisenhower backed the overthrow of Guatemala's democracy as well -- both of these operations being driven primarily by the interests of Foster Dulles' clients on Wall Street (where his firm had been rather embarrassingly late in halting its support for the Nazis).  Never mind the hostility generated throughout Latin America, United Fruit claimed its rights to run Guatemala, and who were the Guatemalans to say otherwise?Unsatisfied with this everlasting damage, the Dulles Brothers dragged the United States into a war of their own making on Vietnam, sought to overthrow Sukarno in Indonesia, teamed up with the Belgians to murder Lumumba in the Congo, and tried desperately to murder Fidel Castro or start an all-out war on Cuba.  The Bay of Pigs fiasco was essentially the result of Allen Dulles' confidence that he could trap a new president (John Kennedy) into expanding a war.If that weren't enough damage for two careers, the Disastrous Dulles Dimwits created the Council on Foreign Relations, shaped the creation of the United Nations to preserve U.S. imperialism, manufactured intense irrational fear of the Soviet Union and its mostly mythical plots for global domination, convinced Truman that intelligence and operations should be combined in the single agency of the CIA, sent countless secret agents to their deaths for no earthly reason, unwittingly allowed double agents to reveal much of their activities to their enemies, subverted democracy in the Philippines and Lebanon and Laos and numerous other nations, made hysteria a matter of national pride, ended serious Congressional oversight of foreign policy, pointlessly antagonized China and the USSR, boosted radically evil regimes likely to produce future blowback around the world and notably in Saudi Arabia but also in Pakistan -- with predictable damage to relations with India, failed miserably at overthrowing Nasser in Egypt but succeeded in turning the Arab world against the United States, in fact antagonized much of the world as it attempted an unacceptable neutrality in the Cold War, rejected Soviet peace overtures, aligned the U.S. government with Israel, built the CIA headquarters at Langley and training grounds at Camp Peary, and -- ironically enough -- radically expanded and entrenched the military industrial complex to which ""covert actions"" were supposed to be the easy new alternative (rather as the drone industry is doing today).The Dulles Dolts were a lot like King Midas if the king's love had been for  dogs*** rather than gold.  As icing on the cake of their careers, Allen Dulles -- dismissed in disgrace by Kennedy who regretted ever having kept him on -- manipulated the Warren Commission's investigation of Kennedy's death in a highly suspicious manner.  Kinzer says no more than that, but James Douglass's JFK and the Unspeakable points to other grounds for concern, including Dulles's apparent coverup of Oswald's being an employee of the CIA.Lessons learned? One would hope so. I would recommend these steps:Abolish the CIA, and make the State Department a civilian operation.Ban weaponized drones, and avoid a legacy as bad as the covert operations of the 1950s and 1960s.Stop the disgustingly royalish habit of supporting political family dynasties.And rename Washington's international, as well as its national, airport.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TCKMJA1C80AM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805094970#wasThisHelpful","R2TCKMJA1C80AM","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This November 11th at 11 a.m. will mark 95 years since World War I ended.  Next July 28th will mark 100 years since it started.  The world war, the great war, the war for no good reason, the war of poison gas, the war to end all wars, the war of mass stupidity, the war that went on for days after the Germans agreed to end it, the war that continued until 11 a.m. as that time had been set to end it, the war whose last man killed in action was a suicidal American who ran at the Germans at 10:59, the war that in fact was intentionally not ended but extended into mass-punishment of the German people until World War II could be commenced, this century-old piece of historical stupidity that shames our species is about to be commemorated on a serious scale -- so dust off your gas masks and get ready.A hundred years. A hundred ever-loving years, and we've neither learned that wars don't end wars nor ever really ended World War II, ever brought the troops home from Japan and Germany, ever scaled back the taxation and military spending and foreign basing and war profiteering.The Last of the Doughboys: The Forgotten Generation and Their Forgotten War by Richard Rubin is 500 pages of excellent history of World War I but without the appropriate rejection of the decision to go to war or the embarrassment one should feel for those who thought they could find glory or goodness by joining in that mass murdering madness.  We tend to look down on all sorts of aspects of early 20th century morality.  Colonialism, sexism, racism, corporal punishment in schools, creationism -- you name it, we've moved on.  Yet writers still recount wars as if the decision to take part in them were neutral or admirable.In a way this makes sense, given what we're all taught about history.  The Khan Academy is a wonderful website for kids (or anyone) to use in learning math.  But if you click over to the section on history it's literally nothing but wars.  Perhaps they plan to add in a few unimportant things that happened during the pauses in between wars, but they haven't done so yet.  It's nothing but war after war after war.  That's history.  President Kennedy supposedly said Lincoln would have been nothing without the Civil War -- it takes war to make greatness.  It takes war to be in the history books.Richard Rubin found and interviewed the last remaining U.S. veterans of World War I before they died.  As he spoke with them their average age was 107.  Everything he learned and recorded is of great interest, but much of it is simply about what it's like to become 107.  Such a study could have been done of non-veterans.  A comparison could have been made of veterans and non-veterans.  Or a study like this one could have looked at World War I resisters.  That there's not a similar book about them, and now can never be, says little about them and a great deal about all of us.  A comparison of the lifespans of veterans and refuseniks would have been an interesting test of the author's theory that going along to get along increases your life.It is perhaps not too late to track down and interview the last remaining survivors of the strongest peace movement the United States has known -- that of the 1920s and 1930s -- but somebody would have to do it and do it soon.Perhaps Richard Rubin will take up that idea, but I tend to doubt it.  His fascination is with war, not wisdom.  And not just his fascination, but most people's.  The sad fact is that, in Rubin's telling, these World War I veterans didn't tend to develop an appropriate sense of regret over a period of 85 years.  There are, no doubt, cases of slave owners who by 1950 were able to express some regret over slavery.  But slavery was on its way out.  War is ever on its way in.Despite my lengthy caveat, The Last of the Doughboys really is an excellent book, for what it is.  The discussions of World War I songs and World War I books, and so forth, are quite wonderful.  And Doughboys is not blatantly dishonest war hype.  It includes the facts about the Lusitania (that Germany had warned Americans not to get on a ship with arms and troops as it would be sunk).  It doesn't look closely at the war propaganda, but it is straightforward enough on the clampdown on speech and civil liberties, and the vicious demonization of Germans and the Kaiser.  It doesn't mention the Wall Street coup or the name Smedley Butler, but its coverage of the Bonus Army is otherwise good.  It doesn't focus on opposition or alternatives, but it does convey the pointlessness of the horror, and it does recount the badly misguided way in which the war was ended.Yet, ultimately, Rubin is striving to give more credit and honor to warriors unfairly overshadowed by the glorification of World War II.  The heroes of the original world war saved the world in the snow and shoeless and uphill both ways.  Rubin wants World War I to get its due -- unlike some wars.  The war on the Philippines, for example, he calls ""not much of"" a war, despite the fact that it cost the population involved a greater percentage of its lives than any other U.S. war has inflicted on any other population, including the population of the U.S. -- including in the U.S. Civil War.  Go to the Philippines and say it wasn't much of a war, I dare you.  It was the model for the costly, pointless, racist, one-sided slaughters of the 21st century.  World War I was a model only for its expansion into World War II.  Otherwise it's obsolete.My friend Sandy Davies, who knows this stuff, recently looked up what the costs have been of the ongoing warmaking by the United States since the pair of World Wars.  I think it's relevant because every single time I speak about ending war and take questions on the topic I'm asked ""What about Hitler?""  In the days since Hitler's been gone, as the world has moved on from Hitler-like expansionism, as a great portion of the world has moved away from war, the United States, according to Davies, has spent $37-40 trillion (in 2013 dollars) on war and preparations for war.There's $32 trillion since 1948 in Department of So-Called-Defense spending documented in [...]plus $780 billion to the War Department in 1946-7 before it was rebranded. Extra funding to the Energy Department, the V.A. and other departments is harder to find, but can be estimated at:Nuclear weapons (DOE): $1.7 - 3 trillionV.A.: $1.3 to 2.5 trillionOther departments: $1 to 2 trillionThen there's the real cost: 10 to 20 million dead in wars the U.S. has been directly involved in, or 15 to 30 million if you count the DRC, Cambodia, the French War in Indochina, and the Iran-Iraq War.  ""These numbers are very conservative,"" says Davies, ""based on publicly available estimates, generally ignoring Les Roberts' findings in Rwanda and the DRC that passive reporting methods generally only count 5-20% of deaths in war zones.""  These figures include:Korea: 2.5 to 3.5 millionVietnam: 2 to 4 millionIraq: 400,000 to 1.5 millionAfghanistan (total): 1 to 2 millionChina: 1.75 millionIndonesia: 500,000 to 2 millionAngola: 500,000 to 1 millionSomalia: 300,000 to 500,000Guatemala: 200,000 to 300,000Greece: 200,000East Timor: 100,000 to 220,000El Salvador: 100,000 to 120,000Syria: 90,000 to 130,000Operation Condor: 60,000 to 100,000Peru: 70,000Colombia: 50,000 - 200,000Laos: 40,000 to 100,000Nicaragua: 30,000 to 55,000Libya: 25,000 to 50,000plus smaller numbers in many other countries.Either we're on a record streak of greatest generations after greatest generations, or we've caught a war addiction so badly that we've come to imagine it's normal, and that -- in fact -- it's all that ever has happened in the world.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24Z2VAH7PT06S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547554435#wasThisHelpful","R24Z2VAH7PT06S","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Boghossian's A Manual for Creating Atheists is a curious and ultimately very valuable book.It's curious because it doesn't make much of a case -- or at least not the sort of case I would have liked -- for why we should create atheists.It's valuable because, if you believe we'd be better off with more atheists, this is a remarkable tool for accomplishing that goal.I don't view sloppy thinking as a great evil in itself.  It doesn't offend me the way hunger and lack of medicine and Hellfire missiles offend me.  So, I look for the argument -- which I think can be made -- that sloppy thinking has serious results, or that belief in a god leads to a lack of responsibility, or that belief in eternal life diminishes efforts to improve real lives.  This book does not focus on those arguments.Boghossian points to abstinence-only sex-ed, bans on same-sex marriage, teaching Creationism, corporal punishment in schools, and other offenses in the United States, as well as pointing to various more-severe abuses by the Taliban, as the undesirable results of theism.  But, with the possible exception of Creationism, these things could continue without theism or be ended while maintaining theism.  Perhaps they would be less likely to continue in a theism-free society in which good arguments against those practices had been introduced.  I'm inclined to think that atheistic openness to questioning assumptions leads toward swifter and more radical political change, whether for better or for worse, and that because we need positive radical change so desperately we need the ability to take that risk.In arguing against the assumption that we must always have war, or poverty, or private health insurance companies, or corporate television networks, or oil drilling, or billionaires, one could do much worse than to appropriate some of the arguments that Boghossian uses to argue against the assumption of theism.  This is the great value in this book. The author provides a guide and numerous examples of how to gently nudge someone away from what Boghossian calls ""faith,"" as distinct from ""religion.""I think the shift toward the word ""faith"" has largely been driven by people's desire to unload the baggage of specific religious beliefs while maintaining a vague conviction in the existence of some vague something that one has no evidence for the existence of.  Boghossian chooses to tackle people's ""faith,"" meaning their practice of believing something with no justification, in order not to challenge their social attachment to church attendance, ceremonies, and support structures of religions.  However, I've had people tell me they were theists because they are not omniscient and they appreciate profound mysteries, even though they reject such notions as ""god"" and ""heaven"" (as if atheists must claim to be omniscient just because they don't celebrate their ignorance).  So those wanting to cling to religion as they lose faith may themselves describe it as their faith evolving.Boghossian's approach to talking people out of faith is a subtle jiu-jitsu -- part therapy, part community organizing, part Socrates.  He cites evidence that people can be talked out of faith, as well as that the process often takes far longer than does conversion to faith.  Seeking to encourage those using his manual, the author explains how reactions that seem to reject arguments against faith can actually be signs of making progress.Boghossian advises targeting people's habits of faith, not the beliefs they hold.  He advocates a non-combative, helpful, and questioning Socratic approach.  Richard Dawkins comments in a blurb on the back cover: ""Peter Boghossian's techniques of friendly persuasion are not mine, and maybe I'd be more effective if they were.  They are undoubtedly very persuasive -- and very much needed.""  I think that's right, but I also think that for a certain type of person, reading this book would be a way to cure them of their god virus.Still, Boghossian does little of what I think he could have done to persuade us of the desirability of working as evangelical atheists.  When, in the course of a conversation, Boghossian wants to provide examples of very moral people who are atheists, he picks Bill Gates (who hoards tens of billions of dollars while thousands of children starve and suffer for lack of it; something one doesn't question if faith in trickle-down economics dominates your thought) and Pat Tillman because he chose to ""give his life for his country"" (Tillman joined in the senseless slaughter of the people of Afghanistan, came to regret his decision, was killed either accidentally or intentionally by U.S. troops when no Afghans were anywhere nearby, and has been blatantly lied about by the U.S. military and media -- a case where skepticism and freethinking would seem to have been badly needed, but where our brilliant producer of atheists seems to have followed his faith in nationalism in choosing this example.)Of course, most atheists don't practice cut-throat computer software monopolism, hoard vast wealth, or join in wars.  In fact, atheists tend to be more generous and more antiwar than theists.  But among those who truly behave morally, including by working and sacrificing for peace and social and economic justice, civil liberties, and the natural environment, are many who say they're motivated by religion.  Boghossian, in advocating steering conversations away from abortion or school prayer, says to aim for the root: ""Undermine faith, and all faith-based conclusions are simultaneously undermined."" One has to hope that doesn't include the good conclusions along with the bad.Oddly, Boghossian's approach, in which he strives to understand and sympathize with the person whose faith he is attempting to remove, gives very little mention to such motivators of religious belief as the desire not to die.  Boghossian uses Socratic questioning to get people to see the error of their ways.  He doesn't try to open them up by addressing their unstated fears of death or a world without an authority figure.  When death finally gets mentioned, far into the book, the author refers to the atheist's position as ""the unknowable"" and ""not knowing.""  Not knowing what, exactly?  That everything goes blank and ceases?  We do know that.Maybe Boghossian is right that there's nothing to be said on that subject, and a society in which people are not taught religion will be a society with much less religion in it, even while death remains horrifying.  Toward the end of the book, the author claims that sound reasoning will give someone a feeling of control that is superior to the feeling of comfort in imagining that their loved one is still alive in a magical place.  But this depends, I think, on recognizing that belief in ""heaven"" is weak and unsatisfying because at odds with most of one's other beliefs.  (See In Bad Faith by Andrew Levine.)  Surely actually believing that nobody dies and that one prioritizes rational belief formation would be the most preferable combination.  But we don't have that choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OEKMWX3JCOVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939578094#wasThisHelpful","R2OEKMWX3JCOVA","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two kinds of countries or societies or places to live. In the first kind, decent, fair, kind, and respectful treatment of every person takes precedent over anyone's preferences for how a culture changes or how much effort is expended trying to slow the change of a culture, or which cultures mix with each other, or which groups intermarry. In this first type of society -- admittedly a nonexistent ideal -- people identify with humanity and welcome any member of humanity into their group of associates, their neighborhood, and their family.  Desire to keep some corner of the globe inhabited by people with a particular skin color or language isn't just slightly outweighed by diligent observance of individuals' rights.  Instead, such sectarian  or tribal desire doesn't exist. And its absence leaves room for concern over war, environmental destruction, hunger, poor healthcare, illiteracy, and all sorts of problems not involving the exclusion of some people from a group.In the second kind of society, importance is placed on creating or maintaining a population that is exclusively or predominantly of a particular appearance or background, religion or ethnicity.  Such a society strays, mildly or moderately or extremely, from democracy, as its demographic project conflicts with people's rights to immigrate, marry, practice or abandon religion, and speak and behave as they choose. Valuing some types of people over others leads toward anti-democratic positions and leaves a society open to easy manipulation through fear and prejudice, distracting energy away from real problems that might appear harder to solve. In extreme cases, this type of society becomes fascist. Hatred and violence become admirable. Lynchings and apartheid and Jim Crow and mass incarceration and sadistic punishment follow.The nation of Israel claims to be both a democracy and a Jewish state. It can't be. Similarly, the United States cannot be a Christian nation or a white nation and a democracy.  A poll in Israel in 2012 asked, ""Israel is defined as both a Jewish and democratic state. Which is more important to you?"" 34% said Jewish, while 22% said democratic, but 42% said that both were equally important.  People in that 42% misunderstand the necessity to choose, as they no doubt do choose every day.  The same poll asked, ""Speakers should be prohibited from harshly criticizing the State of Israel in public ... ,"" and 20% agreed, while another 29% strongly agreed.  Hmmm, is that the democracy or the Jewish state talking?Max Blumenthal's new book, Goliath: Life and Loathing in Greater Israel, is 400 pages of fascistic horrors, a dystopian vision of where the United States or most any other country could go and where Israel has gone.  Of course, Israel uses World War II to justify its outrages, just as the United States uses World War II to justify its military presence in 177 other nations.  The United States arms Israel and protects it from legal consequences for crimes.  U.S. companies and individuals and universities and churches fund and take part in Israel's brutality. U.S. Congress members listen to Israeli war propaganda as attentively as do Knesset members. So, there are perhaps extra reasons for those of us in the U.S. to pay particular attention to Israel's fascistic tendencies.And what do these consist of? Well, permanent war, permanent crisis, fear-mongering, racism, legal and popularly imposed segregation and harassment. False beliefs about past and current crimes of the Israeli military are so openly willful that Israel has a contest show on television for amateur propagandists. Crimes by soldiers or civilians go unpunished or lightly punished when the victims are non-Jews.  These crimes include lynchings, assaults, torture, harassment, humiliation, eviction, home destruction, job discrimination, and constant traumatization. Soldiers always nearby.  Drones always buzzing overhead. Artificial sewage called Skunk sprayed through open windows of homes.  The star of David painted on homes and businesses destroyed to intimidate non-Jews. Crowds gathered on a hill to watch and cheer for the bombing of Gaza like Washingtonians picnicking in Manassas to watch a civil war slaughter. Israeli soldiers openly describing themselves as fascists. Trials with pre-determined outcomes. Incarceration of masses of people in concentration camps.Blumenthal's portrait of Israel is a partial one to be sure, but a terrifying one nonetheless.  He contrasts the relentless hatred and abuse he documents with brief moments of imagining something else.  At a restaurant in Haifa, writes Blumenthal, ""seated at a long table in Fatoush's outdoor garden, listening to a m√©lange of English, Arabic, and Hebrew amid a crowd of Palestinians, Jews, and internationals, it is sometimes possible to imagine the kind of place Israel could be if it ever managed to shed its settler-colonial armor.""That place is not a Jewish democracy or a white democracy or a European democracy. That place is a democracy, and a democracy is a place where you're happy for your son or daughter to get married because they're in love, not because of the ethnicity of their beloved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKS5NW7N366WO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1568586345#wasThisHelpful","RKS5NW7N366WO","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You've heard people say they want to be spied on, as long as it means that other people will be spied on too.  I know you've heard people say this, and which people it was, and how your face looked when you heard it, and what your next telephone call was.  Or, rather, I could know all of that if I were one of the thousands and thousands of low-level snoops it will take for our government to accomplish its surveillance goals.The logic is completely flawed, however.  As FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley remarks, if you're looking for a needle in a haystack, adding more hay doesn't help.  It makes you less likely to find the needle.  A government that sucks up ever vaster quantities of useless information on innocent people actually hurts its own ability to investigate crimes.  And the imagined intimidating effect of things like surveillance cameras in public spaces doesn't actually reduce crime; it merely makes us think of each other as potential criminals.On top of that, the over-investigation leads to all sorts of harm to innocent people that was completely avoidable: wrongful prosecutions and imprisonments, deaths and injuries during unnecessary confrontations, and disastrous cultural and legal changes.  Once everyone has become a suspect, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant.  Once activists are targeted for surveillance and suspicion, many become reluctant to engage in activism -- which, believe it or not, leads to corruption and tyranny.It's also possible to be wrong about one's innocence.  There are over 5,000 federal crimes on the books, plus 300,000 regulatory crimes, plus regulations, plus state crimes.  Almost everyone is certainly guilty of something or easily made to appear guilty of something.All of these points become clearer, I think, when one learns, not just what could happen in the near future, but what is happening right now in the nature of abuses often considered futuristic or dystopian.  A great place -- maybe the best place -- to start is John Whitehead's new book, A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State.This book captures the stories of slowly growing abuse and suppression, and collects them in sufficient mass to shock readers out of their complacency.  Have police pulled you over and done cavity searches yet?  They have to others.  Have they forcibly drawn your blood to check for alcohol?  Have they stopped you on a sidewalk and patted you down?  Some  things you simply don't know whether they've done: have they scanned your pockets, bags, and clothing as you passed?  Have they filmed you with a drone and stored the information, allowing a retroactive search of where you were when, should the need arise?  Have they tracked you via your cell phone or your license plate?  Do they know your web browsing history and the content of your emails?  Have they entered your home and searched it while you were out?  These actions are all ""legal,"" even if unconstitutional.Some abuses you can't help being aware of when they happen to you or someone you know.  Tens of thousands have been arrested and committed to mental institutions.  Local police have been militarized.  Uniquely in the world, the U.S. military ""donates"" its weapons to local police forces.  With the weaponry comes a militarization of uniforms, language, training, tactics, and thought.  Over 50,000 no-knock SWAT-team-style police raids are carried out annually in the United States.  Noticing this doesn't make us paranoid.  It exposes the paranoia of the police, who see an enemy in every member of the public.""There was a time,"" Whitehead notes, ""when communities would have been up in arms over a botched SWAT team raid resulting in the loss of innocent lives.  Unfortunately, today, we are increasingly being conditioned by both the media and the government to accept the use of SWAT teams by law enforcement agencies for routine drug policing and the high incidence of error-related casualties that accompanies these raids.""  Whitehead details some of the specific tragedies.Combine police that have been militarized with a public that has been armed, and you get stories like this one: ""[A]n 88-year-old African-American woman was shot and killed in 2006 when policemen barged unannounced into her home, reportedly in search of cocaine.  Police officers broke down Kathryn Johnstone's door while serving a 'no-knock' warrant to search her home on a run-down Atlanta street known for drugs and crime, prompting the woman to fire at what she believed to be the 'intruders' in self-defense.  The officers returned fire, killing the octogenarian.  No cocaine was found.""If only someone had had a gun!According to Amnesty International, 90% of those killed by police tasers were unarmed when tasered.  But when people are armed, they aren't just tasered; instead they have dozens of bullets pumped into them.Drones, in Whitehead's view, open up a whole new level of militarization.  As tear gas, tasers, sound cannons, assault vehicles, and other military weapons were passed on to police, so too are drones being domesticated.  The reckless killing and blanket spying that will follow pale in relation to some of the suicidal stupidities the military has planned, such as nuclear-powered drones and drones carrying nuclear weapons.It's not too late to push back, assuming we come to understand the desirability and necessity of doing so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EFWGVRVZYU40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590799755#wasThisHelpful","R3EFWGVRVZYU40","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hammer in hand, one sees nails everywhere. Successful unpunished genocide at home in hand, the Pentagon sees Indian Country on six continents.  But don't imagine the U.S. military is finished with the original Indian Country yet, including Native American reservations and territories, and including the places where the rest of us now live.Compare and contrast:Exhibit 1 from the New York Times:""Mr. Obama embraced a disputed method for counting civilian casualties that did little to box him in. It in effect counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants, according to several administration officials, unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent.""Exhibit 2 from a U.S. Army dispatch in 1864:""All Apache . . . large enough to bear arms who may be encountered in Arizona will be slain whenever met unless they give themselves up as prisoners.""Donald Rumsfeld gave a speech at Fort Carson with cavalry troops on horseback dressed in Indian-killing outfits behind him, as he praised troops in Iraq for living up to the legend of Kit Carson -- a man who marched hundreds of human beings to a camp later used as a model for the Nazis'.Osama bin Laden was renamed by the U.S. military, Geronimo.Winona LaDuke's The Militarization of Indian Country tells a history that isn't over, and describes a scene that cannot escape from its past.  Like Coleman Smith's and Clare Hanrahan's survey of the militarization of the Southeast, LaDuke's survey of militarized Indian Country piles up numerous outrages to convey a picture of purposeful devastation on a stunning scale.Many Native Americans live in places called Fort This or Fort That, keeping ever present the concentration camps these places were.  They remain among the poorest and most environmentally devastated sacrifice zones in the United States.""The modern U.S. military,"" LaDuke writes, ""has taken our lands for bombing exercises and military bases, and for the experimentation and storage of the deadliest chemical agents and toxins known to mankind. Today the military continues to bomb  Native Hawaiian lands, from Makua to the Big Island, destroying life.""Later, LaDuke summarizes: ""From the more than a thousand nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific and the Nevada desert that started in the 1940s, obliterating atolls and spreading radioactive contamination throughout the ocean and across large areas in the American West, to the Vietnam War-era use of napalm and Agent Orange to defoliate and poison vast swaths of Vietnam, to the widespread use of depleted uranium and chemical weaponry since that time, the role of the U.S. military in contaminating the planet cannot be overstated.""In Alaska, 700 active and abandoned military sites include 1,900 toxic hot spots.  People forget the seriousness of a failed plan to create a harbor in Alaska by dropping a series of nuclear bombs.  Some of the actions that have in fact been taken have been only moderately less destructive than that proposal.Uranium mines, depleted uranium testing, and nuclear waste storage have done as much or more damage to Indian Country as nuclear bomb testing.  U.S. nuclear weapons are largely located in Native American territories, as well.  If the Great Sioux Nation were in control of its 1851 treaty areas, LaDuke writes, ""it would be the third greatest nuclear weapons power on the face of the earth.""Many Native Americans recognize in current U.S. foreign wars echoes of wars against the Indian nations.  And yet, American Indians have the highest military enlistment rate of any ethnic group and the largest number of living veterans (about 22 percent of Native Americans aged 18 or over).  ""How,"" LaDuke asks, ""did we move from being the target of the U.S. military to being the U.S. military itself?""  Native Americans also suffer from PTSD at higher rates than other groups -- supposedly due to higher rates of combat, but just conceivably also because of greater cognitive dissonance.I admit to finding a little of the latter even in LaDuke's wonderful book.  She claims that sometimes there are ""righteous reasons to fight.""  She opposes militarism but wants veterans to be honored.  I'm writing this from a national convention of Veterans For Peace where I know numerous veterans would reject the idea that veterans should be honored.  What veterans should do is organize more Native Americans and other Americans together into a movement for the abolition of militarism as well as the righting of past wrongs so that they will not any longer be repeated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FEDTEP2231K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193806500X#wasThisHelpful","R2FEDTEP2231K7","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Amy Goodman and Denis Moynihan are touring the country with a new book that everyone should have and read.  ""The Silenced Majority: Stories of Uprisings, Occupations, Resistance, and Hope"" is a history of the Obama Years in the form of a thematically organized collection of columns -- columns that grew out of the reporting done by the most useful show on our airwaves: Democracy Now!How quickly we forget, or even never knew, this recent history -- history that will never make it into school-approved history books.  Reading this book, I was reminded of watching, for the first time, the movie Fahrenheit 911 by Michael Moore who wrote this book's introduction.  That movie recounted basic facts about recent years, many of them familiar to anyone who'd been paying attention, and yet the information came as a shock to most moviegoers.  This book would come as a shock to most readers.A column from November 10, 2010, included in the book, begins, ""If a volcano kills civilians in Indonesia, it's news.  When the government does the killing, sadly, it's just business as usual, especially if an American president tacitly endorses the killing, as President Barack Obama just did with his visit to Indonesia.""  Who recalls that episode now?  Who remembers the crises that jump in and out of our media: the cruelties imposed on Honduras or Haiti?  This book brings together a full four years and moves us to ask where each story has now gone.Here we read a history of teasing:  There's going to be accountability for foreclosure fraud very soon.  No, really.  Any day now.  Any month now.  We've launched a new study into, um, an investigation of a review procedure capability program.  No, seriously. Investigations are underway into the crimes of Rupert Murdoch.  Really, we mean it.Too many of these columns end with references to pretended federal efforts of law enforcement that were never heard from again.  There is no doubt an office somewhere in the FBI in which people are paid to calculate the ideal timing for pretending to pursue justice in one cause or another, and the ideal timing for switching over to silence and forgetting.  But it all looks laughable and offensive if you read four years' worth of it all strung together.This book encourages placing events in context and practices that habit.  ""Just before this Sunday's election in Haiti,"" Goodman and Moynihan wrote on March 23, 2011, ""President Rene Preval gave Aristide the diplomatic passport he had long promised him.  Earlier, on January 19, then U.S. State Department spokesman PJ Crowley tweeted, referring to Aristide: 'today Haiti needs to focus on its future, not its past.'  [Aristide's wife] Mildred was incensed.  She said the U.S. had been saying that since they forced him out of the country.  Sitting in a plane a few minutes before landing in Haiti, she repeated the words of an African leader who criticized abuses of colonial powers by saying, 'I would stop talking about the past, if it weren't so present.'""Part of the recent history reviewed here is the Arab Spring and the Occupy Movement.  As our government/media work to rewrite those stories, Goodman and Moynihan remind us of the days when people in Cairo held up a sign that read ""To: America. From: the Egyptian People. Stop supporting Mubarak. It's over!""  This collection takes us through the occupy movement and numerous other stories that are ongoing and developing, serving as an ideal primer for those now getting or staying involved.The current crisis in Syria, for its coverage of which Democracy Now has been criticized, is too new and does not appear in the book.Enough is included in this book for disturbing patterns to emerge without comment from the authors.  Here, for example, are four years of empty threats to our government from our people.  Many have probably forgotten Bill McKibben's statement in August 2001: ""Our hope is to send a Richter 8 tremor through the political system on the day Barack Obama says no to Big Oil and reminds us all why we were so happy when he got elected.  The tar sands pipeline is his test.""  Apparently there was no plan for what to do on the day (after day after day) on which Obama did not remind them why they were so happy.  There was no contingency plan for his failing the test.  There was no comprehension of how this guaranteed that he would choose to fail the test.  And there is now forgetfulness of the growing ludicrousness of past promises and past pseudo-threats to power.  Move the goal posts.  Declare a new showdown.  Avoid reading this book.The themes of the book include many that never entered the recent Obama-Romney debates.  Among them: race, and the death penalty.  The themes of the book are not presented in isolation, but in interconnectedness.  A Chicago police officer, Jon Burge, goes on a torture spree. ""Where did it all begin?"" ask Goodman and Moynihan.  ""One thing is clear: In 1968-69, Burge was an MP at the U.S. Army's Dong Tam camp in Vietnam's Mekong Delta, where captured suspected Viet Cong soldiers were allegedly interrogated with electric, hand-cranked field telephones supplying shocks.  Torture techniques similar to this were rampant under Burge's command in Chicago.""  On October 6, 2010, Goodman and Moynihan wrote:  ""News broke last week that the U.S. government purposely exposed hundreds of men in Guatemala to syphilis in ghoulish medical experiments conducted during the late 1940s.  As soon as the story got out, President Barack Obama phoned President Alvaro Colom of Guatemala to apologize.  Colom called the experiments 'an incredible violation of human rights.'  Colom also says his government is studying whether it can bring the case to international court. ... Ironically, the Guatemala study began in 1946, the same year as the Nuremberg tribunals, the first of which tried Nazi doctors accused of conducting heinous experiments on concentration-camp prisoners.  Half of those accused were put to death.""Numerous such connections are pointed out in the book or inevitably arise in the reader's mind.  The U.S. Supreme Court in the Troy Davis case finds it constitutional to kill an innocent person.  President Obama creates a drone program the serves primarily to do that very thing on a large scale.While the Occupy movement would not have existed as a national phenomenon without the corporate media, Democracy Now was there first and stayed with it longer.  Getting more people to watch Democracy Now must be an easier thing that getting the corporate media to favor the dismantling of corporate power.  Goodman and Moynihan, who barely sleep, and who are driven by the urgent moral need to confront the horrors the corporate media rarely notices, are on their way to a town near you.  Welcome them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S8XGWXMGFWFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608462315#wasThisHelpful","R2S8XGWXMGFWFH","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Good American: A Situation Report for Citizens"" by B. Sidney Smith is well worth reading, and you can read it in an hour.  This is more the length of an article than a book, and you could read it in the same time in which you could read a lengthy review by me that wouldn't do it justice.Smith summarizes brilliantly the state of U.S. society; the role our government/miitary plays in the world; the ways our televisions and advertising and elections keep us ignorant, distracted, obedient, and pacified; the degree to which ours has become an unequal class society; the looming environmental catastrophe we face (or should face up to); and -- a little less brilliantly -- what we can do about it.I could quote many excellent paragraphs or quibble with the points I disagree on.  But fundamentally this is an outstanding pamphlet that should be spread around like Tom Paine's was.  I can't think of a better, more concise explanation for your average American of what sort of mess we're in.  It's a shame that Smith follows his analysis with a final chapter that walks right up to the edge of demanding creative nonviolent activism and then tells the reader -- exactly as would Obama or Romney: ""Now go vote.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18VIIP12O4ZO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009IDGQSA#wasThisHelpful","R18VIIP12O4ZO0","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Russell Snyder's new book is called ""Hearts and Mines: With the Marines in Al-Anbar: A Story of Psychological Warfare in Iraq."" It's a beautiful book and one that may move you to outraged action, but not in the way you might expect.I got the book from its author at a Veterans For Peace convention.  I assumed it was an anti-war book.  I was startled first by the literary skill of the author, who paints a powerful picture of his time in Iraq.  I was startled second, slowly, gradually, as I waited for the author to turn against the war.  I've read many other accounts by soldiers who came to regret their actions.  They suffer from the actions they have taken.  They deeply regret having killed innocent people.  They find it almost too much to bear.  They lay down their guns.  They resist.  They go AWOL. They file for conscientious objector status. Or they receive their discharge and then denounce the institution of war, committing never to be a part of it again.That never quite happens with Snyder.Here's an intelligent, sensitive young man capable of describing a wide array of conflicting emotions that soldiers experience in wartime.  He enjoys the camaraderie of the military.  He respects the professionalism.  He honors the self-sacrifice.  And he resents the stupidity, fears for his life, and questions the wisdom of the entire enterprise.  Just questions.  He doesn't reject.  This is not a book aimed at moving you to demand an end to military spending.  This is a book aimed -- intentionally or not -- at moving you to seek out and struggle against the cultural habits that allow people to accept war so completely that they can recognize it as an unnecessary piece of barbarism and nonetheless take part in it with pride.""It's a worrisome flaw humanity has yet to overcome that in our modern age we still accept the butchery of our human brothers and sisters as a means of settling our politicians' and religious leaders' disagreements,"" writes Snyder in the introduction.  He writes that his viewpoint evolved there.  But the narrative of the book doesn't display evolution so much as complexity and contradiction.Snyder's job was to blast loud messages in Arabic at Iraqi villages, in order to win their hearts and minds.  He notes that in shooting practice ""two in the heart, one in the mind"" meant two bullets to the chest and one to the head -- mocking the futility of ""psy-ops.""  When, in Chapter 2, Snyder puts bullets into live humans, he describes the success of the conditioning that allowed him to do so without thought.  That thoughtlessness largely remains, at least on the surface, for the rest of the book.Snyder describes the difficulties of ""winning"" an occupation of a country, the inability to trust anyone, the cycles of revenge, the brutality, the lack of understanding, the torture, the sadism, and the tricking of Iraqi children into cursing their country in English or drinking urine.  Snyder describes a remarkable number of incidents in which he could easily have died, as well as learning that someone was offering $5,000 to whoever destroyed his loudspeaker truck or killed his Iraqi translator.  This is a book with more ""action"" in it than most such accounts I've read -- even as it still manages to convey the deadly boredom these incidents interspersed, and the adrenaline high that drove soldiers and Marines to seek out more activity, even at the risk of death.  Snyder describes the fear of death, the resort to religion, and ultimately his attempt to believe that God saved him (while, of course, not saving thousands of others).Snyder disapproves of the worst attitudes and actions he recounts.  ""It felt hypocritical,"" he writes, ""that we should attempt to convince [Iraqis] security was improving and they shouldn't be worried while we Americans swaddled ourselves head to toe in armor and protective gear.  Our hosts must have sometimes regarded our argument as condescending. Since we didn't allow them to have armor or weapons, it seemed to imply their lives were not deserving of the same level of protection as our own.""  At various other times, Snyder writes that his actions had the merit of possibly saving Marines' lives.  Not lives, Marines' lives.Snyder describes himself as torn. ""My soul ached, torn between feeling a sense of contractual obligation, a desire to fulfill my duties as a soldier and to commiserate with my brothers in uniform while mourning the seemingly pointless extinction of so much innocent life.  Not only the little girls whose stiffening corpses were now rotting like refuse in the backyard, or the baby chicks that had survived two tank rounds only to succumb to the sadistic whims of bored Marines, but the countless thousands of other human lives destroyed by war and remembered only as collateral damage. . . .  Prolonging the war seemed akin to setting fire to a neighbor's house and then attempting to extinguish the flames with more fire.  I felt at once very weary, exhausted by the heavy knowledge of so much violence and needless death.  But I remained quiet as I crawled into the turret, resigned to accept my own sinful role.""  In fact, the possibility of acting otherwise is never mentioned in the book -- except for others.  Snyder writes that he ""lamented the state of what I imagined to be my countrymen's lack of awareness that permitted their collective conscience to embrace a war . . . .""  In reality, there is no collective in such matters.  We each have to act alone.  We each bear a different share of guilt.  But most of us at least were not taking part in what we were lamenting.  Snyder ends the book feeling more guilt over his decision not to reenlist than anything else.It's possible that some of what Snyder has experienced and taken part in lies buried within him, threatening to erupt years or decades from now.  ""I might never live,"" he writes, ""long enough to atone for everything that troubled me, but maybe I didn't have to if I made a sincere effort to live a life that benefitted others.""  In my view, what's needed is not further suffering by Russell Snyder.  More suffering benefits no one.  If he is able to move on to a productive nonviolent life, I only hope that it includes more writing.  What's needed, I think, is for the rest of us to appreciate how a book like this one already benefits others.Start with Snyder's condemnation of the effort underway during his time in Iraq to recruit Iraqis to take over the killing of Iraqis.  A similar effort is failing miserably in Afghanistan right now, without any alternative entering the minds of our public policy decision makers.Look at Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's bewilderment at the Libyans' lack of appreciation for all that our bombs have done to their country.  Here's a book that could ease our national case of bewilderment as to why the recipients of our ""aid"" tend to show so little gratitude.The importance of this book is that it takes someone who largely believes (or used to believe) in U.S. propaganda and puts him into face-to-face exchanges with its victims.  These exchanges are riveting:After Snyder's team blasts an area with an instruction to leave, they find an old man in a house with two young boys.  The old man asks where in the world he was supposed to go, the desert?  ""A tear formed in a wrinkled corner of the man's eye and sparkled down his cheek.  ""'I have my son's family here too.  You shot him driving his tractor home.  He was a good man, an innocent man.'  ""He pointed up the street to the burnt-out remnant of a vehicle.  The Marines had destroyed several vehicles with tank rounds during the push into the city, which they identified as potential suicide car bombs. It was pointless to wonder whose version of events was true.  The son was dead, or at the very least his father was a good actor.  ""'I'm sorry to hear of your loss, but sometimes there are accidents in war.  You fought against Iran, did you not?  You know things like this happen.  There are bad people here, people who want to kill us.  We have to protect ourselves.  It is our job to make Iraq safer, and sometimes that means making hard decisions.  Maybe sometimes the wrong people do get caught in the middle.  We try to be careful, believe me.  The terrorists will stop at nothing, even killing children, but we Americans do our best to avoid unnecessary violence.  We follow the Geneva Conventions.  We want to help you.  That doesn't bring your son back, I know, but we are only trying to do our job.'  ""The man rebutted my statement, morosely shaking his head in disbelief that I could be so wrong.  ""'Iraq was safe before you came.  My town was quiet before you bombed it.  Now I cannot even go outside.  We don't have water.' He sighed. 'If you can just let me go to the water valve down the street, I can maybe turn the water back on.'  ""'I can't make that decision.  Our commander wants everyone to stay home.  It's better if you stay inside, safer.  We can bring you water later.'  ""I turned to Sonny. 'Ask him if he has ever seen strangers here.'  ""I looked back in the old man's eyes. 'Has he seen foreign fighters here.'  ""Sonny paused.  'He says, ""Just you.""'  ""I squeezed my eyes shut at the old man's audacity and pinched the bridge of my nose.  It was a true statement, from his perspective, that I was a foreign fighter, but not the answer I looked for.  ""'There are dead Africans in the street up there.  He never saw anyone like that?'  ""The man shook his head.  ""'He didn't know there was a torture dungeon just down the road, where they kept captured border guards?  He never heard a scream? They didn't think it was safe here.'  ""I carefully watched the man's reaction to the news there had been such crimes committed so close to his home.  He showed no surprise.  ""'If you say so,' the old man replied. 'I don't know anything.'""","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U8PGTHMPR1PE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161200105X#wasThisHelpful","R3U8PGTHMPR1PE","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To your average educated careful consumer of U.S. news media, our militarism looks like ad hoc reactionary responses. A crisis flairs up here. We ""intervene"" there. An irrational foreign dictator threatens the peace over yonder. We get into wars because we have no choice, and then continue them because ending them would be somehow even worse than continuing them.In fact, there is a method to the madness. I don't mean just the pressure that President Eisenhower warned us would be created by massive military spending. I mean that the war planners have planned far ahead. They have lists of upcoming wars. (In 2001, according to Wesley Clark, the Pentagon sought wars in the coming years with Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran. Tony Blair independently confirmed a similar list.) They invent the public excuses for those wars as the need arises. The actual motivations are not humanitarian, but driven by a crazed desire to dominate the world's economies, waterways, and fossil fuels.The papers of the 1990s pro-war think tank, the Project for the New American Century, fit with and explain what the United States and NATO and their allies have done for the past 11 years far better than President Bush's speech given on the wreckage of the World Trade Center or anything announced by the White House right up through President Obama's latest campaign speeches this week.A new book called ""The Globalization of NATO"" by Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya traces the development of NATO, from a supposedly defensive and North Atlantic organization, into an aggressive and global one, albeit one with some deep internal rivalries and tensions.World War II never ended. The Nazi scientists were brought to the United States to continue developing weapons. Secret forces were left behind, within European governments (""Gladio"" is the well-known name of the force in Italy), where they killed and lied in support of right-leaning governments for decades, and in support of NATO's strength and unity.""The Globalization of NATO"" looks not only at NATO's 1990s wars in Yugoslavia, but at the U.S. machinations during the 1980s that led to conflict there. As Nazemroaya notes, in 2009, the U.S. eagerly pointed out that the language of Moldova is essentially Romanian, but had when useful in the 1990s tried to claim that the Serbo-Croatian of Bosnia was a different language from the Serbo-Croatian of Serbia. Such claims, like outrage at human rights abuses in Syria and Iran but not in Bahrain or Saudi Arabia, are opportunistic.When U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright learned of a massacre in a Kosovan village, Racak, she delightedly exclaimed, ""Spring has come early!"" NATO was able to begin its campaign of ""humanitarian wars"" with massive bombing of civilians. But the enemy wasn't the people of Yugoslavia. The enemies were Russia and China and Iran. They are the enemies today. In 1999, NATO bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and that same Wesley Clark ordered British and French troops to attack the Russian military. Luckily, those troops refused that order, not wanting to be pawns in a game that risky.World domination means controlling nations like Iraq and Libya, and placing bases and pipelines in places like Afghanistan, where they could benefit the West but hurt Russia, China, and Iran. It also means expanding Europe, NATO, and the European Union, to control the entire Mediterranean (which is how Lebanon and Syria become key targets). It means controlling the Arctic with Canada's help. It means weaponizing outerspace. It means dominating Africa. It means surrounding Russia and China with missiles, bases, and ships, prepared to cut off their trade. It means imposing as much suffering as possible on the Iranian people. It means redefining sociopathic acts as rational inevitabilities.Obama's turn toward Asia, and all the new bases and troops popping up in Australia, Guam, South Korea, and Japan, began before and will continue after Obama. It is part of a strategy to surround China. It is driving a new arms race and new tensions. While China's military spending is still only about a tenth of the U.S.'s, it has grown four-fold in recent years. The arms race has carried over to the Middle East as well, with the United States tripling its sales of weapons to foreign dictatorships last year. All of which is great for weapons makers. It's also part of the madness of the method behind our militarism.Which is not to say that everything goes as planned. Military operations accurately label themselves with the term ""SNAFU"", and pockets of resistance have been known to spring up and grow rapidly. Ecuador and other Latin American nations, as well as Uzbekistan and other Central Asian nations, have found the strength to tell NATO to head on back to the North Atlantic. The Non-Aligned Nations representing the majority of the people on earth just met in Iran and proposed, among other things, plans for total nuclear disarmament. Perhaps the aligned nations should join the non-aligned nations in more ways than one. Perhaps the institution of NATO should join nuclear weaponry on the pile of bad ideas whose time has come and gone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MHL0RZACCMFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985271027#wasThisHelpful","R3MHL0RZACCMFC","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the most inspiring events thus far at the Veterans For Peace National Convention underway in Miami was a presentation on Thursday by several veterans who have refused to participate in war. Typically, they have done this at the risk of significant time in prison, or worse. In most cases these resisters avoided doing any time. Even when they did go behind bars, they did so with a feeling of liberation.Gerry Condon refused to deploy to Vietnam, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, escaped from Fort Bragg, left the country, and came back campaigning for amnesty. President Jimmy Carter pardoned resisters as his first act in office. Condon never ""served"" a day, in either the military ""service"" or prison.Jeff Paterson of Courage to Resist refused to fly to Iraq, choosing instead to sit down on the tarmac. Ben Griffin from VFP's new chapter in the U.K. refused to participate in our nations' wars and has been issued a gag order. He's not permitted to speak, and yet he speaks so well. Mike Prysner of March Forward and Camilo Mejia of VFP here in Miami described their acts of resistance.Mejia did us all the enormous favor some years back of putting his story down in a book -- an extreme rarity, sadly, for peace activists with great stories to tell. Mejia's book ""Road From Ar Ramadi"" is a terrific introduction for anyone wondering why someone would sign up for the military and then refuse to kill people. Mejia, who now works on domestic civil rights issues in Miami while remaining part of the antiwar movement (another rarity), is a co-convenor of the VFP convention.In October 2003, Mejia was the first U.S. soldier to publicly refuse to fight in Iraq. At that time only 22 members of the U.S. military had gone AWOL from that war, a number that would quickly climb into the thousands as the war worsened and as belief in the various rationales offered for the war evaporated. Soldiers also began to refuse particular missions that would be likely to kill civilians or to put themselves at risk for no purpose other than the advancement of a commander's career -- a commander safely giving orders from a base. Veterans of the Iraq War would soon work with Veterans For Peace to form a new organization, Iraq Veterans Against the War. But at the time of Mejia's refusal to fight he stood virtually alone.Mejia joined the military largely for the very same reason most Americans do: the lack of other options. He had worked his way through high school and community college. But the government cut off his financial aid, and he couldn't afford the college bills. The Army offered him college tuition and financial security. That was enough. This son of Sandinista revolutionaries headed off to Fort Benning, the home of the School of the Americas, where he would train to kill for U.S. empire.Mejia learned to dislike the military. His commitment was due to end in May 2003. But in January 2003, the Florida National Guard shipped off to begin the invasion of Iraq that President Bush was publicly pretending to try to avoid and privately concocting harebrained schemes to get started. Mejia's contract was extended to 2031 (not a typo), and he was sent to Jordan. He was neither for nor against the military or the war in any simple sense. He was aware of the massive peace demonstrations around the world. He disliked many things about the military and about this particular war, which he believed was a war for oil. But he was loyal and obedient, not yet convinced of the extreme immorality of the operation in which he was playing a part.Mejia's first experience in Iraq involved the abuse of prisoners. He disliked these practices but did not resist. Mentally he tried to brush them aside as the work of ""a few bad apples."" Or he tried to justify doing what he was doing out of loyalty to the soldiers around him.Mejia gradually became aware of Iraqis' desire that the occupation end, but he believed it would end very quickly. During an Iraqi protest, a young Iraqi man was about to toss a grenade, and Mejia aimed and fired -- as did others around him. The young man died instantly, but the trouble the incident aroused in Mejia's soul did not.Mejia was troubled by his fellow soldiers' racist hatred of all Iraqis. Innocent Iraqis were imprisoned and interrogated, when they weren't shot. Their dead bodies were mistreated by joking soldiers snapping photos with their prize pieces of flesh. ""It occurred to me,"" Mejia writes of some Iraqis who observed such actions, ""how upsetting it must have been for them to see their relative in the dirt, half naked and covered in blood, being laughed at and humiliated even in death.""The beginnings of resistance among the troops arose out of their growing awareness that their commanders were using them in a competition for the most fire fights, the most kills, and the most prisoners. The needs of this competition outweighed justice or even strategy. Returning to base with innocent prisoners was far preferable to returning empty-handed. There was no grander goal driving any operations, as far as the soldiers could see. They went on patrols the entire purpose of which was to guard themselves as they patrolled.As Iraqi resistance grew, so did U.S. fear, to the point where troops would fire even on unarmed children if the soldiers couldn't be certain that the children posed no danger. Mejia understood both points of view, and came to realize that in war the choices are bad or horrendous. The only good choice, he began to see, is to not cooperate with war at all.At one point Mejia tried to explain to some Iraqis something he barely believed any longer himself, that the war was aimed at bringing ""freedom"" to the people of Iraq. One of the Iraqis who knew something about Mejia's situation pointed out that Mejia wished to leave the military and could not. ""So how,"" this Iraqi asked, ""can you bring freedom to us, when you don't have freedom for yourselves?"" When Mejia took part in raids of Iraqi houses, he viewed the terror the Iraqis showed of U.S. capture and ""detention"" as misguided. Surely prisoners would all be fairly tried and released if innocent, he told himself. ""As it turned out,"" Mejia admits, ""the families . . . knew my own army much better than I did.""Yet the troops that left the bases knew more than the commanders who didn't. The latter, falsely believing that resistance was coming from outside the local area, ordered all the wrong roads blockaded to no purpose. The soldiers who knew such decisions were wrong dared not say anything for fear of what challenging a ""superior"" can do to your career.Mejia was able to return to the United States for two weeks' leave. He went AWOL with assistance from peace groups, and turned himself in to face possible imprisonment. He'd ""served"" more than the eight years he'd agreed to. And he believed the war was killing human beings for no useful purpose whatsoever.A mockery of a charade of a pretense of a trial convicted Mejia and sentenced him to 1 year in jail. ""That day,"" as he went to jail, Mejia recalls, ""I was free, in a way I had never been before.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL4ZOV3Q7KTIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078XQ8RG#wasThisHelpful","RL4ZOV3Q7KTIE","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fast forward to 2048. The world is greatly changed, and in this year China invades France, occupying Paris and a good portion of the nation. The French are massacred, evicted, raped, chased, and terrorized. Towns are destroyed. Every town and village has its name changed to a Chinese name, and its prior existence erased from any history books produced from then forward.Portions of France not yet under Chinese control shelter refugees by the millions. French citizens captured in their homes are held as ""prisoners of war"" and freed to become refugees in distant parts of France. China changes the name of its occupied areas from France to Chance. The remaining parts of the country are just referred to by their local (Chinese) names, as if they were part of no nation at all and yet somehow Chinese in the end.For years, the Chancian government continues to expand and to assault the French people. With more and more immigrants from China, Chance becomes an apartheid nation with lesser rights for any French within it. In 2067, Chance launches a major assault, seizing control of much of what's left of France. The newly seized areas come to be called ""the occupied territories,"" in contrast to the already occupied territories, which are called simply Chance.As the years pass, Chancian children are born and raised in Chance who had nothing to do with the original invasion. In fact, they are never even told about it. At most they are taught that Chance was founded in 2048 when the French voluntarily left and the true border of the Chancian nation was drawn on a map with a purple line. That purple line is also called ""the line of 2067,"" even though it was drawn in 2048. Outside of that purple line are the occupied territories and the few towns and villages left to the French.Liberals in Chance propose giving ""the occupied territories"" back to the French and restoring the Purple Line, while conservatives propose eliminating the last French descendant from Europe. Those are the extremes of the political debate in Chance. Everything within the Purple Line is universally agreed upon as properly Chancian. The agreement runs so deep that the question is never raised at all. The original sin in Chancian history is dated to 2067 when the Chancian democracy strayed outside its natural borders and violated the rights of others for the first time.But, of course, Chancian families are raised through the years outside as well as inside the Purple Line, a line that had never been agreed to in any way by the French, a line that would deny many of them the right to return to their homes.The French want reparations and restoration. They date the catastrophe of their nation to 2048. The Chancians are willing to talk about undoing anything they've done since 2067, including through the creation of a French nation. The French nation would include several geographically separated bits of territory in northern and southern parts of the former France. It would remain subject to the rule of Chance on major questions. And the new France would have to agree to the rightful existence of Chance inside the Purple Line -- or the Purple Line plus a little.So, a lengthy and seemingly endless process is created called the Peace Process. The French show up wanting to talk about 2048. The Chancians show up willing to talk only about 2067. The two sides never hear each other. There is never any peace. The Chancians announce at the end of each failed meeting that they ""have no partner"" with which to negotiate peace. Hostilities and a permanent state of emergency prevail, with French people within Chance and Chance's ""occupied territories"" deprived of basic rights, imprisoned, tortured, and assaulted. The other nations of Europe join with the French in resenting the behavior of Chance. The nations of Asia, however, celebrate Chance as ""the only democracy in Europe.""***There are several differences between this story and the story of Israel and Palestine. Some of the differences are trivial: The dates are 1948 and 1967, not 2048 and 2067. The line is green rather than purple. Some of the differences are significant: The Jewish culture always had ties to Israel. The religious element allows for an intermediary class of citizens consisting of Arab Jews. Et cetera.But morally, the differences seem only to obscure what matters. The state of Israel was created through ethnic cleansing. It was created as a state to privilege one religious group, something that states should not do. But two wrongs cannot make a right. Evicting Israelis from their homes, inside or outside the Green Line, is not a solution.Yehouda Shenhav's new book, ""Beyond the Two State Solution: A Jewish Political Essay"" tells the story above, but straightforwardly, without the analogy. The language of the Green Line, Shenhav writes, is ""a language through which Israel is described as a liberal democracy, while the Arabs (and Mizrachi and religious Jews to boot) are described as inferior and undemocratic. This is the language of someone who came to the Middle East for a short while, not to integrate but to exist here as a guest. The position it expresses is not only immoral with regard to the Palestinians, but also potentially disastrous for the Jews. It commits them to life in a ghetto with a limited idea of democracy based on racial laws and a perpetual state of emergency.""Shenhav wants to restore awareness of 1948, but not to try to reconstruct the world of 1948. He does not propose eliminating Israel. He does not propose uniting the people of Israel and Palestine into a single nation.He does propose allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in a manner least disturbing to Israelis already living in those villages or buildings, including with compensation paid to residents evicted by an agreement with returning refugees. He proposes a bilingual society, with a fragmented political federation. He expects this to be very difficult, while preferable to any other approach. And he rightly sees the first step as recovering honesty with regards to not-so-distant history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZMS6FVFY6WW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745660290#wasThisHelpful","R1ZMS6FVFY6WW5","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Apocalypse has been given a bad name.  The Seventh Day Adventists are still around.  The Nike sneaker cult failed to open Heaven's Gate.  The new millennium brought us George W. Bush, not Jesus H. Christ.  And everybody's terrified of ""drinking the Kool-Aid.""But our species is living beyond its means.  If we continue down this path, the planet, our food supplies, our climate, and life as we know it will collapse.  If we bring population growth, consumption, and pollution under control, the damage already set in motion will play out for centuries, but complete catastrophe will likely be averted.Nobody likes to be told that the end might be near.  Either it is or it isn't.  And the question is resolved by a personal lifestyle choice.  Do I wish to be a pessimist or an optimist?  Of course, optimist is far more popular.  Even most predictors of apocalypse have actually believed they were predicting a good thing.  The world was to be replaced with something better.  Even our best environmentalists who understand the radical changes needed for survival guarantee they will happen.  Harvey Wasserman says he simply believes in happy endings.Meanwhile, we can barely get half of us in the United States to ""believe"" that global warming is happening.  Of course, we step outside and there's a sauna, but that could just be ""natural.""  So what if the ocean is a few inches higher?  The people who've been predicting that for decades have been wrong until now, and now they're only a little right -- if you even believe them.  The ocean looks about the same to me.  And if they predict exponential acceleration of such changes, meaning that once the changes have become visible it won't be long before they're enormous, well that just proves one thing: they've drunk the Kool-Aid.  They're pessimists.In 1992, governments finally got together in Rio and took some baby steps.  In 2012, they reconvened and collectively proclaimed, ""To hell with all that.  This rock may be doomed, but that's our great-grandchildren's problem.  Screw them! This is Rio.  Roll down the windows.  Turn up the air conditioning.  Pass me a drink!""  Well, actually, a few scientists and diplomats stood off to the side and muttered, ""What we need to save us is a really bad catastrophe.""  And a 17-year-old girl stood up and blurted out the truth, which made everybody feel really important.  Imagine: you were at the meeting that could have chosen to save the planet; how cool is that?  Imagine how the judge feels who is sitting in Washington, D.C., deliberating on whether the atmosphere ought to be protected or destroyed.  The atmosphere!  Of the earth!  Now that's power, and the longer you deliberate the longer you can fantasize about possibly even using that power.In 1972 a group of scientists published a book called Limits to Growth.  It passionately urged the changes needed before human growth and destruction exceeded the carrying capacity of the planet.  In 1992, the same authors published Beyond the Limits.  There were by then, they found, too many humans doing too much damage.  We were beyond sustainable limits and would need to change quickly.  In 2004, they published an update, arguing that we were already 20 percent above global carrying capacity, and that we had ""largely squandered the past 30 years.""  Their warnings grew sharper: ""We do not have another 30 years to dither.""The updated book charts the course we've been on these past 30, now 40, years.  Population has exploded in less industrialized countries.  Many millions of poor people have been added to our species, while a shrinking percentage of the world's population has continued to hoard most of the wealth.  The planet has become less equitable through the repeated act of giving birth.  Then it has become less equitable still through economic growth that has been made to benefit most those least in need.  Meanwhile, nations with high population growth have been least able to invest in infrastructure, being obliged to take care of their people's immediate needs.  This has resulted in still greater poverty, triggering higher birth rates in families dependent on children to survive.  These vicious cycles can be broken, and have been broken, but not by wishing or hoping.  And time is running out.Sustainable agriculture is being practiced in some places and could feed us all if practiced everywhere and the food distributed to everyone.  The problem is not figuring out what to do so much as simply doing it.  But we can't do it individually, and we can't wait for those in power to do it on their own.Corporations will not learn to make more money by behaving responsibly, not to a sufficient extent to reverse current trends.  The logic of the market will not correct itself, except in the most brutal sense.  If we wait for Wall Street to decide that destroying the Earth is a bad idea, the basic systems of life on Earth will collapse in shortages, crises, and widespread suffering.  Instead, we have to enforce change as a society, and we have to do it now.  If we'd acted in 1982, write the authors of Limits to Growth, we might have avoided serious damage.  If we'd acted in 2002, we also still had a fighting chance.  By 2022, it will be too late to avoid decline.  We're halfway there.Limits to Growth offers the crisis of the ozone layer as evidence that humanity can face up to a global environmental disaster and correct it.  Of course, we can.  We have always had that option and always will.  Even beyond 2022, we will have the option of lessening the destruction to as great an extent possible.  But slowing the damage to the ozone layer required changes to a relatively small industrial cartel, nothing to compare to big oil.  The question is not, I think, whether the world can act collectively on behalf of the Earth.  The question is whether the world can act collectively against the organized strength of the fossil fuels industry, its closely aligned military forces in the United States and NATO, and governments far gone down the path of inverted totalitarianism.For you optimists, I should point out that living sustainably need not mean suffering.  We could live better lives with less consumption and destruction.  Our culture can grow while our population declines.  Our society can advance while our production of waste products retreats.  Our mental horizons can broaden while our food sources narrow.  Millennia from now, people living sustainably on this planet could look back with wonder at the insanity of the notion that everything had to grow, and with gratitude toward those who gave their fellow passengers an awakening smack to the face.Here's one small place to start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22GR1KDAY39SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=184407143X#wasThisHelpful","R22GR1KDAY39SC","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Which came first, the oil business or the war machine that protects it? Who started this madness, the military that consumes so much of the oil or the corporations that distribute and profit from the filthy stuff?An answer of sorts can be found in Timothy Mitchell's book, ""Carbon Democracy: Political Power in the Age of Oil.""Western oil corporations were never strong enough, Mitchell finds, to monopolize the flow or stoppage of Middle Eastern oil without major military and financial assistance. So, they began talking about their control of Middle Eastern oil as being an imperial interest. When ""imperial"" went out of fashion, the phrase shifted to ""strategic interest.""Early in the 20th century, the Anglo Persian Oil Company discovered that its oil stank. It contained high levels of sulfur, and people wouldn't burn it for illumination. So, the oil company enlisted the British Navy, as a customer. In fact, it pretended the Navy was a major customer for a few years until it actually became one. The British empire thus developed an interest in protecting the company's control of the oil of what is now Iran, in order to fuel the new ships of the Navy -- a navy designed to protect Britain's imperial interests.The Royal Navy had another reason for shifting to oil-burning ships, according to Mitchell. Coal miners were developing the annoying habit of going on strike, effectively flicking off the light switch on the empire and all its toys. Coal mining involved more workers than oil drilling, and the movement of the coal, once mined, was more easily blocked en route. Coal, and the ease with which it could be sabotaged, was a driver of democracy, whereas oil would be its enemy.Mitchell also describes British support for the Zionist settlement of Palestine in the 1920s as motivated by a desire to create a population in need of protection, protection that would involve controlling the flow of oil from Iran to the Mediterranean. Well, ... that and a population to serve as protectors of the pipeline. In 1936-1939 the British created a force of armed Jewish settlers to guard the Haifa-Lydda railway line -- a force that would form the nucleus of the army that seized control of Palestine in 1948.Also in 1920 Winston Churchill proposed winning hearts and minds in what is now Iraq by bombing the place, to which the British secretary of state for war objected thus: ""If the Arab population realize that the peaceful control of Mesopotamia ultimately depends on our intention of bombing women and children, I am very doubtful if we shall gain the acquiescence of the fathers and husbands."" Such logic would no more stop Winston Churchill than it would Barack Obama.Come the second world war, and it was the turn of U.S. oil companies to win subsidies from their government to develop production in the Middle East ... to meet the needs of the U.S. military, which in turn would end up viewing the bulk of its needs as consisting of wars to control that oil whenever CIA coups wouldn't do the trick. Immediately after the 1945 talks at Yalta, the United States wanted to move forces from Europe to the Pacific, and to refuel planes in the Middle East. That need motivated President Roosevelt to meet with Ibn Saud. The agreement with Saudi Arabia regarding its oil followed. By the time a U.S. air base was built in Saudi Arabia, the Pacific war was over. But the oil companies had learned that for them every advantage lay in talking about their work as if it were somehow in the ""strategic interest"" of the United States.Next came the giving and selling of mountains of weapons to the dictators of the Middle East, also justified as ""strategic."" The real explanation for the dramatic rise in such sales in the 1960s, according to Mitchell, was that the oil-rich dictators had more money than they could spend on anything else. They might have invested in improving the lives of the people of their nations, of course, but much of that spending would have flowed to third nations. With weapons, the United States could remain the sole provider, or at least try to. It could also enrich its weapons companies. Oil companies actually opposed selling weapons to Iran and argued for ceasing to back Israeli settlements. But weapons companies won out every time.To the extent that the oil companies started the cycle of killing people with war in order to kill the planet with oil, they did so through the power of connections (even if fictional) to weapons sales. The British Navy drove the demand for Western dominance of the world's oil supply, just as the U.S. military today consumes vast quantities of the oil it fights its wars over.In fact, if we go back before history, and ask the question of which came first, wars or the weapons with which to fight them, the answer is fairly clear. The weapons came first. They were developed for fighting lions and bears. They were turned against humans when the lions and bears had been effectively reduced or eliminated. Intense agriculture, used to feed the warriors who would not feed themselves, and to provide them with their weapons, served the purpose later served by oil extraction.It was the military that came first. It is always the military that comes first. And it is the military that pushes relentlessly to own the last word as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBZIH8A53AP1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1844677451#wasThisHelpful","RBZIH8A53AP1Z","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Florida Sun Sentinel has for many years been rather unique, as a corporate newspaper with a regular columnist who's actually good, and I don't mean just good for the context, but actually worth reading even if the masses of South Florida weren't reading along.  Happily, they are.Stephen L. Goldstein has just published a book, also worth reading, called Atlas Drugged (Ayn Rand Be Damned!)  It's fiction, often hilarious fiction, aimed at debunking the notion that Ayn Randian ""free-market"" trickle-down crapitalism can coexist with basic human decency.  ""This is a work of fiction,"" says the back cover.  ""But any resemblance to actual events, locales, or persons, living or dead, is entirely intentional.  The names have been changed but, hopefully, not enough to protect the guilty.""In fact, while the book takes rightwingerism to an extreme, it blends in plenty of elements from reality.  Imagine the most outlandish carrying of so-called conservatism to its logical conclusion, and abandoning New Orleans to a hurricane, or watching a fire department stand by while a house burns (because the owner didn't pay the proper fees) fits right in.The opening scene is basically a CPAC conference set in a world in which normal had become one of today's CPAC conferences.  The speeches of the fascists who populate this book ought to echo in the reader's head when he or she later hears the speeches of actual politicians, because the former are just slightly exaggerated versions of the latter.The heroes of the book are part Occupy Wall Street, part Anonymous.  People march by the millions.  They organize and inspire.  They shut down all the department stores owned by a particular plutocrat, simply by ""shopping"" en masse, without actually buying anything.  But other tactics, from stunts involving animal dung (you have to read it) to hacking into the sound system at important events, rely on a small, secretive band of super-heroes -- too much so, I suspect.  A real revolution is more likely to come through a combination that relies more heavily on popular action and less on the secret heroics of beings who fuse together Julian Assange with the Yes Men and MacGyver.I also wish there weren't quite so much nationalism in what is after all a fantasy of an ideal future at war with a kleptocratic dystopia.  But if you're going to go all in for the founders and the red-white-and-blue, it would have been better to remember the one thing the founders got most right that we have most forgotten: you don't give a single individual power.  You can't solve tyranny through a presidential election, replacing a bad tyrant with a good one.  You have to divide and check power, reducing the president to an impotent executive.  In fact, one would hope that after a couple of centuries we would be able to at least fantasize about moving further toward direct democracy, and away from monarchy.Be that as it may, it's not as if ""Atlas Drugged"" is going to move people in the direction of pinning their hopes on presidential candidates more than they already do (a physical impossibility).  It is, however, going to deservedly and comically drag through the mud of its own making the disgustingly stupid idea that greed and selfishness are the smart way to be kind and generous.  The result, I hope and expect, will be a greater ability to spot the absurdity of the political philosophy being satirized.  If THIS is where free-market principles lead, if the catastrophe carved out by the job-creators in this book is what we're consciously attempting to arrive at, then we'd better reject as absolutely evil many of the assumptions and claims we encounter every day in the rhetoric and the policy coming from our politicians, including of course -- this being reality after all -- both of our leading candidates for president.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18CRS1F9Z8DA0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1555717098#wasThisHelpful","R18CRS1F9Z8DA0","A2LPEQS27G5S58","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LPEQS27G5S58?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Purchased primarily to clean up after my 4 lovebirds who love to toss things through their cage bars. They are super messy! This vacuum has worked wonders getting into crevices the regular vacuum cannot. It is very handy to grab off the charger.

"Model Number: P-FD256TBOP-GEI purchased one of these PNY 256 GB Turbo 3.0 USB Flash Drives when they first hit the market. After using the flash drive for a few months without any problems; I purchased a second. I also recommended this flash drive to my IT department. They now have several of these PNY 256GB Flash Drive that are used for desktop backups and restores. With the heavy use that these flash drives get I would definitely say that they have all been tested to be fast and reliable.I noticed that there were a small handful of reviewers having problems understanding how to use a flash drive. Here are a few facts about USB flash drives. Most all USB flash drives come formatted in the FAT32 files system so that they are compatible with all operating systems (old and new). FAT32 only supports files of 4GB or less. If you plan on copying files larger than 4GB, it‚Äôs EASY to reformat any USB Flash Drive to another files system. The most common file system to use today is exFAT, which is supported by Mac, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS, and more. The exFAT file system will give you increased file transfer speeds due to larger cluster sizes, and exFAT will support files as large as 16EB ‚ÄúExabyte‚Äôs‚Äù (or 1 million TB). You can also do a web search for the term ‚ÄúBenefits of the exFAT File System‚Äù, you will find tons of great reading if you choose to do additional research.Additionally, when reading reviews, take in to consideration that anyone can post something even if they don‚Äôt really understand the product or how it works. As a consumer, be careful that you don‚Äôt let an uninformed product reviewer detour you from making a good purchase. Notice that the large majority of reviewers gave this product four to five stars, there is a reason for this.PNY has a long history for producing fast and reliable Flash Drives. If you are thinking about buying a large capacity USB Flash Drive, this is a great deal, and you won‚Äôt be disappointed with what you will receive. The sliding cap, and Red LED file transfer indicator were an added plus.If my review was helpful to you in anyway, please click the ""Yes"" button below.

"As an avid comparison shopper, I found that Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Isolate is among the top brands that hold the highest in quality and best in value. Body Fortress does not use cheap, or unnecessary ingredients. With only 15mg of cholesterol per each 34-gram scoop, Body Fortress has a lower cholesterol level than most other brands on the market. I also found that Body Fortress does not use the artificial sweetener, Aspartame.I've ordered the 2-pound, Vanilla Cr√®me, Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Isolate from Amazon multiple times. The price per pound is less than you will pay for cheaper brands that are carried in your local drug store. You will really like the taste and it mixes really well without leaving lumps like some other brands do. If you are like me, you will really like the convenience of ordering from Amazon and having the product delivered to your door. So that I never run out, I place my new order when I see that I have about a quarter left in the container.

"This Canon PowerShot, is flat out an awesome camera. I‚Äôm a photographer, and I usually reserve all of my important pictures for my SLR. However, sometimes I just don‚Äôt want to take the expensive camera out, and lug around all of the accessories and lenses. Therefore I bought this camera.From the time I pulled it out of the box I could tell that it was build extremely well. The 42x Optical Zoom (24-1008mm) and 24mm Wide-Angle lens is incredible. For that same capability in a SLR you would pay a ton. I really became impressed one I started taking photos. Because of the size and versatility I find myself in more situations to take incredible shots, therefore this camera is quickly becoming my camera of choice when I go out. And for those that don‚Äôt understand the Zoom Framing Assist technology, this is a great feature. The frame assist really does make it easy to track your subject while using the extreme telephoto. If you have never used extreme telephoto without a tripod before, then you know what I mean (sSHaKyyy BuSiNeSsSs)!Although I never considered shooting videos on my other cameras, I find that the 1080p full HD video on this camera has come in handy a few times while at a ball game. Oh, and you can take it in to professional ball games without being hassled. Did you know that some stadiums do not allow fans to bring professional grade SLR‚Äôs, or cameras with long telephoto lenses? They say that the right to use a professional camera in the stadiums is reserved for the sports press. Well with this camera, you don‚Äôt have that problem. You can take it into any stadium you want, and you will have the ability to zoom right in on the player‚Äôs faces and even people on the other side of the stadium.For the money, you cannot get a better deal. In fact, I would have easily paid a hundred dollars more for this camera.If my review was helpful to you in anyway, please click the ""Yes"" button below.

"I bought this Dell Venue 8, 16 GB Tablet (Android) Directly from Amazon 5 months ago. I don't like to write reviews before I have time to really test a product out. After five months of having this tablet, I can sincerely say this was a great deal! I purchased a few other brands of Android tablets at the local Electronics Chain store before getting my hand on this tablet. After comparing several models, and brands, this tablet, it had a clearer screen, and overall seemed to be built really sturdy. I'm not saying this is the very best android tablet out there, but for the price that you'll pay for others, compared to what you'll pay for this one. This is an awesome deal. Whenever I purchase an item, I compare every single detail. On tablets I compared the RAM Speed, the CPU Clock Speed, the screen pixels and more. This tablet best out the rest as for best bang for your buck.And don't worry that is ships with 4.2 Jelly Bean, and not the latest 4.4 Kit Kat, as soon as you boot up this tablet for the first time, simply go in to settings and then upgrade to 4.4 for free. You can upgrade quickly and without buying anything. It's completely automatic (see screenshot). I wish the manufacturer websites would tell you that but they don't. I had to find that out on my own.Another little handy perk about this tablet, it didn't ship with a bunch of unwanted demo apps that couldn't be removed. There are some tablet brands out there that ship with pre-installed demo applications that cannot be uninstalled. That was very upsetting to me, therefore I was very happy when I found out this Dell tablet did not ship with these types of non-removable demo applications. Based on this purchase, I would definitely buy another one of these tablets as technology evolves.If you feel this review was useful, please click the ""Yes"" button below.

"I was first introduced to the Happy Morning Toothbrush with Xylitol while at my dentist. My dentist hands these toothbrushes out to each patient, to quickly brush their teeth before sitting in the dental chair. All you have to do is quickly run these toothbrushes under the faucet for a second and start brushing. The Xylitol coated bristles quickly foam up like toothpaste, and allows you to effectively brush your teeth.I was so impressed by this innovative idea that I went home and searched for them on Amazon. I was very happy when I found that Cutting Edge International, LLC was selling these disposable toothbrushes. I now keep a few of these with me at all times. I leave a few in the glove box of my car, if you at work, in my gym bag, and I put a few in my inside coat pocket before going out for the evening.These are super handy and very effective disposable toothbrushes.

"I purchased the ‚ÄúTranscend JetDrive Lite 130 128GB Storage‚Äù after running across it while searching for 128GB flash drives. Wow, what a fantastic find!!The Transcend JetDrive Lite 130 is an inexpensive way of increasing your storage, and is a great concept. I just bought a new 2014 MacBook Air with a 120GB internal hard drive thinking that this would fulfill my laptop storage needs. However after uploading all of my digital photos to my new computer, I soon realized that I didn‚Äôt have much storage left on my hard drive. I tried inserting a SD card in the side of my MacBook Air, however it stuck out to far. I also tried a mini USB flash drive, which also stuck out more than I liked. Additionally, I don‚Äôt think they make a USB mini flash drive any larger then 64GB, if they do I couldn‚Äôt find one.The Transcend JetDrive Lite 130 128GB Storage was the perfect solution as well as the least inexpensive option per gigabyte. The JetDrive allowed me to double my storage space, and it sits completely flush, leaving no chance of being caught on something and being broken off.The read write access times of the JetDrive are pretty good, with 95 MB per second read and 60 MB per second write. These read write speeds are actually fast enough to run virtual machines directly from the Transcend JetDrive. I have a 32 GB Windows 7 virtual machine and a 16 GB Linux virtual machine running directly off of the JetDrive. If I were to store both of these virtual machines on the native internal hard drive it would need to take 40% of the 120GB internal hard drive which I would not be able to do without removing all of my digital photos. Placing my virtual machines on the JetDrive was a great option.You can also use the Mac operating system to encrypt the data on the JetDrive just like you would the internal drive. The JetDrive is more reliable and sophisticated than a standard SD card or USB flash drive because of the ‚ÄúBuilt-In Error Correction Code (ECC)‚Äù. The Transcend JetDrive mounts and dismounts automatically when you turn on or off your MacBook.I have used Transcend storage products in the past and have always been satisfied in the value and quality. For anyone who wants to add another 128GB to their MacBook, the Transcend JetDrive products are an incredibly great buy.If you feel my review was useful, please click the ""Yes"" button below.

"Today I received my ScreenPals Computer Reading Glasses from the seller, ‚ÄúIdeal Eyewear‚Äù. The seller shipped the glasses in a nice box and they arrived right on time. Ideal Eyewear also described the glasses adequately, and they looked exactly as pictured. The lense power chart that the seller provided was very helpful.When I first put the glasses on, I was a little concerned that they might not be durable because of their feather lightweight. However after wearing them all day today, durability is not a concern of mine at all. In fact these glasses are very durable, (which is great).I chose to give these glasses a really good test ride and wear them the entire day while on my computer. Then I took the glasses to another level and wore them while driving home. The light amber tent was very effective at softening the glare from the midday sky while driving. I also noticed that the glasses offered an additional benefit. The light amber tint actually has a visually warming effect, just like the warming filters that you would use on a camera. This visually warming effect had a positive influence on my mood. I felt like I had more energy today and I felt more upbeat.Now back to the intended effects of wearing these glasses. As computer reading glasses, these are absolutely perfect. By being rimless and lightweight it is extremely easy to forget that you're wearing the glasses. I had less I fatigue at the end of the day. When I did finally take off the glasses at the end of the evening and look at my computer screen at home I noticed that black text on white background weren't near as sharp as they were when viewing through these computer reading glasses. These classes absolutely remove the entire glare from your screen, which then causes the black text to sit flat on white backgrounds as if it's on paper, rather than a computer screen. I like these glasses so much that I'm going to order another pair right away before they run out. Thanks for offering these, Ideal Eyewear.

"In 2013, I published an extensive review of several orthotic inserts. Of all the insoles I have tried to date, the Superfeet brand are by far the best for me.

Besides offering the support I need to combat my plantar fasciitis and overpronation, Superfeet insoles provide me with a more consistent feel across everything I wear, allowing me a greater range of footwear than my tender feet would otherwise permit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K3V4TKQRJRN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QCSDLM#wasThisHelpful","R2K3V4TKQRJRN6","A18FHN51URF5VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FHN51URF5VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have owned several Fjallraven pieces over the years and loved them. Needing a parka, I was excited to see the Sarek Trekking Jacket on deep discount. When it arrived, I could see why it was discounted. The collar and hood design are inexplicably bad. The hood is oversized to the point of looking clownish. The collar, which is integrated with the hood, thus spreads so wide and stands so tall that when zipped all the way up, the collar stands higher than one's chin. It's a shame, too, because the rest of the jacket is so well done. Oh, well.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K3GSS25K2WYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLP6AX6#wasThisHelpful","R2K3GSS25K2WYR","A18FHN51URF5VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FHN51URF5VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My Bogs do well in the worst weather but are made for winter temperatures. My SWIMS are great for warm days but only in light rain. I needed boots for warm weather downpours that could protect my trouser hems without overheating my feet. So I ordered these and a pair of Tretorn Wings, both in navy. I kept the Tretorns only because the navy color was darker and flatter (more of a matte). In other respects, the two pair were quite similar. Both are styled simply, with prominent white trim at sole and opening. The Tretorns have a wing tab at the back of the opening to help tug the boots on. Though the Vikings lack the tab, I didn't really miss it, either. The boots were easy to pull on and pull off. Both the Vikings and Tretorns run long and a bit wide, as previous reviewers have noted. Though I normally wear a US 13D, I ordered US 12D and found the fit fine. Both  pairs of boots have inconsequential insoles that are easily removed to accommodate my insole of choice for boots: Superfeet merinoGREY, size F. With the Superfeet in place, I had no trouble maintaining my normal pace and stride while walking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33U3AWQBLPBLG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FG90XUC#wasThisHelpful","R33U3AWQBLPBLG","A18FHN51URF5VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FHN51URF5VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I gave this as a Christmas present to my nephew who is eleven and a Lego fanatic. He and I have built dozens of models together. This is one of the best I've seen in terms of detail and motility. However, it is not a model for newbies or young children. It includes significantly more pieces than a comparably-sized Lego model contains. And a higher proportion of the pieces are single-purpose, making it harder to improvise different configurations, if so inclined. My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that this model lives up to Cobi's reputation for especially tight fits. My nephew had some trouble getting a few pieces to interlock fully. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic replica of the WWII-era Sherman tank, the pieces interoperate with standard Lego blocks, and my nephew and I will be purchasing more Cobi models in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6IQ85PP0JK81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXOVG4W#wasThisHelpful","R6IQ85PP0JK81","A18FHN51URF5VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FHN51URF5VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed new winter boots for my mile-long daily commute on the sidewalks of Chicago. After reading several review sites (e.g., Outdoor Gear Lab) for direction, I settled on Bogs. I like the simplicity of the barn boot style: no laces, seams, or tooling to trap muck or allow seepage. I also like the assertive lugs on the outsole: they provide excellent purchase on slush and ice. Though I doubted the boot would be as warm as advertised, it is. I've worn them several days in sub-zero temperatures, walking in excess of 30"" at a time, and my feet stayed warm and dry from beginning to end.And comfortable. These boots come with a removable insole that is decent. However, I replaced mine with Merino wool Superfeet insoles and find the boots to be as comfortable as my Merrill hikers. I can maintain a normal walking gait and speed, too -- something I could not do with my old mid-calf boots. A prior reviewer mentioned discomfort with the side holes. They cause me no irritation (though I fold my trousers into the boot to avoid getting them wet or dirty) and they make it easier to carry filthy boots safely.Tall slip-ons are difficult to take off and this boot certainly is. I've since purchased boot jacks for home and office to limit the ridiculous yoga needed to remove them. Difficulty varies with the size and shape of one's foot and the type of sock worn. While I can remove them without mechanical assistance, it takes a few tugs and twists even when wearing cashmere/nylon socks (I have a low-arch 13D foot).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23T3OH7A8M8AG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006PAF9MI#wasThisHelpful","R23T3OH7A8M8AG","A18FHN51URF5VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FHN51URF5VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm privileged to live just a few blocks from St. James Cathedral in Chicago. Though I'm not a parishioner, I attend several music performances throughout the year. For most churches, Advent is the high point of their liturgical season. This is especially true for St. James. The choir is magnificent -- one of the best I've heard in the Chicago area -- and performs in an acoustically satisfying (if aesthetically challenged) cathedral in the River North neighborhood.Having heard the choir perform this Advent program live, I can vouch that the audio recording captures the sound very well. I play it every December. It never fails to pull me out of the holiday rush into a sacred state of mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHEU5J2LPFYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006X9GZBU#wasThisHelpful","RWHEU5J2LPFYU","A18FHN51URF5VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FHN51URF5VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a long-time Rick Steves follower, I rely on the RS titles heavily. We've used his guides on Great Britain, Spain, and Italy to enrich our travels and each title came through like a champ.On the whole, this was true for the Ireland guide, too. With it, we found some great pubs, added Kinsale to our itinerary (and loved our dinner at Fishy Fishy), and skipped Blarney Castle. Yet there are a few coverage gaps that keep me from giving it the five I usually award RS guides. Two gaps, in particular, are worth noting.Rick gives the Beara peninsula an ""honorable mention as a distant third choice"" (p. 202) to the better-known Dingle and Iveragh peninsulas. Yet Beara is the equal of Dingle in terms of natural beauty and is far less touristy. Even in summer, you can drive Beara all day and pass only a handful of vehicles, giving you ample time and space to explore its sights. We thoroughly enjoyed our two days and one night in Beara and were surprised it is mentioned only in an insert on pp. 202-203.We also found the chapter on County Clare thin. It mentions nothing of the trio of heritage attractions at Bunratty, Dunguaire, and Knappogue Castles. While medieval banquests and open-air folk parks are aimed squarely at tourists, they attract a great many travelers and are conspicuous by their absence in the guide. We went to Bunratty after reading the Trip Advisor reviews. While the dinner show was great fun, the folk park was a waste of an afternoon. I wish Rick had told me so.There are other gaps besides these (e.g., Ashford Castle gets a mention but Dromoland Castle does not even though both are considered two of the best heritage accommodations in all of Ireland). Still and all, the title was a fantastic aid for our family on our holiday in the Emerald Isle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U09HMS8OSENM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612383858#wasThisHelpful","R2U09HMS8OSENM","A18FHN51URF5VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FHN51URF5VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Based on other reviews, my wife and I bought this tablecloth for our dining table. Though the price seemed high, we are impressed by the quality and thickness of the covering. It has a generous layer of vinyl backed by poly-fleece that feels like it will last a long time. The color is not flat but mildly textured and looks much better than its picture indicates. It is also sewn in three pieces (with the two seams are parallel chords each roughly half the radius away from the diameter) so that there is no center seam. This is good. As thick as the tablecloth is, a center seam would be a problem for centerpieces, chargers, or trivets placed on it. The seams do run closer to the edge, so they may be a problem for a couple of place settings but that is an easier problem to handle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QK0DPO12SL40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NTRHPQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QK0DPO12SL40","A18FHN51URF5VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18FHN51URF5VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both in content and layout, this bible is great for older children. As other reviewers mentioned, font size and leading are generous and a great aid to newer readers.

"Having plantar fasciitis, I need a supportive sole even to putter around the house. Orthaheel slippers worked well for me. Sadly, Orthaheel build quality is not what it was; my last pair didn't hold up long with only light indoor use. So rather than purchase another pair, I looked at other brands. I researched umpteen models but couldn't find a summer-weight orthotic slipper that had good reviews. Back to the Orthaheel site I went. There I read about the slides and decided to give them a try.While not the same as slippers, and I'm still hunting, these slides give me good support and are easy to kick on and off. Like any slide, they make an annoying flip-flop sound on hard floors and have a tendency to slip off the foot if you're not careful.
