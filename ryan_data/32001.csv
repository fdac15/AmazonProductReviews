"Good case, but can be a bit tricky to slide in at times. Not really a case, but more rather a shell for the phone. Offers some protection to the sides, but the top and bottom are exposed leaving the edges susceptible to damage if it is ever dropped. The fit was good, the holster/stand works just fine. It doesn't add too much bulk to the phone. The clip is also lightweight. Offers 360 degree swivel on the clip so it can be worn any way. The stand also works well for propping up the phone. Overall, not a bad case, just lacking a bit on the protection side. It's a thin case/shell, so it's not going to offer too much in the way of drop protection here.I received this product at a discounted price for a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F63MPTGEIFTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OY9SG72#wasThisHelpful","R2F63MPTGEIFTY","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Real nice speed rope.  This is a great rope for workouts.  Lightweight, but very well made and durable rope.  Great for cardio workouts.  Great adjustability on the length of the rope for different sized users.  My wife has used it and even with shortening it, it still works great.  No problems with it.  Nicely designed and well made rope.  Great workout book with it.  The handles are great.  Very smooth when jumping rope with it.  Fast and tangle free use.  This is a fantastic workout tool.  Has to be one of the best speed ropes I've ever used.I received this item at a discounted price to review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K48M47A6Y19Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIQ3VWM#wasThisHelpful","R3K48M47A6Y19Y","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very good glass screen protector for the Note 5.  Fit was really good, the cutouts were right where they needed to be.  Easy to install after prepping the phone.  Once installed the touch sensitivity is the same as the phone itself without this glass on it.  Nice to have some extra added protection on your screens just in case.  This also works with pretty much any case out there on the market.  I wouldn't recommend using one with an existing plastic screen protector built it, it can cause issues.  I took the one off of my case and just use the glass now.  Doesn't affect the case at all.  Still works great.

"Fit is spot on with these glass screen protectors.  Cutouts are exactly where they should and need to be.  Covers the glass perfectly.  Very easy and simple to install after prepping the phones glass.  Once it's line up properly and laid down, there are absolutely no air bubbles at all.  Smooth and responsive just like the phone itself.  Touch is just as if you were touching the phone.  No lag, very responsive, works just fine.

"Nice case for the Note 4.  Fit and finish are really good for the price.  Easy to install and fits the phone great.  It seems like it should offer a good amount of protection from drops and bumps.  I have had it installed for a little while and now so far it seems to be holding up quite well.  I sometimes drop my phone on occasion and so far this has held up well enough for me.  No cracked screens or phone damage.  The case has taken the majority of the scuffs and dings, yet the phone is still in pristine condition.  I do like the multi layered design to this case with the outer cover, screen protector, rubber shell and backing.  I am not overly rough on my phones, but sometimes I have dropped it from the seat of my truck and it has hit concrete/pavement and the case has done its job 100%.  No damage to the phone at all.  May have to invest in a few of these.I received this product at a discounted price for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MVM0292J062Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNPU8YA#wasThisHelpful","R1MVM0292J062Q","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice sized mat.  It was larger than I had expected it to be and was quite happy with it.  Simple to use and easy to clean up.  No more litter tracks from the litter box.  The mat works great at grabbing it off our cats feet and keeping it there.  It may not grab all of it, but it does a great job of grabbing majority of it.  Material is nice, mat feels to be durable and heavy duty.

"Very nice 3 set of cutting boards for your kitchen.  These work well.  We have used them with fruits, vegetables, cheese, bread, etc.  They all work and have worked great.  Lightweight, but still durable.  Very easy to clean.  After a quick rinse, they go right into the dishwasher.  They take up no space in a drawer or cabinet.  My toddler son likes to cut up his bananas for a snack so my wife has taught him how to properly use a cutting board.  With a plastic butter knife of course.  He enjoys helping around the kitchen.  These are safe and very family friendly cutting boards.  Wife loves them and uses them quite often throughout the week for meals.

"This is a decent, belt, but the bottles that come with it are a tad bit smaller than I like.  I ended up taking them out and just using it to carry my own refillable water bottle.  The design and overall construction of the belt is nice.  Seems like it should hold up quite well to extensive use.  Good material and good stitching.  The pouches hold bottles well even if you use your own or anything store bought.  They will stay secured.  The front pouch is almost large enough for a tablet.  It will easily hold phones, cash, keys, etc. with not problems.  Belt is comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  I wore it for roughly 6-8 hours straight while at an amusement park.  Only thing I really had to do was occasionally adjust it.  It didn't bother me in any way what so ever.

"THESE LITTLE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT!!  Holy jeez...these will definitely light up a decent area to see.  Small and compact, but yet they do throw a good amount of light.  Also, they are solid feeling light.  Makes a great accessory light, bumper/brush guard light or back up light.  These are just ridiculous for as small as they are.  Very impressive.  I added these to my F250 as an extra set of fog/running lights and they perform really well.  I could run these at night and not need headlights.  Very happy and very impressed with them.

"Great cable for the price.  I tested this cable with an iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPad Mini 2 and newest iPad air.  All recognized the cable and charged fine.  The cable is about 10ft in length so that is more than enough adequate length to plug it in and use it while it is charging and to give you plenty of room to move around and not be restricted by the cable itself.  Both ends of the cable are made nicely and looking sleek.  They look like they would hold up better than the standard OEM cable that came with both phones and tablets.  Build quality is nice, cable is thick enough to take some wear and usage and where it connects to both plugs is nice and stout.  Over all this is a really nice cable for charging multiple devices if need be.I received this product at a discounted price for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UI85UGDGRNKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149RWC00#wasThisHelpful","R1UI85UGDGRNKM","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wife isn't into wearing expensive jewlery too often.  Mainly only her wedding rings and some other things she wears on occasion.  She does like to wear jewelry, but mainly, inexpensive stuff.  That way she really doesn't freak out if it breaks or she loses it.  This necklace fits that bill nicely.  It is nicely designed and made.  The chain on it is a tad bit thin, but for the size of it, that is to be expected I guess.  She really likes it and has worn it quite a few times since getting it.  Very nice looking and goes with basically everything.  She's happy, I am happy.  That's all that matters.

"Very good odor neutralizer.  I wear boots all day at work and my feet take a beating and sweat.  I wear moisture wicking socks to keep my feet dry, but my boots are waterproof tac boots and they aren't so breathable.  They do sometimes remind me I've been wearing them all day when I take them off.  These odor neutralizers work great killing off odor from my boots.  I just toss these in after work and by morning they are nice and fresh.  Here in Florida your feet will sweat in the summer and these do a phenomenal job and doing away with boot odor.

"I started taking this and found myself not craving things as much.  It has helped me suppress my appetite.  No jittery feeling or any odd affects from it at all.  I feel good after taking it.  Not like a physical rush or anything, just my mood is better altogether.  I don't feel like I need caffeine or anything sugary to keep me going.  I really like that.  I was a caffeineaholic.  I needed it, craved it.  This really helped fight that craving and urge.  I have lost a few pounds from using it so far.  I find myself not wanting to eat as big of portion as before.  I still eat regularly, but I eat smaller portions more often.  I have more energy now I think because of that.  I would need a Monster or Rockstar or something by around 2pm, not anymore with the way I have changed things up a bit.I haven't really altered my lifestyle at all, minus the cutting back of the caffeine.  I must say it has helped me immensely.  I will continue to use this and continue my goal to lose more weight by the end of this year.  This stuff is helping me achieve that.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.I received this product at a discounted price for a review","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M8UHKPWBOMOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DYTA1M#wasThisHelpful","R2M8UHKPWBOMOB","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little thing is awesome!!  It works with any USB that has power.  Laptops, desktops, phones via OTG cable, power banks, car and home phone chargers.  Anything that puts power to a USB will light this.  Even Xbox and Playstation USB will power it.  It is bright too.  Surprisingly bright for how small and compact it is.  I put this in my emergency bag with a 10,000mAH power bank so I have an emergency light if need be.  It's small, compact and nicely made.  Has a nice soft rubbery outer shell, kind of like a phone case.  Nicely designed and nicely made.  Did I mention its BRIGHT!!  Very impressive little USB powered light.

"This is a bright light.  It is also much whiter light than most bulbs.  I have these style white LED lights in my kitchen and I prefer them there to the traditional yellowish style bulbs.  Much better for cooking IMO.  I put this bulb in my breakfast bar can and it emits quite a bit of light.  Like some others have also stated, there is a slight delay after flipping the switch.  Not a big deal to me honestly.  Basically the same style and look as a traditional light bulb.  It is a bit heavier, but it shouldn't affect anything.  Nice light overall.

"These film type screen protectors are a bit tricky to install.  Good thing they offer 3 in the package.  I ruined 1 trying to install it at the get go.  I found out if you take a spray bottle with water and mist both the screen and the adhesive side of the film then apply it, they are much, much easier to install and to get all of the air bubbles out.  Once on and dried, it works great.  No touch issues and no issues with it sticking or finger not sliding around like it does on the glass.  The matte does help with the sun glare.  I am outside most of the day working and I was constantly having to look for shaded areas to use my phone for work.  With the matte it helps cut down on the sun glare.  Not 100%, but it does make the phone more usable in very sunny conditions.  I can actually use my phone in daylight with no issues now.  Decent screen protector.

"Nicely made auxiliary cable for connecting your audio devices.  Great quality cable.  Very well made.  Step down design works great in phones with or without cases.  This works with any device that has a 3.5mm jack.  Works nicely to extend any cable to give more room when needed.  The ends on this cable are beautiful.  They are made and designed really well.  Nice solid feel to them.  Not cheap plastic at all.  The cable itself is also of a very nice quality.  Durable yet still flexible enough to allow movement if need be.

"This is a decent camera, but I think it's limited by a few things.  First off, the software for this is nice on the computer, but the mobile version is just way too limited on what it can do.  I really wish it was as in depth, function wise as the PC software is.  It can be a bit tricky to install and get up and running.  After it is up, it works OK.  I had a few issues with the initial set up.  I am running it off of an access point in my home and you physically have to hard-wire it first and make sure it reads the WiFi in your home well enough to connect.  I had to move it to the room where my main router was, then connect it, then move it to where my access point it and then reconnect it to my access points WiFi.  It didn't want to cooperate a few times and I had to do a hard reset on it and start fresh.  Can be a bit frustrating, but after it's connected, it has stayed connected with no issues.The camera itself is decent quality.  Nothing too fancy or extravagant really.  Just a basic Pan/Tilt/Zoom IP camera.  Solid feel to it, works great once it's install and up and running.  Controls like I said are limited on the mobile app, compared to the PC software.  The mobile app will recognize other cameras tho.  I have another type of this same IP camera running in the mobile app alongside this one.  The listen/speak feature is nice, but you have to turn each on individually to use it.  Can't speak and listen at the same time.  Kind of a bummer on that.  That would have made this really nice.Picture quality is decent.  It provides a nice picture in daylight and low light situations.  Infrared works really good at night.  Decent distance on it.  You do have the usual audible click at night when the infrared clicks on and off.  No biggie tho, not that loud.  Overall, nice camera just wish the mobile app was and had as much in depth control as the desktop software did.  Happy with it tho.

"This thing is very cool, but I wish it had the option to stay on one pattern indefinitely instead of cycling thru them all.  There were a couple patterns that I really liked and wish it could be set to stay on those instead of randomly going thru them all.  I like the remote and the various speeds it has for the light, but that one small thing it really is missing.  Nice solid feeling light, feels quite durable.  Not sure how weather resistant it is, but it seems like it would deal with light moisture without it being affected by it.  Not sure I would leave it out in a downpour, but I thing it would be OK if left out and it got a small bit of condensation on it.  The whole setup is really nice.  Came packaged really well and nice and neat.  After putting it together and trying it out, my neighbors were pretty impressed with it and how far it shined and how bright it was.  She was actually commenting how she was interested in purchasing one.  Great light minus that one small ability to keep the light on one pattern indefinitely.

"This is a great backseat organizer.  My toddler son like to take everything with him when we leave the house and it usually ends up all over the backseat or the floor of the car.  Now we can store things for him in this organizer and they don't end up everywhere or get lost under the seats.  This also works well as a seat protector from his shoes kicking the back of the seat.  Tons of pockets in this organizer.  Has some nicely sized pockets throughout this.  It can easily hold quite a bit, from toys to tablets.  It has plenty of room for whatever they decided they need to take with them.  Made of a nice heavy, but not overly heavy material.  The straps on the top and bottom are easily adjustable for a variety of seat sizes.  It works in our car, mini van and pickup truck.  No problems adjusting it to any sized seat.  Easily clips and un-clips quickly to move from one vehicle to another.  Also, the included window shades were a nice bonus.  They clip on easily and work great.

These tempered glass protectors are just so much better than the old film style ones that were such a nightmare to put on.  These go on easily and they stay on.  Even with aftermarket drop suit cases and bumper cases these aren't affected.  They work together great.  The touch response is still exactly as it was without the screen protector installed.  Really nice glass.  Works fantastic.I received this item at a discounted price to review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO1AAXOBZVOXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBJ08EY#wasThisHelpful","RO1AAXOBZVOXN","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works great, but needs a little tweaking in the design.  The nose bridge is a bit annoying.  Needs a bit of padding or a redesign.  Also, there is no touch button for the screen like most VR headsets have.  Some way to use the phone without opening up the case each time.  A small cutout on the right side for a finger to get into to touch the screen is kind of needed.  The headset case itself is kind of thinly made.  Could be easily broken if not careful when using it.  The straps are good and fit good when adjusted correctly.  They can be a bit tricky to adjust tho.  Overall tho, really nice headset.  Fits most phones, even larger Note 4 sized phones.  But, only without a case.  I had to remove my Note 4 from its case to use it.  I do wish these headset makers would take into account phone cases when designing and making these.  My 3 year old absolutely loves this thing for the underwater fish and dinosaur apps.

"This is a great fitting tempered glass screen protector for the Note 5.  All the cutouts were great.  Very easy to install once the phone has been cleaned and prepped for the glass.  The touch response is exactly as it was before the glass was applied.  No issues with that.  Well packaged product.  Doesn't add bulk to the phone at all.

"I myself had an issue installing the software using Windows 10.  After a few failed attempts using the disc, I went to the D-Link site and pulled the latest drivers for Windows 10.  After installing the driver it worked and has worked flawlessly.  This is a great little AC Wireless Adapter.  I run a Asus AC68U wireless router and this has had no issues connecting or staying connected with either the 2.4GHz or 5Ghz channels.  It has a small footprint on the desk in my kitchen.  Takes up hardly any space.  You always know when you're connected with the blue ring around it.  When it's lit to a solid blue you're connected, when it's flashing, you are not.  Easy and simple way to know your wireless status.  Great little AC Adapter with fantastic wifi speeds and solid connectivity.  They've done a great job with this little device.

"Great rapid charger, but this is not a Qualcomm fast charger.  This works well with pretty much any device that can be charged via USB.  Phones, tablets, power banks, bluetooth speakers and headsets, GoPro, etc.  It works well with all of them.  It has a 2.1A and 1.0A port so it can change a multitude of devices.  It is great with any device it charges.  But it is in no way a Qualcomm fast charger, so don't let this fool you into thinking it is.  It is not overly large and it fits into any 12v socket and stays put.  We use this in our rear 12v ports for our sons iPad in our van.

"This works well but can be a bit tricky to get working properly.  We have a German Shepherd puppy who has become a barker for no reason.  This after getting it dialed in correctly has helped immensely with his barking.  He has shown quite the improvement after using this for a few weeks now.  I do wan't him to bark to alert me to door knocks and other outside noises, but not at anything inside the home unless I tell him to.  He is well trained for a young dog.  I did take him to a very good training school for dogs.  I want him to protect my home when I am there or away, but I do not want him barking at every little thing.  This has helped him learn what is acceptable and what is not.  So far this has been great and easy to work with.  Nicely designed and seems to be well made.

"This is a great beard oil compared to some others I have used in the past.  Goes on great either when your beard is wet or dry.  I prefer to use it right after getting out of the shower.  Apply a decent amount and either work it in with your hands or you can use a beard comb or brush.  I just use my hands.  This does have a scent that may take a bit to get used to.  I was a little overwhelmed by it at first, but after a few uses it really doesn't bother me much.  Manufacturer may want to take that into consideration.  Some may not like it and be turned off by it.  It can surprise you with first use.  Other than that tho, it is nice quality beard oil.  I work around drywall and concrete blocks and my beard gets dried out and dust and debris in it most days.  After a good hot shower and washing my beard out I apply this and its nice and soft again.

"These are string of lighted LED with globes.  I had a issue with a few of the clips, but the seller took care of the issue and replaced them for me.  The are a bit shorter than I expected in length, but I may buy another set to extend them at some point.  These worked great in our outdoor screened in porch.  They were easy to hang up and give off enough light to keep the area lit, but they are not overly bright.  More of just enough ambient light to keep it lit without being overbearing.  Great for sitting out at night when the weather is cool and having some not so bright lights on.These were a bit tricky to install the light clips into the globes.  Put the lights into the clip first, then install them into the globes from the side with the 2 little holes that hold them in place.  Then gently line them up and clip them in place.  They didn't have informative instructions on these, which they really need IMO.  They only will go in one way thru the end with the 2 holes.

"Perfect replacement battery for my wife's Toshiba Satellite laptop.  She cooked her other battery by leaving it plugged in all the time when the battery was installed and just killed it.  This replacement battery works really well.  No issues with the laptop recognizing it and running off of it.  I did do a fresh install of Windows 7 after putting it into the laptop, and then upgraded to Windows 10.  Still recognizing it with Windows 10 Home x64.  Run time will vary like it says, depending on your power settings.  I have gotten around 4 hours of life out of it which is about what her OEM battery ran.  I run ours on balanced settings.

Both USB ports provide fast charging for any device that will support it.  Nice blue LED light inside that lights up to let you know when you've connected it to the 12v socket.  Have been using it for some time now and it has worked great.  Phenomenal little dual USB port charger.Price is comparable to most chargers at those brick and mortar places that don't even offer quick charge capabilities.

"Very cool little carabiner style clip.  I tend to keep my keys hooked to my belt loops when I am just out and about.  This I normally just use a basic climbing carabiner for that.  This works better IMO because I can just unhook either the larger or smaller locking ring depending on what keys I need.  I don't keep my house and car keys on the same ring, I keep them separate because I have more on my house keys ring and I don't wan't that extra added weight on my truck ignition switch.  Wears out faster with more weight on it.  This is super easy to remove either loop depending.  I was always having to remove the whole carabiner then removing what keys I needed then re-hooking it back to my belt loop.  With this I don't have to remove the hooked carabiner type thing, just the keys I need now.  Much easier and quicker.  Very solid feel and nice look to it.

"These do work OK for the most part.  Sometimes they do come loose from either the corner clip or from one of the side clips.  I wish they had a little more bite to them.  They do work great when they do stay put.  I think it may either be from them not being adjusted properly or from the sheet not being a good enough or thick enough fabric to hold on to.  I have a large california king bed and the mattress is quite deep from top to bottom.  somewhere around 18-20"" so the sheets we buy are sometimes too small for that deep of a mattress even tho they say they are, they aren't.  I think it may put too much strain on the clips to hold it because it is not the exact sized sheet for the mattress.  Granted the never come fully loose from the whole clip, but sometimes they do.  It is what it is I guess.  They do work for the most part when we do use the larger sized sheets that are cut bigger for our mattress.

It's easily lasted 8-10hrs on a job while pulling cable and never quit.  Surprised it lasted that long.  Other ones I have only lasted about 6 hours at most.  I was bringing 2 different ones with me just so we could have music throughout the day.  Not any more with this little beast.  Very, very cool little speaker.  The range is about right at 33ft, and that is direct line of sight with it.  Anything over that and you'll buffer and the music will cut in and out until you are back in range.  I do wish they could up the range on these to about 100ft.  It can be done, Dewalt makes a bluetooth adapter for jobsite radios that has 100ft range on it.  It has to be possible with these little bluetooth speakers.  Even if it adds a few bucks more, I would gladly pay it.  I haven't tested it's waterproofing and don't plan to, so I cannot comment there about that.  It is a rugged little speaker tho.  I throw it around in my tool bag and it gets banged around, but it's still going strong to this day.  Great little speaker for sure.I received this item at a discounted price to review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UUZIPE7B8AZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014VJD6PQ#wasThisHelpful","R2UUZIPE7B8AZ3","A2BQPAH744QAES","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2BQPAH744QAES?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wife loved them.  They are her new go to socks for when it is chilly and her feet are cold.  She wears them quite a bit, so she must really like them.  They are nice and soft and well made.  She has even slept with them on.  I have heard her say she really likes them and how nice and comfortable they are to wear around the house.  We have wood and tile floors, so they tend to get cold at times.  She wears them when the temperature in the house gets low enough to make the floor too cold for her to walk around barefooted.

Very easy to read even in daylight.  Big, bright, blue LED lights on the front of it.  Very solid feel to it.  Nicely designed and made.  Has worked well in all 3 of our vehicles.  It charges anything that will charge via USB.  Phones, tablets, bluetooth headsets and speakers, GoPro, battery power banks.  Anything I've hooked up to it charges just fine.

"To begin with, this cable is looooong at 10ft.  It works great in our van for our son when he needs to charge his iPad mini while he's in his car seat.  This reaches all the way to the 3rd row in our van and still has plenty of length left on it.  No issues with it being recognized by his iPad mini or our iPhone 6 Plus'.  Each one works with it great.  Haven't used it for data transfer or sync yet so I can't really comment on it about that, but I'd bet it works just fine with it.  It's titled as a charge and sync cable so I doubt they would just make that up to sell cables.  I am sure someone has commented on using it to sync.  Well made and well designed cable.  The price for this one is less than you'd pay for a 3ft or 6ft non Apple charge/sync cable from those brick and mortar stores out there.  I've seen off name brand cables that were no where near as nice for almost twice this price and half the length of this one.  Can't go wrong here.

"This is a great 2-Point rifle sling.  My old 2-Point sling on my Savage Axis .308 was at the end of its life basically.  I happened across this one for a good price and needless to say, pulled the trigger and ordered it.  Pun intended I guess.  Overall tho, this is a nicely made sling.  Nice clips on the ends, nice elastic and nice wide strap.  I did add some foam padding to the strap in the area where I carry it at my shoulder to relieve some of the pressure when carrying it for long periods of time.  Spray adhesive on both the strap and the foam padding and it makes one heck of a strap pad for sure.  Other than that it is spectacular.  Super easy to adjust to your desired length.

"Nice walking/running belt, but I do wish it had more reflective paint or reflective items on it.  Fit is good, comfortable to wear.  Holds basically any phone out right now.  My Note 4 fits just fine even with a case on it.  I don't use the headphone holder part due to using bluetooth headset, but I'm guessing it should be just fine for holding headphones that are wired.  Plenty of room in this also.  You can fit a phone plus a few other items no problem.  It does tend to bounce around a bit if you load it up with a multitude of things tho.  The strap and clip work just fine.  Easy to adjust to almost any sized waist.  I have also used this across my chest from my shoulder to my side and it worked well there too.  Not really a big fan of having things bouncing around while walking or running so I went to the cross chest method and it works better for me.  Overall tho, nice size waist pack.

"My 3 year old had a tendency to leave his iPad mini on all the time watching YouTube Kids.  It would kill the battery life just laying there playing.  Picked up this cover/stand and have taught him how to close it up when he's not using it so the cover would put it to sleep for him.  Now he has finally learned that it will help him save battery life and has more time to use his iPad throughout the day instead of leaving it on all the time.  The iPad fits nicely into the clear back shell cover and the faux leather cover/stand is quite nice also.  Seems to be pretty durable even with a 3 year old using it.  He knows how to set it up for a stand when he wants to watch it in landscape mode.  It holds the iPad well and works really well.

We found this and since she's been taking it for a little over a month now, everything has been great.  No sickness, no ill effects, no change in moods or anything different.  She's been quite happy with it so far.  She has lost weight with using this along with some exercise.  I am not quite sure, but I can tell by her attitude and overall appearance that she's shed a little weight.  I dare not ask.  This tastes nothing like coffee at all, it has a sweet aroma and taste to it.  It says 20 drops a day, but she's only been using half that and has still lost weight.

"These are pretty good replacement low profile wiper blades.  I was kind of suspect about them seeing as I've never heard of the brand before, but I went ahead and ordered them because of the discount for a review cost.  I can say, these are actually really nice wiper blades.  They IMO are better than some name brand ones.  I really like how they attach with the locking cover.  The are smooth on the glass, no chatter at all, even at high speeds.  Here in Florida, it rains a ton and I keep Rain-X on all my glass.  That does help prolong wiper blades due to the less restrictive coating it puts on the glass itself.  These work great with it.  Have had no issues with them at all.

"If you are going to drop the nearly $2k on this monitor you will need to understand that likely you will need to drop another $300 on a video card to use it. The Nvidia 900 series works well (960 GTX is a good starting point). If you don't have a DisplayPort1.3 video card it is likely you will have issues. While the monitor supports using 2 DP1.2's or dual HDMI, because the resolution is non-standard you may have other issues.This monitor has great color reproduction, and 5k at 60hz looks great, but you aren't going to have the smoothest Hulu or Netflix experience at full resolution. So you should also be prepared to use a resolution manager when you need to run things that were not designed for this level of detail.The speakers on this leave a lot to be desired but again if you are going to drop $2000 on a monitor, likely you can afford better speakers that sit on your desktop or book shelf.I gave this a 5 star rating, but.... To be honest if you are looking at $2k worth of monitor you might be happier with 3 monitors at WQHD (2560x1440) as you can get 28 inches x3 for about the same price, and for many work flows and gaming experiences this will be a better setup.Even two 4k Monitors might be a better option.If you are really bawler however you can put two Nvidia 960's in a computer and run dual 5k and that is a very enviable setup for Graphic design or Video Editing.I know for me the decision to go with this monitor was driven by video editing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31HX81Y1DN5NW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKSFXZU#wasThisHelpful","R31HX81Y1DN5NW","A3K8JJP3O9N9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K8JJP3O9N9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Understand that 500 lumens is not enough for much larger than a 60 inch screen, and that there are a lot of projectors that are superior in resolution and brightness from Optoma.

For $25 more you can get the 700 lumen version, which also has better contrast and more accurate colors. The ML550 is never the right choice.

"Understand that this is a ""Shift 4k"" projector not a ""true 4k"" projector which is why the lumens are low, and the price is cheap.The resulting picture is much sharper than a 1080p Projector, and for 4k 24hz content you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference, but you have to understand that this is using multiple passes to achieve the resolution. Basically 24hz is presented at 96hz and the image is shifted 4 times to make the image.The result works pretty well, and keeps cost down. It also give Huge contrast ratios.Where it is limiting is that you lose a LOT of brightness. This is fine if you are doing 120 inches, but 200 inches will push this to a level of darkness that will make watching not so fun.This is definitely not the choice if you don't have a totally dark room.As there is not a lot of 4k content right now, and HDMI doesn't have content protection for 4K yet, I can't recommend this projector for anyone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMUXQ81DHTLFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMMR0R8#wasThisHelpful","RMUXQ81DHTLFE","A3K8JJP3O9N9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K8JJP3O9N9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bang for the buck this is hard to beat. There are a few things to note however. Optima picked some weird color setting to improve the specs of this projector. To get the full contrast you have to put up with a lot if banding in the middle of the range and over saturated colors. This is less of an issue with Video Games than Movies. And more of an issue if you are looking at this for a Daylight projector than a Darkened room.The 3000 lumens preforms well and if you are looking for a projector to connect to your Xbox this a great choice. If you are looking for a 200 inch screen this will not cut it. This is great for rooms up to about 110 inches if darkened and 60 inches if daylight.The speaker is not awesome but is a nice addition for when you want to have a pool party or do something else where you wouldn't have a sound system to hook up to.For an office projector this works really well, and the number of input ports will allow you to have an HDMI with a Apple Adapter and an HDMI without on your conference table which will make hooking up much easier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R50C0LJYKV8GZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MK39P92#wasThisHelpful","R50C0LJYKV8GZ","A3K8JJP3O9N9A7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K8JJP3O9N9A7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought these for my daughter's birthday to wear at competitions in between dance and on stage because they match her studio jacket (red/black).She wears a size women's 6 so I grabbed a medium and I think I could have gone with a small, even with putting them over her dance shoes.I'm not sending them back though because she will only be 9 and after seeing them, I hope they will last a couple of years.They are really comfy (I tried them on because it's not her birthday yet).

"Anyone else squeal when they found out that Ilsa Madden-Mills had a new release coming out?  When the cover released my excitement for release day amped up times 100.  That is one hot cover.I have followed Ilsa since she released Very Bad Things.  I have loved each new book she releases more than the last. And now I am totally head over heals for Declan in Dirty English.  Little bit of a cougar thing going on over here for a fictional character.I have to share that I literally fell asleep reading this because I started late at night. I couldnt bring myself to stop because I was so into it. I woke up when my iPad (mini, thank goodness) smacked me in the side of the cheek. I thought about picking it up and continuing, but I had to get up at 6 for work and it was already 2. I finished as soon as I got home from work. One of those books I did not want to put down for anything.Elizabeth had a rough start in life and then went through a horrible trauma that completely has shaped who she is now as we enter the story.  I dont think she even knows how strong she truly is.  She doesnt let her upbringing take her down, she is determined to be more.  Add to that what she went through in high school shes still standing.  Broken, but standing.Declan has had his own share of heartache in his life and the way he looks is completely opposite of who he actually is.  (Dont judge a book by its cover in the human sense, but when it comes to Dirty English, you totally can.)  Hes tattooed, hes a fighter, and hes the sexiest man on campus (its true, there was a vote).  He looks like the bad boy everyone would swoon over, but inside thats not who he is.I loved Dirty English!  Possibly more than I loved the Briarcrest Academy series, and that is saying a lot.  Complex characters that I could empathize with, a great storyline, awesome friends that have each others backs (even when they dont agree), and hot scenes that leave you wanting your own Declan made this an amazing book!5 hot Dirty English stars from me!Now, we need Daxs book!Thank you for my copy of Dirty English!

"I grabbed Vigilance when it was on sale for 99 cents.  Not only is it by an author whose other works I had on my Kindle Wish List, it came recommended by my friend Laura.  Shes one of my go to tell me what to read next friends.  Shes introduced me to some amazing books before.Im a huge zombie fan, its a thing for our family, we love zombies, we love pretending we are planning for the zombie apocalypse (with the kids) (not that I necessarily want to live through it), its just some (possibly twisted) fun for us.  When Laura said this was a must read, it surprised me because typically she sends me the book that will wring every last emotion from me.  Zombie apocalypse?  Im all over it.Vigilance was really cool.  Instead of being just a telling of how people fought the zombies and survived, this is a set of journal entries that were either found or turned over to the archivist.  It details what each of these people went through at the beginning of the zombie craziness and whether they survived or not.The journal entries come from both men and women, people of different ages, from different cities in the US, and the writing style of each character is uniquely their own.  No one sounds like a person you read a few entries previously, no one reminds you of another character, each character is written in their own individual tone.  That cant be an easy task for an author to take on.  L.G. Pace III excels at it.I have to say I think this is my most favorite zombie book I have ever read.  It was different that any other book in this genre that I have ever read.Im so glad my friend told me this was a must read because I totally agree.5 zombie loving stars from me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9F4ZMETV30B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFRB5CW#wasThisHelpful","R9F4ZMETV30B9","A3AANHILJU77IK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AANHILJU77IK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first saw this game a couple of months ago at my son's occupational therapy.  He loved it there (he's 6, which is younger than the recommended ages).  I promised him after his last appointment that if he finished his session (he was having a rough day) that I would buy this game to play with him.  That was enough motivation.All of my family loves this.  For the youngest we change the rules (everyone who completes the puzzle correctly wins) and we go slow, usually he picks a card he thinks he can do.  For the rest of us, it's fast and furious.  Awesome family game!  My 8 year old can play it with the regular rules but it's still tough enough at times that I'm left really analyzing the card to figure out exactly what it is I am doing.Excellent family game!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVV8YASAKLNWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031P91LK#wasThisHelpful","RVV8YASAKLNWQ","A3AANHILJU77IK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AANHILJU77IK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Devils Metal is all sex, drugs, and rock and roll on the way to Hell.  Quite possibly literally.This was one of the books I didnt read the blurb for.  I knew it was by Karina Halle and I grabbed it knowing that I love her work.  I didnt know if this was going to be one of her more paranormal styles or one that would be a straight rock god romance.I am so glad I didnt read the blurb.  I was reading along, thinking this is going to not have any paranormal aspect to it, its pure 70s.  (Though I was born in the middle 70s, I dont remember much beyond my Sesame Street bell bottom overalls, to me she hit the 70s dead on with her descriptions, the clothes, the hair, the music, the days of writing letters and finding payphones.  I felt like I was right back there, seeing what it was like in the decade that I was born in.)  Back to what I was saying, I would be reading along and come across a sentence or two that left me wondering are we entering the paranormal or did Dawn take acid and I didnt catch it or is she losing her ever loving mind?Freaky is the one word that comes to mind about my feelings when I finished this book.  Freaky.  Karina wrote this story in such a way that while it is paranormal, it left you thinking like that could have actually happened.  It would explain a lot in that decade.Theres two ways that I feel when I am reading a book.  One is where I feel like I am as much a part of the story as the characters are, the second is where I feel like I am an outsider looking in.  The second is what I felt here. Its normally the way I feel while reading a horror book.  Its that feeling you get when you are watching everything start to fall apart and there is nothing you can do to change what is going to happen.  I didnt have an intense connection to an individual character, it was more an intense connection to the storyline in general.Awesome book !  5 stars from me!  Im so glad I grabbed it.  I just started The Devils Reprise and I cant wait to see where Sage and Dawn will be heading on this journey, though I already want to kick Sages arse.  I think I may just have myself a Karina Halle marathon.  Ive got so many books of hers that I have bought and that are sitting in my Kindle cloud waiting for me to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34OO8DCZY1TJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B76PMRC#wasThisHelpful","R34OO8DCZY1TJK","A3AANHILJU77IK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AANHILJU77IK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series is one of the reasons I love Scarlett Dawn so much.  She can go from writing paranormal to mafia romance and everything else in between with ease.  No matter what the genre is, I always have loved each book/series.I have to quote Vanessa on Goodreads because she put my thoughts on every book by Scarlett Dawn into the perfect words:When you pick up a Scarlett Dawn book, you dont simply read it. You dive head-first into an abyss of originality and a world one could not even fathom to dream up on their own. It doesnt matter the genre, or even the story (although, thats part of the allure), its the characters. Its the chemistry, the conversation, the uncanny wit and drama that unfolds before your very eyes. Reading a Scarlett Dawn book is an experience, not just a pass-time.Obsidian Mask was no exception.  We are back in the world of Elizabeth and Daniil.  We have all of the characters we have grown to know (and begrudgingly love in some cases) plus Scarlett brings in some new characters from Elizabeths family.  Each new character adds their own layer of personality to the story and brings a new level of drama as we start to explore the family dynamics that Elizabeth has grown up with.  Her mother and father can stop a fierce gun toting mafia member in their tracks with a lecture that will have others in the group snickering until their gazes fall on that person.Through Beths eyes we get to explore other relationships of other characters and I cant wait to see where some of those relationships go as the series continues.I loved watching Elizabeths and Daniils relationship grow and see where it would go throughout the story.  We had a huge surprise that I personally didnt even think might appear in this book when I picked it up.  Speaking of that surprise, SCARLETT DAWN, how can you leave me hanging like that at the end?  I want the next book in the series like yesterday.Obsidian Mask had everything I expected from a book from Scarlett Dawn: amazing deep characters, a fabulous storyline full of twists and turns, drama, and hot scenes between my favorite characters.  I absolutely loved this.  5 stars from me!I received this book for free in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQWEYVC0QXDDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012I3EV38#wasThisHelpful","RQWEYVC0QXDDD","A3AANHILJU77IK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AANHILJU77IK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using this for a few weeks, following the emailed instructions that said to take it 30 minutes before a meal.  That is different from the instructions on the bottle.I haven't noticed any major changes, other than losing 8 lbs in 2 weeks (that's why I'm giving it 3 stars vs less).  I started a much more physical job (vs sitting at a desk all day) and the weight loss started with that, not before when I started taking the pills.  The Yacon Root Powder might have helped a bit, but I didn't lose any weight the first week I was using it, the 2nd and 3rd week, when I started my job and was moving a lot more, was when I lost the weight.I don't plan on buying another bottle because I really don't feel a huge difference, no extra energy, no reduction in acid, etc.I received this product at a discounted price but my opinions are all my own.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BNQ1P5Q9J9EJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIUQMYC#wasThisHelpful","R3BNQ1P5Q9J9EJ","A3AANHILJU77IK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AANHILJU77IK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been taking this daily for a couple of weeks now.  I haven't noticed any real changes other than possibly being a bit more regular.

"I thought this would be a great alternative to my husband wearing his wedding ring.  His regular ring hurts his finger and causes it to be inflamed with blisters.  His verdict was that he didn't like the way this one made his finger feel.  He tried it for a bit and couldn't get used to it.I gave it to my oldest son (16) since my husband didn't like it and he likes it.  It's not his favorite piece of jewelry, but he thinks it is kind of cool.I wouldn't buy another one of these for either of them because my husband does't like it and my son isn't overly enthused.

"Can we just take a moment to talk about the covers to this series?  Seriously, some of the most beautiful and intriguing covers that I have seen.  The cover of Crane was what drew me to this series in the first place and I eagerly anticipate each new cover as much as I do the actual books.  Steam did not disappoint at all.  Another gorgeous cover to add to this series.  They take my breath away the first time I see each of them.On to the book.  How to go about telling you my thoughts on Steam without giving to much away?  This one is tough because there are some serious twists, turns, and moments where I wanted to cry to Stacey Rourke, why??? Why???  Why????First, Steam is full of the humor that I have come to absolutely love about Rourkes writing.  Its full of quick wit and hilarious sarcastic comebacks even in the most stressful of situations.Each of the Legends Series books fills in the blanks for us of certain legends that we have grown up hearing about.  This time, in Steam, we were going through the Salem witch trials.  We go back and forth between past and present, tying facts together along the way.  We find out just what has driven HG Wells this whole time and we meet 2 new characters that are integral to the story line.  Our much loved favorite characters are back (mostly) to take us on this journey, which when we start has the hessian in more control of Ireland than I think we have seen yet.The ending threw me.  I was not expecting that at all and it made me cry.  The only thing that left me with hope is that I caught Staceys post on Facebook where she said What if I told you Steam would NOT be the last Legends Saga book?.  My response was, I would love you forever.I need more Legends.5 stars for this amazingly talented writer who has a way of drawing us into this world where things are not what we grew up believing they were.

"I never thought about giving my dogs a probiotic even though I take them for myself.  I was looking for a Glucosamine Chondroitin supplement  for my 8 year old Chinese Crested.  If you've read any of my past dog product reviews, she was a puppy mill dog for 3 years.  Someone broke her jaw and never took her to get it fixed.  When I adopted her as a rescue, my vet said that her jaw being broke was not normal puppy play.  Flash to today, hairless Chinese Cresteds are known to lose their teeth, it's a genetic thing, add in her broken jaw and she doesn't have many teeth left.  The vet and I weighed the pros and cons of fixing her jaw and it was decided as long as she can eat, it's best to leave her as she is.  Recently she hasn't been eating her hard food as much (Wellness for small breed, very small pieces) and I assume that it's because her jaw hurts.I started giving her this a week ago and I've noticed her back at the hard food dish that my chihuahua uses eating away.I have also started giving it to my chihuahua mix.  She is getting older, she is a black dog with brown markings and her brown markings have all turned gray, I have no idea how old she is.  I'm assuming since she has been with us for 5 years, we got her as a rescue, she is getting close to 8-9.  We have all noticed she's getting a bit testy in her older age and snapping at my younger kids when they sit too close.  After a week on this, I think she is feeling a bit better.  I haven't seen her snap at one of the kids for daring to sit next to her in a couple of days (it was a multiple time a day occurrence).  I just asked my husband if he has seen her snap at the kids for the few days, he thought about it for a bit and shook his head no.  She has got to be feeling a bit better.I don't sprinkle it over their food because like I said Junie sneaks to Suki's dish and eats her food sometimes.  I use a chicken sausage, cut it in half, one half for each dog.  I slice it down the center but not all the way through.  Then I use the scoop to put the powder into the center of the sausage.  Junie doesn't mind the powder at all and will lick it out first, she'll eat anything if it's in her reach, I swear.  Suki cannot see the powder or she will not touch it.  We place the sliced side down on a plate and she will grab it and eat it in her bed.I cannot see us going without this product ever again.  Just in a week it has helped make some wonderful positive changes in my dogs.  I can't wait to see what else might come from this.  I'd love to see Suki playing with my cat again like she did up until about 6 months ago, front paws down with her tail waving all over.I received this product at a discount price to facilitate my review but my thoughts and opinions are all my own.  This has been amazing for my 2 little dogs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R802E8QLNAXLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAW8ZSS#wasThisHelpful","R802E8QLNAXLL","A3AANHILJU77IK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AANHILJU77IK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did not know I wanted a selfie stick until I saw a couple of girls on stage at dance awards with one taking pictures of themselves and of the crowd.  I thought how fun would that be for my 8 year old when she is on stage?The Clik Stik pro arrived promptly after I ordered it (at a discount to facilitate this review) and after I opened it and my children realized what I had in the box I immediately heard how it was each of theirs and the reasons they need it more than their siblings.Hello, this is mom's selfie stick.My 16 year old cracked me up.  He is the king of making fun of people with selfie sticks but the clik stik went missing this weekend, suspiciously enough, he is with my sister and brother in law having a fun weekend boating, camping, and hitting the drive in movie.  I don't suppose my selfie stick being MIA is a coincidence?The stick is simple to set up.  As long as it has a bit of a charge you can use it right out of the box.  I had enough power to mine to take a few pictures after connecting to my phone via blue tooth.  Other than the connecting part, I really didn't get a chance to set it up myself.  My 2 oldest had it in their hands and connected to their own camera (when they took it from their sibling) in seconds.  I did get to take a few pictures that day after receiving it...from my 11 year old daughter's phone because she had it connected and her phone attached... and it worked great, push the button, picture is taken.  You can take the picture from just about any angle by adjusting the part that holds the phone, rotating it (by adjusting your arm and how you're holding it), extending it as far or as little as needed, it's a great little tool for picture taking.I have so far found it in the possession of 3 of my children, in 2 of their rooms, and in one bed where my daughter was using it to hold her phone up for a facetime conversation because her hand hurt (she couldn't switch hands because her other hand is casted she broke it, her hand, not the selfie stick).  We now know from this that it is not only easy for an adult to use but that it is easy for children at least down to 8 years old to use (the 8 year old has an older iphone she uses as an iPod, not set up as a phone).  The 6 year old is the only one who hasn't attempted yet, but seeing as he can run both the PS3 and the Amazon Fire TV better than I can, I am pretty sure the selfie stick would not defeat him.Fun to have, easy to connect, simple to use for better photos of you and your friends or you and whatever is in your background (or to hold up for a facetime convo), my family loves this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11RD6VEEUP93C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0120D4GJU#wasThisHelpful","R11RD6VEEUP93C","A3AANHILJU77IK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AANHILJU77IK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you knew me, you would know I am a huge essential oil fan (I diffuse Eden's Garden, which you can grab here on Amazon.  My oil I go through the most is the Sweet Orange 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil- 30 ml).  It works great in this diffuser.That being said, I have been sitting on this review for a few days trying to decide if I like this diffuser better than my original diffuser or not.  It's a hard decision.In the picture, the one that is going is the one I am reviewing, the other one, on the right, is my old much loved diffuser.I love the style of this one.  It's a little more funky and takes up a bit more space.  The thing I am not 100% sure of is if it fills the room with the scent as much as my older one did.  My older one could be going in my office and I would smell it in the front room when I walked in the house or out of another room.  This one I can't really smell in another room, it does fill my office up with the scent though.The other feature I miss from my old one is there were 3 (or 4, it's not next to me while I write this review) timed settings.  This one has 2, 3 hours and until the water runs out.  This one has the same color options as my old one.  I don't use that as often because if I'm in my office, I have the light on while I'm working.  The kids will turn it on if they come into the room.It holds the same 100 ml that my first diffuser held.  I think it does go a bit longer, which might be why I am not getting the same amount of scent sent out.  It's not diffusing as large of a quantity at once to make it last longer.  If I hadn't had my old diffuser to compare this to, I would give it 5 stars.  It does work great and is pretty to look at.  Because I have had the experience of my other diffuser in the same price range, this one gets 4 from me.  I would rather add water a little more often and have the scent fill 3 rooms then have it only fill one.I have to say my girls stole my other diffuser the other day to run in their rooms because their diffuser broke (different brand).  I don't think I'm getting it back any time soon.  I'll be happy with this one.

"Used this when I had cancer before and have it again so am using it again .  Really helped me regain lost weight and if you have trouble swallowing solid food or are tube fed works great too .  Even when I could finally eat solid food I could have lived on this and not missed it .  This stuff really works and in my opinion is different than 90% of the other boost type drinks .  Taste good too (like the Vanilla flavored ones .) .  At $146.99 for 4 cases of 24 meals/cartons the price is the best I've ever seen too .  I bought 8 cases (May 2015) and they expire 14 June 2016, which means I will have used them long before then .

"I bought this knife blind as to quality .  This is info I learned later and seems to apply to all knives made in this brand, Blade material: stainless superalloy / vanadium steel Cutting edge hardness: HRC 57 plus or minus 2 .  The variance in hardness worried me but apparently it may be better than + - 2 . Blade hardness is about the same as most European knives, maybe a little better .  Fairly sharp out of the box but I did reshape the edge and sharpen it on my stones .  Mine has taken and held an edge very well during use and I am beginning to trust and like it a lot .  Fit and finish was good, the handle could be a little larger for my large hands but will fit most people well .

"First I am a home kitchen cook who likes SHARP  kitchen knives and have several .  I bought this because of the 15 degree angle .  The first two knives I sharpened were a Petty/Utility 6 inch and a 4 1/2 inch paring knife, Stainless Japanese made . The Petty Knife has a HRc 56,the paring knife HRc 61 .  It took a lot more strokes to finish the HRc 61 but did a pretty good job on both, but I did a final touch up with 1 Micron Borium Carbide on a Basal Strop .  One thing that did happen on both of those is there was a  line of rubbing on both sides of the knives which I thought was from contact with the rubber on the sharpening slots .  But under magnification I found they were very fine scratches .  That I didn't like, almost rubbed the logo off the paring knife .  So be warned that can happen . I then used a French made K-Sabatier 10 inch slicer, Hrc 56 which has a good patina .  It did a good job on it and no scratches to the sides .  So I liked it better .  Then I used a Victorinox 10 1/2 inch Stainless Chef Knife, HRc 56-57, and it did well on it with no scratches .  I could shave hair on the arm with that knife when done but not as smoothly as my Shapton Ceramic Stone work .  I have 7 Japanese Western style Stainless Clad and clad Carbon chef knives I probably will not ever use in this since I don't want to have any scratches on the sides of them .  Now honestly the scratches may have been due the the narrow height of the smaller blades and taller ones may not have that happen, even if thin blades, like the Victorinox and K-Sabatier knives I sharpened .  One thing if you don't really let you knife become DULL the #2 honing slot is all you will need to use and it is a very fine Diamond grit that polishes pretty good .  That will provide an edge that most home users will be happy with .  I may try one of my thin Japanese Western Chefs knife in this and if I do will post the results . ADDENDUM:  I did try one of my Japanese Chefs knives and it did Ok, but probably will stay with the stones for those.  But a warning for Petty/utility/paring knives  it will leave rub marks down the sides of those smaller blades (tried 3 different ones 4 and 6 inch and the same thing on all) .  That bothers me so I won't ever use it for any more of those .","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LMZY2BYW6XJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JIMVS0#wasThisHelpful","R1LMZY2BYW6XJ3","AB5X63CW9O0R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5X63CW9O0R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"GOOD ONE.  I have been using a double walled plastic tumbler with lid and straw, so will compare to that.  This tumbler is way better.  I drink milk with all meals and like it cold.  This tumbler keeps it colder longer than anything I have ever used including stainless coffee cups with plastic lids.  I put 3 small cubes of ice in a milk and three hours later it had hardly melted.  Now that's on an August day at 86 degrees with no AC.  A very LIGHT film of condensation did form on the outside of the tumbler but didn't run like my plastic tumbler does. Straw that comes with it is 8 inches long 1/4 inch inside, so you could drink shakes etc.  A larger straw would not fit and be useful with the lid on  though, since you couldn't move it to the side of the tumbler to get those last drops. The inside of the lid is plastic but the label say no BPA or Lead.  Although it says Dishwasher safe it also warns you not to use high temp water.  I suspect if you do that, the bottom of the tumbler which is pressed and sealed on would come off.  Why ?  The air between the walls would expand under heat and blow it loose.  I hand wash mine. I normally don't give Made In China products high marks since they don't earn it, but this is an exception.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWM8KB4VODHRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JEGSZCQ#wasThisHelpful","RWM8KB4VODHRG","AB5X63CW9O0R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5X63CW9O0R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Large  SS straws.  These measure 1/4 inch inside 5/16 or 8 mm outside 81/2 inches long, while the bent straw I ordered measure 3/16 inch or 5 mm inside (both straws Epica Brand) .  I order a D'Eco Brand 16 oz tumbler and it came with the larger diameter straw.  Anything larger in outside diameter  than these won't fit and be useful through the lid of that tumbler. The reason is you need a little room to be able to move the straw to the edges inside of the Tumbler and if larger you couldn't.  These are well made, but remember stainless will rust if not dried.  Brush will reach through straws also for cleaning.  Decent buy but you can find the same under different names.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DWB2I4S1SF3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HI4L4G0#wasThisHelpful","R2DWB2I4S1SF3E","AB5X63CW9O0R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5X63CW9O0R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you want just a plug and play radio this isn't it. First let me say READ THE MANUAL it explains controls,  bands, UT, and every aspect of this radio.  If you don't you will be lost if you are new to this like I am or have never had a GREAT Radio  for AM/SW.  Don't buy the Sangean ANT-60 Short Wave Antenna shown by Amazon, since you get an Antenna like it except the Sony doesn't plug in but clips on the external radio antenna and I believe that really will work better.  I tried the Sagean plugged in and didn't receive as well as the Sony built in antennas so I will clip on the external antenna if I use it, and the supplied Sony one does that.  I've had a couple SW radios and none received well, also AM stations on my other radios is terrible.  With this the one I tune the distance (for me not wide open)  then enter manually or scan stations.  After locating what I want I adjust the distance tuning and engage the synchronous detection and the sucker locks that station and tracks it cleaning it up.  I have never been able to receive AM stations near or far away like this unit does (clear too, using only the built in antennas). FM works great and again in my location better than most.  It has a small speaker but is fine for FM for me.  I am hard of hearing and for AM and SW I like to use headphones, already had some that work fine. It has a lock switch that will not let settings be changed accidentally when transporting it to, nice feature. If you have a station tuned in and turn it off all settings for it will be the same when it's turned on again too (neat). I did buy an external power supply on Amazon but although it works it doesn't say what the power supplied is so I am going to buy one at radio Shack that does and have the correct plug installed . I read reviews by Ham Operators prior to buying and all spoke highly of this radio. Seems you would have to spend several hundred more to really beat this thing.  I really got more radio than I expected and am very pleased.  If you read the manual and take your time think you would be too. ADDENDUM:  For those new to this who are really interested in a fine SW/AM radio and are reading the negative reviews.  Let me say this radio has been around since the 70s with a few changes and is still highly rated by experienced operators.  A junk radio would not have survived this long.  It has features that few SW radios have except those costing several hundred dollars more . After reading many of the negative reviews I can say with no doubt most of those reviewers never read and comprehended the operators manual. Those folks need a plug and play radio only.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB3343VV3HLL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IS4X#wasThisHelpful","RB3343VV3HLL9","AB5X63CW9O0R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5X63CW9O0R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The picture shown is not the SR. The Sr has an outside case with short legs cast in it, you can buy longer Snap On legs if needed. The Sr has 3 hand adjustable bolts in the top section which allow you to use smaller or larger Dutch ovens without using the grill or heat defuser plate.  You can set a Dutch oven closer or further away from the heat and plus the body is acting as a wind screen on the bottom of the Dutch oven since it is hanging partly inside. The collapsible one doesn't allow this.  If I want to use the top grill I still can. I like that a lot better.  I have used the Volcano Original (SR) for several years and bought one with the propane set up. Why ? Just because. Haaa.  $145.00 is a great price. You can't fold the Sr up but unless you really move it a lot doesn't matter and doesn't take much room, plus you can put all the propane kit parts inside it.

"First the price of $44.84 which included shipping was a good one for this 5 lb increment 3/8 drive wrench.  I needed the 5 lb increments so I could use it on my motor scooter and be as precise as possible.  Took a muffler off today and used it to put back on . Had 3 bolts setting for 37 Ft lbs and one for 16 Ft lbs.  When the proper torque was reached the ratchet gave some slack and there was a loud click followed by another softer one.  Now I'm and older guy who is hard of hearing so if I can hear those clicks a person with normal hear sure isn't going to miss them.  Instructions were clear but one thing look at the handle closely and the mark coming from 5 lbs (or any number) will drop down then intersect the center line on the handle.  It has to do that so you can adjust the next 4 lbs 1 lb at a time if needed.  Once you pass 4 on the knurled hand you will be to the next 0 on the knurled handle and the next higher 5 lb increment line will be sitting above the 0.  I know people who have used one before will know that but for a first timer it might help.  Wrench is supposed to be +or- 4% which is close enough since torque values should be the minimum torque for a bolt. Has a decent plastic case for storage too.  I do like it and would recommend it to a friend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUTKLRR93TGVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GZP41Y#wasThisHelpful","RUTKLRR93TGVA","AB5X63CW9O0R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5X63CW9O0R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought two of these. I have 3 of these feeders in the 10 oz sizes called Ruby. The Hummers love them over a number of others I've tried. The perches allow the birds to land and drink with less effort too.  The clear bottoms let you see them actually get the drink if you hang high enough. That's neat. The bottom is two halves that separate which makes cleaning easy and the fit back on the bottle easy . The bottle has a large enough opening to make cleaning easy, the red top will screw off if you want although I normally don't do that. They have a water moat on the top which keeps ants out also.  One reviewer said they leak easy.  I haven't found that to be true any more than other feeders if tilted far enough.  I have 8 feeders out and wish all were as easy to clean as these .  Five of my feeders are 10 oz feeders and each is emptied in one day as a rule so thought I would increase the sugar water enough that I could refill every 2 days.

I'm an old retired guy who loves to watch the little rascals zip about and would recommend this type of feeder to anyone. Same design is made in several different sizes by this company.  ADDENDUM:  Wrote this review before receiving them and birds do love them and more bird use these at the same time than the smaller ones.  But both feeders had a broken perch when I received them. One I could glue back the other wasn't in the bubble wrap, which means it was broken off before shipping. That one I took a piece of plastic wrapped wire and made a perch, glued it in place with 60 second epoxy.  Now I could have returned them but needed now so repaired instead. However I'm not the first to receive ones with broken perches so did want to mention it. Couldn't find a way to tell Amazon other than a return so did add this. Also ordered 2 more but from TrueValue in Midland Mo. and cheaper too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB36JGEP33V65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DT2XOIG#wasThisHelpful","RB36JGEP33V65","AB5X63CW9O0R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5X63CW9O0R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I put this on a Honda Forza 300 Scooter on the handle bar and can adjust it for different positions.  With the foam liner in I can put 16 0z or 12 Oz soda or water bottles in it.  I use a small short bungee cord with a zip tie, tied in it, set in a circle loop, so it fits over the top of the bottle. Use a cap of course and it rides perfect. When I want a drink, stop, unhook the bungee, lift the zip tie loop off, cap off and have it. The foam insert will stay on the bottle when taken out but fits back in easily when the bottle is replaced.  Nice part is I can take it off and store under the seat when not using, leaving only the ball mount on the handle bar.  If I ever use it for coffee etc., will have a tight top on them to prevent splashing, and I won't drink anything while moving on the scooter  (like to have BOTH hands on the controls).

"Growing up in a small town in which your father is a local hero is almost bound to be something of a psychological determinant in anyones developing sense of self: and so it is with Sheriff Sam Deeds (Chris Cooper), having to live under the weight of his late father, Buddys seemingly unassailable reputation as a man of honour and integrity. It was Buddy (Matthew McConaughey), when a deputy, who rid the town of the notorious Sheriff Charlie Wade (Kris Kristofferson) thereby ending his tyrannical reign.To mark the life of such a man, the towns mayor  also a previous deputy alongside Buddy  Hollis Pogue (Clifton James), proposes to erect a permanent memorial to his one-time colleague outside the local courthouse, which they are also going to name in Buddys honour.But, as you might imagine, all is not what it seems and this is thrown into sharp relief by the discovery of the remains of a man buried in a shallow grave just outside town on a long disused army firing range.The discovery is made by two off-duty soldiers pursuing an amateur archaeological hobby and armed, this time, with just a handy metal detector. And it throws up another important artefact in terms of what will subsequently unfold as the sands of time are blown away by Sams increasingly uneasy investigation into the crime and, as a corollary, his own past; the corroding remains of a sheriffs badge in the form of a lone star.This is a masterful film: brilliantly written, edited and directed by John Sayles and deserves a lot more attention than it probably gets.  Chris Cooper, in a rare big screen lead role, imbues the character of Sam with just the right ingredients of pathos, integrity, regret and wistfulness; a kind of mature Sheriff July Johnson, his earlier role in that other elegiac western, Lonesome Dove.  He is more than ably supported by Kris Kristofferson as the odious Charlie Wade, and Clifton James as the somewhat hapless Hollis Pogue, amongst a stellar cast of first rate actors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ELRFFUYDBY20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GNYDGOO#wasThisHelpful","R3ELRFFUYDBY20","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having been converted to Peter May fandom by the excellent Lewis Trilogy, which was only enhanced by Entry Island, I was slightly apprehensive about trying out Enzo Macleod for size.  The reason being that my foray into extra-Lewis territory hadnt been a happy one after being thoroughly disappointed by the first in the China Series, The Firemaker.  Admittedly, I didnt finish it and may go back to it in due course: the culture clash lost in translation nature of the narrative seemed a bit forced; lacking the verisimilitude that made the Lewis books so real.Luckily, my experience this time round was a pleasant one.  We have a middle-aged grumpy old man as protagonist: Enzo Macleod, Professor of Biology at a second rank French University, a somewhat embittered and battered victim of lifes vicissitudes, which have left him with no wives and two adult daughters, one doting, one not so.  He takes on a bet to solve one of the countrys most baffling mysteries; the disappearance of one of its rising young stars, ten years previously.  What follows is a kind of Anneka Rice type Treasure Hunt around France hunting down clues to the whereabouts of the missing person.Its all a bit preposterous but thoroughly entertaining for all that and Im now looking forward to the second instalment of Enzos adventures: I might even give the Firemaker another go!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HIP361JUJJK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUE0CX4#wasThisHelpful","R2HIP361JUJJK9","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If youre looking for a Nordic Noir fix; best to look elsewhere.  Okay, it involves crime(s) and the polices attempts to solve them: thus, we follow in the footsteps of the (almost obligatory) troubled young female detective and the somewhat hapless male partner she has foisted upon her.  But its a Nordic saga with a difference!Basically, a child has gone missing from the same town from which said detectives own daughter disappeared some years before.  Being the daughter of the late indigenous captain of industry, who owned the local cellulose plant, she is home to sort out his estate.  But we soon become aware that there are some very strange goings on and this is not going to be a straightforward police procedural.  Instead it appears to be a rather curious melange of eco-nut/fantasy folk-lore/new-agey/anti-capitalist/police procedural type thing with vague undercurrents of science fiction (a la Day of the Triffids) and even a sprinkling of H. P. Lovecraft!There are various potential minor irritations; e.g. the lead character does particularly silly things at various times you wouldnt expect of a trained, experienced police detective, but those aside, its a different, quirky and intriguing series with a bit more interest than the usual run-of-the-mill police procedural and well worth sticking with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TP23YOORO9IZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7HEILA#wasThisHelpful","R2TP23YOORO9IZ","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a brilliantly acted story depicting the life of a woman who lives most of it, for whatever reason, in total despair. As a consequence, she poisons the lives of all of her so-called loved ones to the extent that her son, Christopher (John Gallagher Jnr) grows up emotionally shattered and in need of continual therapy! Somewhat bizarrely, this meat grinder of a life is punctuated by odd moments of compassion for those on its periphery: she cares, sporadically, for her next-door neighbour, who is clearly suffering from some form of mental illness, and the latters son who also grows up with his own severe problems.Of course, in the lead role of a woman for whom an inner rage appears to be the driving force of her life, Frances McDormand excels as does Richard Jenkins as her long suffering husband, Henry, who, in stark contrast to his wife, is the sort of person who sees good in everyone and brings a ray of sunshine into every room he enters. But dont mistake this for entertainment: it might portray real lives and, as a character study of the form of mental impairment from which Olive almost certainly suffers, its no doubt brilliant, but darkness lies at its core and it revels in its efficient application of misery to the minutiea of everyday life.Olive seems to resemble the art-loving character from the Woody Allen film, `Play it Again, Sam' in which Woody, who has great trouble approaching members of the opposite sex, is in an art gallery with his friend, played by Diane Keaton. She spots an attractive young woman staring at a Jackson Pollack painting.Spurred on by Keaton, Woody finally manages to pluck up enough courage to stand beside the young woman and attempts to begin a conversation. For his opening gambit, Woody asks the girl what the painting says to her. She replies: ""It restates the negativeness of the universe; the hideous lonely emptiness of existence; nothingness; the predicament of man forced to live in a lonely, godless universe for all eternity like a tiny flame flickering in an immense void with nothing but waste, horror and degradation forming a useless bleak straightjacket in a black absurd cosmos.""Undeterred he asks her what she is doing Saturday night. She answers; ""committing suicide"". He responds, ""what about Friday?""The girls sombre view of existence seems to sum up nicely that of Olives, and more than half the other characters, in this depressive essay on the absurdity of being. If ever I decide that, for whatever reason, I deserve self-flagellation, I'll make sure any self-administered means of escaping this mortal coil are safely locked away and watch the whole thing through again!","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BDKOYW91VJKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SR36TKM#wasThisHelpful","R2BDKOYW91VJKL","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having never watched a Jason Statham movie before but based on the glowing reviews this received I expected a lot better.  The plot, such as it is, is riddled with holes and real actors, such as Paddy Considine, David Morrisey, Aidan Gillen and Mark Rylance are criminally wasted, whilst Nicky Hensons hard-assed superintendent is laughably stereotypical.  The characters are not just one-dimensional; theyre paper thin.But at least the 97 minute running time provides an opportunity for Statham to showcase his acting skills, running as he does through the whole range, from A to A-.  Eastwood showed how the renegade cop thing could be played over 40 years ago: since then weve had a plethora of sub-standard wannabees hissing their way through threadbare plots in pale imitations of the original.  Ill give Statham this, he does have screen presence: but he does so little with it that, by comparison, he makes set props appear animated.  Good actors may not have a lot of dialogue but still hint at an internal life; e.g. the aforementioned Eastwood or McQueen.If anybody wants to see what Morrisey and Gillen are truly capable of when given a half decent, literate script that focuses on British crime, they need look no further than the TV adaptations of Mark Billinghams novels, Sleepyhead and Scaredy Cat, aired on Sky1 in 2010 as Thorne, with the ever excellent Eddie Marsan as a bonus.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R143FZ84AQID58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ILYW1E#wasThisHelpful","R143FZ84AQID58","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its probably best not to watch this just before your elective surgery: techniques and knowledge have, of course, improved, vastly, over the last hundred years or so, but the images the series presents are graphic and brilliantly realized.  The setting is The Knickerbocker Hospital (or Knick), a fictional hospital, inspired by a similar institution in New York at the turn of the Nineteenth Century; the middle of the Belle poque in Europe and towards the end of The Gilded Age, in America, during which the great philanthropists, (or Robber Barons depending on your viewpoint), such as Andrew Carnegie, distributed largesse and endowed museums and colleges, etc. and, of course, hospitals.Clive Owen plays Dr John W. Thackery, a driven man: a man obsessed with being the best; a surgeon at the top of his game displaying his unmatched skill and the arrogance that comes from routine success when the stakes are nothing less than life and death.  But success doesnt come free and its almost Faustian cost is vividly portrayed.The production values are superb and evoke the spirit of an age when advances in science and technology were making anything seem possible.  This is underscored by a pulsing, seemingly anachronistic, techno soundtrack, which is definitely not evocative of 1900 but which works because, in a kind of every second counts way, it serves as a leitmotif for Thackerays obsessive drive for perfection.The foundation for all of this is Steven Soderberghs brilliant direction, which draws excellent performances from a uniformly top-notch cast: all of human life is here; the sordid, the glorious, the sacred and the profane.All in all, its informative, exciting and educative and makes for exhilarating entertainment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P7WKEXM8UVVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8BC59Q#wasThisHelpful","R1P7WKEXM8UVVI","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 1971, this is the first of Pakulas so-called Paranoia trilogy, which was followed by, in 1974 and 1976 respectively, The Parallax View and All the Presidents Men.Not so overtly political as the two later films, although it introduces themes that will echo throughout the 1970s, it is in some senses more akin to Copollas Conversation, which brings to the fore the insidious uses of which emergent technology was  capable in order to spy on the unsuspecting.  Fondas high class call girl, Bree Daniels, is receiving rather unsettling phone calls that, in all probability, would have gone uninvestigated had they not somehow been linked to a parallel investigation into the disappearance of a respected upstate businessman, Tom Gruneman, the whereabouts of whom the FBI are no closer to establishing months in.  Toms friend and business colleague, Peter Cable (Charles Cioffi), calls in John Klute (Donald Sutherland), an old buddy of Toms to move the search forward.  Thus we are introduced to the eponymous detective; basically, a private eye, with no previous missing persons experience.Although Sutherland plays the films title character this is very firmly Fondas movie: Sutherland, as the softly spoken, understated hick, is the movies decent apple pie Norman Rockwell moral centre.  Against him, and his search for his missing friend, are pitted all the materialistic, hedonistic evils of the big city.  He begins the search with the only credible lead the FBI have been able to establish; Bree Daniels.  Initially reluctant to become involved she finds herself inexplicably drawn to Sutherland; inexplicably because her life is all about establishing control over men; the Johns she so easily manipulates.Pakula draws a brilliant, aching, painful performance from Fonda; perhaps her career best and the scenes between her and Sutherland as she gradually begins to relinquish the control upon which she has relied for so long are beautiful to behold.  But all the performances are top notch, including a superbly sleazy cameo from Roy Scheider as Fondas erstwhile pimp and Charles Cioffi, as the Machiavellian puppet master, Peter Cable, who thinks it is he who is pulling all the right strings.But underpinning it all is a superb score by Michael Small, who might reasonably be credited with starting the paranoia film score genre, echoed in films like the near contemporaneous Dirty Harry, all on his own, with this eerily dreamlike but decidedly unsettling creation that perfectly elicits within the viewer the sense of being stared at and which would be developed in his later score for The Parallax View.Almost a perfect film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ADUPDXTK4XFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005U2KC#wasThisHelpful","R1ADUPDXTK4XFP","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Probably the first thing to say about this book is that, whatever use it may be, there is virtually nothing that is uniquely applicable to engineers.  For example, it begins by suggesting the reader build a winning resume followed by landing and acing an engineering job interview before suggesting it would be a good idea to define their career goals. The same advice allies to job seekers in any occupation.Most of the advice it contains is simply common sense: however, to the extent that most of us need commonsensical things pointed out to us before we act sometimes it may probably be of some use.What I found most jarring about it, though, is the relentlessly hyperbolic nature of the tone; e.g. How to be a world class engineer and such like.Basically, if you can get through it without throwing up, you just might get something from it!","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ZRDUUL280FC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118659643#wasThisHelpful","R7ZRDUUL280FC","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fresh from the brilliance of the Bridge I and II I was looking for something to replace the Nordic crime slot in my viewing and noticed another foreign import on BBC4.  Okay its not Nordic Noir and it hasnt the obvious darkness of The Killing or the aforementioned Bridge.  Nevertheless, there is definitely something rotten in the state of Belgium and detective Paul Gerardi sets out to find and expose just what it is.  It opens with a cleverly executed bank heist.  The bank is private, solely open to only the most exclusive clientele who keep their dirty dark secrets safe from prying eyes, so they think, in safety deposit boxes deep in the vaults of the Jonkhere bank.However, only a carefully selected 66 boxes are opened out of the hundreds that line the vault walls.  What is it about this particular set of boxes that interests the burglars?  Gerardi doggedly pursues the clues wherever they may lead and they lead to the highest places in the land; no-ones secrets are safe and murder and mayhem follow.This is a very well made crime series with excellent production values and acting to match.  For me, though, it doesnt quite meet the exacting standards set by its Nordic counterparts; its neither as tightly plotted nor pacey, but, these caveats aside, thoroughly recommended nonetheless!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22PFS0T70WVN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5EE9NA#wasThisHelpful","R22PFS0T70WVN0","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not so much a movie but rather a series of beautifully lit and carefully crafted tableaux of various scenes featuring the great man, often in silhouette and in characteristic pose.  Daniel Day-Lewiss performance is almost chameleon-like and, after a while, the viewer completely forgets even the muttley-like vocal mannerisms, as one is swept up in his remarkable evocation of the gaunt, lantern-jawed president.The nub of the story is the passing of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution (basically, to abolish slavery).  As such, if it had been called The 13th Amendment it would not have been mis-named.  There is a great deal of politicking going on: we see Lincoln as the consummate exponent of that art, ladling out home-spun apple pie homilies when necessary combined with the occasional table thump just to remind all present of the steel beneath the velvet glove.There is too, Lincoln the family man, adeptly pacifying wife Mary, who is sympathetically portrayed, by Sally Field, as a skilful politician in her own right.  Together they endure the torment of a son who feels compelled to go to a war she is convinced will claim him as yet another victim of that internecine carnage.Surrounding them there is a wealth of acting talent on show prominent amongst which is Tommy Lee Jones, as Thaddeus Stevens, the Republican staunch anti-slavery campaigner, and David Strathairn, as Secretary of State, William Seward.  But, chipping in with what might be the most engaging performance is James Spader, playing William Bilbo, a political lobbyist and early incarnation of the type of character one might imagine being on the books of the White House during Nixons inglorious reign.It all makes for an interest view, albeit a very brief one (the action takes place over a four month period towards the end of Lincolns presidency, and life) but is marred by the usual Spielberg traits that will, in all likelihood, prevent him being regarded as one of the greats himself: his seeming inability to avoid the kind of mawkish sentimentality that has the viewer now and again hunting anxiously for the sick bowl!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A883Z1VMGEPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AMANBA#wasThisHelpful","R1A883Z1VMGEPL","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Two superb central performances from James Norton, playing middle class priest, Canon Sydney Chambers, and Robson Green, his working class buddy, Detective Inspector Geordie Keating, combine to make this gently wistful detection series an absolute delight. Attention to period detail means it accurately evokes a Britain slowly emerging from post-war austerity on its way to being a country for which its prime minister could, with some justification claim; `they've never had it so good'!And like most cop/buddy stories the main protagonists have their ups and downs but ultimately successfully manage to meld their own unique qualities into a single crime solving force the baddies simply can't withstand.Series One is based on the book by James Runcie, Sidney Chambers and The Shadow of Death and, like the book, the TV drama is a series of six separate, but linked, stories, through which a core set of characters are introduced, evolve and grow. One of the central themes is the on-going saga of Sidney's love life involving not one but two lovely and intelligent young women.There is quite a bit of soul-searching going on a lot of the time as Sidney wrestles with the demands of his parish work, the oscillating nature of his romantic attachments, and the increasing requirement to come to the aid of his professional buddy, and act as amateur sleuth. The series tackles issues of race, social class, commitment, faith and, of course, love and hate.Yes, there are slight changes from the book but so what? Not everyone has read the book so these won't matter a jot to those people. The TV series and the book from which it is adapted are two different entities; there is no obligation to make it an exact copy and if it was it would not work as well as it does on the screen - that is what an adaptation is!James Norton's gentle and wonderfully nuanced portrayal of Sidney follows his outstandingly evil performance in BBC's `Happy Valley' demonstrating at once a talent for both comedy and drama and an enviable dramatic range.In a word, superb!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYGE32EX8HS2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R041FXA#wasThisHelpful","RYGE32EX8HS2E","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had high hopes for this debut novel when reading the promising blurb on the back since it appeared to explore many of the literary themes which interest me; e.g. psychological thriller and the horrors of war, and set in a time period which is also of interest and, at the present time, topical.  It is undoubtedly, beautifully written but, alas, ultimately disappointing, involving as it does, a rather wimpy protagonist about whom I felt progressively less concern as the narrative unwound.  It was rather like travelling on a reasonably pleasant journey with a reasonably pleasant companion during which nothing more engaging than reasonably interesting things occur, some of which appear to take you down potentially interesting cul-de-sacs the exact nature of which you never really find out.When I did finally reach the end, which comprises a wholly unnecessary epilogue, I simply had the reaction: is that it?","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OB3IBMYHAFMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1908885238#wasThisHelpful","R1OB3IBMYHAFMQ","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being Poldark veterans of the first TV incarnation the whole family waited in eager anticipation for this version and were duly disappointed and not disappointed in turns!  And as fans of the former its virtually impossible not to make comparisons.  The writer of this adaptation, Debbie Horsfield, clearly decided early on not to simply make a glossy replica of the much loved 1970s classic starring Robin Ellis and Angharad Rees.  It is to her credit that the finished article renders something that can justly be regarded as a refreshing twist on what many, given the response to the 1996 TV version of The Stranger from the Sea, starring John Bowe and Mel Martin,  regard as something of a sacred cow!Ross Poldark is still the dark, handsome slightly dangerous but definitely dashing hero returned from the American War and Demelza the rustic maid who fights to win his heart, against what she perceives to be, at least initially, the overwhelming odds embodied by the moneyed society lovely, Elizabeth Chenoweth.  But these 21st Century incarnations of the Cornish lovers have decidedly different character traits compared to their 1970s predecessors, even if their underlying values are the same.Winston Graham, Poldarks creator, could not of course, help but be influenced by his literary forebears: Ross Poldark, in whichever incarnation, bears strong resemblances to both Rochester (Jane Eyre) and Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights) as the strong and sometimes violent man with equally strong and sometimes violent convictions but also only too human weaknesses.  Graham, in his novel Marnie, created Mark Rutland, also something of a Rochester type character, played by Sean Connery in the Hitchcock adaptation, who rescues the girl Marnie, from herself by employing what now would be regarded as decidedly questionable methods; rape being the most obvious, which Hitchcock didnt shy away from depicting.  Thus, although there are dark and violent emotions in these Byronic archetypes, the present Ross appears to have been mellowed by Horsfield somewhat, perhaps in response to 21st Century sensibilities.Aidan Turner in the lead role certainly has the obvious Byronic looks and Eleanor Tomlinson, as Demelza, though not quite so feisty as her TV forebear, the right combination of vulnerability and necessary steeliness when required.  There is too, a marked difference in the relationship between Ross and Elizabeth, and even George Warleggan seems slightly less reptilian than Ralph Bates played him.  However, although Im a Phil Davies fan (Judd Paynter) I dont think anyone will ever be able to replace Paul Currans brilliantly memorable Judd!In short, its a worthwhile viewing experience: though a little too frenetic in places - for example, the motivation for Ross and Demelzas marriage is given insufficient development time - it looks fantastic and should do wonders for the Cornish Tourist Board!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JPX8C7T9SQY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VC1YIB8#wasThisHelpful","R1JPX8C7T9SQY0","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having been infuriated by the much lauded novel upon which this series is based but still being interested in the life of Cromwell I was anxious to see if the adaptation had transcribed all those irritations along with the basic story. Happily that hasn't been the case: the adaptation being mesmerizing not least because of the mesmerizing performance at its core. Mark Rylance is compulsively watchable as the upwardly mobile courtier who, although worldly wise and cunning, still manages to persuade us his heart is in the `right place'.However, Cromwell was a physical as well as political bruiser: Rylance convinces as the latter but perhaps, less so as the former. In his youth Cromwell was said to have been a mercenary fighting with the French; the scenes in which Cromwell attempts physical intimidation of his opponents might therefore be said to be the only weaknesses in an otherwise stunning actualization of the essence of the man. Frequent references are made to Cromwell's 'low birth', not least by Wolsey whose CV is similar in that respect, and ironically, by the Duke of Norfolk (Bernard Hill), whose vulgarity is singularly at odds with Cromwell's 'noble' forbearance in the face of such provocation.The other performances are also, largely, first rate, not least that of the brilliant Jonathan Pryce as the aforementioned arch schemer, Wolsey, Cromwell's sponsor, to whom the latter appears genuinely fond; and Anton Lesser as More; even though he comes across in this little more than a vindictive and sanctimonious prig rather than the `man for all seasons' whose `silence deafens all Europe'!The production not only looks superb: it's literally very dark; but is not afraid, also, to be one of silence and pauses. Ultimately, the impression is of a man of humble origin whose finer qualities of loyalty, courage, iron will and ambition got him promoted to the highest offices of the land but whose real job was as a kind of `nanny' to a spoilt brat for whom he fixed successive toys following their unceremonious dumping from his royal pram.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23U2O4RAAPPC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V324G1S#wasThisHelpful","R23U2O4RAAPPC9","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where to begin? Well the beginning did seem to promise something intriguing with the brutal murder of what, in advance, had seemed to be one of the principal characters: (he is featured prominently on the front of the DVD). Perhaps there would be a series of flashbacks in which this character's backstory was told: he does pop up for a few minutes in a subsequent episode but that's it.From then on it's all downhill! The murder `investigation' is led by the local sheriff, Dan (Richard Dormer), obviously an advocate of the `bull in a china shop' mode of conducting a murder investigation. He turns out to be a bit of a `nutter', making the law up as he goes along to suit whatever seems to be his purpose at the time. This appears to change rapidly, according to events, but is driven by an obsession for a young Spanish woman, Elena (Vernica Echegui), who runs the local hotel. Dan has a deputy, Eric (Bjrn Hlynur Haraldsson), who is married to the Governor, Hildur Odegard (Sophie Grabol), who also seems to be as thick as those two proverbial planks. The only rational police operatives appear to be the two main female officers who have distinctly subservient roles.Fortitude's `finest', therefore, don't seem up to the job and the Governor enlists the aid of the London Metropolitan Police in the form of Detective Chief Inspector Eugene Morton, played with an engaging insouciance, by (American) Stanley Tucci who, it seems, was already on his way to investigate the earlier murder of an obnoxious Brit by the name of Billy Pettigrew. Naturally, the local lunkheads resent the intrusion and try all they can to obstruct his, by necessity, separate investigation. Meanwhile, Elena is bonking the emergency services bloke, Frank Sutter (Nicholas Pinnock) who leaves his son alone in their accommodation to carry out that mission in the barn while his wife, Julia, (Jessica Raine) nips down to the local for a swift jar and some boogying with the locals. Back in the barn Elena is obviously fired by such passion for Frank that she ignores the sub-zero temperatures. However, Frank's little son, Liam, deserted by both parents, decides to skip out the bedroom window and run barefooted through the icy snow, which results in frost bitten toes: so, off to the doctor with him.The only true medic in situ is Dr. Margaret Allardyce (Phoebe Nicholls) who reckons installing Liam in a giant oxygen tank is the answer. Margaret has a daughter, Shirley (Natalie Gunning), with a `weight problem': at 18 stone she's too thin, according to boyfriend, Markus (Darren Boyd), who loses no opportunity to stuff her full of his favourite foods. Aside from this weird behaviour he's just plain creepy!Thicko, Eric, the Governor's husband, has been bonking the Governor's best friend, Trish (Chipo Chung), whose husband, Professor Charlie Stoddart (Christopher Eccleston) has had his brain rearranged by the unknown assailant Dan, with his advanced investigative methods, is never destined to find. Meanwhile, there's a completely nutty old wildlife photographer, Henry Tyson, mumbling barely coherently and feeling sorry for himself cos he's dying of liver cancer, played hammingly to the hilt by Michael Gammon, sorry Gambon, who `senses' there's something not quite right about the place - really? He asks local embalmer/taxidermist/shaman, Tavrani (Ramon Tikaram) to make him a kind of voodoo doll, a tupilaq, to ward off evil spirits.I could go on but I'm sure you get the picture! All in all it's a total mess with so many ridiculous red herrings and cul-de-sacs the writers ought never to be employed again!

Why, for example, is there no place for Thomas Paine, whose book, The Rights of Man, published in 1791, has never been out of print and his pamphlet, Common Sense, published, anonymously in 1776, could reasonably be argued to have inspired the American Revolution: Washington ordered it to be read to all of his troops! Similarly, no place for Alfred Wegener, whose theory of continental drift, initially discredited, is now recognized by all Earth scientists and supported by, amongst other things, paleomagnetic evidence and seafloor spreading and supported by our current knowledge of plate tectonics.It could also be argued that the Beatles were incredibly influential not only in terms of their effect on music, globally, but on popular culture in general. However, I can also understand that, by definition, as a group, they do not qualify! Lastly, Gandhi (M) and Churchill (W) dont merit a place, although they both make the Honourable Mention list. Again, it could be argued that Ghandi was instrumental in beginning the break-up of the largest empire the world has ever seen and that Churchill, Gandhis implacable enemy; in almost single-handedly bolstering British resolve in the two years Britain stood alone against the Nazi war machine, prevented, in vehemently opposing the forces of appeasement, the world from falling into a new dark age. It is highly likely, that without him, Britain would have entered into a dishonourable understanding with Hitler and been swallowed up by the burgeoning Nazi empire which would then have succeeded in conquering the Soviet Union, gained the atomic bomb and the USA would have followed!So, although the book is, in my opinion, not without its faults, that is the fun of such books and the price for which you can pick up this one  worth every penny!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O3CWPIG0QZ9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0806513500#wasThisHelpful","R1O3CWPIG0QZ9N","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This powerful and gripping but emotionally wrenching BBC series recounts the abduction, and its aftermath, of a five year old boy, Oliver Hughes (Oliver Hunt), whilst on holiday in northern France with his mother, Emily (Frances OConnor) and father, Tony (James Nesbitt).  Ostensibly, the focus is on the devastating effect this event has on the childs parents and their marriage but, rather like the pattern made in a pond from a dropped stone, the spreading ripples encompass all of the surrounding characters from potential suspects to the police team carrying out the investigation.Initially the couple are the subject of wide-spread sympathy and everyone, from the proprietors of the hotel in which they are staying to the towns mayor, seems keen to help.  However, they are soon subject to the ravenous attentions of the media and the pressure takes its toll on their relationship.The narrative occurs in the present day, 2014, and through flashback to 2006, the year in which the abduction occurs so, over the course of each episode, we see, gradually, the corrosive effects of this hideous crime on all concerned.  In the process, the story examines various familial but principally parent-child relationship scenarios from the Hughes own with their missing child, Oliver, and that of Emilys with her parents - who travel to France to support their daughter - through lead investigator, Julien Baptistes (Tcheky Karyo) with his drug addicted daughter, to thoroughly odious investigative reporter, Malik Suris (Arsher Ali) with his toddler son.I was at first slightly irritated by James Nesbitts performance but was gradually won over and by the end thoroughly convinced by it.  All the performances were top-notch but one that, unexpectedly, especially moved me was that of Titus de Voogdt, who played one of the prime suspects, Vincent Bourg.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W6I1RV60IEC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3J0GX6#wasThisHelpful","R2W6I1RV60IEC4","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bryan Forbes directed, here, his first film; an adaptation, in black and white, of Mary Haley Bell's story of childhood naivet contrasted with adult cynicism.  The screenplay, written by Willis Hall and Keith Waterhouse, teeters on the edge of mawkishness at times but just about manages to avoid the kind of sentimentality that mars similar films within this genre.  In this sense it resembles `To Kill a Mockingbird' released a year later.It features some of the stalwarts of post-war British cinema and Alan Bates delivers a suitably under stated performance as the bearded fugitive, Blakey, the credulous kids mistake for Jesus when they discover him hiding in their barn.  Using kids from the local primary schools of its rural Lancashire setting as `disciples' it successfully juxtaposes their current innocence with the harsh realities of the adult world they've yet to experience as it retells the story of Christ's betrayal and delivery into the hands of the authorities.  In one scene towards the end a `disciple' is bullied into admitting that Blakey isn't really Jesus just before we hear the local train passing by blowing its whistle!With its wonderfully evocative and now iconic Malcolm Arnold score it's a sheer delight from beginning to end and time machine back to a time that truly, now, seems an age of innocence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LSI0QJT8K6AY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004RE8N#wasThisHelpful","R2LSI0QJT8K6AY","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

James feel and I became quite excited at having discovered a new author I could trust! I suppose that sounds a bit extreme but I think some will understand what I mean.It is very well written: in terms of prose style I cant fault it. However, once the superbly written set up is over the implications arent, unfortunately, handled with as much assurance. I never felt fully convinced by the protagonists growing sense of terror and, as some other reviewers have said, all in all, he and the other characters in the story seem rather half hearted in terms of emotional depth and this makes it more difficult to empathize with them.Another problem is that it doesnt really know what type of story it wants to be: we start off in good ghost story territory; Oxford dons, Gothic architecture and Christmas in the offing; only for it to veer off towards the end into bog standard serial killer country!The novelette also has echoes of another modern Jamesian story; The Matrix, by Jonathan Aycliffe in which, although of novel length, the author manages to gradually build and then maintain a truly unsettling undercurrent of dread. By comparison Three Winter Ghosts does suffer, but I hope Sargent perseveres because I think there may be true talent there!","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7K18JIYKYJU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492931330#wasThisHelpful","R7K18JIYKYJU3","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im a bit of a fan of titbit books that you can pick up; gain something useful from by way of inspiration, information, motivation and probably any other of a hundred other words ending in ion; and put down without worrying about losing your place!This book certainly fulfils that criterion.  Distributed amongst eight useful categories from The Ancient World to the Internet Age are the products of Humans inventiveness that made the modern World we live in today.  The earliest entry goes to stone tools, which date as far back as 2.6 million years B.C.E, whilst the most recent is the Large Hadron Collider, which arguably neatly summarizes mankinds progress, at least in material terms, from the Stone Age to one of the pinnacles of Western Civilization.Obviously, each entry is necessarily limited to the most salient facts: if youre going to tackle 1001 entries you cant afford to go on at length.  But it serves to whet the appetite for further research.  Open this book at random and you can be sure to hit on something to pique your interest; as several have observed before me  it makes the perfect loo companion or an invaluable resource for those enjoy pub quizzes and the like!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W7XMUFJIHGQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764161369#wasThisHelpful","R1W7XMUFJIHGQ1","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a commendable attempt to make the process of actually `doing' science and technology a bit `sexy' through the story of British boffins, just before the outbreak of World War II, inventing one of the early forms of Radio Detection and Ranging, or, as the US Navy later referred to it, RADAR. To some extent it works as we witness the establishment of a team of suitably eccentric egg-heads led by Robert Watson Watt (Eddie Izzard) gradually persuade the initially somewhat skeptical `powers that be' that it could make a vital contribution to the air defence of the realm when hostilities with Germany actually began.Watt's unconventional team drew from most corners of the British Isles: he was Scottish and a worthy descendant from James Watt; his chief assistant, Arnold `Skip' Wilkins (Karl Davies), English; and the cricket loving Edward `Taffy' Bowen (Celyn Jones), Welsh, amongst others. Predictably, they are given little money, shabby accommodation, scarcely functioning equipment and, perhaps most tellingly of all, held in barely concealed contempt by the influential and somewhat odious Frederick Lindemann, played convincingly with relish by David Hayman. Lindemann did his best to discredit Watts' efforts and tried to use his close relationship with Churchill, who, although out of government, always had his own `secret sources of information', to obstruct the team's progress. Fortunately, on this occasion Churchill's instinct that their efforts might prove fruitful overcame his tendency to defer to Lindemann on scientific and technical matters. (Lindemann is an interesting character in himself being, of German origin, and simultaneously an almost rabid anti-Nazi and believer in eugenics and the possibility of genetically engineering a race of `super-beings'; characteristics which, however, are not pursued in this programme).Eventually, following a semi-successful demonstration to various government officials, including Air Marshall, Sir Hugh Dowding, head of RAF Fighter Command, Watt and his team were able to secure greater funding and rather more salubrious quarters.Ultimately, the attempt to make science (at least appear) sexy doesn't quite succeed; the only hint of sexiness being supplied is in the form of Laura Fraser who plays Watt's long-suffering wife, Margaret! Nevertheless, it has a certain charm and continues the delineation of `war wizardry' begun almost fifty years previously in, arguably, a rather more successful attempt by British classic, `The Dam Busters'.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQL9RXSOZADX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJMPKYY#wasThisHelpful","RQL9RXSOZADX0","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, she is supported by an equalling brilliant cast in this dark tale of evil lurking beneath the seemingly prosaic world of the post-industrial, West Yorkshire market town of Hebden Bridge.Catherines domestic life is tangled with tragedy at its core and she seeks to assuage the guilt she feels through her police work and the raising of her young grandson. But the release from prison of Tommy Lee Royce, chillingly played by James Norton, who Catherine blames for the suicide of her daughter, sparks a series of dramatic events of Jacobean proportions!This is gripping, edge-of the-seat stuff and continues, fittingly, the long tradition of brilliant BBC productions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V53N63573IKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRXHEAA#wasThisHelpful","R1V53N63573IKP","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You could say that this series is a study in the most stressful life events that anyone can endure: if it can happen - it does happen! What makes the series such a winning formula is not only how its characters cope but the humanity, even when behaving abominably, with which each reacts to the others' misfortunes. Central to all the mayhem is the story of the septuagenarian lovers, Alan (Derek Jacobi) and Celia (Anne Reid), whose teenage crush survives six decades, their marriages to other people and the birth of their own families, only to be rekindled by the `magic' of the Internet!It cannot avoid melodrama but the interwoven stories of the lives of the two families are told, by scriptwriter, the excellent Sally Wainwright, with such knowing warmth and delivered, by a superb cast, with such `sure-footedness' that one is held captive; laughing one moment - crying the next!

"Any attempt to represent the Russian front impartially is almost certainly going to alienate one or other of the various participants descendants. And so it is with this production, which does have its fair share of controversy! It tells the fictional story of 5 twenty something friends, all of whom are native Berliners, as they each in their own way prepare to deal with the looming crisis of the drive to gain Hitlers Lebensraum. The need for this living space was outlined in the infamous Mein Kampf dictated to his lackey, Hess, when both were languishing in Bavarias Landsberg Prison following the failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1924.Two of the friends are brothers, the eldest, Wilhelm (Volker Bruch), who is a junior army officer, and his pacifist brother, Friedhelm (Tom Schilling), a private in the army, are shortly off to participate in Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia, which begins on June 22nd 1941. Two are girls, Charlotte (Miriam Stein), who is in love with Wilhelm, and Greta (Katharina Schuttler), an opportunistic, somewhat cynical would be singer, working as barmaid. The final member of this group is Viktor (Ludwig Trepte), who is Jewish and therefore, perhaps, the most unlikely. Some critics were left open-mouthed at the improbability of any twenty-something Germans, having had nine years of Nazi indoctrination, enjoying friendly relations with a Jew. However, Viktor and Gretas relationship is a little more than friendly and in the opening scene during which the group assembles in the bar for the last time before they all have to go their own way, Greta establishes a fateful relationship with an SS officer who interrupts their party, in order to save Viktor from discovery.Other critics have poured scorn on the production for seemingly ignoring any aspect of the holocaust, for depicting ordinary Germans as victims of Nazism rather than more than willing participants and portraying Polish partisans as rabid anti-Semites. Nevertheless, the series is brilliantly acted and does succeed in illustrating certain aspects of Hitlers War of Annihilation on the Russians. As such it represents a welcome addition to other similar series such as Band of Brothers also, with some justification, not without its critics, which serve to educate succeeding generations about the satanic nature of Nazi Germany.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPNLY13GHH2W3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ID8H8EW#wasThisHelpful","RPNLY13GHH2W3","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the story of a man descending into a hell, largely of his own making.  Christopher Eccleston convincingly plays the once idealistic big city councillor, Daniel Demoys, who uses his power and influence to award contracts for building work to seemingly respectable local `businessmen' who are, of course, more than a bit `dodgy'!  The financial rewards for this mean that, socially, he is upwardly mobile. However, this is only one of several skeletons lurking at the back of his closet!  As he becomes further mired in the seamy machinations of city hall and falls under the influence of corrupt council official, Jerry Durrans (Ewen Bremner), he begins to consume ever greater volumes of alcohol and frequently awakes in strange places with very little recollection of how he got there or what happened the night before!Needless to say this all leads him on a downward spiral into the beginnings of alcoholism, even dodgier criminal involvement and impending marriage breakdown.  But determined to redeem himself and recapture his early idealism he decides to `come clean' with the electorate and finds his refreshing honesty has made him a hero with the public and he's touted for mayor!The production design appears to be the bizarre lovechild of `Amelie' and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner; it always seems to be raining. We never know where or when it is but this dark city was very reminiscent, to this viewer at least, of a kind of slightly futuristic green-tinged Manchester.  The acting is first rate - we get a characteristically nasty cameo from David Hayman - and the pressure on both Demoys and the viewer builds to a nerve shredding appropriate tension.  Disappointingly, however, the ending seemed just a little too pat.Nevertheless, despite not being perfect - what is? - in its depiction of a descent into alcoholism, corporate corruption and human frailty it makes for stylish and compelling viewing and very well worth a watch!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31JN6C1N1NN1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009VB9K6O#wasThisHelpful","R31JN6C1N1NN1Q","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first read this many decades ago when O'Hara was better known and, along with his compatriots such as Faulkner and Hemingway, etc. more popular than now.  Only Fitzgerald and Steinbeck seem to have remained so with each having books on examination syllabuses.  But, of course, that doesn't necessarily mean they're popular!However, since the publisher has seen fit to re-issue this in Penguin Classics, perhaps O'Hara will begin to enjoy something of a return to popularity.  The novel was certainly popular when first published in the middle fifties and won a prestigious literary award.  It tells the story of Joseph B. Chapin a big fish in a small pond, living all of his life in the mythical Gibbsville, Pennsylvania, described as being `too large to be a town but too small to be a city'.  His story opens shortly after his life ends when the great and the good of Gibbsville are gathered to pay their respects to one of their own at his funeral and O'Hara omits no detail in telling us who these people are, their relationship to the deceased and their relative importance to the life of their town.  In this respect the book is something of a tour-de-force of sustained writing employing, as it does, flashbacks and flash-forwards to interweave the complex web of inter-relationships among this seeming multitude of characters many of whom play no, or very little, further part in Joe's story.  And I have to say that at times learning the intimate details of these people's lives became somewhat tiresome.Having said that, persistence does pay off as the various threads eventually connect to form a picture of a man whose reach very definitely exceeds his grasp and for which he eventually pays a heavy price.  I was prompted to revisit the novel in the wake of having completed another long overlooked apparent would-be `classic', `Stoner' dubbed by the Guardian as the `must read book of 2013' and written by a writer much less well known than O'Hara.  In certain respects the two books bear comparison since, although their protagonists are not exact contempories, they describe the lives of two American men from birth to death, during the early to middle years of the Twentieth Century.  As such I can recommend them as appropriate companion pieces.  They are both extremely well-written in their own ways but, although I am glad I've read them, I don't think I shall return to either of them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13274DB7ACBQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143107100#wasThisHelpful","R13274DB7ACBQY","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately I was expecting something else when I ordered this, and after reading some of the more effusive reviews: I don't know; something a bit different, something, perhaps, profound. But, considering the tragic circumstances of the author's childhood as a cancer sufferer, all I got from this series of recommendations gleaned from a lifetime of comparative pain and suffering, were a series of rather facile reflections on a particular life that, in some instances, I found mildly offensive.By comparison to, say, something like 'Cancer Ward' by Solzhenitsyn, which a reader may find very definitely a life-changing experience, this came across as nothing better than a twee series of not very insightful fairy tales.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R338890NTZSYRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718194810#wasThisHelpful","R338890NTZSYRC","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having been astonished by his earlier book, I am Jonathan Scrivener, published two years previously, I hunted round for any others from the same period and this fitted the bill perfectly.  Unsurprisingly, there are several similarities: the earlier novel featured the absent and enigmatic Jonathon Scrivener who, consequently, became the books focus around whom all the events of the novel were woven.  Chaos also features someone; Sir Keith Petersley, who becomes one of its leading figures but who is absent for most of the time.  Both of these lead characters employ a third person to fulfil similar roles, and who acts as a lens through which the narrative unfolds.  In the earlier book, James Wrexham is taken on by Scrivener, ostensibly, to catalogue the books in his London apartments library.  In Chaos, Vernon Dexter is employed to be the tutor of Petersleys seven year old son, Eric, who remains immobile after being dropped as a two year old.The Petersleys are an odd bunch and, minus the errant patriarch, either inhabit a decaying stately pile called Greystones, situated somewhere deep in the English countryside, or live close by.  There is no money and Dexter never gets paid and barely fed but luckily he has an independent income, which allows him to pursue a career he enjoys knowing that as soon as he stops doing so he can simply give it up.  Aside, from Eric there are four adult children; Adrian, from Petersleys first marriage, who is a brilliant award winning architect, Clive, a self-pitying milksop who works in a job through his social connections, Myrtle, a late twenty-something spinster obsessed with the local self-obsessed curate who is clearly off his trolley, and Anna, the youngest at twenty, who is beautiful, feisty and kind.  Petersleys second wife, Lady Isabel, is desperately in love with her absent husband, who makes no secret of his affair with a leading actress.  She, therefore, invents for herself a dream world which she inhabits in self-inflicted seclusion barely leaving a private apartment within the crumbling great house itself.Having sought out an interesting position with interesting people Dexter immerses himself in their motley and often absurd lives just as, in Scrivener, Wrexham becomes immersed in the lives of the friends of Scrivener who call at the flat in his absence and through whom he begins to piece together a mosaic of the man himself.There is much to admire in this later book: the writing, as in the earlier, is exquisite and Houghton uses his characters to give voice to his own opinions on the state of the Empire  this was published in 1932 - and the descent of man into the chaos alluded to in the title.  However, regrettably, instead of coming to a satisfying conclusion, it rather peters out and, as such, is worth only 4 stars.  Nevertheless, this is still very much worth a read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EUOGR7SSQ5K6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VW7M3U#wasThisHelpful","R3EUOGR7SSQ5K6","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To some extent this series is a bit of a mess! There is so much going on that it's easy to get lost amongst the mixture of plot elements that appear to have been put together rather in the manner of someone cheating when completing a puzzle by cutting the first pieces they pick up to force them to fit. We have Frankenstein's creation displaced in time and space competing for top spot with Dracula who appears to have spirited Mina away from a father she never originally had. He seems to be a kind of Allan Quartermain explorer type obsessed with finding the origin of the Nile and racked with guilt over the loss of both children: his son accompanied him on one ill-fated trip. Buffalo Bill, in the guise of Ethan Chandler (Josh Hartnett) also plays a prominent part together with Dorian Gray convincingly mincing his way through the lot and corrupting any and every one he can literally lay his hands upon. And in the monster's attraction to Maude, an ingnue playing at the local Grand Guignol theatre, there is even a hint of Gaston Laroux's famous phantom.Central to all this mayhem is the figure of Vanessa Ives played by Eva Green who gives an astonishing performance as the possessed friend of Mina whose aforementioned father, Sir Malcolm Murray (Timothy Dalton), is convinced holds the key to his daughter's fate: so chuck in a bit of the Exorcist as well! A brilliantly hammy turn by Simon Russell Beale as an utterly dotty Egyptologist and a curious sprinkle of Billie Piper as a consumptive Irish whore completes the dish. All we are missing is the slightly puzzling absence of Mr Hyde: but (hopefully) it's still early days yet!So, utterly unoriginal and yet utterly compelling: it plays upon the viewer's knowledge of all of those Gothic ingredients to create a heady brew that looks absolutely sumptuous and is very, very definitely for adult consumption only. This is the grown-up relative of the recent Jonathan Rees Myers, Dracula which, though good, is a pale shadow of this gloriously exotic concoction.It's highly probable you will have seen nothing like it on television before!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q92TCWQQCZVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KACFMHO#wasThisHelpful","R1Q92TCWQQCZVV","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is quite a lengthy book but the quality of the writing is so fine that the pages skip easily by.  This is aided by the average lengths of the chapters none of which are longer than four pages.It tells the story of a young German boy and a young French girl of comparable ages and their lives leading up to and during WWII.  The boy, Werner Pfennig, lives with his little sister, Jutta, in an orphanage, in Zollverein, for the children of those killed in mining accidents.  He is a precocious technophile and a wiz at repairing broken radios.  When the story opens, in 1934, he is seven and Jutta is five; two little typical Aryan progeny, both of whom have hair as white as snow.  Werner is destined for the mines, at 14 but is saved when one day he is called upon to repair the radio of a local Nazi party official who, as a reward, recommends him to a Napola (Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten or National Institute of Education); one of about 30 such instititutions created to indoctrinate young minds to become the administrators of the envisaged global Nazi empire.  In reality they brutalized and brainwashed their young charges to the extent that they willingly threw themselves under the wheels of the allied juggernaught during the last months of the war and were slaughtered in their thousands.The girl, Marie-Laure, lives with her father who is a locksmith and works for the Musum National d'Histoire Naturelle that is home to a unique 37 carat sea diamond, the Sea of Flame, much coveted by the marauding Nazis.  At age eight she goes blind and her father, a skilful artisan, constructs for her each year on her birthday, an intricate puzzle box inside of which, should she succeed in solving its particular problem, is a special treat.  He also constructs a scale model of the surrounding area in which they live so that she is able to go out and find her way around.  When the invasion reaches Paris they escape to a relatives house in St. Malo, on the coast of Brittany.  Marie-Laure is an avid reader and soon learns braille, which enables her to travel to and see places in her imagination: Jules Verne and Charles Darwins Voyage of the Beagle acting as a kind of magic carpet.The protagonists stories are told in alternating chapters and the reader knows that, at some point, they are going to mesh.  In some ways this is a magical book but it does have some drawbacks: for one, the narrative shuttles backwards and forwards in time quite a lot and its not really obvious what the author is attempting to achieve by this.  Just as you are beginning to learn something about one of the characters suddenly you are whisked off to another time and/or place completely, which is somewhat disconcerting.  Also, having said, earlier, that the writing is fine some Americanisms creep in, examples of which are sidewalk, pre-packaged sandwiches (really?) etc. which again, is quite jarring.Nevertheless, any deficiencies are more than made up for by the story itself which, despite the brutality of monstrous evil, is one of love, hope and self-sacrifice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HACLZ919FAM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476746583#wasThisHelpful","R2HACLZ919FAM5","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film illustrates, through the microcosm of an elite school for future supermen, in which we see two cadets forge an unlikely bond of friendship, the brutalizing effect of Nazi ideology on a whole generation.  The main focus is on Friedrich Weimer (Max Reimelt) the very epitome of Aryan perfection, whose boxing skills are noticed by an instructor at the school and which gain him entry into its hallowed ranks.  To these is added Albrecht, son of the local gauleiter (paramilitary governor) whose father epitomizes, in his own way, the twisted logic of Nazi philosophy, which is totally at odds with his more sensitive sons own world view.Gradually, Albrechts influence on Friedrich causes the latter to question his continued willing participation in and acceptance of the very philosophy he literally embodies. The film makes for very uncomfortable viewing but succeeds, eminently, in depicting the desensitizing effects of Nazi brainwashing in which kindness, tolerance and sensitivity represent weaknesses to be eradicated at all costs; bringing, vividly to mind, OBriens statement to Winston at the end of 1984, if you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face  forever.As you will read in other reviews there is some controversy over this particular DVD version concerning aspect ratios and the fact that the packaging doesnt reflect its content!  But, not being aware of any of this prior to viewing it had no effect on me whatsoever.  Therefore, if you want a very well-made, acted to perfection, glimpse of the true evil of the Nazi state, dont let any of that put you off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R58QHQWVP2QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009Y8DQ2S#wasThisHelpful","R3R58QHQWVP2QH","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"An adaptation of Nevil Shute's 1957 novel and released in 1959 but set in 1964, after a World War III nuclear exchange, the film was remarkably prescient, considering the Cuban missile crisis looming just over the horizon. It tells the story of, what is suggested to be, the last remaining humans alive awaiting, in Australia, their seemingly inevitable fate, as deadly radiation seeps ever further south.The last remaining American submarine captained by Commander Dwight Towers (Gregory Peck) sails into Melbourne, having been submerged during the super powers' fatal exchange and falls under the command of the Royal Australian Navy. Towers is assigned a liaison officer, Lieutenant Peter Holmes (Anthony Perkins) who is married to a somewhat infantile and very naive wife, Mary (Donna Anderson). The couple have a young baby, Jennifer, frequently referred to but never seen. The couple throw a party for Towers and we are introduced to a couple of the other major players in the cast: scientist, Julian Osborn (Fred Astaire) and love interest, Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner). Towers and Davidson duly oblige and an embryonic relationship is established by him putting her to bed, alone, after she characteristically overdoes the alcohol intake.A strange continuous but non-repeating Morse Code signal is picked up by what's left of the authorities and Tower's superior officer, Admiral Bridie (John Tate) orders him to take his sub to investigate: the origin of the signal is San Diego. With him go Osborn, to take appropriate measurements of radiation in the northern hemisphere. Holmes, who has to try to convince his wife, that if he doesn't return in time, she needs to administer the necessary `pills' to their daughter and herself, is also along for the ride. Initially, she reacts with characteristic naivet and seems unable to face reality but eventually allows herself to be persuaded.The film must have made for quite traumatic viewing at the time given its audience: the first in the history of the planet to live with, what must have seemed the very real prospect of imminent annihilation. The black and white cinematography adds to the feeling of stark reality and the score, by the Oscar nominated, Ernest Gold, packs a suitable punch in all the right places.It makes for dismal viewing, especially the end, and along with other, typical of the time, Cold War offerings such as Fail Safe (1964) paints a pretty depressing, doom-laden view of the future of human-kind. But then MAD was always a rather ironic way of ensuring posterity existed to view them!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZI7U0P06AMY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004SGB5#wasThisHelpful","RZI7U0P06AMY2","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this lesser known war film McQueens persona is very different from that in which he got top billing in the perennial classic, The Great Escape, released the following year.  In this earlier film, although he also got top billing, he was very much one among several in what amounts to quite an ensemble piece with, if anything, Bobby Darin, getting more on screen time with the more obviously flashy role of the cocky, happy go lucky platoon souvenir collector, Corby.  McQueen plays, Reese, a battle-hardened veteran recently demoted from sergeant: the reason is more or less skipped over but suggests that hes a bit wound-up.  In a relatively minor role, James Coburn, his Magnificent Seven buddy, plays mechanical whiz, Corporal Henshaw.  Harry Guardino and Fess (Davy Crockett) Parker play Sgts. Larkin and Pike, respectively.The story opens in a rest area behind the front line in Montigny, 1944.  We dont know which Montigny  there are several dozen in France  but its near the Siegfried Line so its likely its around November/December just before the Battle of the Bulge. Reese arrives to join up with his new platoon and meet his new buddies but right away shows he isnt much of a team player.  The following day the company have to move back up to the front line and Reeses squad; Corby, Henshaw et. al under Sgt. Larkin have to hold a position on a slightly raised ridge across from a German pill box housing a machine gun post and situated behind a mine field.  Temporarily, the company is split up and the platoon is stretched far too thinly to be able to hold out for very long should the Germans discover just how thinly!  Needless to say they become stressed out; bullets begin to fly and tempers begin to fray.This is a relatively short, tightly scripted film with McQueen on top form and all other performances right on the money; in particular, its a vivid reminder of the scandalously under-used acting talents of Darin (see also, Pressure Point with Sidney Poitier, released the same year).  The black and white cinematography and superb lighting are just right and brilliantly evoke the reality of the mud, dirt and squalor of foxhole life.  And, of course, its directed by Don Siegel  did he ever make a bad film?","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIBHWIGH5UPOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YCCPRA#wasThisHelpful","RIBHWIGH5UPOY","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This graphic versions of Shakespeare's Macbeth is brilliant for bringing the story to a new generation who will, hopefully, be able to then progress at a later stage to the original text. This makes it a far less forbidding experience for the average GCSE English pupil! The original text and the modern English versions share the same images and so can be directly compared, page for page, if pupils are struggling to understand the original. The artwork is uniformly excellent.Additionally, there are also some well written background articles on the globe, the background to Macbeth itself with a 'potted' history of the appropriate period of Scotland. Together, with a full Dramatis Personae, all of this makes for a very fulfilling reading experience for younger readers who have an opportunity to experience the full richness of Shakespeare's English and the contribution he made to the development of our language.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30BPQ3I6PWJRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906332444#wasThisHelpful","R30BPQ3I6PWJRH","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Three years before they made The Thomas Crown Affair together, McQueen first teamed up with Norman Jewison to make, essentially, a cover version of Paul Newmans The Hustler.  This time, instead of pool we have the kid from the wrong side of the tracks attempting to beat, The Man, Lancey Howard, at his own game, stud poker.There are various side issues to settle along the way before the kid sits down with the Man and McQueen gets marvelous support from a stunning cast including; the great Edward G Robinson, as Lancey Howard, Karl Malden as the kids friend, Shooter, Anne Margret as Melba, Shooters frivolous wife, who also has the kid in her sights, and Joan Blondell, as Lady Fingers.  Both Robinson and Blondell were nominated for Oscars in supporting roles.With a brilliant script by Ring Lardner Jnr, its scored by Lalo Schiffrin whod also create the iconic score for Bullitt three years later and the title song is by the equally great Ray Charles; what more could anyone want?Oh, and unlike with Thomas Crown, the Blu-ray upgrade is definitely worth it; totally stunning!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8UFBOE7ZJWNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OBQDHU#wasThisHelpful","R8UFBOE7ZJWNK","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Isbel Loment is a spoiled rather bored woman, in her early twenties, who lives with her relatively elderly widowed and wealthy aunt and who is is engaged to the right man.  She lives the slightly cloistered middle class life of a well brought up girl between the wars and superficially appears to have a perfect middle class life planned out for her.  And yet, she feels vaguely dissatisfied, moving as she does, with her aunt, from one hotel to another in search of the right house.  Marshall, Isbels fianc, is a somewhat staid stockbroker recently returned from America on business during which journey he meets a recently widowed middle-aged English industrialist, Henry Judge, with a house that might fit the bill for Isbel and her aunt.  The house, Runhill Court, is in West Sussex, quite close to where the women are staying in Brighton, and is ancient, having first been built by a Saxon nobleman named Ulf.Marshall agrees to contact the owner and arrange for them to visit.  In advance of the visit Marshall relates a story about the house told to him by Judge regarding a strange room on one of the upper floors of the house that can only accessed by a phantom staircase that appears abruptly now and again and vanishes just as quickly.  Her interest piqued Isbel is keen to visit.  When she does she hears music playing: someone is playing a piano and she recognizes the music as an ascending scale in the first movement of Beethovens 7th symphony.  Suddenly she has an awareness of other times; a feeling that this is not all there is as if lifted above the trivia of her everyday existence into a new realm of greater intensity.  Separated from her fianc, who has wandered off during her reverie, she ascends to an upper floor and enters a room.  There she meets a man who turns out to be Judge the owner.  Immediately they experience a strong mutual attraction but realize they must leave and return to normality.Isbel is shaken by her experience and though she remembers little of her encounter in the upper room is left with echoes of the feeling experienced there and intuitively feels that it has something to do with Judge who appears to be just another middle-aged man to her outside the seemingly mystical room.  It is as if the room has enabled her to connect with life as it should be lived.The book is beautifully written and although some have remarked that the style is a bit awkward and stilted in places that was not my experience.  I will certainly re-read it after a suitable time period: it reminds me of another book written about ten years previously by another shamefully and long neglected English writer, Claude Houghton, who also wrote similar meta-physical fantasies such as the exquisite, I am Jonathan Scrivener.  Lyndsey is far better remembered for his science fiction fantasy, Voyage to Arcturus, but The Haunted Woman certainly deserves to be equally well regarded.The only modern writer I have experienced who comes close to evoking the same sense of other-worldliness is, somewhat bizarrely, given the differences in period and cultural background, Haruki Murakami.But on reflection, perhaps this isnt as strange as it may at first seem!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WLZ09C8W9B8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080953231X#wasThisHelpful","R1WLZ09C8W9B8I","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By no means a conventional vampire story; the book appears to represent an attempt, by its author, to try something a bit different and, in this respect it succeeds. It concentrates on the centrality of blood to the maintenance of life and examines our human fascination with it, which may also explain, at least in part, our equal fascination with the mythical creatures for whom it, literally, forms the essence of their existence.I was attracted to the book because, I'm something of a Francophile, a lover of Paris in particular, and a fan of Gothic literature and books set in war time and it begins in France shortly after that city has been liberated from the Nazi occupation towards the end of WWII. So, with all those boxes `ticked' I settled down to read with keen anticipation that my eagerness would be well rewarded. Alas, this was only partially true! It is written well enough by a well-regarded author of books that have until now been targeted at the young adult market. And it does begin promisingly enough sketching out a background for its protagonist, Charles Jackson, a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corp, and setting up a raison d'etre for all that follows.While visiting, with his superior officer, a museum on the outskirts of Paris one day Jackson is drawn to look into a bunker in the grounds and there, in the darkness within, is disconcerted to witness what he believes to be a man drinking the blood of a prone young woman. The man looks up from his gory refreshment and stares at Jackson with a look of barely concealed amusement. Startled, Jackson stumbles out into the glare of day and makes his way back to his major and is subsequently driven away from the nefarious scene to what he believes to be `reality'.Time passes. However, he is caused, vividly, to recall this event in 1951 when, as an `up and coming' star of the medical world, he is invited to address a prestigious medical conference on the latest developments in his particular field, haematology. Following what he feels was a disappointing performance he leaves the conference early and later that day, in a brasserie, is stunned to see the same man from the bunker seven years before. This time he is only in deep conversation with a young woman. When the woman leaves alone Jackson decides to follow her to another bar and manages to strike up a conversation. In doing so he finds out her name, Marian, and that she is an American PhD student at the Sorbonne whose thesis, on how blood is used in The Divine Comedy, is in an area of research in which an old friend of his is a world renowned expert. She finds this sufficiently an inducement to accept Jackson's invitation to visit Cambridge and there meets, Professor Hunter Wilson, Jackson's friend and eminent Dante scholar.Jackson intends to use the visit to try to `pump' Marian for all the information she has about the mysterious man from the bunker and ends up falling in love with her. She tells him that the man's name is Verovkin, a wealthy Estonian minor aristocrat who is acting as her `patron', but she reveals little else about him. She returns to Paris with little sign that she reciprocates Jackson's feelings. He manages to meet with her sporadically but she seems very reluctant to divulge anything further about Verovkin and, at some point, stops responding to his letters. Eventually he travels to Paris to confront her but is dismayed to learn that she has returned to America, due to a breakdown in her health.Convinced that Marian has come to harm and that Verovkin is responsible, guilt drives Jackson to begin his quest to find Verovkin and bring him to justice. The quest is pursued over the next two decades and wreaks havoc with Jackson's career, health and relationships.In its early stages the book's pace is exactly right and the reader feels that the stage is set for some exciting action. The author manages, too, to convey a distinctly unsettling atmosphere as Jackson's pursuit of his prey takes him, at first, to Avignon and then on to various other parts of Europe. However, the pace then drops and for long periods nothing seems to happen and our `hero' Jackson proves himself to be something of an incompetent clot and just a bit too wimpy! Okay, some nasty things happen to him and others but, in response, he just seemed to cry a lot and not do very much else!There is much discussion about blood, the Eucharist and various other mythical associations which would all be very interesting providing there was more of a pay-off for the reader in terms of some sort of progress being made. Eventually I got just a bit fed up with Jackson's blubbering and simply found the ending, having patiently waded through with increasing disinterest, irritating!","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NCX0NM9D5A9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRKPFV2#wasThisHelpful","R2NCX0NM9D5A9C","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a fan of both gothic literature and crime fiction and a huge admirer of Tim Willocks' and James Lee Burke's novels, principally featuring the latter's New Iberia detective, Dave Robicheaux and his sidekick, Clete Purcell, I eagerly awaited the appearance of HBO's True Detective. Basically it's a `buddy movie', or more accurately, a buddy anthology, since both its protagonists, spectacularly brought to life in this first installment, by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, play homicide cops for the Louisiana State Police.Of course, since detectives work in pairs, it's hard not to make a buddy movie about cops; (one notable recent exception being `Prisoners' featuring Jake Gyllenhaal's, billy no-mates). From, Bodie and Doyle, Starsky and Hutch and Cagney and Lacey right up to the recent crop of Nordic Noir imports, The Killing and The Bridge, the crime element almost always takes backstage, slightly, to the (developing) relationship between the cops. True Detective is no exception and it is the character arc of predominantly, Woody Harrelson's, Detective Marty Hart, which provides the interest here: both cops are damaged, or at least, troubled `lost souls', more obviously so in the case of McConaughy's `Rust' Cohle, whose eccentricities are explained by the fact that `he's from Texas'. So it is that, at first, Detective Hart appears to be the well-balanced, sane, `feet on the ground' type of guy assigned a new, slightly strange, partner from out of state.  However, initially, at least, this relationship is definitely of the `love hate' variety with the love conspicuous by its absence.SOME SPOILERS from this point!They're sent to the scene of, what appears to be, a ritual killing and so begins the investigation of the murder of the unfortunate former prostitute, Dora Kelly Lange. And gradually, as the investigation develops we get the impression that all is not right in Marty's life and, just as there is a very dark undercurrent flowing beneath the seeming respectability of the civic life of Vermilion Parish and the wider state scene of Louisiana, so there are features of Marty's domestic and professional situations that don't bear too close a scrutiny. And, progressively, we begin to detect that the apparently most troubled of the two, Cohle, is, in fact, the one whose integrity remains intact as his partner slowly disintegrates under the pressure of being forced to confront both the unsavoury reality of his working life and the values upon which his domestic `relationships' are founded and the conflict within his soul becomes a raging war between the two sides of his personality.Duality/duplicity is a constant thread running through the story; from, for example, Cohle's four years spent as an undercover narcotics cop among an East Texas biker gang and Hart's reprehensible antics, to those of the odious Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle and his family. Even Maggie, Hart's unfortunate wife; a victim of his `extra-curricular activities', decides to use his own methods against him, defiling herself and Cohle in the process. Added to this is the destabilizing effect on Hart of his oldest daughter's emerging sexuality signaling her eventual departure from the family home representing, once again, a breakdown of the family as a unifying principle in his life. Thus, when she is caught in the back of a car with, not one, but  two teenaged boys his instinctive reaction is to hit out  with unthinking violence because, in doing so, he somehow manages to assuage his own guilt at consorting with much younger women, and re-establish the norms of his `social/domestic order'. This partly explains the extremes of Hart's violence whenever he's confronted by his own `indescretions': it is Cohle who holds up to him a mirror from which he can't avert his gaze and which, therefore, must be smashed into non-existence.Another main character, of course, is the mysterious perpetrator, heard (about) but rarely seen and referred to, variously, as the `Green Spaghetti Monster' and the `Yellow King' who inhabits `Carcosa', which seems to be, in the latter case, a direct reference to the late Nineteenth Century writers of `Lovecraftian' type supernatural tales, Robert W. Chambers and Ambrose Bierce, respectively. Check out the cover art from the recent `CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform' edition of Chamber's `The King in Yellow' to see what I mean.But perhaps the most mysterious character of all is the Louisiana countryside; an often bleak, flat seemingly never-ending terrain of impenetrable bayous, swampy inlets, bald-cypresses and oak forests; a terrain that gives shelter to the monster towards which the action propels our two driven detectives, who, in seeking to end its nefarious reign, look to salvage some kind of personal and joint redemption.The whole thing is brilliantly realized: the writing assured, the narrative multilayered, the plot complex, the dialogue rich and authentic and the acting stunning. We've been spoilt by 24, Homeland, The Killing and The Bridge etc. but this is right up there with the very best and the `icing' on this particular cake is the theme song by the Handsome Family that effortlessly evokes the alien nature of the angel-abandoned country through which, with Cohle and Hart, we fearfully tread!And we hear its echoes still - lingering in our dreams.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35WUZ8VGX4SHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUCF420#wasThisHelpful","R35WUZ8VGX4SHN","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In considering Scott's performance in this brilliant film I was put in mind of Cassius's words regarding Caesar, whom he describes as bestriding `this world like a colossus'.  That might be seen as something of an exaggeration but for the fact that he features in virtually every scene.  Similarly, though principally by his admirers, the same might be said about the eponymous general whom Scott embodies as though born to play this one role alone.  In a remarkably nuanced performance, given the characteristics of the man he plays, Scott allows the more sensitive side of Patton's character to appear from time to time and even, though for the briefest of moments, elements of self-doubt and self-recrimination as, for example, he is informed of the plight of American troops landing amphibiously during the battle for Messina or kissing the forehead of an American captain following a ten hour vicious encounter with a German armoured column during the Battle of the Bulge.However, central to all that happens for the last two thirds of the film is the infamous `slapping' incident following which, on Eisenhower's order, Patton has to apologize to the assembled `offendees' including the doctors and nurses, in addition to the slapped soldier, but still manages to accuse the latter of cowardice in so doing!  He certainly had a way with words but not one best geared to achieve his ultimate purpose, which was to occupy a pivotal role in the upcoming thrust into Nazi Germany.  In fact he is relieved of his command of the 7th Army (Western Task Force, Operation Husky) and has to make do with being merely a decoy back in England to fool the Nazi high command into thinking he was preparing to lead the assault on mainland Europe via the Pas de Calais.Eventually, after more or less being on his `best behaviour', Patton is given command of 3rd Army, who play a supportive role in Northern France following Operation Overlord, while Omar Bradley (played by Karl Malden) is given command of 12th Army Group.  One can only wonder, in terms of shortening the war, what might have transpired had Patton kept his mouth shut, his hands to himself and their roles been reversed.The film doesn't seek to mitigate any of Patton's `transgressions' and Scott's towering performance shows Patton in all his belligerent glory.  He receives excellent support from Malden in the other major role and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Michael Bates, as Monty.  But what the film does do is to convey, unambiguously, Patton's sense of personal destiny as if he'd been born for this moment in history: a trait he almost certainly shared with Churchill.The combat scenes are handled magnificently and the viewer gets a real feel for the sweep and scope of battle with men and machines being manipulated by both sides like pieces on a chessboard.  Added to this is the gloriously (now) iconic score by Jerry Goldsmith.  All in all an epic war film that, by the end, leaves one with the feeling; `they don't make `em like this anymore'!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IT0YC871FIJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LQGXPA#wasThisHelpful","R1IT0YC871FIJG","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Tenant plays hotshot barrister Will Burton who has yet to lose a case and is the darling of his chambers and the envy of his rivals, chief among whom is Maggie Gardner (Sophie Okonedo).  Will is happily married to Kate (Ashley Jensen) and they have a young son, Jamie (Gus Barry).  The series opens as Will successfully defends a particularly nasty client, Liam Foyle (Toby Kebbell), on trial for murder, by spotting a legal technicality in the prosecution case, and chalks up another victory, at the expense of prosecuting counsel, the aforementioned Maggie.We get glimpses of Foyles domestic circumstances, which leaves us in very little doubt that this is a very odd individual indeed.  One would, of course, have expected the not guilty verdict to have invoked within the accused a feeling of gratitude towards the person securing his freedom.  However, with this individual abnormal is normal and things take a horrible turn for the worse at the expense of Will, his family and their continued well-being.Following on from the equally outstanding, What Remains, this first rate film, originally aired on BBC as three one hour episodes, is suitably eerie with gothic overtones.  As might be expected the whole cast is magnificent, with Toby Kebbell outstanding as the creepily evil Foyle.  It examines the usual law story themes of guilt, retribution and the nature of justice and is a right up there with the best of BBC drama.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R311LGVI96V01F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJFEN50#wasThisHelpful","R311LGVI96V01F","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fresh from his exploits in Taken it was obviously a good idea to exploit Neesons newly minted tough guy persona while still fresh in the mind of the film-going public: hence Unknown, a shamelessly derivative product if ever there was one!  Perhaps I'm being a little too harsh, but I think not. Naturally, it's impossible to escape our cultural influences and we cannot look at anything without looking through the filters of our experience and here we have a perfect example.  Whether consciously or otherwise the visual echoes of previous productions flicker and sometimes beam from the screen almost blindingly throughout.But this isnt meant to be a criticism: for the movie buff its all part of the entertainment!  We have bio-scientist, Dr Martin Harris (Neeson), arriving in a snowy, wintery Berlin accompanied by his wife (January Jones).  Almost three decades before, in Hitchcocks Torn Curtain, we had physicist, Dr Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman), arriving in Copenhagen accompanied by his fiance (Julie Andrews).  Both esteemed American scientists are visiting European capitals to give presentations at an important scientific conference.On arriving at their hotel Harris realizes that his briefcase, containing important items like a passport and his presentation papers, has been left at the airport and, bizarrely, without telling his wife he hops back into the taxi and returns to the hotel hoping to retrieve the lost briefcase.  However, calamity strikes and the taxi is involved in an incident that causes it to swerve and hurtle through a barrier into the icy river.  Harris is knocked unconscious but the female driver, who we later come to know as Gina (Diane Kruger) is able to escape and make the surface.  She realizes Harris is still in the car and manages to dive down and save him!He wakes up in hospital and is told hes been out for four days.  Immediately discharging himself he manages to make his way back to his hotel to find his wife who steadfastly refuses to recognize him having in the meantime mysteriously acquired another husband, Dr Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn), who has all the necessary documentation to prove that he is the real Harris and Neeson the imposter!So which one is the real Harris? Since Neeson is the star, it must be him, surely!  But just like Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) before him in North by North West, he has a tough job persuading just about anybody!  However, hes given the name of a private detective, a former Stasi operative named Ernst Jurgen (Bruno Ganz) who acts as the wiser older mentor type figure a la, Dr Brulov (Michael Chekov) in Hitchcocks Spellbound.  Jurgen advises Harris to find the taxi driver, Gina, as he thinks she may be the key!And, indeed, this turns out to be a valid assertion.  Gina, just like Michelle (Emanuelle Seigner) in Polanskis Frantic, who aids Harrison Fords Dr Richard Walker (a mere medical practitioner) in an unknown Paris, proves to be just the kind of streetwise, knowledgeable young sidekick Harris needs.So, weve seen many of the elements before but the primary source seems to be Hitchcock, primarily, North by North West: even an evil though amiable and courteous Mr Big a la James Masons, Phillip Vandamm, in the form of Frank Langella, enters the action about half way through and January Jones and Diana Kruger are a kind of amalgam of Eva Marie Saints, Eve Kendall.Fittingly, then, after suitably Machiavellian plot machinations, the film ends on a train.  It might be derivative but very entertainingly so!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTM3DBRXQMNNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZGI1V0#wasThisHelpful","RTM3DBRXQMNNW","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It takes the patient reader from quite basic mathematics through to that required by third year undergraduates in engineering and physical science courses in planned, frame-based, systematic and methodical steps.

"From the opening brilliant shot of the Phoenix skyline as the camera narrows in on the midday tryst between Janet Leigh and John Gavin in their `cheap hotel' to the final focus on Norman's face upon which is superimposed a skull, this is an undoubted masterpiece. But even before this, the amazing Saul Bass title sequence, which changes in time to Bernard Hermann's brilliant score, is also simply breath-taking! The soundtrack itself has been given a major overhaul and is now presented in 5.1, which manages to preserve Hermann's iconic driving syncopated rhythm while enhancing the overall listening experience.It has to be one of the most influential films ever made: for example, William Friedkin describes, on the accompanying extra documentary short, `In the Master's Shadow' how he found out how Hitchcock filmed the scene in which Martin Balsam, playing the P.I. Arbogast, falls backwards down the stairs in the Bates' house while trying to maintain his balance, and then used it in a similar scene in the Exorcist. Various other luminaries add their own anecdotes revealing the master's influence on their own and other's films and the massive debt the art of movie making owes him.Along with this there is a feast of other extras: for the price, this is ludicrously inexpensive and should be on the shelf of any serious film fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11C1YK521HL63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087ZG7UW#wasThisHelpful","R11C1YK521HL63","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most people should be aware that, as humans, we love a good story: the success of W.H Smiths, champions of the `yellow backs', and Amazon attest to that fact and what, John Yorke, has done here, is to trace the development of the story through history from Aristotle to the present day. He is an experienced TV producer and should know his subject inside out. He illustrates his thesis, which, basically is that all stories conform to a three act structure (even those written in five acts) with examples, from all forms of entertainment involving the written and spoken word, Ridley Scott's film, Thelma and Louise, being only the most prominent. To give it a touch of academic credibility he chucks in a bit of Jungian and 'pop' psychology here and there and talk of universal 'archetypes'.But this isn't brain surgery or even rocket science: the same impulse that drives us to see what is over `the next hill' is that which drives us to find out who killed Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick - the need to know; we are curious creatures! And when that impulse becomes engaged by a well written conflict set-up our brains demand a conflict resolution: hence Act 1 - conflict set-up; Act 2 - crisis; Act 3 - conflict resolution.And it could have made for an interesting exploration in a `wetter', shorter, more engaging and less repetitive book. If I hadn't already seen Thelma and Louise I doubt very much if the reading of this book would have compelled me to do so!Oh, and the paperback has a horrible plain black cover that is faintly repellent to the touch. Elsewhere, this has garnered ludicrously gushing reviews: hopefully this will redress the balance!","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QRSAFMHMZSOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOHMTCU#wasThisHelpful","R1QRSAFMHMZSOA","A17639YIJLDS1G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17639YIJLDS1G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first two had broken light bulbs (not globes), the third one was cloudy and had a huge dent. Thankfully Amazon's amazing customer service overnighted me new ones until I got one that was perfect. Now that it's all setup, it looks awesome.Be warned, it takes a long time to heat up and get flowing. It usually takes about 2-3 hours at 70 F to really get going.After reading elsewhere, I added a timer and a dimmer for more adjustability. The dimmer is not needed at 70 F, but that might change as summer brings warmer temps and with a dimmer I can lower the temp and keep it flowing. I also had a kill-a-watt unused and connected that up to get an exact reading on the wattage of the dimmer. At 96watts (max) it flows great at 70 F. If I lower it to 85watts it slows dramatically and seems to stall but is still slightly moving.  Lower than that all the lava/wax collects at the bottom.

The pouch you can attach to your camera strap is nice.I purchased a DSLR.Bot remote for my iPhone and was disappointed with the range of only about 10 feet and was hesitant to purchase Canon's remote since they stated the RC-6 only only works 16 feet away.

"This is my 2nd of three Gorillpods that I've owned.  It's an excellent product and well worth the money.  I used it while traveling for a week in Costa Rica and it was excellent when taking pictures in a horizontal / landscape orientation.  However, it was practically unusable when I rotated the camera (Canon 7D with 28-135mm kit lens) 90 to take a vertical / portrait orientation shot.  The legs just aren't quite strong enough to hold the weight of the camera off balance in this position.  My setup weighs ~1,500g / 3.5 lbs which is within the weight limits of the SLR-Zoom but I disagree.  The Ball Head w/Bubble Level is ok for basic usage, there's no panning, and if your camera has a built in level I would use that instead.So, I ended up getting a Joby GP8-BHEN Gorillapod Focus with Ballhead X bundle.  It's a huge improvement over the SLR-Zoom model.  I can position my camera in any orientation and it's steady.  The Ballhead X is much smoother and there are separate lockouts for panning 360 and positioning the camera.  If you have a smaller camera body or a small prime lens on the 7D I think you might be able to get away with the SLR-Zoom model but the Prime is so much better made.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVHUOZXVNMBO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002FGTWOC#wasThisHelpful","RVHUOZXVNMBO3","A1YCWQHEXXPSNE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YCWQHEXXPSNE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off I'm not a big fan of rhythm games. I really loved Rhythm Thief for its fun story and catchy themes, but aside from that I generally ignore games like this. I am, however, a massive Persona fanboy, so as the latest game in that franchise I couldn't resist buying a copy. Please bear that in mind when you read the review.This is, frankly, the biggest leap away from the core mechanics and style that Persona has yet taken. Persona Q was actually pretty similar to the originals battle-wise, with only the social interactions and options being pared away for more normal cutscenes. Dancing All Night has removed even that minimal non-battle functionality. Instead, the game plays out like a visual novel, with still images of your characters appearing in front of a 2D background and speaking at you. If movement happens you'll be informed about it via text block. It's a little less involving that Q but it still works. The dialogue is at least fully voiced so you have the joy of hearing all your favorite Persona 4 characters back again. Okay, Rise's voice actor has changed, but she still sounds the same to me.The plot is standard Persona. At midnight you go to a strange otherworldly stage where you're faced with a series of opponents trying to defeat you. This time, instead of beating them to a pulp you have the somewhat less satisfying task of defeating them through dance. Yeah, it's silly. Did you expect any less from a Persona game? This basic setup works fine for the game, giving you enough plot points and character interactions to stay involved if never doing more than just whetting your appetite.Gameplay is fairly basic rhythm game. It's based on the six buttons at the outer edge of the Vita: the Up, Left, Down, Triangle, Circle, and X buttons. As the music plays shapes pop out of the center of the screen and rush towards one of the edges and you have to time hitting the button exactly right. There are also rings that pop out from time to time that you can nab for bonus points. For these you tap the analog stick. The music comes right from P4, but they aren't the exact same themes you remember. They've been remixed and edited to better fit the game. The music is one of the things I love most about the Persona series. Shoji Meguro is a genius. But I find that the music here doesn't really help as much with getting the timing right. In Rhythm Thief, the songs had distinct beats that you had to match, and hitting the right buttons was very much a matter of listening to the music. Here I paid more attention to the buttons popping up. The music matches the buttons, but it's not as intuitive as if it had actually been written for the game. The animations are also not particularly interesting and you're basically doing the same thing over and over. None of this made the gameplay bad, but I found myself viewing the battles more as interruptions to the story than I had for previous Persona games.Again, rhythm games aren't really my thing so I may not be the best person to review this, but I found Dancing All Night entirely average in terms of gameplay.

"This book is a welcome change to recent Star Wars novels, leaning more towards military scifi than heroic swashbuckling. In fact, the book it most reminded me of was Rogue Squadron, except that it has an infantry perspective rather than a fighter pilot/covert ops one. That's quite a compliment. While the focus is very much on a single lead character it is in many ways the story of a unit and their experience of the galactic civil war. This is Twilight Company, an elite ground unit whose constant deployment in hard-fought battles is taking its toll. As an infantry unit they fight through numerous land battles during the Rebels retreat rimward in the prelude to Empire Strikes Back. There are no epic heroes, no Jedi, no larger-than-life warriors, just ordinary men and women pushed too far. It's a step closer to what I suspect Rogue One will be like, and if the film is anything like the book it'll do well.This book is obviously a tie in with the new Battlefront game, as can be seen from the title. Video game tie ins don't generally bode well, but in this case (perhaps because the game has no campaign mode) it manages to tell an interesting story while still having elements that will undoubtedly appear in Battlefront. Several of the worlds will appear in the game, including Hoth and Sullust, and they do a good deal of planet hopping. In fact, I have to give this book credit for giving us the first recreation of the battle of Hoth that doesn't feel forced and fanservicey. Our heroes have a reason to be there and their presence has consequences. This is not a book where everyone survives. People suffer and people die. Even people you like. It's a war novel and as such bears the marks of comradeship and tragedy that you'll find in many a war memoir.The book does have rather a problem though, and it's tied in with the structure. The book starts off strong and it ends strong but everything from the third or fourth chapter up through a little ways past Hoth feels purposeless and disjointed. I'm tempted to blame this on an EA directive to show as many planets as possible but I suspect it's just inexperience. Our lead character, Namir, is about as hard-bitten and cynical as you can get. He cares for his team but he has no particular loyalty to the Rebellion beyond gratitude for getting him off his home planet. None of this is wrong for a character, but it's handled poorly from a storytelling standpoint. We're not aware what his motivation is until halfway through the book, and by the time you realize just how emotionally uninvolved and flawed he is it's almost too late. None of the missions have any purpose because he doesn't care to know why they fight, not because they're pointless. The Rebellion comes across as self-righteous blowhards because he's flawed not because they are. The sheer meaninglessness of events is due to his perception, not reality. Once you and he start to realize that the book becomes good again, but it takes too long to get to that point and there isn't enough signposting before this to indicate his character journey. So you just have to read on in the hope it will get better. Because it does.Having said all that, the characters as a whole are very good and well-defined. The book is very focused around Namir, but even minor background characters have personality. I particularly liked the Imperial viewpoint, though it wasn't really developed as much as it could have been. The battle scenes are described viscerally and they seem tactically sensible. It feels like a much more conventional war than we see in the films, but at the same time there's enough mention of the fact that these soldiers are underarmed and isolated for it to seem Rebely.All in all it was an excellent read after it reached a certain point. If anyone starts the book and finds themselves uninvolved I strongly recommend they keep reading because it does get better. The flawed structuring is the only reason I didn't rate the book five stars. Fans of military scifi should find themselves highly entertained here, and even regular military fiction readers might appreciate a different viewpoint. And for those who just want a good Star Wars novel: don't worry, it still has that in spades. But it brings something new to the table, and that alone makes it worth checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS1Q06S1D8RTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OX20#wasThisHelpful","RS1Q06S1D8RTH","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm really torn on what to think of this book. On the one hand it's clearly been very diligently researched and is the result of a lifetime's worth of study. It may rely heavily on secondary literature, but it pulls from a wide range of books and tries to offers something that no other work has attempted. On the other hand it's full of unsupported assumptions and some highly misleading statements that diminish its value dramatically.Some of these false statements are the result of poorly worded sentences. The book feels like every paragraph's stuffed with as much detail as humanly possible and this can lead to confusion. This is especially true in the first chapters where it tries to deal with Roman warfare thematically but is frequently unclear about the era being discussed. We go from discussing procedures from the fourth century then back to the second and then to the sixth. These chapters are absolutely crammed with background material in a very confusing manner. For example, he will refer to an earlier point only with ""See above"" or a later one with ""See below"" without including page numbers or any easy way of locating the issue being discussed. If you're reading this book it's probably best to regard this as a reference section and just start the book with the main narrative.Not every questionable statement can be attributed to this overstuffing though. Many come from the author's unquestioning faith in any and all sources. He distrusts basic source criticism and his stated procedure is to believe every source implicitly, unless disproven by another source or archaeological study. The section on various barbarian groups is particularly prone to this, including details from the sixth century or later to describe events in the third and fourth centuries as if, unlike the Romans, barbarian groups were stable and unchanging in all aspects. At one point he actually uses sources from the 11th-14th centuries to describe Nubian kings in the 3rd century, even attributing their adoption of these customs to the exact year 298. I realize that part of the reason he relies on these sources is an absence of material from earlier periods, but that limited data means that you have to be extra careful and critical of every single piece of evidence you use. Instead he charges in as if there are no issues of reliability. If two sources say completely different things then he must find a way to keep both of them true. Only if he can't pull off this feat does he present both statements and argue for one. Occasionally he doesn't even do that.A big part of this problem comes from the choice of publisher. There's nothing wrong with Pen & Swords books, but they serve a different audience from academic literature. You can't stuff these books full of references or include in-depth discussion on historiographical concepts. For that reason, we have no way of knowing where he gets many of his statements from. There are a total of 382 footnotes in a 435 page book. That's less than a footnote a page. So if you want to know, for example, what primary sources he was relying on for those Nubian kings I mentioned earlier you're out of luck. His entire argument seems to be based around the fact that they used Greek names in their titles, which can obviously only be a compelling argument if those names come from non-Greek sources. The Byzantines would naturally be expected to translate foreign titles into their native Greek, and I suspect that's exactly what we're seeing due to the fact that the titles given are exactly correct and not Arabic or Ge'ez-inflected versions. The point is that I have no way of knowing. You just have to take his word on it, and as the book went on I found myself less and less willing to do that.And then there are the wildly unsupported assumptions. For example: ""Persian rulers always learnt of a Roman invasion within twenty-four to forty-eight hours from the time the invasion occurred regardless of where they were in the vast empire"" (p. 128); ""Ardashir modelled most of his administration after the Achaemenid model""; ""Muslim military organization was based on Hellenistic Greek practices"" (p. 134); ""Heruls were warrior berserks!"" (p. 85); etc. These statements are common and extreme. I can't get over the Muslim one. How on earth does he propose this reliance on Hellenistic military organization was to have developed more than 650 years after the last such kingdom fell? And how can we know the Sassanians based their administration on the Achaemenid one when we can't even show that they knew of their existence not to mention their structure? For that matter, how would we even recognize it if they did given our extremely sparse data for the internal organization of both states? It's these sorts of comments that lost my tolerance of his other errors. When it states so definitively this many inaccurate or misleading facts a book becomes positively dangerous.By the time you get to the narrative (which is after all the core of the book) you're getting quite tired of these problems. As this is the author's area of focus you might expect these problems to diminish here. Unfortunately, only the overstuffed paragraphs go away. The other flaws are there in force. He relies heavily on the Historia Augusta for third century events (most notably arguing for the early existence of the limitanei and magister officiorum), despite more than a century's worth of studies showing that it's a late fourth century forgery (but that's source criticism, his hated bugbear). Worse still, he cites 12th century Byzantine sources as evidence for 3rd century army titles (specifically the obviously anachronistic tagmata), and uses John Lydus' (6th century) antiquarian musings as if they describe in perfect detail the army structure as it existed for a brief period under Gallienus. Why Gallienus? Because for any other period we have too much information showing that Lydus was being anachronistic (as he often was).Here more than anywhere we see his tendency to trust any and every source carried to its logical extreme. The numbers given in classical sources are questionable at the best of times, but he trusts even the least reliable ones. For example, he's quite certain that over 300,000 soldiers took part in the battle of Chrysopolis and gives similar numbers for Constantine's campaign against Maxentius. As to Germanic tribes he believes they were similar in scale. 150,000 for the Goths of the 4th century is a conservative(!) estimate, he suggests, based on Procopius' description of the later Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy.  In practice of course, he doesn't think they used armies larger than 70-100,000 men because Germanic armies didn't have a proper logistical network beyond having each soldier bring some supplies with him. I would really love to know how an army of 100,000 men could function in the field without a supply network and yet not starve to death in under a week. Living off the land is a lot harder for a large army than a small one.And then come the bizarre conclusions that are given no attribution or justification. For example, he claims that Ballista was sent with a  fleet by Gallienus to fight the Persians (p. 161); that Maximian was a notorious simpleton and most of the Germanic invasions under the tetrarchy were a result of his sexual depravity (p. 192); that Galerius' promotion was really a coup and Severus ""undoubtedly"" had orders to assassinate Maximian if he resisted (p.224); that Constantine recreated the tetrarchy (p. 293); that Julian was a literal psychopath who secretly murdered his wife and children (p. 381); and many other random ideas. These statements are positively damaging to anyone reading the book because unless they know better they'll assume he has some foundation for his statements. This isn't even a question of gullibly repeating sources verbatim, which at least provides information that's useful to know, it's inventing conclusions that don't match any facts. Here's where the footnoting problem really comes in. Footnotes keep you honest. Being able to do without them has sapped the value of what had the potential to be a truly amazing reference book by allowing unsupportable assertions to be thrown around without question. Could he have justified any of these wild assertions? Maybe not, but he could at least have shown us what he was basing his conclusions on.Is this book of value to anybody? Despite it's myriad flaws there is some use to it as a straight narrative history of the later Roman Empire from a specifically military point of view. An appropriately skeptical reader should be able to recognize most instances where the book strays from history into wild speculation. For example, when he starts proposing a historical basis for the Da Vinci Code you can probably tell the discussion need to be taken with an entire shaker of salt. If you're not planning to use this book as a source for anything it's probably safe enough. The maps are excellent and his diagrams and photos help with visualizing a sometimes inaccessible period. But on the other hand, the completely invented facts can throw someone really off if they're not already aware of events. If you're interested in history then don't these facts matter? And if you have to double check every fact then what's the point of it?A book like this that provides a detailed narrative of late Roman history for a wider audience is necessary and useful so I have to applaud the author for attempting it, even if it isn't what it could have been. No such book currently exists, although David Potter's The Roman Empire at Bay does a good job for this period and Peter Heather's The Fall of the Roman Empire covers the fifth century west well. I just wish that this book had lived up to the potential in its topic.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R297OAK1X7KPB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015X3SCKI#wasThisHelpful","R297OAK1X7KPB0","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who don't know what these books are (ie. most people who aren't Russian) you're looking at the dry scholarly tomes of a mathematician who decided he didn't care for the minor role of Russia in ancient and early medieval history and decided that this meant all history must be all wrong. Now I'm not dissing the Russians here. These ideas were rightly dismissed by Russian experts decades ago and, except for the occasional eccentric mathematician and celebrity, they receive little attention now. That's why he's searching for a new audience: his books have sold just about as much as they ever will in Russia. Time to release them in English. Because if there's one thing an English audience loves reading it's Russian propaganda.These books are a statistician's attempt to combat established history using page after endless page of charts and diagrams in the hope that people won't actually check through all these figures. At twenty-two volumes in length it's a fairly safe bet, even though these books are extremely short (65 pages by my count, though he claims 350). But what's really amazing is how little digging it actually takes to find the repeated and obvious errors in his work. The man is so certain that he must be right that he sees no problem with forcibly altering the facts to fit his ""theory"" or accepting huge margins of error when seeking a parallelism.You don't even have to wait for the book to begin for the errors to creep in. The title alone presents a false dichotomy. Fiction or Science? As if those are the only two options. And I have no doubt that Fomenko does indeed see it that way given his haughty dismissal of anything even loosely connected to the Arts. History is too close to the Arts and must be purged of anything that isn't a string of exact, quantifiable numbers. All similar number strings must be combined into the same string, and any ""facts"" or ""historical personages"" attached to those numbers must be purged as well. Nice, clean math. But it's more disturbing than just that. These books are a vast horde of Russian nationalic propaganda. Apart from ridiculing any non-Scientists (AKA those unqualified to form proper conclusions) the main goal of these books is to establish that Russia ruled all the world from North America through Europe into China and the Middle East, and they did so for most of recorded history. So his two assumptions about the world are:1. All Non-Scientists are either liars or idiots.2. Everything in the world originated in Russia.One of these two assumptions is underlying every single one of his conclusions. He treats his random and unsupported speculations with just as much respect as ones that have been established through years of research backed by hard evidence. All Arts and Humanities subjects are regarded as worthless as sources of information and aren't even worth mentioning unless to state (not argue or prove) that they are wrong.And now the history of the world as outlined in this book: History begins when Andronicos Comnenos dies and becomes Jesus. History records him as an unsuccessful Greek emperor with no real successes who was beaten to death by the mob and not a poor prophet from Nazareth who was crucified but hey, what do they know. It's not like the crucifixion was an important part of the story or anything. Immediately all of Europe decides that they're Christian and march against the Muslims. It may sound confusing why they'd blame the Muslims for what was an internal coup but they were probably just confused because Mohammed wasn't born yet. At some point they changed their minds and decided to skip the first three crusades and jump straight onto the Fourth (except that they didn't. It was actually the same as the First. Obviously. Please try and keep up). They then sacked Constantinople which was also Rome which was Troy which was Jerusalem. At some point they get confused and occupied the Holy Land as well and then forget all about Constantinople and let it fall back to the Greeks since Jerusalem was now Constantinople which was Troy which was Rome. People back then had very short memories often forgetting why they did something before they even did it. This is probably due to their lack of statisticians. During the First Crusade the Greeks decide to avenge the kidnapping of their queen by... also sacking Constantinople. After sacking their own city they quietly vanish for a few years, probably in embarrassment. Some time later Erasmus wrote the New Testament confusing generations of scholars who wondered what they had been copying out for all that time. Having now written a New Testament it was decided that they needed an Old one. I'm sure the reasons for the reversed order are as obvious to everyone else as they are to Fomenko. Some time in the 15th Century David rose up, except that he was Turkish and ruled in Constantinople. Despite the many wars with the Turks Europe had never warred with the Turks and accepted all of these events as holy writ. After all, the Turks were really Russian in funny hats and the Russians ruled the world. The Byzantines were secretly ruling in England. After the death of Solomon (Suleimon) the Jews split off from Christianity because they were tired of not being persecuted because of something they didn't do and decided that being hunted by the Inquisition was more fun. In the confusion the Catholics and Orthodox Christians split apart as well because everyone else was doing it and it seemed a good idea at the time. They were to regret this later when the Catholics sacked their city but that had already happened so it was fine.It turns out that Russia has dominated the world since the earliest recorded history (what a shock!). The Mongols were not from Mongolia because the people there are nothing but worthless servants of the Russian Empire (it's ok. Fomenko assures us that the Mongols never knew of Genghis Khan until some pesky monks told them that they used to rule the world). Russia was actually the major Empire that the Romans were based off of and has existed since the dawn of civilization. Silly Georgians thinking they are anything but the personal property of Russia! Ha ha. They also controlled America, Europe and North Africa by 1300 so I guess that we should all submit to the Russian yoke as is our hereditary duty. Occasionally a czar would allow the governors of Europe (kings hah!) to wage war on each other if they pleased him. Presumably the English sucked up to him better than France which is why they did so well in the Hundred Years War but then lost his favor again which resulted in the French winning. Joan of Arc was probably the czar's sister or something. The czar could summon anyone to his court and they had to obey which is why Moscow is renowned the world over as being filled with better artwork and architecture than such dives as Paris and Rome (which isn't the REAL Rome after all). After Russia fell in the 1600s (through internal troubles. No one could EVER conquer Russians) the rest of the world immediately conspired to hide that they ever existed lest they should try to rule over them again. Thus they erased this empire from the history books and replaced it with such lies as Rome and the Holy Roman Empire (couldn't they even pick a new name? Obvious!). Thus the treacherous Romanovs rose to power (did I mention that he first published this under the Soviets?) and they too decided to forget there had ever been a Russian Empire of such a scale. Many ""Roman"" documents are simply Russian ones with a few name changes. Latin is merely a corrupted form of church Slavonic, despite bearing no similarity to that language. The Russians probably invented it to confuse future generations of schoolkids. They had after all had it engraved all over the southern part of their empire on specific styles of buildings which they immediately buried and built medieval cities on top of to confuse archaeologists. It never showed up in Russia itself. Perhaps they punished the provinces by making them write everything in Latin. Oh those cruel Russians. After the late 18th Century things begin to return to what is normally called history.As you can see it is far less confusing than the 'conventional' timeline. You might think I'm making this up but that is what you get when you put all his history together. Minus the sarcasm perhaps.Here we're up against an interesting change. Rather than rewriting European history Fomenko feels like taking on Chinese history, with amusing results. His conclusion? Those of you following along can probably guess this but: Russian. All Russian. Just like every other civilization on the face of the planet. How are people not more grateful to Mother Russia? No wonder Putin looks permanently angry. China was, like the rest of the world, ruled by Russia until the sixteenth century. At this point the great Russian Empire dissolved and East and West split off to form their own different governments and yet all agreed on a uniform policy of covering up their shared Russian past. Nope, no logical problems with that conclusion!So how are East and West to be united? Fomenko cites Morozov who made the ingenious observation that if Chinese names are but translated they lose their foreign flavor. It's an amazing revelation that changes everything we thought we knew about world history. It's almost enough to make one believe that a book translated out of, say, Russian could lose its obviously Russian appearance. But I dunno, that seems a little far-fetched. I'm pretty sure I could still tell based on the terrible spelling and grammatical errors. What this means in practice is that Fomenko is now able to translate more accurately original Chinese works despite not knowing any Chinese. That's how he knows that the phrase Chinese Empire is actually to be translated as Mediterranean Empire. His intuition is just that good. Once you recognize that the Chinese Empire is in fact the Mediterranean Empire you immediately realize that the three kings he mentions next must in fact be Diocletian and the tetrarchs. Of course, there were four of them and none of them were known as the Clear and Passionate, the Literary, or the Great, but that's obviously only a minor difficulty in this line of argument. This conclusively and forever proves that the Chinese in fact had no history of their own but simply copied and pasted it from Mediterranean history, just as the British did.I'm just going to summarize briefly Chinese/Roman history for people so that they can better understand it. That European history and Chinese history is identical is a fact often remarked upon. Actually, it's never been remarked upon, but let's not let that stop us. This identical history is because Chinese history is just European history given different names. The years match exactly with European ones. Roman history started when Sulla founded the Empire in ""83 B.C."". Some people have in fact pointed out that nobody in the history of the world has ever claimed that, but according to Fomenko it's the accepted date and therefore he must be correct because he are being so clever. This is obviously a parallel for the foundation of the Han dynasty, only 57 years earlier according to Fomenko, which is of course essentially the same date. It's only two generations' worth of people after all. Practically the previous day. Certainly it's much closer than the 119 years that ""conventional"" history books would place between them. These two empires continue until the third century where they both fall to invaders from the north and internal problems. Sure, Rome doesn't actually fall during this time period, but that's a minor technicality. Now, both empires experienced a renewal in the 260s with Rome starting its Third Empire at this time and China entering the Jin dynasty. Nitpickers might point out that the division of the Roman Empire into three parts is something that Fomenko made up, or that no Roman Empire fell at this time, or that the recovery of the Empire is properly dated to Diocletian in 283, or that the Jin dynasty only ruled a part of China and was filled with constant wars, but these are obviously unimportant details. What matters is that they were identical in every way. Similarly, to point out that Eastern Jin was the continuation of the Western Jin empire while Eastern and Western Rome were two parts of the same is pedantic, just as it is to point out that this happened more than sixty years before the permanent division of Rome. And then of course, we have to go right to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, which is obviously the same as the fall of Eastern Jin in 420, only 56 years off so the dates are getting closer all the time! And then China and Rome stayed collapsed forever, never to rise again. The End.I'd criticize this book more for its distortion of Chinese history, but more than with any other period it's clear that Fomenko has absolutely no understanding of this history to begin with. All we see of Chinese history is brief snippets excerpted from other authors' works and superficial comparisons like the one above. Chinese history is clearly wrong because Fomenko knows it's wrong, and doing the research to actually prove this would take valuable time away from explaining how amazing Russia was.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHNS3GPYO8IMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AWV398#wasThisHelpful","RHNS3GPYO8IMI","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Fomenko mostly deals with this by, you guessed it, ignoring it. Even in the book that is supposed to be dedicated entirely to it. What he does instead is focus entirely on Russian coinage while ignoring other nation's coins and the fact that they are remarkably concentrated in the very areas that he claims constantly changed names. To the extent that he does confront this issue he focuses on side problems, like the fact that coin portraiture is generally similar or that they didn't generally provide dates until fairly recently. And he spends a surprising amount of time justifying his chronology's existence and making it look like the history of the subject isn't one of utter failure but in fact a growing consensus.

The main argument in this book is that all Crusades, mass migrations, or great wars are the same eternal conflict. We can all see the absurdity of imagining that more than one world war could occur. Such a laughable thought! He also starts to do some construction work on his new chronology. For example, he's now decided that the Roman Empire dated from the 10th to 11th centuries and was located in Egypt before moving north to Constantinople (12th-13th centuries) and then north yet again to Moscow (14th-17th centuries). Ever closer to perfection in other words. The Romans buried their corpses in pyramids before moving them to the Valley of the Kings. This is why all the hieroglyphics refer to Roman events and use Roman names and are written in Latin. Can you imagine how crazy it'd look if that wasn't true? It'd be like he was making it all up! How can you even argue with such persistent madness? It's obvious that this doesn't make any sense, but facts just glance off his determined march towards a glorious Russia festooned with glory and world conquest.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSHDTKSVS8ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013J9WYHU#wasThisHelpful","R1NSHDTKSVS8ZK","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But it's more disturbing than just that. These books are a vast horde of Russian nationalic propaganda. Apart from ridiculing any non-Scientists (AKA those unqualified to form proper conclusions) the main goal of these books is to establish that Russia ruled all the world from North America through Europe into China and the Middle East, and they did so for most of recorded history. So his two assumptions about the world are:1. All Non-Scientists are either liars or idiots.2. Everything in the world originated in Russia.One of these two assumptions is underlying every single one of his conclusions. He treats his random and unsupported speculations with just as much respect as ones that have been established through years of research backed by hard evidence. All Arts and Humanities subjects are regarded as worthless as sources of information and aren't even worth mentioning unless to state (not argue or prove) that they are wrong.And now the history of the world as outlined in this book: History begins when Andronicos Comnenos dies and becomes Jesus. History records him as an unsuccessful Greek emperor with no real successes who was beaten to death by the mob and not a poor prophet from Nazareth who was crucified but hey, what do they know. It's not like the crucifixion was an important part of the story or anything. Immediately all of Europe decides that they're Christian and march against the Muslims. It may sound confusing why they'd blame the Muslims for what was an internal coup but they were probably just confused because Mohammed wasn't born yet. At some point they changed their minds and decided to skip the first three crusades and jump straight onto the Fourth (except that they didn't. It was actually the same as the First. Obviously. Please try and keep up). They then sacked Constantinople which was also Rome which was Troy which was Jerusalem. At some point they get confused and occupied the Holy Land as well and then forget all about Constantinople and let it fall back to the Greeks since Jerusalem was now Constantinople which was Troy which was Rome. People back then had very short memories often forgetting why they did something before they even did it. This is probably due to their lack of statisticians. During the First Crusade the Greeks decide to avenge the kidnapping of their queen by... also sacking Constantinople. After sacking their own city they quietly vanish for a few years, probably in embarrassment. Some time later Erasmus wrote the New Testament confusing generations of scholars who wondered what they had been copying out for all that time. Having now written a New Testament it was decided that they needed an Old one. I'm sure the reasons for the reversed order are as obvious to everyone else as they are to Fomenko. Some time in the 15th Century David rose up, except that he was Turkish and ruled in Constantinople. Despite the many wars with the Turks Europe had never warred with the Turks and accepted all of these events as holy writ. After all, the Turks were really Russian in funny hats and the Russians ruled the world. The Byzantines were secretly ruling in England. After the death of Solomon (Suleimon) the Jews split off from Christianity because they were tired of not being persecuted because of something they didn't do and decided that being hunted by the Inquisition was more fun. In the confusion the Catholics and Orthodox Christians split apart as well because everyone else was doing it and it seemed a good idea at the time. They were to regret this later when the Catholics sacked their city but that had already happened so it was fine.It turns out that Russia has dominated the world since the earliest recorded history (what a shock!). The Mongols were not from Mongolia because the people there are nothing but worthless servants of the Russian Empire (it's ok. Fomenko assures us that the Mongols never knew of Genghis Khan until some pesky monks told them that they used to rule the world). Russia was actually the major Empire that the Romans were based off of and has existed since the dawn of civilization. Silly Georgians thinking they are anything but the personal property of Russia! Ha ha. They also controlled America, Europe and North Africa by 1300 so I guess that we should all submit to the Russian yoke as is our hereditary duty. Occasionally a czar would allow the governors of Europe (kings hah!) to wage war on each other if they pleased him. Presumably the English sucked up to him better than France which is why they did so well in the Hundred Years War but then lost his favor again which resulted in the French winning. Joan of Arc was probably the czar's sister or something. The czar could summon anyone to his court and they had to obey which is why Moscow is renowned the world over as being filled with better artwork and architecture than such dives as Paris and Rome (which isn't the REAL Rome after all). After Russia fell in the 1600s (through internal troubles. No one could EVER conquer Russians) the rest of the world immediately conspired to hide that they ever existed lest they should try to rule over them again. Thus they erased this empire from the history books and replaced it with such lies as Rome and the Holy Roman Empire (couldn't they even pick a new name? Obvious!). Thus the treacherous Romanovs rose to power (did I mention that he first published this under the Soviets?) and they too decided to forget there had ever been a Russian Empire of such a scale. Many ""Roman"" documents are simply Russian ones with a few name changes. Latin is merely a corrupted form of church Slavonic, despite bearing no similarity to that language. The Russians probably invented it to confuse future generations of schoolkids. They had after all had it engraved all over the southern part of their empire on specific styles of buildings which they immediately buried and built medieval cities on top of to confuse archaeologists. It never showed up in Russia itself. Perhaps they punished the provinces by making them write everything in Latin. Oh those cruel Russians. After the late 18th Century things begin to return to what is normally called history.As you can see it is far less confusing than the 'conventional' timeline. You might think I'm making this up but that is what you get when you put all his history together. Minus the sarcasm perhaps.Ah, England. I knew he'd get here eventually. So, having seen how Fomenko likes to distort his facts we can legitimately wonder what method he'll use here to ""obliterate"" all the data we have. Will he invent dozens of insane theories and treat them as ""legitimate possibilities"" to cast doubt on the accepted version? Will he cite historians of doubtful value as if they are the accepted resources on the topic and then lie about being the first to see this? Or will we just get another string of lists? If you guessed all three: Congratulations! You win a free prize, which since all prizes look essentially the same to an impartial observer you've already received years ago but didn't realize it was actually a reflection of this one. Too bad.So, might as well do these in order. The first one is a bombardment as you might expect. He's trying to create as much confusion as he can so that when he finally does start laying out ""facts"" you're more prone to believe him. So a few of his claims: Armenia is Romania ie. Byzantium; Britain is actually in Albania (=Albion) which is in the Byzantine Empire and therefore Byzantium; Mt. Sinai is Vesuvius; Herculanium and Pompeii are Sodom and Gomorrah; New Troy=Old Troy=Byzantium=Rome=London; the English word island is actually Asia-land (because in the old days nobody had heard of vowels) and can therefore mean basically anything; Brutus was Julius Caesar; the Scots are Russian; the Britains were Prussians; the Welsh are Turks; the English are the Angeloi (a short-lived Byzantine dynasty that saw Constantinople sacked by the crusaders, except of course that the English are also the crusaders); the Irish language is actually Russian (because Irish without vowels is RSH which sounds like RSS, which is Russian without vowels); etc. I'm gonna just quote an example of how hard he works to connect everything together. ""Today the name of the 'London river' is Thames. But because all these events are happened in the East, we need to remember that here some people read the text in opposite direction: from the right to the left (in Europe: from the left to the right). The word SOUND (= strait) without vowels is SND and after opposite reading is DNS. Because D and T were sometimes equivalent, and the same is valid to M and N, we see that the following conjecture (equivalence) is possible: DNS = TMS, i.e. 'sound' = 'Thames'."" Why, that's not confusing at all is it? No siree, I'd sure be glad to see him finally step in and make sense of that!The second technique is also used amazingly here. He uses the normally reliable Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, but also Nennius and Geoffrey of Monmouth, who he calls Galfridus Monemutensis because Russian translators can't bother to translate names out of Latin (which was really corrupted church Slavonic anyway and not an actual language despite having its own vocab and sentence structure, so it doesn't matter). For those not in the know, these last two are accounts of King Arthur and are mostly fictitious. ""Nennius"" is called on occasionally (he's one of our only sources for Sub-Roman Britain, meaning the 5th and 6th centuries) but never relied on exclusively or even trusted. Geoffrey is just historical propaganda and English myth, written to please the new Norman overlords of Britain. Nobody cites him seriously except as an example of this. Despite that, Fomenko states that ""In fact, these texts form a basis for modern concept of old and medieval English history."" Where does he even consider medieval English history to end? Only one copy of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was updated after 1079. After this God knows what his sources were.Which brings us to his third method. So again we are confronted with a massive list of kings. Here we're confronted immediately with a problem: there was no king of England until the time of Edward the Elder in the 10th century. Fomenko deals with this the way he deals with all data that doesn't match his preconceptions: he ignores it. The chart starts with Cenwalh (king of Wessex) and Theodosius I. If you have to ask why you obviously haven't paid attention to his previous works. It's because he says so. And right away we have a non-match. Unbelievable. By his own math Theodosius I ruled for 16 years while Cenwalh ruled for 29. How can he consider this a match?!? That's almost twice as long! It ends with Justinian and Egbert, who are at least slightly similar, although bizarrely he cuts Justinian's reign in two because 553 was the highpoint of his reign. I think. Or as Fomenko puts it, he ""became unique [ie. sole?] emperor in Roman-Byzantine empire. He ruled during his last 12 years without any corulers."" A very odd comment to make because he ruled his first 26 years without any co-rulers too. In between these two figures are three kings unmatched by anyone on the Byzantine side, but he dismisses that because they had short reigns. Err, why should people making fake king lists add in short-reigned kings instead of just making up numbers? Oh right, because the charts don't work unless they did. And here again we see the most grievous problem Fomenko continually runs into: his numbers don't match. As in, in a chart of only eight matching kings only three of them match with less than a fifteen percent margin of error. That's according to his own numbers, which are frequently wrong (although closer here than in his Roman section). A match of less than a decade (or more if he feels like it) is considered definitive proof that kings are in fact the same people, this when the average reign of the monarchs listed here is 17.6 years.At this point his list falls apart even worse so he compensates by moving kings around. Oh yes, he can do that. Didn't you know? People in the past were so mindbogglingly unoriginal that they couldn't invent new numbers (though obviously they were experts at new names) and so simply mixed the dates around. The fact that this allows him to mess with the king lists as he wills is merely a happy coincidence. The best bit is that the kings being moved around are a father and his four sons. So two sons get to rule before their father and two after. As he sees it, this is obviously THEIR error as all the names look alike to him. It never ceases to amaze me how all these people are just interchangeable names and numbers. To repeat: two sons have been moved into position before their father to make Fomenko's job easier. At this point we see why Fomenko has messed with this list the way he has: it's so that Alfred the Great lines up with Heraclius. Two kings famous for driving back invaders threatening their kingdoms. Of course they must be identical! But I'm going to ignore here the fact that Alfred's campaigns against the Vikings led to the establishment of the first permanent pan-English kingdom that grew under his successors while all of Heraclius' achievements against the Persians were brought down when the Arabs took over most of his reconquered Empire. Instead I'm going to focus on his predecessors. The men ruling before him were his father and his brothers. His immediate predecessor was his brother Aethelred who died after being wounded in battle against the Vikings. This man is paired up with Phocas, one of the demons of Byzantine history, who murdered the emperor Maurice and started the decades-long Persian war that was to dismember the Roman Empire. Two more different figures could not be conceived, yet Fomenko would have you believe that they're the same person based solely on the fact that Phocas' reign was only two years longer than Aethelred's. Incredible. At least with earlier figures he at least TRIED to make their lives match. This sort of incongruity goes on for a while and then we jump forward 210 years in the Byzantine line while continuing on in the English one. At this point it's hardly even worth pointing out the silliness of all this. The last thing I will say is that he frequently gets the names wrong, especially the English ones. The most glaring example is that first king of the United Kingdom wasn't Jacob, it was James. So incredibly sloppy.And we're given a special little treat here as well. Fomenko treats us to more linguistic discussion. Yay! So, the dating of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was (following on from Bede) in A.D., or Anno Domini (in the year of our Lord). But not so, says Fomenko, for he knows this as the Year of Grace, apparently the Russian formulation of the term. And obviously the Russian term should supersede the Latin term being used, even when the text in question was written in Latin for a Latin-speaking audience (as Bede was). So why does this matter? Because obviously Year of Grace is still too precise! Why, what if it actually meant year of the Greeks instead? So to repeat, we are told that the Russian equivalent of a Latin term is in fact the correct one and that therefore the term used in the document itself in fact means what it means in Russian and not what it says it means in the language being used. We are then treated to a discussion of words that look similar to that Russian one and told that this means that in fact the imagined Russian Year of Greeks must be what was meant by In the Year of the Lord. I'm including an entire paragraph that follows on from this conclusion because I feel it demonstrates decisively how hard he's struggling to problematize what is in actuality a very simple concept:""Maybe the original (and forgotten today) meaning of a formula ""Years of Grace"" differs from one which is accepted today. Maybe it was ""years in Greece"", ""Greek years"" or something like this. It is possible also that there is a relation between terms Grace, Greece and Christ. Was the name of Christ associated in some sense with a name of country ""Greece""? For example Christ religion = ""Greece religion""? It might be because in medieval epoch Greece was a name of Byzantine empire, and another it's name was Romea, Rome. So Christian, ""Roman"" religion could be called also as ""Greek religion""; but if so then there might be a confusion between ""A.D."", ""Christ"" era and old ""Greek"", Byzantine era which was used sometimes, as well as ""A.D."", with it's thousands omitted. It could be not obvious which era was actually used in an old documents which indicate ""Years of Grace""."" Yikes. It just goes to show that the only way his work can make any sense is if you assume that nobody before the 18th century actually knew how to count.The main conclusion he draws from all of this is that the English were actually the Byzantines. Ignore the fact that they wrote in Old English and had Germanic and occasionally Celtic names, they were Byzantine and wrote in Greek and had Greek names. There was in fact only one period of history covering all these times, the one known as 1040-1327 in England and 1143-1453 in Byzantium. The two other periods (640-830/830-1040 English, and 378-553/553-830 Byzantine) are simply reflections of this period. That's why the English kingdom fell twice, once in 830 at the height of Wessex's power and again in 1040. I guess William was a little slow to arrive. Ignore the fact that the few parallels he finds between English and Byzantine rulers in each individual period don't line up with the other periods. That is merely a distraction. It just shows that people have been altering the facts to make their past seem more distinguished. As he's clearly the expert on doing that I defer to his judgement here.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29MPFW48X5SMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013IGWBAE#wasThisHelpful","R29MPFW48X5SMV","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who don't know what these books are (ie. most people who aren't Russian) you're looking at the dry scholarly tomes of a mathematician who decided he didn't care for the minor role of Russia in ancient and early medieval history and decided that this meant all history must be all wrong.

Yup, the good old USA was once a part of Russia. Didn't you know that? Apparently we were Russian until 1775 when the Russian wars between the Romanovs and Pougachevs split their empire (299). And Native Americans? Figments of our overactive imaginations. They never existed. The people who occupied America (or at least western America) were the Russians. And the proof of that is that the geography of the west was vague in the Encyclopedia Britannica of 1771. Were you expecting more proof? Well you don't get any. Apparently there is no other conceivable reason why the west would be unknown except that there was a great empire keeping people away. Nope, no other possible reason. I figure that this is part of his sinister agenda to give Russians the right to run casinos on American soil. After all, they're the REAL Native Americans yet we give privileges to all these phoneys.The rest of the book attempts to tie the American Revolution in to revolts in Russia. Despite generally accepting that post-17th century history is more or less accurate Fomenko decides that, well wait actually no it isn't because otherwise Russians can't claim to have controlled the US. So once again he throws history to the wind, complete with thoroughly dateable and identifiable documents, in favor of his own wild theories. Again, all of this is based on the fact that European maps of the west coast of America were rather spotty.

Thus the treacherous Romanovs rose to power (did I mention that he first published this under the Soviets?) and they too decided to forget there had ever been a Russian Empire of such a scale.

You might think I'm making this up but that is what you get when you put all his history together. Minus the sarcasm perhaps.By the third book focusing exclusively on Russian history you may be starting to catch on to the idea that maybe making Russia look great is the purpose of this entire series. Congratulations: you can recognize patterns. Fomenko seems to think he's the only one capable of this. So this book continues to tell his story of Russian history. The Byzantines (Russians) collapsed unexpectedly from the fallout of that whole Jesus thing and each state immediately established its own version of history, which they nonetheless managed to keep separate and internally consistent. In Mongolia (Russia) the Horde (Russians) were disorganized and took years to recover from this. Although, as the center of all human civilization, they still managed to receive Byzantine empresses in marriage. Oh, and all European nobility is descended from Augustus. A random claim about a man whose entire line died out within a few generations but whatever.I'm not even going to bother going into too much depth here. Unless you know a lot of Russian history you won't know who I'm talking about anyway. Suffice it to say that every early Russian ruler was in fact one of the great Mongolian khans, starting with Georgi (Genghis). Tedious stuff for me, but maybe a Russian historian would find it more entertaining. This is actually as far as I'm going with the Russian ones. No fewer than seven of these books (almost a third) are detailing Russian history, and while that's fine and dandy for a Russian nationalist pseudohistorian it's pretty boring for someone outside Russia.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIGFIZNUX00NF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0134CZ9UG#wasThisHelpful","RIGFIZNUX00NF","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who don't know what these books are (ie. most sensible adults not from Russia) you're looking at the dry scholarly tomes of a mathematician who decided he didn't care for Russia's general sidelining throughout ancient and early medieval history and decided that this meant all history must be all wrong. Now I'm not dissing the Russians here. These ideas were rightly dismissed by Russian experts decades ago and, except for the occasional eccentric mathematician and celebrity, they receive little attention. That's why he's searching for a new audience: his books have sold just about as much as they ever will in Russia.These books are a statistician's attempt to combat established history using page after endless page of charts and diagrams in the hope that people won't actually check through all these figures. At fifteen volumes in length it's a fairly safe bet, even though these books are extremely short. But what's really amazing is how little digging it actually takes to find the repeated and obvious errors in his work. The man is so certain that he must be right that he sees no problem with forcibly altering the facts to fit his ""theory"" or accepting huge margins of error when seeking a parallelism.You don't even have to wait for the book to begin for the errors to creep in. The title alone presents a false dichotomy. Fiction or Science? As if those are the only two options. And I have no doubt that Fomenko does indeed see it that way given his haughty dismissal of anything even loosely connected to the Arts. History is too close to the Arts and must be purged of anything that isn't a string of exact, quantifiable numbers. All similar number strings must be combined into the same string, and any ""facts"" or ""historical personages"" attached to those numbers must be purged as well. Nice, clean math. But it's more disturbing than just that. These books are a vast horde of Russian nationalic propaganda. Apart from ridiculing any non-Scientists (AKA those unqualified to form proper conclusions) the main goal of these books is to establish that Russia ruled all the world from North America through Europe into China and the Middle East, and they did so for most of recorded history. So his two assumptions about the world are:1. All Non-Scientists are either liars or idiots.2. Everything in the world originated in Russia.One of these two assumptions is underlying every single one of his conclusions. He treats his random and unsupported speculations with just as much respect as ones that have been established through years of research backed by hard evidence. All Arts and Humanities subjects are regarded as worthless as sources of information and aren't even worth mentioning unless to state (not argue or prove) that they are wrong.And now the history of the world as outlined in this book: History begins when Andronicos Comnenos dies and becomes Jesus. History records him as an unsuccessful Greek emperor with no real successes who was beaten to death by the mob and not a poor prophet from Nazareth who was crucified but hey, what do they know. It's not like the crucifixion was an important part of the story or anything. Immediately all of Europe decides that they're Christian and march against the Muslims. It may sound confusing why they'd blame the Muslims for what was an internal coup but they were probably just confused because Mohammed wasn't born yet. At some point they changed their minds and decided to skip the first three crusades and jump straight onto the Fourth (except that they didn't. It was actually the same as the First. Obviously. Please try and keep up). They then sacked Constantinople which was also Rome which was Troy which was Jerusalem. At some point they get confused and occupied the Holy Land as well and then forget all about Constantinople and let it fall back to the Greeks since Jerusalem was now Constantinople which was Troy which was Rome. People back then had very short memories often forgetting why they did something before they even did it. This is probably due to their lack of statisticians. During the First Crusade the Greeks decide to avenge the kidnapping of their queen by... also sacking Constantinople. After sacking their own city they quietly vanish for a few years, probably in embarrassment. Some time later Erasmus wrote the New Testament confusing generations of scholars who wondered what they had been copying out for all that time. Having now written a New Testament it was decided that they needed an Old one. I'm sure the reasons for the reversed order are as obvious to everyone else as they are to Fomenko. Some time in the 15th Century David rose up, except that he was Turkish and ruled in Constantinople. Despite the many wars with the Turks Europe had never warred with the Turks and accepted all of these events as holy writ. After all, the Turks were really Russian in funny hats and the Russians ruled the world. The Byzantines were secretly ruling in England. After the death of Solomon (Suleimon) the Jews split off from Christianity because they were tired of not being persecuted because of something they didn't do and decided that being hunted by the Inquisition was more fun. In the confusion the Catholics and Orthodox Christians split apart as well because everyone else was doing it and it seemed a good idea at the time. They were to regret this later when the Catholics sacked their city but that had already happened so it was fine.It turns out that Russia has dominated the world since the earliest recorded history (what a shock!). The Mongols were not from Mongolia because the people there are nothing but worthless servants of the Russian Empire (it's ok. Fomenko assures us that the Mongols never knew of Genghis Khan until some pesky monks told them that they used to rule the world). Russia was actually the major Empire that the Romans were based off of and has existed since the dawn of civilization. Silly Georgians thinking they are anything but the personal property of Russia! Ha ha. They also controlled America, Europe and North Africa by 1300 so I guess that we should all submit to the Russian yoke as is our hereditary duty. Occasionally a czar would allow the governors of Europe (kings hah!) to wage war on each other if they pleased him. Presumably the English sucked up to him better than France which is why they did so well in the Hundred Years War but then lost his favor again which resulted in the French winning. Joan of Arc was probably the czar's sister or something. The czar could summon anyone to his court and they had to obey which is why Moscow is renowned the world over as being filled with better artwork and architecture than such dives as Paris and Rome (which isn't the REAL Rome after all). After Russia fell in the 1600s (through internal troubles. No one could EVER conquer Russians) the rest of the world immediately conspired to hide that they ever existed lest they should try to rule over them again. Thus they erased this empire from the history books and replaced it with such lies as Rome and the Holy Roman Empire (couldn't they even pick a new name? Obvious!).

Minus the sarcasm perhaps.To repeat what I said in my last review: Russian history is not my forte so I can't go as in-depth as I would like on the nonsense. Still, he has given plenty of examples to show us how he operates and we can see them all on display here. The most honest quote in this novel comes while introducing his hypotheses. Right up there at number one: ""Russia has never been conquered by any foreign invaders."" Why is that the preeminent conclusion? Because that's what he wants to believe and therefore what he shall believe. For that reason all foreign words or peoples are to be given a Russian etymology. Mongolia for example, is merely a derivative of the Russian word mnogo, or ""many."" The Greek word for great also comes from this term. The Mongolian word yurt (tent) comes from the Cossack words orda (horde) or rod (clan). How are they even similar to that word and why do they mean such different things? Moving on peoples! Czar's etymology is not explained (it actually comes from Caesar) but they are equated with the Khans. God, this ignorance is painful!But really, this is my favorite quote in the whole book: ""The readers must become accustomed to the uncommon concept that geographical names would drift from place to place in the Middle Ages; this process had only stopped with the invention of the printing press and the mass production of uniform books and maps, which had naturally led to the 'solidification' of the names used for nations, cities, rivers and mountains."" It is indeed an uncommon concept. And why must we accept it? Because without doing so the entire ""theory"" becomes mush! As they say, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof, which is why the fact that he doesn't bother is just so laughable. There is no suggested method by which this extraordinary and constant shifting of names could take place, nor is there any reason to take his word for it when he offers no proof to the contrary! What a waste.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84D5JPU6BSR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0130WMBTC#wasThisHelpful","R84D5JPU6BSR0","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You might think I'm making this up but that is what you get when you put all his history together. Minus the sarcasm perhaps.I have to admit, this era is not my specialty. I know very little about medieval Russian history once we get past the Rus Vikings. That said, by this point it doesn't even take much background knowledge to see his silly tricks at work. His two possible approaches are: 1. Take an already questioned fact and then ""disprove"" it, claiming that he was the first to do this and implicitly casting doubt on the intelligence of all before him. 2. Take an established fact and then propose a nonsensical alternate theory with no proof or justification and treat it as if the two theories are approximately equal in plausibility. For example, this quote on a Byzantine mosaic: ""The word 'Mongolia' is written in Greek as 'Mugulion', or 'Megalion', which translates as 'The Great'. This confirms the hypothesis that the words 'Mongolia' and 'Megalion' are derived from the Russian word 'mnogo' ('many'), or 'mnogo' + 'vel' ('great')."" The actual transcription is Mougoulion, or 'of the Mongols'. There is no Megalion in the mosaic, nor is that an actual Byzantine Greek word. The real word would be Megala, which this clearly isn't. Megalon would be the plural genitive. As for the rest of the etymology, do I even need to point out how ridiculous it is? Vowels aren't just interchangeable you know. Or the fact that the assumption is and remains that Russia was the progenitor of all things. Classic Fomenko.Once this has been done he can start throwing random speculation around as certain truths and claiming that any date, personality, or symbol is in fact identical to every other date, identity, or symbol. For example, did you know that the octagonal star is a uniquely Christian symbol? And that its presence on a Mongol authority tablet proves that they were in fact Russian Christians? By the same reasoning the Nazis must have been Indians since the swastica is an Indian and East Asian symbol of old standing. Again, I know little of Russian history, but I've seen enough of his unsupported allegations to know that this isn't the book to go to if you want to actually learn it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ENNACN3NURH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012YC1PXC#wasThisHelpful","R2ENNACN3NURH0","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You might think I'm making this up but that is what you get when you put all his history together. Minus the sarcasm perhaps.This book is more of the same. Unsubstantiated assertions stated with complete confidence and any event that bears even a passing similarity gets combined with every other. Two Gulf Wars? How absurd. Clearly those and the war in Syria are all reflections of the same conflict. A proxy war between Russians and Americans? Must be the same one. Afghanistan, Syria, Korea, and Vietnam are surely the same thing. After all, they're all notoriously hot, with only a 25% margin of error.And for that reason we see the Gothic War against Theodoric and the war to overthrow Tarquinius Supurbus merged into one (A great claim here incidentally: Tarquin spelled backwards [phonetically] is Neukrat, which is probably connected to Novgorod. Of course, he's not using the Latin form of the name [Tarquinus, or Suniwkrat] and he provides no reason why anyone would write their name backwards or why the tyrant Tarquin would have the name of a city, but clearly that's incidental to his main point; which is that if he throws enough nonsense at you eventually some of it might stick). Both Servius Tullius and Theoderic were the last kings to die before their kingdom fell after all, and they were very similar. Except of course, that being the second to last king isn't a very strong connection. And actually Theoderic was in reality the first of about seven kings (depending on how you count them), not the second to last. And every successful king issues reforms if you really think about it. And Theoderic's reforms were wiped out when his kingdom was destroyed while Rome flourished in part because of Tullius' reforms. Actually, apart from the fact that they were both successful kings who had both at least been to the city of Rome (even if only once in Theoderic's case) I can't see many connections with them. But that's not the point, because they're otherwise so similar. Like in the way the Romans overthrew Tarquinius Supurbus. That's just like the way the Byzantines... conquered the Goths in a series of battles. Or the way the war continued for years and only ended when the invaders gave up all attempts to conquer the kingdom. Err, or when they took it over entirely and drove the Ostrogoths from Italy. Hmm. I'm starting to actually see more similarities with the Iraq War.Even odder, we see both these wars merged with the Nika revolt, which took place just before the Gothic War and therefore shouldn't even be open to parallelism according to his ""theory"" since they were both recorded by the same author, who surely wouldn't be copying himself. This is particularly odd when you consider that the Nike Revolt was exactly that: a revolt, while the other two were genuine wars.And then yet a third merger as all these conflicts are equated with the Trojan War. Because after all, a giant ten-year siege is exactly the same as a series of setpiece battles. Honestly, is it the word war? Is that what they all have in common (with a 25% margin of error)? Because that's the only similarity I can see here. But I'll just end this discussion with a direct quote from his brilliant novel: ""Since both wars are but phantom reflections of one and the same real medieval war, they must resemble each other"".

Now I'm not dissing the Russians here. These ideas were rightly dismissed by Russian experts decades ago, except for the occasional eccentric mathematician and celebrity.

At fifteen volumes in length it's a fairly safe bet, even though these books are extremely short (this one's only about 91 pages long, though it claims to be 362). But what's really amazing is how little digging it actually takes to find the repeated and obvious errors in his work. The man is so certain that he must be right that he sees no problem with forcibly altering the facts to fit his ""theory"" or accepting huge margins of error when seeking a parallelism.You don't even have to wait for the book to begin for the errors to creep in. The title alone presents a false dichotomy. Fiction or Science? As if those are the only two options. And I have no doubt that Fomenko does indeed see it that way given his haughty dismissal of anything even loosely connected to the Arts. History is too close to the Arts and must be purged of anything that isn't a string of exact, quantifiable numbers. All similar number strings must be combined into the same string, and any ""facts"" or ""historical personages"" attached to those numbers must be purged as well. Nice, clean math. But it's more disturbing than just that. These books are a vast horde of Russian nationalic propaganda. Apart from ridiculing any non-Scientists (AKA those unqualified to form proper conclusions) the main goal of these books is to establish that Russia ruled all the world from North America through Europe into China and the Middle East, and they did so for most of recorded history. So his two assumptions about the world are:1. All Non-Scientists are either liars or idiots.2. Everything in the world originated in Russia.One of these two assumptions is underlying every single one of his conclusions. He treats his random and unsupported speculations with just as much respect as ones that have been established through years of research backed by hard evidence. All Arts and Humanities subjects are regarded as worthless as sources of information and aren't even worth mentioning unless to state (not argue or prove) that they are wrong.And now the history of the world as outlined in this book: History begins when Andronicos Comnenos dies and becomes Jesus. History records him as an unsuccessful Greek emperor with no real successes who was beaten to death by the mob and not a poor prophet from Nazareth who was crucified but hey, what do they know. It's not like the crucifixion was an important part of the story or anything. Immediately all of Europe decides that they're Christian and march against the Muslims. It may sound confusing why they'd blame the Muslims for what was an internal coup but they were probably just confused because Mohammed wasn't born yet. At some point they changed their minds and decided to skip the first three crusades and jump straight onto the Fourth (except that they didn't. It was actually the same as the First. Obviously. Please try and keep up). They then sacked Constantinople which was also Rome which was Troy which was Jerusalem. At some point they get confused and occupied the Holy Land as well and then forget all about Constantinople and let it fall back to the Greeks since Jerusalem was now Constantinople which was Troy which was Rome. People back then had very short memories often forgetting why they did something before they even did it. This is probably due to their lack of statisticians. During the First Crusade the Greeks decide to avenge the kidnapping of their queen by... also sacking Constantinople. After sacking their own city they quietly vanish for a few years, probably in embarrassment. Some time later Erasmus wrote the New Testament confusing generations of scholars who wondered what they had been copying out for all that time. Having now written a New Testament it was decided that they needed an Old one. I'm sure the reasons for the reversed order are as obvious to everyone else as they are to Fomenko. Some time in the 15th Century David rose up, except that he was Turkish and ruled in Constantinople. Despite the many wars with the Turks Europe had never warred with the Turks and accepted all of these events as holy writ. After all, the Turks were really Russian in funny hats and the Russians ruled the world. The Byzantines were secretly ruling in England. After the death of Solomon (Suleimon) the Jews split off from Christianity because they were tired of not being persecuted because of something they didn't do and decided that being hunted by the Inquisition was more fun. In the confusion the Catholics and Orthodox Christians split apart as well because everyone else was doing it and it seemed a good idea at the time. They were to regret this later when the Catholics sacked their city but that had already happened so it was fine.It turns out that Russia has dominated the world since the earliest recorded history (what a shock!). The Mongols were not from Mongolia because the people there are nothing but worthless servants of the Russian Empire (it's ok. Fomenko assures us that the Mongols never knew of Genghis Khan until some pesky monks told them that they used to rule the world). Russia was actually the major Empire that the Romans were based off of and has existed since the dawn of civilization. Silly Georgians thinking they are anything but the personal property of Russia! Ha ha. They also controlled America, Europe and North Africa by 1300 so I guess that we should all submit to the Russian yoke as is our hereditary duty. Occasionally a czar would allow the governors of Europe (kings hah!) to wage war on each other if they pleased him. Presumably the English sucked up to him better than France which is why they did so well in the Hundred Years War but then lost his favor again which resulted in the French winning. Joan of Arc was probably the czar's sister or something. The czar could summon anyone to his court and they had to obey which is why Moscow is renowned the world over as being filled with better artwork and architecture than such dives as Paris and Rome (which isn't the REAL Rome after all). After Russia fell in the 1600s (through internal troubles. No one could EVER conquer Russians) the rest of the world immediately conspired to hide that they ever existed lest they should try to rule over them again. Thus they erased this empire from the history books and replaced it with such lies as Rome and the Holy Roman Empire (couldn't they even pick a new name? Obvious!). Thus the treacherous Romanovs rose to power (did I mention that he first published this under the Soviets?) and they too decided to forget there had ever been a Russian Empire of such a scale. Many ""Roman"" documents are simply Russian ones with a few name changes. Latin is merely a corrupted form of church Slavonic, despite bearing no similarity to that language. The Russians probably invented it to confuse future generations of schoolkids. They had after all had it engraved all over the southern part of their empire on specific styles of buildings which they immediately buried and built medieval cities on top of to confuse archaeologists. It never showed up in Russia itself. Perhaps they punished the provinces by making them write everything in Latin. Oh those cruel Russians. After the late 18th Century things begin to return to what is normally called history.As you can see it is far less confusing than the 'conventional' timeline. You might think I'm making this up but that is what you get when you put all his history together. Minus the sarcasm perhaps.Finally we've reached the parallelisms, the core of his argument. This is when things finally start to make sense right? Right?!? Well, this section is certainly informative, I'll give it that. It shows exactly how far Fomenko is willing to go. His basic argument is that regnal lists from different periods in history line up too precisely and must be duplicates. Therefore these kings have been duplicated and are actually the same person. Sounds a logical proposition, right? Umm, well it is at least a testable theory.I really hope this book isn't representative of the operation of Russian academia. Facts don't fit your model? Numbers not adding up right? Don't worry about it! We can just make up some new ones and that'll make it all better. To show you what I mean I present his chronology of the early and late Roman emperors (for no apparent reason labelled the second and third Roman empires) along with added comments and corrected dates. Misspelled names are corrected in []:Sulla, ruled four years (82-78 BC)Aurelian, ruled 5 years (270-275 AD)-Sulla became dictator in 82 and resigned in 81 (1 year)-Correct (5 years)Strife, less than one year (78-77 BC)Strife, less than one year (275-276 AD)-No Strife at all (0 years)-Tacitus was emperor, though not for long (I'll give him his 1 year)Sertorius, 6 years (78-72 BC)Probus, 6 years (276-282 AD)-Famous Roman rebel in Spain. Did NOT rule Rome. Active from 83-72 (Active 11 years. Ruled Rome 0 years)-Correct (6 years)Strife, 2 years (72-71 BC)Strife, 2 years (282-284 AD)-Spartacus Rebellion 73-71 (3 years)-Carus ruled. No strife (Actually 0 years)Pompey the Great, 21 years (70-49 BC)Diocletian the Divine(?), 21 years (284-305 AD)-Pompey was never unopposed. Spent most of his time at war (Influential for 21 years)-Diocletian had colleagues. Only sole ruler for 2 years (Co-ruled for 21 years)Joint rule of Pompey and Caesar (first triumvirate), 11 years (60-49 BC)Joint rule of Diocletian and Constantius Chlorus (first tetrarchy), 12 years (293-305 AD)-Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar had loose alliance from 60 on. The reason that it's called a triumvirate is that there were three of them. trio=three viri=men. It was never an official term. Crassus died in 53 (7 years)-Diocletian ruled with Maximian from 286, Constantius and Galerius from 293. All ruled at same time. There was also never a second tetrarchy (Ruled with Maximian 19 years)Strife, 4 years (49-45 BC)Strife, 4 years (305-309 AD)-Civil War lasted from 52-46 (6 years)-Relative peace. More damningly nothing happened in 309 to validate a change from strife to non-strife. The date is chosen simply to match the first one (0 years)Julius Caesar, the conqueror of first triumvirate, 1 year (45-44 BC)Constantius Chlorus, the conqueror of first tetrarchy, 1 year (305-306 AD)-Caesar had been ruling since at least 48. Held Rome since 52. And he never conquered the triumvirate since he was in it (4-8 years)-Chlorus only just promoted to Augustus. Again, there only ever WAS one tetrarchy. And Constantius was a tetrarch till he died (1 year)Triumvirate, 17 years (44-27 BC)Tetrarchy, 18 years (306-324 AD)-Antony dead by 30. Who were the other two triumvirs supposed to be? (Octavian unopposed 14 years)-Tetrarchy died when Constantine killed Maxentius in 312 (6 years)Augustus, the conqueror of the second triumvirate, 41 years (27 BC-14 AD) or 37 years (23 BC-14 AD)Constantine, the conqueror of the second tetrarchy, 31 years (306-307[337?] AD) or 24 years (313-337) or 13 years (324-337) where 324 marks the death of Licinius-Killed Antony in 30, but if he counts the period of co-rule with Constantine they why not with Augustus who ruled (or co-ruled) from 44 BC-14 AD? (58 years including co-rule. 44 sole rule)-Doesn't the fact that he can have three different sets of dates for the same event, none of which match Augustsus, kind of show you how seriously messed up his process is? (31 years including co-rule. 13 years sole rule)Please note what he does here. Constantine overlaps with the last one but Augustus doesn't. He's just removed 17 years without comment. You'll see more of that in a bitThe birth of Jesus Christ in the 27th year of Augustus (0 AD)The birth of St. Basil the Great (the Great King) in the 27th year of Constantine (330 AD)-Probably off (Herod died in 2 BC) but it is the traditional date.-No way. Basil was born in 303. Constantine was still serving under Diocletian at that time. Also, ""The Great King""? Where does that come from?Tiberius, 23 years (14-17[37] AD)Constantius II, 24 years (337-361 AD) or 21 years (340-361)-Correct (23 years)-Correct (24 years)Struggle between Tiberius and Germanicus, 13 years (6-19 AD)Struggle between Constantius II and Constance[Constans], 13 years (337-350 AD)-Germanicus rose to command in 14. Tiberius didn't rule till 14 either (5 years)-Constans is correct but he left out third brother Constantine II (13 years)Caligula, 4 years (37-41 AD)Julian, 2 years (361-363 AD)-True (4 years)-True (2 years)Strife, less than one year (41 AD)Strife, less than one year (363 AD)-Claudius succeeded immediately after. No ""Strife"" (0 years)-The ""Strife"" was Jovian's rule which he will list later (1 years)Claudius, 13 years (41-54 AD)Valentinian, 11 years (364-375 AD)-True (13 years)-True (11 years)Joint rule of Claudius and Pallantius within the ""triumvirate"", not more than 13 years (41-54 AD)Joint rule of Valentinian and Valens within the ""triumvirate"", 11 years (367-375)-Pallantius never ruled. Also, there was no triumvirate after Augustus. Fomenko has no idea what he's talking about (0 years)-Valens ruled from 364. Not sure why he changed it. 14 years is closer to 13 than 11 (14 years)Nero, 14 years (54-68)Valens, 14 years (364-378)-True (14 years)-True, but remember: Valens was only co-ruler. And a junior one at that (14 years)Joint rule of Nero with Burrus and Seneca, 8 years (54-62)Joint rule of Valens with Valentinian and Gratian, 11 years (364-375)-Burrus and Seneca never ruled (0 years)-Gratian didn't rule until after this time (0 years) Finally, a Match!Joint rule of Nero and Seneca, 11 years (54-65)Joint rule of Valens and Gratian, 11 years (367-378)-Seneca never ruled (0 years)-Gratian didn't rule until 375 (3 years)Galba, 1 year (68-69)Jovian, 1 year (363-364)-True (1 year)-I can't help but notice that Galba came after Nero while Jovian came before Valens. He's changing the order of dates again to make them fit. Also, he already listed Jovian's reign under a period of ""strife"" earlier (1 year)Strife, less than 1 year (69)Strife, less than 1 year (378)-True, though it lasted MORE than one year (1 year)-True, though again, it lasted MORE than one year. Gothic War not ended until 382 (4 years)Two Vespasians, 12 years (69-81)Gratian and Valentinian II (after the death of Valens), 13 years (379-392)-True (12 years)-Gratian died in 383 (4 years)Domitian, 15 years (81-96)Theodosius the Great, 16 years (379-395)-True (15 years)-True, though please note the comparison. Domitian was a persecutor while Theodosius was THE Orthodox Christian ruler after Constantine. Is this comparison one that Christian authors would wish to make? (16 years)Nerva, 2 years (96-98)Eugenius, 2 years (392-394)-True (2 years)-Eugenius isn't an emperor and 'rules' during Theodosius' rule. Date fudging again (0 years)Joint rule of Nerva, 2 years (96-98)Joint rule of Eugenius, 2 years (392-394)-What's the point of listing them twice?Trajan, 19 years (98-117) or 16 years (101-117)Arcadius, 13 years (395-408)-The first dates are true. Nerva died in 98 so why Fomenko would be confused I don't know. Probably because he wants to throw the dates into doubt (19 years)-Arcadius was co-ruler with his brother Honorius (13 years)Adrian[Hadrian], 21 years (117-138)Honorius, 28 years (395-423)-True (21 years)-Honorius was co-ruler with his brother Arcadius so he can't be matched with Hadrian who succeeded Trajan (28 years, but when brother's years are removed only 9 years)Antoninus Pius, 23 years (138-161)Aetius, 21 years (423-444) or 14 years (423-438)-True (23 years)-Aetius wasn't emperor, didn't 'rule' until 430s. and was the most important man in the state until he died in 454 (0 years)Marcus Aurelius, 19 years (161-180)Valentinian III, 18 years (437-455) or or 11 years (444-455)-True (19 years)-Valentinian ruled since 425. Please note he's counted as co-ruling with Aetius. More date fudging (30 years)Commodus, 16 years (176-192) or 12 years (180-192)Recimer [Ricimer], 16 years (456-472)-Ruled after 180 (12 years)Ricimer never ruled (0 years)Pertinax, less than 1 year (193)Olybrius, less than 1 year (472)-True (1 year)-True, but skipped over 5 other emperors (1 year)Didinus[Didius] Julianus, less than 1 year (193)Glycerius, less than 1 year (473,474)-Didius Julianus lasted 2 months (<1 year)-Glycerius lasted 1 year and 3 months (>1 year)Clodius Albinus, less than 1 year (193)Julius Nepos, less than 1 year (474)-Usurper who never gained recognition. Lasted til 197 (4 years if you count it. 0 if you don't)-Ruled just over 1 year (1 year)Pescennius Niger, 1 year (193-194)Romulus Augustulus, 1 year (475-476)-Usurper who never gained recognition (1 year if you count it)-True (1 year)Septimius Severus, 18 years (193-211)Odoacer, 17 years (476-493)-True (18 years)-True, but not a Roman. Empire fell with Romulus Augustulus. Odoacer was a Goth (17 years)Caracalla, 24 years (193-217) or 6 years (211-217)Theodoricor[Theodoric] the Great, 29 years (497-526) or 33 years (493-526)-Ruled after 211. technically co-ruled after 209 but certainly wasn't doing any ruling in 193 at the age of five (6 years)-The later date is correct. Still not a Roman though. Gothic king of Italy (33 years)Note that in that entire chart there are only 4 that match exactly (Including the periods of ""strife"") and a few others that come close. Please also note that the period from 82 BC to 217 AD is 299 years long while the period from 270 to 526 is 256. So somewhere in a span of less than 300 years he managed to lose 43 of them. That's 1/6 the total years he's dealing with. Yet if you look at his chart the length matches almost exactly. That should tell you a lot about how precise he's being.A moment's glance should tell anyone how lethal this is to his argument. If he's arguing that the standard regnal lengths are too precisely similar to be a coincidence then he needs to use those same regnal lengths. He can't just make them up or he's just showing a similarity between two imaginary numbers of his own invention.But it gets even worse than this though. Fomenko actually claims to see patterns in the emperors being ""duplicated"". He helps himself here by creating an arbitrary start date. Sulla was neither the first nor last to seize sole power in the Republic and Aurelian was but the forerunner to Diocletian's reformed Empire. So what reason could Fomenko have for choosing to start with them? They're matched because both were remembered for their cruelty. How clever. Bravo good sir. Well done. Find two people renowned for their cruelty and force them to merge into one. That's exactly the kind of wooly thinking I've come to expect from these books. As usual Fomenko has forced a parallel without mentioning that he's changing things around to do so. Ignoring the fact that Aurelian's reputation for cruelty comes from the Historia Augusta, which is almost as pseudo-historical as this work, the simple fact of the matter is that the two have basically nothing else in common. Sulla's reforms vanished within a decade of his (natural) death while Aurelian's paved the way for his more successful successor Diocletian. Following this we again see Fomenko's number fudging. The use of Strife to cover any periods that don't match is the most obvious one. Another is the use of Sertorius as a counterpoint to Probus. Probus was indeed a 3rd Century emperor but Sertorius was a Roman rebel, albeit a famous and not wholly despised one. Given the number of Roman armies sent against him it seems hard to believe that he was ruling Rome from all the way over in Spain.Diocletian and Constantius Chlorus are also radically altered. Again Fomenko has distorted the facts to make it fit by removing participants. Diocletian had three colleagues not merely one. What's more Constantius wasn't his main colleague but merely his junior partner. Maximian was Diocletian's partner in government and he ruled not from 293-305 but from 286. But using him would throw Fomenko's calculation off, especially given how much importance he gives to Constantius. He calls Constantius Caesar's double even though he did nothing to merit such a comparison. When Diocletian resigns he lists one of his periods of strife and says that Constantius conquers the Tetrarchy as Caesar conquers the Triumvirate. Both are wrong but to focus on Constantius all that he does to conquer the tetrarchy is die. Within a year of Diocletian's resignation he's dead so how he's able to posthumously conquer the tetrarchy is beyond me. Inasmuch as the tetrarchy was destroyed not conquered (which may be a translation issue) it was done by Constantius' son Constantine who spent not four years but twenty changing the tetrarchy into a monarchy. As for Caesar he didn't conquer or even destroy the triumvirate. It was never a formal system. When Crassus died in 53 and Pompey refused to grant Caesar a consulship in 50 the alliance ended. If anyone 'conquered' it it was Pompey who maintained his authority by denying Caesar protection from his enemies. So while I suppose Constantine could be compared to Caesar his father can't which ruins Fomenko's 'theory' by throwing the dates off. An amusing association is between Caligula and Julian. Caligula was a well-known sadistic tyrant (although Fomenko says little is known of him) while Julian was an (over)educated man who tried to bring paganism back. But of course they're the same person because they both wore the military sandals (caligae) which gave Caligula his name. The fact that all Roman Emperors wore such sandals while on campaign is skimmed over. So just to be clear: all the most important figures bear no resemblance to their supposed double, and the few similarities he can find are too facile to mean anything.A few of my favorite examples from his more detailed comparison:Both Augustus and Constantine relied on the military to get them into power.Good point Dr. Fomenko. Good point...""Belisarius is a military leader. Justinian is an emperor. The relationship is initially a benevolent one, but ends in a quarrel.Caesar is a military leader. Pompey is a number one public figure. Friends initially, foes eventually.Achilles is a military leader. Agamemnon is the 'principal royalty'. Friends at first, enemies afterwards.Valerius is a military leader, while Tarquin the Proud is the 'main king'. Hostile in the beginning; mortal enemies afterwards."" (page 195)Now let me try one: General McChrystal is a military leader. President Obama is a 'president.' The relationship is initially a benevolent one, but ends in a quarrel. Hey, that's kinda fun! Good thing there can't possibly be more than one person that vague and unconvincing comparison could describe.And my personal favorite: ""Second Empire. A while ago Tiberius was adopted by Octavian Augustus. Tiberius is known to have died being 'strangled with blankets.' In a sense, this death may be considered unexpected.Third Empire. Constantius II is the son of Constantine I. Constantius II, as historians tell us, 'died unexpectedly.'""Death by blankets is 'unexpected' now? What gives? Seriously, how a dying 78 year old man being hurried to his death can be compared with a 44 year old man dying of an illness in the prime of life is beyond me.So now you see the problems with his comparisons. They're either hopelessly vague or they take one case and force it to fit another. So basically what Fomenko has shown is that human life is repetitive. Even that he can't do without messing with the evidence. And speaking of the evidence, there is something seriously wrong with his way of footnoting. In the bibliography at the back he assigns every book a number and then uses that number in the text. I don't know if that's standard for Russian Mathematical works but it certainly isn't for English historical ones. Or French ones. Or German ones.. Or Italian ones... And there's a good reason no one uses it, it's confusing. You have to go all the way to the back of the book and scroll through hundreds of books to find the one you want, only to find that it's in Russian anyway and hasn't been updated since before the Russian Revolution. There are actually a large number like that. 767 is from 1938 which makes it relatively new. I guess he didn't want to use any books he hadn't already read in childhood. This sourcing method is really frustrating when he gives non-standard citations for standard sources. For example: Plutarch. Fomenko states that Plutarch calls Sulla an Emperor. Since such an office didn't exist in the Republic I decided to look up what word he was mistaking for 'Emperor.' But the citation is this: ([660], Vol. 2, pages 137-138). If you look that up in the Bibliography you find: Plutarch, Comparative Biographies, Vol. 1: Moscow, USSR AN Press, 1961. Since I don't read Russian I have no way of finding that page. This is why proper historians use chapters and verse (like the Bible) to identify their sources. These don't vary with the translations. And while it's hard to judge from a title, that book doesn't sound like it's in Greek. Which means that he's basing his statement about a technical term on a book that translated that technical term for him. The point is that I can't check up on it since he does such a bad job with his sources.This is entirely in keeping with Fomenko's bias and standards of evidence. Brutus is associated with a whole slew of people because Fomenko decides his name comes from 'brat' which means brother. The problem is that 'brat' is a RUSSIAN word meaning brother. He passes by that without question but he's basically assuming that Russian is the originator of all languages. That would be like me claiming Caesar was a sailor since his name is similar to the word 'sea.' It is decidedly typical of Fomenko's extreme nationalistic agenda to assume that everything revolves around the Russians. A minor example of his standards, but an amusing one for me, is his statement that Caesar was called Emperor on coins decades before that office even existed. This is particularly amusing for me since Caesar BECAME the word for emperor as did Augustus after his successor. The Romans never really developed a word for Emperor outside of using those two names. It'd be like claiming that Martin Luther King can't have been from the '60s since America wasn't a monarchy at that time. This is the same question I asked above from his references to Plutarch. The word he's probably referring to though is Imperator which means general, not Emperor. Eventually the Emperors would associate that word so strongly with their power that it would become impossible to untangle it but that was centuries in the future. Another possibility is that it refers to the title of princeps which means the first man of the state. While Augustus made that title a permanent feature of Imperial titulature it originally meant exactly what it said. The leader of the senate had been called the princeps senatus for ages. For Plutarch the options are autocrator (Greek for Imperator), Sebastocrator (Augustus), Kaisar (Caesar), or basileos (king). Since he doesn't say which word it is all that can be done is guess. Fomenko's Latin is apparently as bad as his translator's English.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX7CJC55W8K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DD8J5E#wasThisHelpful","RX7CJC55W8K7","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Now I'm not dissing the Russians here. These ideas were rightly dismissed by Russian experts decades ago, except for the occasional eccentric mathematician and celebrity. That's why he's searching for a new audience: his books have sold just about as much as they ever will in Russia.These books are a statistician's attempt to combat established history using page after endless page of charts and diagrams in the hope that people won't actually check through all these figures. At fifteen volumes in length it's a fairly safe bet, even though these books are extremely short (this one's only about 90 pages long, though it claims to be 372). But what's really amazing is how little digging it actually takes to find the repeated and obvious errors in his work.

The title alone presents a false dichotomy. Fiction or Science? As if those are the only two options. And I have no doubt that Fomenko does indeed see it that way given his haughty dismissal of anything even loosely connected to the Arts. History is too close to the Arts and must be purged of anything that isn't a string of exact, quantifiable numbers. All similar number strings must be combined into the same string, and any ""facts"" or ""historical personages"" attached to those numbers must be purged as well. Nice, clean math. But it's more disturbing than just that. These books are a vast horde of Russian nationalic propaganda. Apart from ridiculing any non-Scientists (AKA those unqualified to form proper conclusions) the main goal of these books is to establish that Russia ruled all the world from North America through Europe into China and the Middle East, and they did so for most of recorded history. So his two assumptions about the world are:1. All Non-Scientists are either liars or idiots.2. Everything in the world originated in Russia.One of these two assumptions is underlying every single one of his conclusions. He treats his random and unsupported speculations with just as much respect as ones that have been established through years of research backed by hard evidence. All Arts and Humanities subjects are regarded as worthless as sources of information and aren't even worth mentioning unless to state (not argue or prove) that they are wrong.And now the history of the world as outlined in this book: History begins when Andronicos Comnenos dies and becomes Jesus. History records him as an unsuccessful Greek emperor with no real successes who was beaten to death by the mob and not a poor prophet from Nazareth who was crucified but hey, what do they know. It's not like the crucifixion was an important part of the story or anything. Immediately all of Europe decides that they're Christian and march against the Muslims. It may sound confusing why they'd blame the Muslims for what was an internal coup but they were probably just confused because Mohammed wasn't born yet. At some point they changed their minds and decided to skip the first three crusades and jump straight onto the Fourth (except that they didn't. It was actually the same as the First. Obviously. Please try and keep up). They then sacked Constantinople which was also Rome which was Troy which was Jerusalem. At some point they get confused and occupied the Holy Land as well and then forget all about Constantinople and let it fall back to the Greeks since Jerusalem was now Constantinople which was Troy which was Rome. People back then had very short memories often forgetting why they did something before they even did it. This is probably due to their lack of statisticians. During the First Crusade the Greeks decide to avenge the kidnapping of their queen by... also sacking Constantinople. After sacking their own city they quietly vanish for a few years, probably in embarrassment. Some time later Erasmus wrote the New Testament confusing generations of scholars who wondered what they had been copying out for all that time. Having now written a New Testament it was decided that they needed an Old one. I'm sure the reasons for the reversed order are as obvious to everyone else as they are to Fomenko. Some time in the 15th Century David rose up, except that he was Turkish and ruled in Constantinople. Despite the many wars with the Turks Europe had never warred with the Turks and accepted all of these events as holy writ. After all, the Turks were really Russian in funny hats and the Russians ruled the world. The Byzantines were secretly ruling in England. After the death of Solomon (Suleimon) the Jews split off from Christianity because they were tired of not being persecuted because of something they didn't do and decided that being hunted by the Inquisition was more fun. In the confusion the Catholics and Orthodox Christians split apart as well because everyone else was doing it and it seemed a good idea at the time. They were to regret this later when the Catholics sacked their city but that had already happened so it was fine.It turns out that Russia has dominated the world since the earliest recorded history (what a shock!). The Mongols were not from Mongolia because the people there are nothing but worthless servants of the Russian Empire (it's ok. Fomenko assures us that the Mongols never knew of Genghis Khan until some pesky monks told them that they used to rule the world). Russia was actually the major Empire that the Romans were based off of and has existed since the dawn of civilization. Silly Georgians thinking they are anything but the personal property of Russia! Ha ha. They also controlled America, Europe and North Africa by 1300 so I guess that we should all submit to the Russian yoke as is our hereditary duty. Occasionally a czar would allow the governors of Europe (kings hah!) to wage war on each other if they pleased him. Presumably the English sucked up to him better than France which is why they did so well in the Hundred Years War but then lost his favor again which resulted in the French winning. Joan of Arc was probably the czar's sister or something. The czar could summon anyone to his court and they had to obey which is why Moscow is renowned the world over as being filled with better artwork and architecture than such dives as Paris and Rome (which isn't the REAL Rome after all). After Russia fell in the 1600s (through internal troubles. No one could EVER conquer Russians) the rest of the world immediately conspired to hide that they ever existed lest they should try to rule over them again. Thus they erased this empire from the history books and replaced it with such lies as Rome and the Holy Roman Empire (couldn't they even pick a new name? Obvious!). Thus the treacherous Romanovs rose to power (did I mention that he first published this under the Soviets?) and they too decided to forget there had ever been a Russian Empire of such a scale. Many ""Roman"" documents are simply Russian ones with a few name changes. Latin is merely a corrupted form of church Slavonic, despite bearing no similarity to that language. The Russians probably invented it to confuse future generations of schoolkids. They had after all had it engraved all over the southern part of their empire on specific styles of buildings which they immediately buried and built medieval cities on top of to confuse archaeologists. It never showed up in Russia itself. Perhaps they punished the provinces by making them write everything in Latin. Oh those cruel Russians. After the late 18th Century things begin to return to what is normally called history.As you can see it is far less confusing than the 'conventional' timeline. You might think I'm making this up but that is what you get when you put all his history together. Minus the sarcasm perhaps.Here's where things start getting fun and we begin to see some of those strange ""parallelisms"" that he's always talking about. And the beginning of the deep argumentation behind this. It's rather fun. See, Fomenko doesn't really argue his case so much as present facts and tell you what they mean. For example, Augustus was depicted with a Christian crown on a medieval map, therefore he was Christian and a contemporary of the author. Could this drawing have been made centuries later by someone living in a Christian nation? Absurd! Why? Because it's obviously the map that's correct not the statues. Why? Because Augustus was living in the 13th century and the later statues are obviously 16th century forgeries. How do you know that? Because the map is obviously correct. Why?!? Because Augustus was living in the 13th century... There is no logical step skipped here in his reasoning. Augustus must have been a 13th century monarch because he was a 13th century monarch. QED. If you don't like that consult source [1177]. Oh, didn't I mention that? Fomenko uses a random system where instead of referring to his sources by name he numbers them all at the back of the book. This makes it impossible to find his sources (many of which are only available in Russian) but that's not as important as his real goal in all this: to convert history into a nice and clean set of numbers devoid of all other meaning.In case you're wondering, yes all his arguments are like that. The renaissance artist Tintoretto drew a drawing of the emperor Vitellius based on a statue, therefore he must have lived at the same time. Osirus is actually a corruption of King Jesus (Esu-Rex, ie. the Latin Rex and three letters from the middle of Jesus' name. Because that makes sense), Christian crosses added to Egyptian obelisks ""prove"" that the Egyptians were Christian, a minaret added to the acropolis ""proves"" that it was actually a mosque, etc. It's like sympathetic magic. If something is near to something else then it must have always been a part of it. None of it is a real argument.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GCIWTFQGLEME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0124T3LM8#wasThisHelpful","R2GCIWTFQGLEME","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

All of these ""contradictions"" are found in the Bible, specifically the Apocalypse and Old Testament. Huh, now why could these specific examples have been chosen? Could it be that perhaps the Bible isn't 100% strictly accurate? What an astonishing thought! Good thing we have Fomenko to tell us this after all those years of historians taking the Bible completely literally! Actually, what he's arguing is even more absurd. Apparently the fact that medieval astronomy borrowed ideas from the Bible is proof that the Bible was actually based on medieval astronomy. References to four planetary chariots and other concepts in both medieval astronomy and Biblical works prove that both were actually written at the same time.

It's like Scientology in a way, in that it starts off sounding relatively sane and then keeps drawing you further and further in until you find that you've committed too much to understanding the work and can't easily get out.Instead of relating his own reconstruction of history (which he is generally surprisingly unwilling to do) he here focuses on challenging the existing basis of history, which he considers the creation of Joseph Scaliger. For those who don't know, Scaliger was the man who first thought to combine ancient history into a coherent whole, with Hebrew and Egyptian history no longer separated from Greek and Roman. As the first person to attempt this it is hardly surprising that he got some things wrong. Which is why it is so amusing to see Fomenko struggle so hard to prove this very simple point and then wave it about in the air as if it proves that everything written since was a lie. This is one of his main methods for dealing with any historical problem incidentally: he finds a fact that historians already believe is questionable and then swoops in and repeats exactly what the critics are already saying, claiming that this is the one vital piece of evidence that all the others rely on and aren't historians silly for placing all their faith in it? It's like claiming that modern science is entirely fictional because the Earth revolves around the sun. After all, the earliest scientists thought it was the other way round, and since we built our knowledge base off these people's work everything that we've learned so far must be a lie.You might wonder what happened to all the other methods for dating artifacts, and that's why Fomenko's dedicated the rest of this book to attacking these. To summarize his arguments briefly: radiocarbon dating doesn't ever work, never ever ever, unless it supports Fomenko's own preexisting conclusions. He's amazingly unsubtle about this too. Immediately after explaining at length about how radiocarbon dating is a myth he then goes on to use it as a way of proving that the Shroud of Turin (radiocarbon dated to the 12th century) is genuinely Jesus' face and therefore Jesus was actually born in 1152 and crucified in 1185 in Czar-Grad. His justification for accepting radiocarbon dating in this instance? Because it was tested more than once. Good thing that this is the only artifact in recorded history that has been tested more than a single time. You may notice that this description of Jesus doesn't line up with that in the outline above. Get used to that. Since he believes history is nothing but a series of parallelisms copied over and over again every historical figure can expect to be a half-dozen other historical figures in disguise. Doesn't matter if they have nothing in common.And then the book ends, rather suddenly. The reason for this is that it's only the first chapter of what was once a larger book. Surprise! This work used to be a four volume set, but it's now expanded to fifteen volumes with minimal new content added. And just before it gets truly amusing too.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27JBTLTC0UXYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011VIZ95A#wasThisHelpful","R27JBTLTC0UXYC","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Thus they erased this empire from the history books and replaced it with such lies as Rome and the Holy Roman Empire (couldn't they even pick a new name? Obvious!). Thus the treacherous Romanovs rose to power (did I mention that he first published this under the Soviets?) and they too decided to forget there had ever been a Russian Empire of such a scale. Many ""Roman"" documents are simply Russian ones with a few name changes. Latin is merely a corrupted form of church Slavonic, despite bearing no similarity to that language. The Russians probably invented it to confuse future generations of schoolkids. They had after all had it engraved all over the southern part of their empire on specific styles of buildings which they immediately buried and built medieval cities on top of to confuse archaeologists. It never showed up in Russia itself. Perhaps they punished the provinces by making them write everything in Latin. Oh those cruel Russians. After the late 18th Century things begin to return to what is normally called history.As you can see it is far less confusing than the 'conventional' timeline. You might think I'm making this up but that is what you get when you put all his history together. Minus the sarcasm perhaps.You don't even have to wait for the book to begin for the errors to creep in. The title alone presents a false dichotomy. Fiction or Science? As if those are the only two options. And I have no doubt that Fomenko does indeed see it that way given his haughty dismissal of anything even loosely connected to the Arts. History is too close to the Arts and must be purged of anything that isn't a string of exact, quantifiable numbers. All similar number strings must be combined into the same string, and any ""facts"" or ""historical personages"" attached to those numbers must be purged as well. Nice, clean math. But it's more disturbing than just that. These books are a vast horde of Russian nationalic propaganda. Apart from ridiculing any non-Scientists (AKA people unqualified to form proper conclusions) the main goal of these books is to establish that Russia ruled all the world from North America through Europe into China and the Middle East, and they did so for most of recorded history. So his two assumptions about the world are:1. All Non-Scientists are either liars or idiots.2. Everything in the world originated in Russia.One of these two assumptions is underlying every single one of his conclusions. He treats his random and unsupported speculations with just as much respect as ones that have been established through years of research backed by hard evidence. Linguistically too he is a dunce since he views all languages as being mere corruptions of the original Russian. Linguistics after all, is not a science. Neither is Art, Archaeology, Sociology, Geneology, or Anthropology. Thus they are worthless as sources of information and aren't even worth mentioning unless to state (not argue or prove) that they are wrong.And man is this book the least interesting of the lot. This book contains Fomenko's challenging of astronomical methods of dating, which is about as exciting as you might expect. Tedious, tedious stuff. Titles like ""The strange leap of parameter D"" in the theory of lunar motion"" are exactly as dull you might expect. Why can't he get straight to the parallelisms? Oh right, he needs to draw readers in with the relatively sane stuff before he ambushes them with the truly nutty ideas.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCSP6GQHWT88Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011YC01VU#wasThisHelpful","RCSP6GQHWT88Z","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only conspiracies here have to do with the number of insanely positive reviews. There are twenty(!) here where the reviewer only has one review to their name and it's a five-star review for this book. And more coming. Funny that. It's almost like somebody has set up multiple accounts and is trying to up the rating. Parallelism indeed. Two with no other reviews may be coincidence. But twenty? Very subtle. You might as well have just copied and pasted your review.So, I'm not a mathematician and I don't know enough to contradict Fomenko's math, but I don't have to. By that reasoning Fomenko wouldn't be able to contradict me because I'm a Classical History Major and this is (ostensibly) a History book. I can tell you exactly why his math must be wrong and why he should be ashamed to call himself a scientist. Scientists must make the models match the data, not the other way round. When the facts don't fit your theory then the problem isn't with the facts, it's with your theory. And boy do the facts not fit this 'theory.' It would be hard to think of a way in which history could make less sense than it does through his model.First, a brief explanation for anyone not familiar with this book. Anatoly Fomenko is a Doctor of Mathematics at Moscow State University. Despite a lack of support from his colleagues (who consider his ideas on history nuts) he published a series of seven books in which he rewrote the history of the world based on his ideas of Statistics. As explained on the back cover, ""Jesus Christ was born in 1053 A.D. and crucified in 1086 A.D. The Old Testament refers to mediaeval events. Apocalypse was written after 1486 A.D."" I'll go more into why he thinks that makes sense later. The Roman Empire and all of Classical civilization was invented by Jesuit monks who wrote in a remarkably short time all of Western literature and invented an entire civilization which people then immediately forgot never existed. All Classical buildings are simply medieval ones that have been misdated.And now a brief history of... well history, as seen through Fomenko-vision: History begins when Andronicos Comnenos dies and becomes Jesus. History records him as an unsuccessful Greek emperor with no real successes who was beaten to death by the mob and not a poor prophet from Nazareth who was crucified but hey, what do they know. It's not like the crucifixion was an important part of the story or anything. Immediately all of Europe decides that they're Christian and march against the Muslims. It may sound confusing why they'd blame the Muslims for what was an internal coup but they were probably just confused because Mohammed wasn't born yet. At some point they changed their minds and decided to skip the first three crusades and jump straight onto the Fourth (except that they didn't. It was actually the same as the First. Obviously. Please try and keep up). They then sacked Constantinople which was also Rome which was Troy which was Jerusalem. At some point they get confused and occupied the Holy Land as well and then forget all about Constantinople and let it fall back to the Greeks since Jerusalem was now Constantinople which was Troy which was Rome. People back then had very short memories often forgetting why they did something before they even did it. Very sad. During the First Crusade the Greeks decide to avenge the kidnapping of their queen by... also sacking Constantinople. After sacking their own city they quietly vanish for a few years, probably in embarrassment. Some time later Erasmus wrote the New Testament confusing generations of scholars who wondered what they had been copying out for all that time. Having now written a New Testament it was decided that they needed an Old one. I'm sure the reasons for the reversed order are as obvious to everyone else as they are to Fomenko. Some time in the 15th Century David rose up, except that he was Turkish and ruled in Constantinople. Despite the many wars with the Turks Europe had never warred with the Turks and accepted all of these events as holy writ. After all, the Turks were really Russian in funny hats and the Russians ruled the world. The Byzantines were secretly ruling in England. After the death of Solomon (Suleimon) the Jews split off from Christianity because they were tired of not being persecuted because of something they didn't do and decided that being hunted by the Inquisition was more fun. In the confusion the Catholics and Orthodox Christians split apart as well because everyone else was doing it and it seemed a good idea at the time. They were to regret this later when the Catholics sacked their city but that had already happened so it was fine.It turns out that Russia has dominated the world since the earliest recorded history (what nationality was Fomenko again?). The Mongols were not from Mongolia because the people there are nothing but worthless servants of the Russian Empire (it's ok. Fomenko assures us that the Mongols never knew of Genghis Khan until some pesky monks told them that they used to rule the world). Russia was actually the major Empire that the Romans were based off of and have existed since the dawn of civilization. Silly Georgians thinking they are anything but the personal property of Russia! Ha ha. They also controlled America, Europe and North Africa by 1300 so I guess that we should all submit to the Russian yoke as is our hereditary duty. Occasionally a czar would allow the governors of Europe (kings hah!) to wage war on each other if they pleased him. Presumably the English sucked up to him better than France which is why they did so well in the Hundred Years War but then lost his favor again which resulted in the French winning. Joan of Arc was probably the czar's sister or something. The czar could summon anyone to his court and they had to obey which is why Moscow is renowned the world over as being filled with better artwork and architecture than such dives as Paris and Rome (which isn't the REAL Rome after all). After Russia fell in the 1600s (through internal troubles. No one could EVER conquer Russians) the rest of the world immediately conspired to hide that they ever existed lest they should try to rule over them again. Thus they erased this empire from the history books and replaced it with such lies as Rome and the Holy Roman Empire (couldn't they even pick a new name? Obvious!). Thus the treacherous Romanovs rose to power (did I mention that he first published this under the Soviets?) and they too decided to forget there had ever been a Russian Empire of such a scale. Many ""Roman"" documents are simply Russian ones with a few name changes. Latin is merely corrupted church Slavonic despite belonging to an entirely different branch of the language family. The Russians probably invented it to confuse future generations of schoolkids. They had after all had it engraved all over the southern part of their empire on specific styles of buildings which they immediately buried and built medieval cities on top of to confuse archaeologists. It never showed up in Russia itself. Perhaps they punished the provinces by making them write everything in Latin. Oh those cruel Russians. After the late 18th Century things begin to return to what is normally called history.As you can see it is far less confusing than the 'conventional' timeline. You might think I'm making this up but that is what you get when you put all his history together. Minus the sarcasm perhaps.It seems best to explain why he is wrong about the facts he lists before going into the facts that he's ignoring. First off comes a good example of how he combines Classical and Medieval history together. To him the First Crusade and the Trojan War are the same event. One of Fomenko's favorite tools, a chart, might demonstrate why this is.Simularities:First Crusade . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..| Trojan WarA war . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..| A warSieges involved . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| All about a siegeEast vs. West . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| East vs. WestUm, took place on the planet earth . . . . . . . . . . .| Probably the same if it happened at all...The differences:First Crusade . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..| Trojan WarLead by Bohemund, Raymond, Geoffrey, etc. . . . ..| Led by Agamemnon, Achilles, Odysseus, etc. (No matching names)Fought for religious reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| Fought for political/personal reasonsTraveled by land . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..| Traveled by seaLeaders fought on horseback . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| Leaders arrived on chariots, fought on footWeapons: lances, spears, iron swords, chain mail ..| Weapons: spears, bronze swords, bronze greavesAll participants monotheist . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..| All participants polytheistCame from all over Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| Came from GreeceLasted three years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .| Lasted ten yearsWent to recover city . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..| Went to destroy city and recover wifeSet up a kingdom on enemy land . . . . . . . . . . . . .| Immediately returned homeLeaders became kings and lords of new land . . . . ..| Leaders offend the gods and are punishedArchaeology confirms presence in Israel . . . . . . . ..| Archaeology confirms presence in GreeceMentioned the Trojan War in documents . . . . . . . .| Was the Trojan War...As you can clearly see there is a great deal there fully justifying the combination of these two events as the same war. How could it not be?...Clearly this idea is nuts and fails on any comparative level. There are almost no similarities between the two events except that they were both famous. To combine the two would require removing all facts except for the sieges. If you discard all that then there is nothing left.His arguments for this are all mathematical and rely on eclipse records and other such information as well as a statistical analysis so vague that multiple mentions of sieges mean they must be the same one. By that reasoning my name is Stuart therefore I must be a king since previous Stuarts were kings of England. QED. Can I have my crown please? A key fact of mathematics is that garbage in=garbage out. He may have done all his calculations correctly, but if he feeds in the wrong data or assumptions then he'll still get worthless data back. Even I know better than to do what he does. By selecting only those sections of chronology which match his conclusions and ignoring those that don't he violates a key rule of statistics. My Statistics I teacher taught me that. It's as basic as you can get. For example he selects a segment of Byzantine Emperors and matches them with a series of Old Testament kings. The two dynasties match up very well indeed so he concludes that they must be identical. Sounds convincing. But why did he choose to compare that stretch of kings with that stretch of Emperors? Because they matched of course! Statistically speaking if you try hard enough you will be able to find matches in the lengths of reigns for various civilizations if you have no other qualifying factors. If he'd chosen Roman Emperors to match with the Byzantine ones he probably wouldn't have found his correlation. Or Frankish ones. Or English ones. Or even earlier Old Testament ones. In fact, even with that it doesn't fit because he has to combine Justinian and Justin I to make it match Manasseh. He had an even worse time fudging the list of ancient Spartan kings to make them match the despots of Mistra (p. 304). He actually inverted the Spartan king list, which makes total sense because people trying to hide what they did would naturally just invert the chronology instead of, y'know, making the dates up? It's not like there are any other similarities between the names he's matching. I should also point out that unlike the despots the Spartans had two kings at a time. He's actually skipped over the most famous king Leonidas (of SPARTANS! fame) because he didn't fit as well as the other one.He also thinks he's being clever by comparing the ancient kings of Rome with a list of Emperors from the later Empire (p.305). This shows his fudging at its worst although people who've never studied it might not know it. It looks reasonable at first glance. Kings of Ancient Rome: Romulus Quirin, Numa Pompilius, Tuttus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquin the Ancient, Servius Tullius, Tarquin the Proud lasted in total 244 years. In the later Empire Constantine I, Basileos the Great/Asa, Valentinian I, Honorius, Aecius, Valentinian III, Recimer, Odoacer, Theodorich, The Goths last 252 years. The first thing that any Classicist will note is that those are not the correct English transliterations of their names. The translator didn't even try to get them right. Basileos the Great is St. Basil despite never being called ""Basileos"" or ""the Great"" in English. I have no idea who Asa is supposed to be. The problems with this: First the ancient kings are fake. Probably made up by Roman mythologists. Certainly they didn't know the exact dates when they ruled. So he's comparing a fictitious dynasty with a factual one. He'd undoubtedly say they're both fictitious but this chart was supposed to prove that and it doesn't prove anything of the sort. Moving on to the real Emperors. St. Basil wasn't an emperor, he was a bishop and theologian. He has no place on this chart. Fomenko has skipped over Constantius, Constantine II, Constans, Julian, Jovian, Valentinian I, Valens, Gratian, Thodosius, and Valentinian II unless one of them is Asa. So one king ruling 43 years has become 11, including Valentinian I who shows up next on the list after he's been dead for about 5 years. Actually he only shows up on the chart after he dies. Perhaps he's supposed to be Valentinian II? He is followed by Honorius who actually shows up at the right time for once but they do neglect to mention that the Empire has been split in two by this point and thus there are two Emperors whom he can chose from to fit his chart. Apparently that's not enough because the next man is... well I don't know who he is to be honest. He's certainly not an emperor. If Aecius is in fact Aetius then he was magister utriusque militiae (sort of head general) under Valentinian III who shows up next. Even someone who's never read anything about the Later Empire should note that Fomenko jumped straight from Valentinian I to III. Aetius in fact lasted a further ten years dying in 454 a few months before Valentinian III who had him killed. He only lists him as dying in 444 because that way he matches with Ancus Marcius giving him a 'reign' of 21 years. Following Valentinian III comes what is definitely supposed to be Ricimir. He was also not an Emperor but a general and had been killed several years before the Empire fell. There were nine Emperors during this time (in the West) and then the Western Empire fell. Not one to let facts get in the way Fomenko continues with the first of the Gothic kings. Finally he's met another section that matches with his list. Odoacer and Theodoric last 50 years to Servius Tullius' 44 (according to Fomenko). At this point he just gives up and the next king is ""the Goths."" Huh. Well that makes perfect sense. As you can see, despite his neat graph he's made up most of his dates and skipped over dozens of Emperors. The only ones that actually fit are Constantine I (the first one on the list) and Odoacer/Theodorich who were kinda two different people and not the same one like Servius Tullius. Even the bits that do match don't do so exactly and to have any significance it would have to match exactly. It's like saying that 2+2=5 because 2 is approximately 3. The average length of rule for a king is 20 years (look it up) which means that even a few years difference is a major deal statistically. That by the way is a valid and important use of statistics in historical studies.I leave the astronomical stuff to people more qualified than I to judge it. Clearly if his statistical analysis is this far out of whack his astronomical analysis isn't gonna be much better. I shall stick to the limited attempts he makes to explain away all non-mathematical historical evidence.The biggest problem that he finds is that all documents from Antiquity are copies. None of them are older than the 11th Century and thus must be fake. There are no original documents from the classical era (except that there are. See below). While this may sound convincing to anyone who has no contact with the subject it is inevitable if you think about it. The Romans were destroyed 1500 years ago. Parchment simply doesn't survive that long under ordinary circumstances. Any documents surviving must be copies. This doesn't mean that there is no way to test their authenticity. Comparisons of documents is one key way. If two documents are identical, or nearly so, then they may be presumed to come from the same source. Since it is possible to date documents in this way it can be worked out what the oldest one is and which document was copied from which source. What you find is that most of the more numerous sources are copies of multiple originals from unconnected authors on opposite sides of Europe. Which means that those documents must be based on even earlier sources. So already we're past Fomenko's 11th Century limit. Many forgeries can thus be detected by when they first appear on record, what sources they used to write it, and stylistic and factual variations. Fomenko is a mathematician. Every fact must be either true or false. Therefore this system must seem maddening and imprecise to him. And it is imprecise, at least on mathematical terms. That doesn't make it inaccurate.Since dates do show up in documents from time to time he needs to come up with a way to discredit every writer who's ever lived and I have to admit he has a highly original way of doing so. Without offering any proof he asserts that Roman Numerals didn't have a number for ten. X stood for ten in Roman numerals but Fomenko believes that they only had I's and V's since X stood for Christ (p. 337). X was the first letter of Christos (Ch was spelt X) in Greek and therefore they put it in there to indicate that it was the 1st Century of the Christian era. It makes me wonder how a 12 (XII) year old boy can really be a 200 year old man but I'm sure that the mathematician knows what he's doing. 1 is also fictitious. As a Russian who doesn't use the Latin alphabet 1, I, J, and l look much the same to Fomenko and as he does with all things that look the same he combines them. 1 was not actually a number but the letter I (or J) and stood for Jesus (Iesus in Latin). So the year 1300 is actually the year 300 after Jesus. As proof of this he includes a picture of a tombstone in Britain with what he claims is a J for a 1. Sure it is Dr. Fomenko. Sure it is. Don't worry. We believe you. As you might imagine he gives no evidence apart from the similarity (to a Russian) of appearance and treats his idle and unsupported speculation with the same weight as solid fact. He also views anno domini (AD) as being misunderstood (p. 351). While anyone who's taken even a little Latin will tell you that it means 'in the year of the lord' Fomenko has an alternate translation. Since 'dom' means house in Russian he assumes that it means the same thing in Latin. Thus anno domini would mean 'in the year of the (ruling) house' and would refer to the current ruler and not Jesus making it impossible to determine dates from AD. This is an early example of the ethnocentrism that is to dominate his later works. Needless to say this doesn't work in Latin. While the word house in Latin is domus I refuse to give him credit for this since he referred to a Russian word, not the Latin one. However 'in the year of the house' in Latin would be anno domi, not anno domini. Domini is the genitive of dominus which means master. While it is connected to the word for house (being one who is in charge of it) it has an entirely distinct meaning from it and the word cannot be used in that way. Clearly the fact that he doesn't know Latin isn't stopping him from making sweeping assumptions about it. Anyways this makes dating from the dates included in documents impossible which is certainly convenient for him isn't it? Of course all of this makes it hard to explain the many medieval Universal Histories that went from the Creation to the present and used BC and AD in exactly the same way they do now. I love the idea that Bede was actually living in the 18th Century describing the goings on of the Stuarts and Hanovers as if they were a dozen petty feuding monarchs in an only-recently Christianized land.Another way to determine a document's (or artifact's) age is Radiocarbon dating. Fomenko dismisses this entire branch of science as unreliable because it disagrees with him. Carbon Dating never provides exact dates, merely dates +- a certain number of years. It can usually be stated to within 30 years or so. This isn't a science that we're asked to have blind faith in. It can, and has been, verified. Radiocarbon dating is used most frequently in archaeology where it is one of the only ways to date a structure in the absence of written evidence. Fomenko dismisses this because it completely eradicates his 'theory.' Radiocarbon dating matches historical dating with high accuracy. Only in documents written about prehistory is there any variation which is to be expected given how little data there must have been for ancient historians to go on when they were dealing with events before their time. This is the factor that most of his supporters jump on because it is seen as harder to disprove. I admit I'm not sure how accurate it is, although it's certainly far better than +-1,000 years. But then, this isn't the foundation of his argument. He only attacks it because his 'theory' requires that it not be true. The real 'strength' of his argument lays in his statistical analyses and astronomical work. Even if Carbon Dating turned out to be rubbish he would be no closer to proving his 'theory.'To conclude: his events don't combine, his dismissal of carbon dating doesn't hold up, and his statement about forged documents is completely inaccurate. That last point I will demonstrate further below under the section which deals with the evidence that he denies or ignores. And speaking of...Having shown what utter rot his selective use of facts is it's time to turn to the facts that he doesn't want people to know. Starting with something I mentioned above: documents. While parchment doesn't last forever as I have said, there are certain conditions which allow it to be preserved for much longer than it would normally be. These finds are rare but offer a valuable insight into the ancient world. The most famous of these finds comes from Vindolanda. This was a Roman fort just below Hadrian's Wall. There were a series of letters written on thin slivers of wood which were preserved underwater in the muddy ground. These letters dealt with common every day things including troop strength, parties, new clothing, etc. They also include selections from Roman literature that Fomenko dismisses as forgeries. These documents are originals, not copies, and deal with an everyday Roman life that Fomenko claims never existed. The key points is this: there was no way that a group of Jesuits working in the 16th Century could have known that anyone would have the technology to read what was written. The processes used to recover the letters was invented by archaeologists in the 1970s including the infrared photography needed to recover them. There was no way that Jesuits could have known that they would survive by chance, would be discovered, or could be read once they had been. Furthermore, what would be the point? It's not like people doubted the Romans existed. Why create all of this useless information only to bury it forever in a place where it should have rotted away? Especially in Protestant England where Jesuits weren't exactly welcome? This parchment find is not the only one. There is a major dump in Egypt (also outside Jesuit control) and smaller ones in several other places around Europe and the Middle East. Furthermore, the building that the Vindolanda documents was found in was clearly Roman in design and structure. Which brings me 'round to my next point.Clearly Fomenko has no interest in the arts or humanities. He dismisses art historians with all the contempt he clearly feels for any field that isn't Math or Physics. Which explains how he can make some of his outlandish claims. I should point out that he considers none of these claims as proof of his 'theory.' He doesn't even take artistic studies seriously enough to dispute them. He simply assumes that they are wrong because he is right and leaves it at that. His sections on architecture are masterpieces of arrogant disdain. The only reason he even deigns to mention them is because his 'theory' is correct and therefore they must be wrong. I don't think that I need to explain why that is the wrong attitude to take.As an example he considers the Parthenon to be a Turkish mosque. The Parthenon is of course a masterpiece of Classical architecture and is lacking the traditional Muslim mosque design. Particularly the dome. Yes the roof was blown off, but they can still tell the structure of the thing from what remained. And what remains is remarkably similar to other temples traditionally labeled as Classical. I'm not kidding when I say he makes this claim based on no evidence either. His logic is that the Ancient Greeks never existed therefore this building cannot be Greek. He says that there was a Turkish tower on the Acropolis and therefore it must have been built there at the same time. His rather poor photo from the 1860s shows the tower right next to the temple of Athena Nike and it seems to be constructed of similar material to what is underneath it. By his reasoning this alone is enough to conclude that it was originally there when the temple was constructed.His conclusion ignores the similarity of design between classical buildings and assumes that they are all more modern. The fact that there are buildings of similar design and function located throughout Europe is ignored. Why these buildings were all built, covered in Roman inscriptions, and then abandoned is left as something of a mystery. Or it would be if he mentioned it. Also missing is a discussion of artifacts and how some artifacts are found throughout the Mediterranean despite the highly different cultures that exist there. Why do Turkish buildings and artwork differ so much from Italian buildings and artwork if they were all the same a few hundred years ago when they built Classcal temples? And for that matter, why were they the same? Roman armor is especially strange since the only conclusion possible from his 'theory' is that everyone around the Mediterranean adopted Roman armor, sculpted and painted it (but only on Classically styled buildings), and then abandoned it without it ever having an effect on medieval armor and weaponry. This entire section is a blatant insult to the reader's intelligence and his own. And it gets worse.When mentioning the dating of buildings he neglects to explain the layering. Specifically how one building is often built upon another. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the building on top is the newer building. Yet he would have us discard such obvious facts. Because when Classical buildings are found in a medieval city they are INVARIABLY found on the bottom. That's right, all those Classical buildings being built at the same time as medieval ones somehow all ended up on the bottom while their contemporaneous medieval ones ended up above them. Gosh, isn't that surprising?So there you have it. This sad little pile of pseudohistory manages to waste 586 pages in his first book alone trying to prove something that your average five-year-old would know is nuts. A very sad thing. I'd feel more sorry for a man who's clearly slipped his bolt if it weren't for his unshakeable arrogance and contempt for all other fields. The basic assumption of the book is that mathematics trumps history. Clearly he knows better than all those stupid historians who can't see that they wasted their time in not becoming mathematicians. He actually says that one of his goals is to reclaim chronology for the field of mathematics from which he is convinced the church stole it. His contempt for other fields is staggering. He clearly knows this field better than any artist, art historian, historian, physicist, or even just plain commonsensical human being and has no hesitation in stating it. In doing so he never stoops to their level by debating facts, he simply states them as truths and then ridicules them. This book really doesn't deserve a response, but what the hey, it's a pretty funny read.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PWJNAA53UH7B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2913621058#wasThisHelpful","R1PWJNAA53UH7B","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Immediate note of importance: this is a European game that will only play on European systems. It WILL NOT play on a US 3DS. If you want to play this game on a US system you're likely to have a long wait. This game is exactly the same as Bomb Blast, except that this one focuses on Paolo while that one focuses on Hector.This game is a bit of a step down from the previous two. The basic plot of the game is the same as the first one: the Raimon Junior High soccer team competes in a series of matches to defeat all their competitors in the Football Frontier, only this time it's the Football Frontier International and their competitors come from all over the world. This is a bit of a step back from Inazuma Eleven 2, where the team took on aliens who were trying to conquer Japan through soccer. Going back to just a soccer tournament is kinda a letdown, and there's no way to avoid that. That doesn't mean it can't still be good.This title continues the same gameplay of the previous entries. You face random football battles where you have to score a goal with four players.

This is mixed in with RPG elements of walking around town and recruiting players. Put that way it sounds kinda dull, but it really isn't. The character fluff is great and the football battles suitably challenging. There is only one major change to gameplay here: you now get exhausted quite rapidly and are constantly switching players out.

He's supposed to be Italian so I was expecting someone to do a Mario impersonation, but instead he sounds like he's trying for a German accent but with rolled rs. Yeeek. Even muting it can only help so much. I can handle the cockney Japanese in text form, but having random Italian phrases and words scattered throughout the dialogue is just annoying. There's just no getting away from it. I want to like Fideo (he was great in the Anime) but here he's just annoying.The game's problems come with the advent of the story.

This is combined with occasionally sloppy plot devices, like how Froste suddenly develops a broken leg and has to stay behind with no setup or warning. Also, there are four hospitalizations, and of those four characters three hid their illness from their friends and three needed operations to cure terminal plotitis. It feels just a little bit overdone and stale.Another problem this time round (and one they didn't suffer from before) is the characters. Mark, Axel, and the rest are as cool as ever. Fideo's great, and so are some of the new guys. But then you get the two most annoying characters in the series: the coach (who I shall always think of as Snake) and Caleb. As you might remember from the last game, Caleb's kinda a dick. He doesn't get any better here, although his story is partially saved by a late piece of character development where you realize just how much Dark screwed over him and Jude. Snake has no such redemption because the game seems to think he's utterly brilliant. And there's nothing quite so annoying as seeing everyone fawn over a character you can't stand. Coach's problem is that he is the worst coach in the entire world. Rather than tell his players what they should do, he gives them a series of arbitrary tasks that then lets them learn the skills they'll need. Like locking them in their rooms for no reason. Or making them practice in the mud. Or banning Evans from playing. He has super secret reasons for all of these, but he maintains the idiotic attitude that if they don't work out why he's doing what he's doing for themselves then they deserve to lose. What a pro.Honestly, the plot may be repetitive, and several new characters a nuisance, but the core of the game is the same old Inazuma we already love. It ties up a number of the loose ends and resolves the series on a decent note. I might wish that it didn't feel quite so tired, but at the same time I was glad to be returning to a world I enjoy. I can't exactly say I never got frustrated playing it, but the good definitely outweighs the bad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39L3JAOUR6CQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BG4R0IO#wasThisHelpful","R39L3JAOUR6CQW","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Immediate note of importance: this is a European game that will only play on European systems. It WILL NOT play on a US 3DS. If you want to play this game on a US system you're likely to have a long wait.This game is exactly the same as Lightning Bolt. It's exactly the same, except that this one focuses on Hector while that one focuses on Paolo.This game is a bit of a step down from the previous two. The basic plot of the game is the same as the first one: the Raimon Junior High soccer team competes in a series of matches to defeat all their competitors in the Football Frontier, only this time it's the Football Frontier International and their competitors come from all over the world. This is a bit of a step back from Inazuma Eleven 2, where the team took on aliens who were trying to conquer Japan through soccer. Going back to just a soccer tournament is kinda a letdown, and there's no way to avoid that. That doesn't mean it can't still be good.This title continues the same gameplay of the previous entries.

"This is the book we've been waiting for! New canon has thus far been a bit of a mixed bag, at least as far as literature is concerned. We did get the delightful Tarkin, A New Dawn, and Lords of the Sith, but we also got stuck with the miserable Heir to the Jedi and Aftermath.This book is what Aftermath should have been.What we have here is a grand space opera on the widest of stages. A love story that feels real and tragic, but never phony. It's not a story of Jedi and laser swords, but of normal men and women caught up  in a galactic civil war. It's exactly what Disney was promising to give us but thus far failing to deliver. The heroes are two ordinary people who go through the imperial academy and end up on different paths, one fighting for the Rebellion and the other the Empire. Such doomed romances are typical of larger-than-life settings, but this one is notable for the relative subtlety of their positions and motivations. Sure, the Empire is pure evil, but at every step of the way you see why people fight to protect it. The characters are extremely well drawn and you understand fully the motivations of the leads.Take my advice: don't read spoilers saying which one joins the Rebels and which sticks with the Empire. Guessing which is which was one of the most entertaining parts of the first third of the book. It's not that it's a major twist. The decision doesn't exactly take you by surprise. The guessing is fun because they both have such clear reasons to join the Rebellion, and such clear reasons to stay. You feel like they each could have hopped either way, yet once the reveal is made it seems inevitable.That's not to say the book is perfect. Once the two are apart the story gives us what amounts to a potted history of the war, with the lead characters appearing at all of the major encounters from the films. I normally hate this sort of cameo, but it's done well enough here that I can forgive it. Still, it could have been avoided. Another result of this is that the story becomes a bit choppy and fragmented the further along we get. And frankly, post-joining not enough is done to keep the Rebel's story interesting. The main interest at this point comes from watching how the Empire slowly corrupts the souls of the people serving it. Everyone starts the book off as a decent person, but by the end the survivors aren't all nice. It's a fairly brutal transition to watch.This book is the first real look at a galaxy post-Endor, despite what Aftermath might tell you. It deals with matters of galactic import and does so with skill and subtlety. The first real must read of the new canon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQV56KW2EGSGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484724984#wasThisHelpful","RQV56KW2EGSGV","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had very high hopes for this book which it unfortunately failed to meet, or even approach. That's not to say that there was nothing interesting in here, but it never really comes together as a story. Certainly it's not the galactically important novel it was advertised as and seems to aim at in its interludes. But it's still our first new canon look at a galaxy post-Endor and therefore indispensable to some. So I'm going to try to cover two things in this review: a more typical look at the book's plot and writing style and a more fanboy-centred look at what exactly we're learning about this new verse, including some holdovers from the old one. If you don't want any spoilers whatsoever then don't read the 5th and 6th paragraphs, but I'm not discussing anything plot-related.The novel basically wants to be a small-scale story of heroics on a backwater world where an absentee mother and her young son try to assassinate/capture the attendees of an imperial conference. As such it has the right basic elements, but whether because of an innate desire to go large scale and epic or because of instructions from above it feels the need to go galactic in scope, even when this actually distracts from the plot. The first problem is that the most interesting element, the imperial remnant conference to decide the fate of the Empire, is developed the least and we're left with no insights whatsoever. The second is that we're constantly hit with flashbacks/flashsidewayses to events elsewhere in the galaxy that have nothing to do with the plot (the interludes). These seem to be there for the rabid fanboy, but although that category includes me I wish they'd left them out. They add nothing but confusion to the plot and make the reader constantly yearn to leave this backwater little planet and see some of the more interesting things apparently happening at the same time. No sense spoiler-baiting if it comes at the expense of the overall novel. When it sticks to local events it's largely alright. It's just that it rarely does for long.The plot is pretty basic, but that's not a problem if it's told well. The difficulty here is that the book relies on recurring tropes that diminish in shock value each time they're used. Aside from the fact that people get captured or (easily) escape capture almost every chapter (and there are a LOT of chapters) we have the old 'Oh, but they're not REALLY dead' trick pulled on us at least seven times. It feels very amateurish and I'm not surprised the author previously wrote for RPGs since that's what it feels like at times. Particularly with the writing style. And it's waaaay too long for its subject matter. The whole plot could be trimmed down to a longish short story.I'm afraid though that the biggest flaw with this book is its writing. It's written entirely in the present tense, meaning that it will say ""he thinks clearly"" instead of ""he thought clearly"". It doesn't seem that distracting at first, but it gets more annoying as time goes on. It's meant to seem more immediate this way, but there's a reason this style is rarely done and that's because if it's not done carefully it seems distancing and weird, even just subliminally off. We rarely hear ""I go to the store"" becuase it's nearly always ""I went to the store"" or ""I'll go to the store"", or even ""I'm going to the store"". While we're talking of unnatural there were several times I was thrown off by how unlike Star Wars the dialogue sounded. From the constant ""damnits"" (sic) to a ""very cool"", ""not so much"", and the mention of radar the dialogue seems off to me. It sounds a lot like kids talk today, not like they talked in the movies. It can be distracting, especially when combined with the more normal Star Wars style.Edging into the second section of the review, we do get to see a few familiar faces. Wedge Antilles (back to being Red Leader now) is one of the leads of the book, but he's given basically nothing to do. He's unconscious most of the time and when he's awake he comes across as fairly empty, out of his depth, and even wimpy. I really hope it's just bad writing on the current author's part and not an attempt to rework the character. I know they've rebooted canon, but that doesn't mean it's wise for them to remove what people liked about a popular character, especially one who better than anyone fits their stated goal of expanding the cast beyond the big three and those with magic Force powers. Other characters show up as well, including Ackbar, who's basically paranoid (eternally afraid of another ""it's a trap"" moment, I kid you not), Mon Mothma, who's apparently trying to disband the army already (not like people want to see wars in Star Wars, right?), and Han, who shows up for five pages in an interlude for no reason. Yeah, I told you those interludes could be distracting.As I said earlier, it's really the interludes where we get our background information and we do get a few substantial hints about the new state of the galaxy. Just to rattle off a few names that show up: Czerka, Black Sun, Carrack Cruiser, Grand Admiral (Ackbar no less!), Coronet City, Taris, and the New Republic are all officially in the new canon now. We also find out some interesting facts, like that the new Senate House is on Chandrilla despite the New Republic having Coruscant, Lando's still involved with Cloud City, and the Empire's down to one Super Star Destroyer. That last one is interesting given that we saw the Falcon flying through a crashed one on Jakku in the last trailer. There are also a lot of more spoilery hints about Dark Side cults and hidden leaders and general mystery, but I won't spoil those. You can do a search for them online.There are quite a few tidbits I didn't mention and if you're a rabid fanboy you'll have to read the book just to catch them all. If you're not that I suggest you move on and find another. The old canon had a lot of good books (plus a lot of bad ones) and the new canon has the excellent Lords of the Sith, A New Dawn, and Tarkin (avoid Heir to the Jedi). Or you can read up on the comics, which have all been pretty good so far. But there's nothing much here worth reading unless you're desperate for information.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MFE9KTBT30Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USOCNCQ#wasThisHelpful","R11MFE9KTBT30Q","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I switched to the A77 after testing out Nikon's D3200, and boy am I glad I did. That was a fine camera, but it was clearly not being marketed for somebody of my interests. I'm interested in photography, but I primarily use my camera to take vacation photos. Not like the casual holiday snaps you're better off using a pocket camera for, but detailed photos of the places I visit for future reference. For that reason I rely very strongly on Live Mode (since I take a lot of photos from odd angles) and need a camera that can take good photos with a minimum of fuss. Having explained that, I'm going to focus on what this camera has that I need, for what else can you cover in a brief Amazon review? If my needs don't sound like yours then by all means skip this!The biggest area where the A77 rises above the competition is in having an instantaneous Live Mode. This is something that most DSLRs lack since the mirror has to flip up when it takes a photo and this causes a delay of several seconds. For those not in the know, Live View means that you use the viewscreen on the back of the camera instead of sticking your eye right in the little viewfinder. Not being able to use it can be really tricky if you rely on fast photography or any of the features that come with a viewscreen rather than a mirror. For example, it means you have to constantly move your eye from right against the camera to about a foot back to check if you took the photo right or not and then back again to take another shot. Needless to say, taking lots of photos can get really tiring this way.Using the A77 Live View on the other hand is a piece of cake. It takes pictures immediately and you can see what you're going to get before you take it. Since the viewfinder is an LCD display as well you don't have to take your eye away to see what your picture looks like. Some people don't like that the viewfinder uses an LCD, but I really like seeing the focus points and other features on there. You lose out on those if you have a regular viewfinder. The level of resolution is quite impressive so you're really not missing that much detail. Or you can use Live View and take advantage of the fully rotating viewscreen to get some extraordinary images you couldn't reach otherwise.The second main thing I adore is the GPS. With this feature on it's simplicity itself finding where I took every photo so there's no need to hunt for ages finding the site manually. The GPS is very reliable too, usually locking on within twenty seconds or so. I've used it in fields and in cities with no problem. The only thing that seems to throw it off is cloud cover.The camera has a number of other useful features you won't find in the competition. There's a digital level that makes lining up on the horizon simplicity itself, a joystick to make controlling menus easier, two dials so you can adjust aperture and shutter speed without switching back and forth, in-camera lens correction, and many more. The array of buttons is excellent, and any changes are only one or two clicks away. I also like the rugged construction. I feel like I can take this camera anywhere without worrying it will get wet or cracked.That's not to say the camera is all strengths. The automatic levels are rather poorly judged. I find I consistently need to put the exposure compensation down by 0.7 in the day and up by 0.7 at night. Until you get that mix right all the photos will look washed out. I'm also not convinced it captures colors as well as the Nikon, and sometimes it's not as focused as it thinks it is. So it doesn't quite work as a camera you can just take out and shoot perfect photos with.One thing that I really do miss about the Nikon is the nighttime quality. The A77 has a translucent mirror so it loses light every time it takes a picture. This means that the higher ISO levels are going to be pretty wretched. Anything over 1600 is going to be grainy and over 3200 is unusable. Fortunately, Sony has also worked out a way to compensate for this slightly. If you set it on twilight mode the camera takes six photos in rapid succession and combines them into a single non-grainy photo. It's more reliable than it might sound and lets you take good-looking photos up to 6400. It's still not as good as the Nikon (particularly in color depth) but it works and it helps compensate for blur as well.No camera's perfect, but this one has more than its fair share of strong points. The camera may be a bit old now, but that just means you have a better chance of finding a good deal on it used. I think it's better than the A58 (which felt too plasticy and cheap to me) and offers more useful features than any comparable brands. If you want something a bit better than the entry-level model but can't afford the newer A77II then go for this.

That's not to say that there was nothing interesting in here, but it never really comes together as a story. Certainly it's not the galactically important novel it was advertised as and seems to aim at in its interludes. But it's still our first new canon look at a galaxy post-Endor and therefore indispensable to some. So I'm going to try to cover two things in this review: a more typical look at the book's plot and writing style and a more fanboy-centred look at what exactly we're learning about this new verse, including some holdovers from the old one. If you don't want any spoilers whatsoever then don't read the 5th and 6th paragraphs, but I'm not discussing anything plot-related.The novel basically wants to be a small-scale story of heroics on a backwater world where an absentee mother and her young son try to assassinate/capture the attendees of an imperial conference. As such it has the right basic elements, but whether because of an innate desire to go large scale and epic or because of instructions from above it feels the need to go galactic in scope, even when this actually distracts from the plot. The first problem is that the most interesting element, the imperial remnant conference to decide the fate of the Empire, is developed the least and we're left with no insights whatsoever. The second is that we're constantly hit with flashbacks/flashsidewayses to events elsewhere in the galaxy that have nothing to do with the plot (the interludes). These seem to be there for the rabid fanboy, but although that category includes me I wish they'd left them out. They add nothing but confusion to the plot and make the reader constantly yearn to leave this backwater little planet and see some of the more interesting things apparently happening at the same time. No sense spoiler-baiting if it comes at the expense of the overall novel. When it sticks to local events it's largely alright. It's just that it rarely does for long.The plot is pretty basic, but that's not a problem if it's told well. The difficulty here is that the book relies on recurring tropes that diminish in shock value each time they're used. Aside from the fact that people get captured or (easily) escape capture almost every chapter (and there are a LOT of chapters) we have the old 'Oh, but they're not REALLY dead' trick pulled on us at least seven times. It feels very amateurish and I'm not surprised the author previously wrote for RPGs since that's what it feels like at times. Particularly with the writing style. And it's waaaay too long for its subject matter. The whole plot could be trimmed down to a longish short story.I'm afraid though that the biggest flaw with this book is its writing. It's written entirely in the present tense, meaning that it will say ""he thinks clearly"" instead of ""he thought clearly"". It doesn't seem that distracting at first, but it gets more annoying as time goes on. It's meant to seem more immediate this way, but there's a reason this style is rarely done and that's because if it's not done carefully it seems distancing and weird, even just subliminally off. We rarely hear ""I go to the store"" becuase it's nearly always ""I went to the store"" or ""I'll go to the store"", or even ""I'm going to the store"". While we're talking of unnatural there were several times I was thrown off by how unlike Star Wars the dialogue sounded. From the constant ""damnits"" (sic) to a ""very cool"", ""not so much"", and the mention of radar the dialogue seems off to me. It sounds a lot like kids talk today, not like they talked in the movies. It can be distracting, especially when combined with the more normal Star Wars style.Edging into the second section of the review, we do get to see a few familiar faces. Wedge Antilles (back to being Red Leader now) is one of the leads of the book, but he's given basically nothing to do. He's unconscious most of the time and when he's awake he comes across as fairly empty, out of his depth, and even wimpy. I really hope it's just bad writing on the current author's part and not an attempt to rework the character. I know they've rebooted canon, but that doesn't mean it's wise for them to remove what people liked about a popular character, especially one who better than anyone fits their stated goal of expanding the cast beyond the big three and those with magic Force powers. Other characters show up as well, including Ackbar, who's basically paranoid (eternally afraid of another ""it's a trap"" moment, I kid you not), Mon Mothma, who's apparently trying to disband the army already (not like people want to see wars in Star Wars, right?), and Han, who shows up for five pages in an interlude for no reason. Yeah, I told you those interludes could be distracting.As I said earlier, it's really the interludes where we get our background information and we do get a few substantial hints about the new state of the galaxy. Just to rattle off a few names that show up: Czerka, Black Sun, Carrack Cruiser, Grand Admiral (Ackbar no less!), Coronet City, Taris, and the New Republic are all officially in the new canon now. We also find out some interesting facts, like that the new Senate House is on Chandrilla despite the New Republic having Coruscant, Lando's still involved with Cloud City, and the Empire's down to one Super Star Destroyer. That last one is interesting given that we saw the Falcon flying through a crashed one on Jakku in the last trailer. There are also a lot of more spoilery hints about Dark Side cults and hidden leaders and general mystery, but I won't spoil those. You can do a search for them online.There are quite a few tidbits I didn't mention and if you're a rabid fanboy you'll have to read the book just to catch them all. If you're not that I suggest you move on and find another. The old canon had a lot of good books (plus a lot of bad ones) and the new canon has the excellent Lords of the Sith, A New Dawn, and Tarkin (avoid Heir to the Jedi). Or you can read up on the comics, which have all been pretty good so far. But there's nothing much here worth reading unless you're desperate for information.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16281CHRR16KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=034551162X#wasThisHelpful","R16281CHRR16KM","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any composer writing the score for a sequel to a film with music as memorable as Jurassic Park's is forced to take one of two risky approaches. The first option is to simply remix the original theme as much as possible and settle for a competent and nostalgic score with a minimum of originality but a maximum of nostalgia. The second option is to do something more difficult and pay brief homage to the original theme while creating new and original music in the style of the original.This soundtrack does not quite fall into either trap, but it doesn't evade the problem either. While he offers the typical themes expected from a Jurassic Park soundtrack most of the score is new work. Unfortunately, most of the new material is entirely background and incidental. The film itself makes only infrequent use of the grand rising musical moments that Spielberg so loves so this may have made a grand orchestral theme impossible. It is frankly a waste of Giacchino's talents. A side effect of this absence of any grand themes is that this score is noticeably shorter than most. In fact, the longest track is a thirteen minute suite that's simply all of the other music mixed together.John Williams is a tough act to follow but if there's anyone capable of doing it that person would be Michael Giacchino. His scores have typically been among the greatest created by modern composers, and they seem to get better and better with each passing year. This man is in his prime. It's particularly unfortunate therefore that this score doesn't properly live up to the potential of this power couple. Instead I'd recommend the soundtrack for the original film, or almost any of Giacchino's. His Pixar soundtracks are all excellent as are the two other soundtracks he composed this year. Perhaps three masterpieces in one year is simply too much for any artist.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTYBGR66YLJ91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWUD62U#wasThisHelpful","RTYBGR66YLJ91","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't really my sort of book. Don't get me wrong, I love Vader and the Emperor, but at the same time they're so beyond the pale that I've never found myself wishing they were the protagonists. To be honest, I don't see a lot of depth in pure evil. Some people go in for that, I don't. Different tastes I suppose. That's why I was so surprised to find that this really is a very well written and enjoyable book. It focuses on the villains sure, but it gives each of them their own distinct character (including Moff Mors, Star Wars' semi-famous first gay character) and doesn't make the mistake of trying to make their enemies out atrocity them to increase our sympathies.I've never read any of his books before but Kemp is a very skilled writer. He knows the level of badass we expect from Vader, and delivers in spades right from the first chapter, but he also manages to flesh the characters out beyond just living embodiments of evil. The galaxy feels real and it feels gritty and lived in (something the Clone Wars series sometimes had trouble with) and more than a little dangerous. The story is important for setting up future events and resolving old issues. It feels a lot like a transition book between the prequels and the original trilogy and it handles the potential conflict well.The core of this book is the powerful relationship between the two leads. The relationship between Vader and Palpatine is really fleshed out from what we saw in Revenge of the Sith and feels as if it's well on the way to where we meet them in Return of the Jedi. Sidious seems somewhat doubtful of his apprentice and Vader is loyal but has occasional trouble overcoming bad memories. But now they need to work together if they're going to survive Ryloth's fierce wilderness and enemies hunting them. Yeah, like that's gonna really be a problem. But it's nice to see Sheev really crank his power out some. He never really got the chance to do that in the prequels except for that fight where he threw the Senate at Yoda.The two of them have an interestingly symbiotic relationship. Vader is all about pure rage and takes the protection and security of his Empire to heart. The Emperor is a shady and cruel man who doesn't seem to care one way or the other about his Empire except in that it allows him the chance to devote himself to his dark side studies. He seems to be working hard on that prescience thing he has going in Return of the Jedi and he doesn't really care how many of his own people die to improve his connection to the Force. I can't say that's how I saw Palpatine (I always envisioned him taking great joy in having people dance about on his strings) but it works well for the novel.There are other characters here as well. The rebels of Ryloth are the main antagonists, and basically those lousy ingrates want the Empire to stop enslaving them and occupying their planet. Jerks. They're led by Cham Syndulla, a resistance leader from the Clone Wars and Hera's father. He's the guy that would be the lead protagonist of any other book, and he gets plenty of time to shine here, but the focus is always centered on Vader and the Emperor. This is the first major rebellion in the new Empire and one of the delights here is seeing a proto-Rebellion forming. Obviously we don't get to see the whole thing spring up here fully formed but this seems like a logical precursor to an organized galactic resistance movement.The only real problem I have with the book is that the scale is limited almost entirely to the Ryloth system and a single Star Destroyer. With a book showing off the Sith Lords' might you kinda want an epic backdrop for them to fight in. Instead they spend most of their time fighting with forest critters away from the main group. It feels like an opportunity for something bigger was wasted here. The ending was also very sudden and anticlimactic. But none of that changes the fact that the book is a really good read despite being focused on a topic I wasn't expecting to like.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KBMGD719EJF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKX0R62#wasThisHelpful","R3KBMGD719EJF3","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This isn't a bad book. It's also not a good one. In fact, it seems aggressively mediocre, as if deathly afraid of doing something that might possibly mean something for any of the main characters. I say characters, but I just mean Luke. He's the only one who shows up here except for a brief appearance by Leia and, oddly, Ackbar. I can't say there's a single awful moment, but there aren't any really good ones either.In fact, the entire book reads like a series of side quests. The first third of the book is a sidequest unrelated to the main plot. The remaining two thirds is one brief adventure after another, none of which build on each other or have any real effect on future missions. In fact, the big dramatic escape at the end is resolved in one line that says that the main chase is over, instead of actually building on the drama of whether they made it or not. And again, even the main plot is generally unimportant on either a personal or galactic level.The big draw of this book is hearing an entire story told from Luke's perspective. It's less effective than you might think. Luke just doesn't have the sort of charming cynicism of someone like Han or even Leia. In fact, he doesn't have much of anything. Inasmuch as there is any cohesive character drama it's about Luke's daddy issues, which alternate between feeling really obvious and somewhat implausible. I could believe Luke being interested in what his father did, but his curiosity waxes and wanes depending on the author's mood. It would have been far better if the book had focused on Luke's insecurities (daddy issues being one among many) rather than just sort of half-heartedly acknowledging them. Some of the character dialogue is awfully stilted too. Can anyone really imagine Luke saying Thats an extraordinary feeling, if you dont mind me saying. How did you come to hold it?I can't really say I'd recommend this book to anybody who wasn't a diehard fan. It's not even of much use as a resource for finding out more about the new canon since, while it is new canon, it was already commissioned under old canon and hastily reworked. Of all the books released thus far this is by far the weakest. Still, it's fairly harmless and inoffensive as such books go. And if that's all you're in the mood for thenn it might work for you. Just don't go in expecting Shakespeare.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EUIXYCIP9MPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345544854#wasThisHelpful","R1EUIXYCIP9MPB","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tarkin is the second book in the new canon of Star Wars novels, and the first genuinely good one. A New Dawn, for all its various merits, failed repeatedly to live up to its potential as an adventure novel or a character piece. With Tarkin we can see a bit more of what the Lucasfilm Story Group has planned for this universe. That, for me, is one of the chief thrills of this book.James Luceno is an author who has been on my watchlist for years as one of the best Star Wars writers to never really have an unreservedly good novel. His books have to me seemed consistently better than their subject matter since his area of focus always seems to be periods of little interest. Who really wanted to see the background negotiation behind the trade regulation conflicts that lead up to the Phantom Menace? And the less said about the NJO the better. But despite the subject matter his books were always an easy read, and I've been waiting for the day when he found himself writing on a subject worthy of him. And finally he has in what is technically his first Star Wars novel in the new continuity.Tarkin is a book that's miles better than it should be. Wilhuff Tarkin is not a sympathetic man by any stretch of the imagination. To have an entire book devoted to him has seemed criminally wasteful to some. All the more so since this is not so much an adventure yarn as it is a genuine character study. At many points it feels almost like a biography of its subject, not a problem for me since I enjoy biographies.The main plot features a group of insurgents (not really rebels so much as terrorists) who are using advanced holonet hacking abilities/technology to sabotage and destroy Imperial outposts. The Emperor sends Vader and Tarkin to chase them down, and in so doing they form the beginning of the partnership we see in A New Hope. The secondary plot consists of Tarkin's musings on his past and the rise of the Empire. This section is focused on A LOT, and contains most of the truly interesting character moments along with a potted history of how the Empire is run and what exactly its inhabitants believe and value.The main plot's fairly weak to be honest. Or  I might better say that it's fairly simplistic and undeveloped. But that's because it really is only an excuse to allow the character study to unfold. And an excellent character study it is. Tarkin emerges from these pages as a fascinating figure who is understandable without being particularly sympathetic. While the book doesn't focus overmuch on his atrocities (apart from repeatedly demonstrating his indifference towards civilian casualties) it doesn't make the mistake of sugercoating them either. Tarkin is still that wonderfully privileged brute we saw in A New Hope, he's just provided with the background and beliefs to match it.It's not a perfect book by any means. The grand revelation about his past, saved until a conversation with Vader just before the book's climax, isn't nearly as big a deal as it's made out to be. But overall it provides a highly satisfying look at a man who doesn't generally receive a lot of attention. The look at the workings of the Empire is fascinating, as is the speculation sure to be raised about what sort of hints are being dropped about The Force Awakens. And Tarkin's personal history is truly interesting. Just don't go in expecting to see much in the way of sympathetic characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O8RHH5JXZ1XZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345511522#wasThisHelpful","R1O8RHH5JXZ1XZ","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best Final Fantasy game we've gotten in years (assuming we don't count Bravely Default). Sure, the game's already four years old but there's been nothing really good in the FF series since 2007. This breaks the losing streak. Type-0 is a brilliant game and captures the sense of wonder and awe that's been missing from recent Final Fantasies.I'm not one to gush over gameplay but this game has an excellent combat system. What's more, while I usually hate magic as a combat mechanism, the magic works really well here. There are four basic elements to combat. First is your attack. Playing as Ace (all the characters have playing card names. Don't ask) your main form of attack is to throw cards at people. It sounds lame, but it's actually really badass and effective. The second element is the shield system. You can summon shields that help protect an area from attack. This can be really useful in establishing temporary cover, although like most cover in this game the shields can be overpowered. The third element is the warping system. This is how dodging works and it's basically a really cool way of avoiding attacks and advancing quickly on your opponent. They've copied this system for FFXV and with good reason: it's really cool. The fourth element of combat is more typical: casting. You can cast spells and damage your enemies or help your allies. It's fairly standard, although the charge time is kinda cool.Type-0 is very unlike earlier games in the series for all it apes Crisis Core's combat system. The storyline is much darker and the issues it deals with more complicated. It's all very much military and mission-based and doesn't allow for the same type of roaming that other Final Fantasies offer. Actually, it reminds me more of Valkyria Chronicles in approach, particularly the documentary way the plot is advanced. But this works for the game rather than against it. The main series has been afraid to take risks of late (although FFXV seems set to change that) so a radical direction shift is a good idea. It brings this game to life and provides use with a reason to care about the storyline.The basic plot of the game is fairly familiar. Evil military dictator invades peace-loving nation intent on stealing their priceless crystal. Blah blah blah, bad things ensue. But it quickly becomes clear that this familiar situation is not going to be as familiar as we thought. The opening of the game is truly heartbreaking, following dying characters' efforts to reach their reinforcements. It's immediately apparent that this game is not going to shy away from looking at the darker side of war. To this end one of the main plot elements is that characters are forgotten as soon as they die, in line with the crystal's wishes. This has been done to avoid suffering among the survivors but it's incredibly tragic for everyone involved as they can't even remember their closest friends once they've been lost. It's kind of a crazy idea but it really works at emphasizing the loss and suffering. The game's different approach also appears in its setting. Instead of placing you as lone hero types you are merely military cadets training with the regular army. From this you get to experience life in the military rather than as the lone wolves you know you'll end up playing as in combat. It's a refreshing change and they handle it well.At some point we have to address the issue of the graphics. This is not a next gen game. It's a port of a PSP game, and a four year old one at that, so in many ways it's unfair to criticize it for its inevitable limitations. On the other hand, it's being very much billed as Type-0 HD, and that gives us cause to analyze how much that's accurate. While it is true that the graphics have been upgraded from the PSP version it is very clear that they remain very much inferior to the quality you would expect from a PS4 or even a PS2 game. I'd place it on about the FFX level, and not the remade version. The texture maps are quite obviously designed with a portable audience in mind as they appear blurred and 2D in HD resolution. Other aspects show the PSP's limitations as well. The camera controls have obviously been optimized for a system with no second analog stick, and while this does make combat easier it means that the camera controls are sudden and jerky and turn the world into a blur that makes it hard to keep track of.Does this really matter in the end? I'd argue that, for the most part, it doesn't. Type-0 isn't aiming for absolute realism but instead tries to create a vaguely Animeish world where everything is somewhat larger than life. And in that it succeeds. The game looked great on the PSP and for the most part it looks great here. The buildings are large and impressive and contain a surprising amount of detail for a PSP game. And of course, gameplay-wise graphics just don't matter unless they're so bad as to cause control difficulties. The only real problem from a graphical standpoint is that the game is inconsistent in quality. Apparently, they upped the quality of the leads by simply replacing the original models with the ones used in the the cinematics. While they are obviously not at next gen level they look acceptably detailed on the big screen for it to seem a design choice and not a flaw. For characters who never appear in cinematics they've stuck with the old models. This can be really obvious. In the opening scenes we get one soldier who never shows up in a cinematic holding hands with our lead. While Ace has smooth and articulated digits the side character's hands are just stubby rectangular blocks. Things like this make it harder to defend the 'artistic choice' argument. There's no denying that as ports go this one was lazy and superficial, particularly given the difficulties that should have been recognized in porting a portable game to a larger console, but it still works as a game.The level of detail put into all aspects of this world is pretty astounding. You can access the files in the library to find detailed descriptions of everything that's going on, from the history and background of the world to the characters inhabiting it. Unlike FFXIII this isn't essential to understanding any of the plot, but it is useful in case you forget anything or simply want more details than the main quest provides. The level designs are very impressive, even if they are quite linear. Here we run into the problem of the PSP again since levels are kept quick and are made up of many smaller areas rather than one large one that would tax the system too greatly. It's annoying but inevitable, and the load times are very good.There are two other things I adore about the game, one of which will please people and the other nobody but me will care about. First off, the music here is pretty amazing. I've been disappointed with the score of every game since X and even when they hit decent tracks it usually only shows up once or twice amid the generic ones. But this game has the best main action theme since VIII. A good action theme should make you feel like a badass even when you're facing off against minor mooks. While the rest of the music is less memorable the main theme is used in a lot of different variations throughout, all of them good. The other thing I love is that most of the names in here is Latin-based. As a latinophile I love seeing the Soldier Empire take on the Red Dominion (and their allies the Armour Alliance and the Harmony Kingdom) to prevent the time of ending. It's cool and should feel out of place in the Japanese-based world, but it really helps make the names seem foreign (to a Japanese audience as well as a Western one I imagine). And of course the music is filled with dramatic Latin chanting too. Awesome.On the whole I really loved this game. It has a great combat system and a powerful story that deals with some pretty dark issues for Final Fantasy. It feels creative and inspired and alive. If you can ignore the limitations imposed on it by the PSP system you'll find a spectacular game that really shows why Final Fantasy has been a force to be reckoned with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LD5SWDNVVUHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWJ4JW4#wasThisHelpful","R2LD5SWDNVVUHW","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a brief but excellent biography of one of the most important figures of the early fifth century. Although primarily known (slanderously) as the man who invited the Vandals into North Africa Boniface was also an important figure in imperial politics, and a rare figure about whom we have contemporary evidence from his friends. This biography is probably overdue, but at the same time contains little that is astonishing or new. While we may have more information about Boniface than other figures of the time it still doesn't amount to much and the book is often forced to simply recount political events to which Boniface was only a minor participant. In so doing it always tries to show it from his viewpoint as well as can be known. The most interesting bits were the analysis of the letters Augustine sent to him. Augustine was his friend while he was a young man stationed in Africa, and while his opinion of Boniface sunk as the man meddled in power politics in later years he remained connected to him until his death during the siege of Hippo Regius. These letters provide insight into the man himself and suggest the course of his early career.If people like this book there's also a good biography of Aetius available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R66JB45L1U0FB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780937172#wasThisHelpful","R66JB45L1U0FB","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the PS3. There, I've said it. It was very hard for me to get used to the idea of replacing it. Which is why although it offers improvements in several key areas I don't think the PS4 is quite as good as the PS3. In many ways the two systems are nearly identical. Controls, Settings, the PSN are all still here in only slightly different forms. The interface has been changed from a row of different options to two rows with one controlling settings/extra features and the other containing the games and apps. Instead of only displaying the game in the slot you now install everything like an app, which can make it confusing when you're not sure what disc is in the machine. This system makes it easier to find the most recently played game but gives fewer options for organization. I preferred the old system with its neat rows but this one is perfectly functional.On a technical level the PS4 is a marked improvement over the PS3. Games run much smoother and don't suffer from long loading times. The games that have come out so far seem to make good use of the system's capabilities and larger save files by, for example, keeping track of your character interactions and making the NPCs carry a grudge. It's an interesting and engrossing idea that really helps with immersion. A nice feature is that now the system can multitask. While playing your game you can pause it and go out to the main menu to check on downloads or settings and then go back to your game without losing your place.Some of the other changes are less interesting. The social gaming idea is something that Sony has worked very hard to incorporate into the basic design of the PS4 but apart from game reviewers I'm not sure how much use people will make of the ability to record gameplay. I've taken a few screencaps just for fun, but it's not a feature I'm likely to use very often.One change that is a step back is that they have removed video/audio file functionality. For those who are used to using their Playstation as a media centre in addition to a gaming system this will be a major disappointment. Now the only way to watch films or listen to music is to play it on DVD or pay for one of the streaming services. Since DVDs can be clumsy to carry around and streaming sites depend on reliable internet connections this simply isn't a reliable option for some people. Better keep that old PS3 around.I was more than a little skeptical about the new controller. Playstation has kept their controller design basically the same since the original in 1995, with the only major change being the dual analog sticks a couple years later and then a wireless version being used for the PS3. There's a reason for this, and it's not complacency. The design is quite simply the best yet offered for a video game system, and all of its competitors have imitated it to one degree or another at some point.Which is why I was more than a little surprised to discover that the new controller is an improvement. Not much of one mind you, but enough to make the change worthwhile. First off they've added a touchpad to the area between the screens.which allows slightly more choices to be made with maps and the like and also makes entering text easier. It's easier to hit accurately than the select button so this is a big improvement for games that rely on that. Another addition is a motion sensor. I doubt that it's as sensitive as the Wii, but the new feature allows it to select areas on the screen simply by pointing the controller at them. Which is cool. A speaker and microphone jack have been added which allows for some cool in-game effects.The rest of the buttons remain essentially the same (why improve on perfection?) except that start and select have now been replaced with share and options. I'm not that fussed about sharing gameplay footage but the select button does basically the same things as the start button so I'm not sure why they bothered to change the name. I'm less impressed with the new shape. It's been altered slightly so that the smaller handles now sit in your hand smoother but the steeper angle for the L and R buttons means you really need to hold the controller in a loose low-down grip to access both at once. They also have a glowing light on the back now which doesn't seem to do much except waste battery.In short, the new system is better than the PS3 in some areas, about the same in others, and actually worse in a few places. I'd still recommend getting it if there are any games you're interested in, but keep the old system around since they complement each other well. Honestly, there's no point in until a must-buy next gen game comes out anyway and that didn't happen until relatively recently for me. Most of the best PS4 games are also available for the PS3. Alien: Isolation, Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Metal Gear Solid V, Persona 5, Destiny, Final Fantasy XIV... all available on last gen systems. So why upgrade? But now they are finally coming out with next gen exclusives. Assassin's Creed: Unity was the first good one (glitches aside) and in the next year we get Final Fantasy Type-0, Star Wars: Battlefront, Kingdom Hearts III, and Final Fantasy XV. These are all available for the XBOX One of course, and there really isn't that much reason to prefer one next gen system over the other. Titanfall aside Microsoft doesn't have that many great exclusives either. However, later this year we get Bloodborne and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, both exclusively for the PS4, and inFAMOUS: Second Son has already been released. Now there's finally a reason to buy a next gen system beyond the desire to simply have the latest platform.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QU1AMT68YQTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGA9WK2#wasThisHelpful","R1QU1AMT68YQTC","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In many ways Assassin's Creed: Unity represents a return to form after the largely disappointing American trilogy. Sure, Black Flag was a lot of fun, but the land stuff was almost an afterthought and it barely even feels like an Assassin's Creed game. But Unity is an Assassin's Creed game through and through, for better or worse. And it's about as good looking a one as they've produced thus far.First off, I think everyone has heard of the horrible glitches that this game had on release. I'm not going to deny that releasing a near unplayable game is an extremely bad thing, or that it deserves every sting of criticism it receives for that. However, by the time I bought a copy most of the bugs had been fixed by the giant patch it automatically downloads so I can't claim to have experienced these glitches as anything but hearsay. Sure there one or two minor glitches, but nothing that interfered with gameplay and nothing which I haven't seen in other games. For that reason this review will not discuss such problems and can focus on the game itself.First off, visually this game is a vast improvement over previous titles, which were usually very impressive on their own. The city of Paris is beautifully rendered here, with a nice alternating weather feature which really adds variety to the game and makes it feel as if time is passing. The ability to run through buildings is something I thought sounded cool but not particularly useful, but it's one of the key elements that aids in immersion. Going inside these houses just in passing makes them all feel like real and lived in to a degree I never thought possible. It also makes it ridiculously easy to lose guards. Another nice element is that they have given more life to the city than previous games could. Each NPC character seems to have his own life and we see numerous love affairs, robberies, mourning, etc. taking place throughout the city. Everyone has a reason to be where they are. The textures are more detailed and some of the faces look almost photo real, at least until they speak. Speaking of faces though, there is one feature that needs to be discussed.The hair. Oh God, the hair! Assassin's Creed and games in general have often had problems rendering hair believably, but I can't recall it ever looking this bad. They've abandoned creating the hair as a single block with a cool texture map and are now trying to create each hair individually. Except using about 1% of the actual hair. Which is why anyone who doesn't have their hair pulled back (or God forbid has a beard!) looks like some sort of monstrosity with a line of strings sticking out of their head at odd angles. I'm sure this is a logical step to developing truly natural-looking hair but the developers should have known it wasn't working and they should have known this pretty early on. Perhaps a part of it is how silly this looks on the new ultrarealistic faces but it would look bad on almost any figure.The gameplay is slightly different from previous games, but still similar enough to not cause a problem. Combat has been tweaked to be much harder. Gunshots hurt and are very difficult to dodge. Instead of health regenerating over time you buy disposable potions to heal yourself. These can get used up extremely quickly. Not so fond of these combat mods to be honest. What I do love are the stealth mods. They've really improved stealthing in this game. Now, when you're spotted as soon as you break their line of sight a transparent figure of you appears in the location where they last saw you.  The guards will run to the last place they saw you and look around that area, but if you're out of their line of sight they won't magically find you. You can use this to your advantage by being careful where your last known position was and then ambushing them.One element they're trying to push is the online multiplayer. Now many of the missions you come across around town are multiplayer co-op missions. If you're not interested in multiplayer this can be slightly annoying. The accents are slightly odd here. Previous games gave their characters accents to match their nationality, but now everyone speaks with an English accent except when they're speaking random French. It works fine but it's a little strange.The plot is basically more of the same and it's as tired as it felt in III. The Assassin/Templar conflict just isn't that interesting and has been played out already. The best drama in earlier games came from entirely non-Templar related elements. Ezio's family drama, Kenway's roguish greed, these were the bits that made us care. Listening to people jabbering about which apparently monolithic but vaguely-motivated group they belong to has become tedious. We learned everything we needed to know about this in the first game. Starting with Revelations the simple plots vanished and now we're given complicated political goings on that have nothing to do with the main conflict of the plot. I'm firmly convinced that tying these games around an existing war/social revolution is a massive mistake. How was aiding the American Revolution supposed to help the Templar cause? It was clearly about issues that had nothing to do with that, and forcing the two ideologies to merge made a muddled mess. This game has the same problem, although they play it more carefully. The revolution seems to be happening in the background and is almost irrelevant to the main plot, which is tied up with internal squabbles in the ranks, until the end where they at least give an understandable reason for why the Templars support the side they do. It doesn't make any sense because their plans are simultaneously too specific and too vague to be reasonable, but it is at least clear.Fortunately, this game learned from the best and gives Arno a love/family interest. She's a Templar which confuses things but it does actually give us a reason to care. Arno is an entertaining character too, being a bit cheeky and adventurous, at least until he joins the assassins for no real reason at which point he loses all personality. His personality comes back somewhat when the love  story picks up again, which makes the game worth playing through to the end. The love story works really well, as do the mystery elements sprinkled in towards the end (it'd be great if they could do more of this in London next year since that setting is full of mystery). The Templar/Assassin stuff is just perfunctory and done more from a sense of obligation than any real passion. They didn't even bother to give Arno a real motivation to join the assassins (he''s avenging his Templar foster-father? What?) and the fact that nobody among the assassins really questions his ties to the Templars feels so false it's confusing. We also get rather fewer historical personages here than I would have expected (and mostly in side quests), which is fine because shoehorning them in was a large part of the problem with III.If that sounds a bit confusing, well, it is. The plot is a mix of tired cliches and new ideas. Gameplay has been improved in ways I didn't think were possible. Paris is beautiful and immersive, with enough similarity to the real geography to be recognizable and with the same cheeky historical footnotes as previous games. Overall, I wouldn't say that this is the best Assassin's Creed by a long shot but it's a marked improvement from recent attempts. It's just that the series feels a little stale. Gameplay remains as fun as ever, but it would be nice if they could find a way to drift away from direct Assassin/Templar plots or at least find a way to expand their ideologies and plans into something intelligible or interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R4BAOH6C014U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J48MUS4#wasThisHelpful","R2R4BAOH6C014U","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent case for the iPhone 6. It adds a little weight but provides a lot for that drawback. The battery in this case holds enough juice to charge the iPhone 1.5 times. Given the increased power demands required by the larger screen this is an important addition. Using it is easy too, since all you have to do is press the button on the back and it starts charging. It charges through the same port you use to charge the phone so there's no need for an extra charging session. Once the phone has finished charging the case starts charging too.With the case on it's about twice as thick and twice as heavy, but it's about the same width and smooth to the touch. The back of the phone is almost completely safe from breakage, although the camera is still exposed through a hole. The iPhone 6 camera is an ugly extrusion anyway, so this actually helps streamline the phone. The plastic lining the sides is transparent and not flush with the phone's body which means that dirt and grit begins to coat the inside and make it look really dirty. There's nothing you can do about this really, except keep the phone away from all dirt. The face of the phone is slightly recessed now which should help it in case of a fall. The buttons on the side still work, if slightly less well. The speakers seem to work about as well, though they may be quieter. The headphone jack is a lot worse though, being too deep for regular earphones and now requiring an extension wire. The charging port has replaced the Apple exclusive cable with a regular Micro USB. This works just as well as the Apple cable but is easier to replace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N3Q3YR5GBSA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6Y9UPQ#wasThisHelpful","R1N3Q3YR5GBSA1","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well. your iPhone certainly won't be damaged in here. This case basically covers the entire phone in rubber. The front screen is protected by a plastic cover that fits surprisingly well and about a 1/4 inch of rubber on the sides. While the phone may be protected the size increases exponentially. It's about three times thicker than the iPhone 6 and almost as heavy again. I found that the extra weight makes it very difficult to use the phone one-handed. The volume and on/off button aren't as sensitive as they are without the case. It can occasionally be hard to turn on. The Mute button (very important when in a crowded theater) is very hard to use without taking the phone out and fiddling with it for a minute. The Touch ID seems to work okay, though it's not as sensitive as it is without the cover. The screen protector fits well, but the thick rubber on the sides makes touching the edges of the screen difficult. Since this is the section you type on that can be a problem. For my part I found it so annoying I took it back out of the case and bought another brand.I can't really fault it for doing what it's supposed to do. If keeping your iPhone free from all danger is more important than some of the functionality then this will work fine. Otherwise, it's better to go with a slightly smaller case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36T4TGER4NDAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOOF88Y#wasThisHelpful","R36T4TGER4NDAM","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent keyboard for the iPad. I spent a lot of time searching for a case for mine and this was by far the best that I found. All other cases on the market seemed to be designed to either work as a keyboard or a case, and not both. They may protect your iPad but when it comes time to use it you are required to have it sitting sideways propped up as if you're going to type. If you want to use it like a regular iPad without the keyboard you have to actually take it out of its case. With this case you can prop it up (it magnetically locks) and use it as a keyboard or you can fold it over and place it flat. In this position it protects the keys and lets you turn the iPad to face whichever way you want. It's a simple feature that was harder to find than I thought it would be.As to the keyboard itself, it works as well as any of the others I tested. The bluetooth link was easy to establish and caused no problems. It only turns on when the iPad is snapped in place to type so the battery isn't draining itself needlessly. The keys are closer together than on a regular computer, but this is going to be a problem with any keyboard you get for the iPad. The copy and paste functions are clearly labeled and easily accessed, along with all the other functions. The only real problem is that the numbers are shrunk down to about a third of the size of the other keys for some reason. The iPad sits at a convenient viewing angle when locked in and the area surrounding the keypad is not exactly cushioned but certainly fuzzy and comfortable to rest your hands on.When closed the case looks like a fancy notebook. It's quite impressive how easily it blends in with your other school materials. It should prevent the iPad from getting its screen cracked or scratched (and the heavier bit with the keypad on it is what's protecting the front) but if you really want tougher protection then you should probably go with one of the metal models. This one's good enough for me and, I suspect, most other people. Access to the iPad's regular buttons is slightly impeded, but it is not made impossible. The camera and microphone still function. The iPad is connected to the case in one of those mystical iPad ways that allows it to turn the iPad on when the case is opened and switches it off when it is closed. The only really annoying thing about the case is that every time you close it the iPad snaps in, which means that whenever you open it you have to force the bottom clip off. I don't know why it makes you do that.Overall I think this is the best case on the market. There are probably better keyboards out there, and I know there are better cases, but they aren't that much better and they don't do both as well as this one does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G38LJJ648ZKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJJ96DK#wasThisHelpful","R3G38LJJ648ZKG","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the best Tales games out there. I fell in love with Symphonia and Abyss returned my affections, but some of the recent games in the series have left me feeling cold (*cough* Xillia). Vesperia has taken almost everything I loved about Symphonia and improved on it.Let me just get this out of the way now. The biggest flaw with Vesperia is its story. A lot of Tales games have confusing stories but Vesperia takes the cake for being the most confusing on an hourly basis. In other Tales games you know what you're trying to achieve more or less from the beginning. In Symphonia you're trying to save the world from decay. In Abyss you're trying to stop the miasma. In both games the situation takes numerous complicated plot turns that completely alter the manner in which you're expected to succeed in your task or even what that task means, but on the whole the initial quest leads directly to the end quest. In Vesperia you have no idea what's going on until you near the end. At 30 hours in I still didn't know what was happening and I had no indication that the world was in danger at all. After every major event Yuri asks Estelle whether she wants to continue on her current quest (which changes repeatedly) or investigate some new incident. The party is constantly struggling to find a reason to stay together. There's not really the sense of unity that the other games had. This is all tied into the game's theme of growing up and deciding your own path, but it's a really bad idea from a storytelling standpoint.Now if that sounds bad, well, it kinda is. But it's not as frustrating as it might seem. This is largely because of the characters. Vesperia has assembled one of the best cast of characters I've seen in a video game. Yuri Lowell is the lead and he's a ball of laughs. Unlike other Tales protagonists he's not quite as kiddish (he's 21, an old man by Anime standards). I was very impressed with what they can do when they have a more mature character like this. When the game goes for the stereotypical Tales character reveals (gosh, is that obvious princess really a princess? No...) Yuri reveals he's known the entire time and just hasn't bothered to tell anyone. You can feel his self-satisfied smirk at watching the others in shock. His friend and foil is Flynn (an NPC unfortunately). He's the second part of the duo and is essential to the question that drives the game: is it better to work from within a crooked system to try and change it from the inside, or to oppose it directly knowing that it means not much will get done. Yuri takes the latter approach, Flynn the former. As you might imagine this leads to some conflict but also some really interesting exploration of the issue.The other characters are good too. Estelle is totally not a princess. Honest. Raven's the untrustworthy scoundrel type who's always whining about his old age (he's somewhere in his 30s the poor man). Karol is a kid who wants to overcome his fear of, well, everything, in order to become a guild leader and respected person. Rita's very angry and likes hitting people. Judith is... odd. Let's leave it at that. Repede is a dog. With a  pipe. Yeah, I don't get it either. These characters are fun to watch and we still get the great Tales cutscenes that reveal background details and conversations to expand on the plot and characterization.The mechanics of the game are basically the same as earlier ones. We still get an open world and enemies you can see approaching and sometimes avoid. Fighting is done in a fighter game format and real time. Your companions are computer controlled, although you can determine the tactics they should follow or override their commands. The graphics are much better than in Symphonia, while continuing the same cell shaded style. Instead of the big headed wide-eyed spheres of that game we get more realistic Anime figures.I don't think this game quite beats Symphonia, although it definitely has areas where the improvement is massive. The plot is to blame for this defect, but it's never bad enough to make the game anything but fun. You want to find out what happens to these characters, even if you don't necessarily want to see it told in this way. The cities are charming, the gameplay first rate, and the plot (when it finally shows up) decent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMXU2RIEWS41D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015HZLVA#wasThisHelpful","RMXU2RIEWS41D","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have decidedly mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it is a useful examination of exactly what changed equipment-wise during the late 2nd and mid-3rd century. On the other, it does not have the in depth look that would have made it a truly great resource. There are not enough pictures or examples to serve as a resource on Roman arms and armor (at best it constitutes a thorough outline) and the narrative coverage of the third century crisis is broad enough that it doesn't really satisfy.The section of the book that deals with actual weapons and weaponry (the main topic after all) is small. Only 66 (pages 49-115) out of 142 pages actually cover it, with the rest of the pages devoted to a narrative of the period. These pages are the best in the book, but they do little more than whet your whistle. The illustrations in this section are sparser than they should be, leaving the author simply describing the objects through text in a somewhat unclear manner. His central argument about the reasons for the change are good, but again seem like they could use further bringing out. As an introduction to the topic it works well.The narrative section is fairly unimpressive. The author suffers from the common tendency of those covering specialist topics (here a historical recreationist) to suck in every piece of information and combine it, even when it doesn't make sense. That's why you get sections like the one on Valerian's Persian campaign where he combines a defeat in battle (Zonaras and Shapur) with plague (Zosimus, Syncellus, Peter the Patrician) and capture during negotiations (Zosimus) despite the descriptions in these sources not lining up on other details. A lot of the sources for the 3rd century are extremely poor and cannot be relied on, particularly the Historia Augusta (a late 4th century forgery posing as a late 3rd set of Lives) which is frequently used in the book. In general, there is nothing in the narrative section that couldn't be found in other better books.The best part of this book is the photographs. The author is a reenactor and has numerous pictures of himself in reconstructed 3rd century Roman armor. When he mentions that he has tried to make certain pieces of equipment shown in ancient sculptures/descriptions work practically you know that he means it. I honestly wish that the entire book had focused a bit more on this aspect since this is what the author is an expert in. If he could have shown photographs or drawings of the way in which his reconstructed equipment worked and how he arrived at his conclusions then it could have gone a lot more in depth and I wouldn't have as many source complaints.This book isn't the worst introduction you could have to the topic. I'm clearly not in the target audience in that way so maybe it's difficult for me to judge its quality. But to me I just feel there are better books out there that outline some of these ideas in as good or better detail. Roman Military Equipment from the Punic Wars to the Fall of Rome offers an excellent look at Roman arms and armor. It covers a much wider period and therefore goes into less detail but it has more pictures and discussion. The Late Roman Army is a good look at the army in general (again, over a somewhat wider period but this time only about 200 years) and features much information on archaeological issues such as arms, armor, and equipment. For general overviews of the period you can't do much better than The Roman Empire at Bay, which is both in depth and readable. Other good narratives include The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine and Aurelian and the Third Century.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJIWYTE8WA1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781553343#wasThisHelpful","R3AJIWYTE8WA1D","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I had to describe this film in one word it would be perfunctory. Each scene is brief and uninvolving and the audience only endures them in hopes that the scenes being set up will prove better. Unfortunately that turns out not to be the case. This film isn't trying very hard and it has no real point to make or issues it wants to deal with. There's nothing unique here. The film has taken elements from the legend and earlier screen depictions and reformatted them without adding anything new. There is one exception: God. The God of Exodus is presented as a small and petulant boy. It's an intriguing idea, and one that would have potential if this was a completely different film. Making God a brat only works if you're taking a much harsher approach than this film is. If God is just a callous child then he should be crueler and more indifferent. Impulsive even, especially towards his chosen prophet. But that would require a different film. One that challenged the idea that God is just or that obedience to his command is righteous. In short, a film with passion.If I was permitted to use a second word it would be indifferent. This is nowhere more apparent than in the performances. It is in fact Ramses' entire character. He seems bored with everything and nothing really interests him at all. At first I thought this to be intentional, that Ramses was an uncharismatic and disinterested ruler who would eventually need to change to respond to challenges he could not anticipate, resulting in an unbending air of autocracy resulting from his inner weaknesses. But this soon proved not to be the case. While he does care for his son and displays some other such humanizing traits he can never quite shake the air of apathy. Even when charging at Moses beneath the crest of a fearsome tsunami he displays little emotion. It's a stunning indictment of Joel Edgerton's acting abilities. Not that Christian Bale does much better. His Moses manages to creak above indifference to become merely passionless. He clearly has some principles, but we're rarely allowed to see them and he rarely offers any justification or explanation. Other characters do display some emotion but to say that they're minor roles is an understatement. Only Moses (and to a much lesser extend Ramses) gets all the attention. Secondary characters, even those played by such wonderful actors as Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver, get only one or two lines in the entire film.My third choice of words would be anachronistic. And every aspect of this film is tainted with this to one degree or another. Where to even begin? For a start, Egyptians weren't white. Neither were Jews. When called on this Ridley Scott actually said that he didn't even try casting ethnic actors because the studios would never finance a film starring ""Mohammad So-and-So From Such-And-Such"". I think that sums up his approach right there. He's probably right about the need for name brand recognition (though I could point out several Arabic or at least Arab-looking actors who have carried films in the past, or the fact that biblical epics rely mainly on a religious audience who don't care so much about the actors and thus often have unknown casts) but that doesn't just sweep the problem under the rug. It's not just a question of using white actors in Middle Eastern roles, it's a question of where those actors are used. The upper classes of Egypt are the palest of the bunch while servants and social inferiors provide the touch of color. The worst example of this is in the battle of Kadesh at the very beginning. The Egyptian army (mainly white) faces off against the Hittites (varying shades of brown, with shaggy beards and primitive costumes). The Hittites came from Asia Minor and would have looked about the same as modern Turks do (ie. a mix of European and Middle Eastern features). Their army even included people from as far away as Greece, or at least the Greek colonies on the shores of western Asia Minor. In other words, the Hittites are us, or as close to us as anyone gets in this film. And yet they are portrayed as primitive native tribesmen, reinforcing the negative stereotype of superior white men versus barbaric brown peoples that has been entirely artificially placed in this film for no discernible reason.There are many other elements of inauthenticity as well. Egypt has never looked less Egyptian than it does here. Honestly, where did all those mountains come from? Egypt is mainly flat and only inhabitable along the Nile or the coast. The costumes are forced as well, looking more like modern garments with Egyptian touches than anything from the time. The inhabitants of these costumes speak in pseudo-modernese with no obvious effort made to match the time period. To hear Ramses speak lines like ""From an economic standpoint, what you suggest is problematic to say the least,"" feels painfully false, and equally so is the way they handle all aspects of life in the capital where every element of modern government seems present from military briefings (complete with maps) to near universal literacy and the concept of universal human equality. Non-ahistorical scenes feel forced as well. The reveal of Moses' parentage is unlikely and confusing at best, certainly not the life-changing moment it should be. Ramses' reasons for banishing Moses (or anything else he does really) seem utterly unmotivated. And why on earth would the two of them charge at each other when a tsunami is about to hit them? But worse than this is the fact that it never FEELS authentic. In fact it feels completely artificial. Unlike Gladiator or Kingdom of Heaven (or even Robin Hood, which suffered from the same problem) this isn't a lived in world. It's a stage for people to play on. And the fact that such an unrealistic world is being treated so mundanely really crushes it. A movie can get away with a lot of factual errors, but not when it doesn't feel like it's coming from a real place.If forced to pick another word I would choose pretty. See? If you keep picking words to describe a generally crummy film eventually you hit on a good element. Almost all films have something to recommend them. Even this isn't that much however. I could have chosen beautiful, and it's never that. But some of the shots were very well chosen and the effects well incorporated. Some of the plagues in particular are wonderfully realized. If it weren't for Scott going a little overboard on the color palette these scenes would be stunning. The CGI is impressive and manages to provide us with some quite cool moments indeed from a boat crew devoured by angry crocodiles to an army caught in an avalanche to the final tsunami, these moments all work impressively well. The ability to do pretty is even carried out so well it can be a detriment to the film. The final scenes of Moses and Ramses charging under the tsunami look gorgeous, but make no sense at all since they would certainly die. The fact that they do not lessens the entire point of the scene (that the tsunami is wiping out Ramses' army) and turns it from cool into a massive and worthless gimmick. Scott still has a flair for the dramatic, but without the material to back it up none of it can take root.If I had to chose a final word to wrap up this film it would be tired. Scott must have felt some passion for the project at one point (unless he simply wanted to cross biblical epic off his list of genres), but whatever he may have felt at one point was gone by the time it came to filming. There is no love here. No passion. There was undoubtedly effort, but all the effort in the world can't make up for a lack of inspiration.Another word: Recommendations. Since I'm complaining so much about this one it seems like I should provide some sort of reference to the films that succeed better. There are a lot of good biblical epics out there, most of which leave this one in the dust. The most recent and interesting one is Noah. Now there's a film that did exactly what this one tried to do: present a semi-rationalized look at Biblical events which treats religion as reality instead of stage drama and God's will as a questionable motivator. The Moses story is a more popular one among biblical epics and it has been told many times. The most famous one is The Ten Commandments, where we're treated to a cast of thousands and all the self-righteous posturing you could want. It's pretty good and pretty much the benchmark for Biblical epics. Moses is a miniseries starring Ben Kingsley (also in this film) and is really quite good for a more limited budget. The Prince of Egypt is a wonderful cartoon that captures this story in a slightly less serious (and more musical) manner. It's really a lot better than it has a right to be. I attribute this to the fact that the story is just so darn good and open for embellishment. It's rather hard to screw it up this bad.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TGXHVMFDQ76P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QWUJMV0#wasThisHelpful","R1TGXHVMFDQ76P","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Popular histories are often looked down on by professional scholars. Which is unfair really. Popular histories may lack the vetting of the peer review process but many of them provide a perfectly reliable view of events. Good popular histories offer accommodating prose and a cushioning of major debates in order to draw in new readers.This is not one of those books.Uncountable inaccuracies spring up from the very beginning. The account of the battle of Megiddo matches up with the real battle in only the broadest strokes, and is filled with tedious rhetoric. The book is clearly intended to be read like a novel and follows that path clearly, even to the extent of including imaginary dialogue between participants. That's right, he makes up entire speeches. And the worst part is he isn't even explicit about when he's doing so.The bronze age clearly bores him since we quickly move on to Greek and Roman times. In under fifty pages we've covered a thousand years. Why even bother covering Megiddo, honestly?  He's clearly more interested in the classical era. It's much better documented and more familiar to most of his audience. Which is why it's surprising to see him continue to get everything wrong. From describing the Spartan warriors as bearing 13 foot Macedonian sarissas at Thermopylae to describing legions as composing 5,000 hoplites, 4,000 velites, and 800 cavalry, there seems to be no fact so basic he cannot screw it up.His understanding of the battles themselves is no better as they are heavy on hyperbole and ""character"" and weak on facts. Interpretations are taken from better authors and rewritten. Those interpretations he creates himself are wrong. For example, did you know that Hannibal won his battles by inventing the commando unit? Or that the Persians could have defeated the Greek navy at Salamis if only they had lured them out to sea where their triremes would have been destroyed by the high winds?The most painful part for me is his depiction of late Rome, one of my favorite periods. Many authors get this time wrong but his is genuinely the worst I've ever read. According to him Rome was still the center of the Empire, barbarian auxilaries replaced Roman legions, Rome was run by barbarian soldiers (whose compatriots invaded and destroyed Rome anyway), millions of Visigoths invaded Rome, the size of the army shrank, Constantine had all the citizens of Rome baptized, Valentinian was killed by the Goths, Valens was captured alive, Stilicho was killed at Honorius' banquet, and Alaric burned Rome to the ground as part of a carefully orchestrated Gothic policy. It's just awful gibberish.So much of his material is confusingly wrong. I can understand an incompetent researcher using Shakespeare as a historical source (which he does), but some of this is truly confounding. Why does he think the Emperor Titus was murdered? Nobody says that. Or that Frankish soldiers ""liberating"" Gaul were treated as saviors? Or that Augustus' death resulted in civil war (confusingly called the war of the diadochi, which as he notes was fought for control of ALEXANDER's empire). Or that the Jews invaded Asia Minor? Or that legions were usually encamped without their generals for security reasons? Or that Philip of Macedon was not an empire builder? Or that helot was the word for Greek light infantry? Or that Greek triremes typically charged into battles using sail power? Or, most absurdly of all, that Asoka ruled from 293 to 36 BC? That last one is presumably a typo, but the fact that it was just left in there is a depressingly accurate sign of how little effort went into this book.The welcoming prose isn't that great either. Just to include a random sample:""Most of the augusti were possessed of an empty idea of self-worth. All were spoiled by wealth and power, posturing as emperors, but once confronted with reality their faade collapsed and they saw no way to stop the headlong descent into disaster. Then they fell on their knees to beg, 'Help me!' And those being addressed would look at them ironically, and then do nothing, whether for the Emperor or his empire."" This is neither the best nor the worst prose in the book and is depressingly typical.This is one of those books where reading it will actually make you know less than you did at the outset. Not only will you not learn anything of value but you'll have to actively unlearn all the mistruths presented here. A real waste of a book.Having thoroughly blasted this book it seems like I ought to mention some general histories that cover a similar period in a more reliable way. I found The Birth of Classical Europe: A History from Troy to Augustine a generally reliable guide. Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian was also good.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13AK5CUCQSJ07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0340821779#wasThisHelpful","R13AK5CUCQSJ07","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not going to say the Tales series is necessarily predictable, but when you put one of these games in you know pretty much what you're getting. The characters will be variations on classic Anime tropes as you navigate your teenage protagonist through a series of battles based on a combination of button mashing and tactics. In terms of design and style they all follow a pretty tight formula. The main variations come from the plots, which (while they always share features like multiple worlds and a powerful church) are all unique and clever with a lot of enjoyable world-building.Since the elements that make up a Tales game are so standard there are really only two major questions that need to be answered about this game: how good is the story and how well does the game adapt itself to the portable system? As to the latter the answer is pretty well. The graphics on the Vita are very good and the game doesn't look substantially worse than Tales of Xilia on the PS3. The fact that this was ported from a DS game makes it even more impressive since there is little evidence of the compromises that must have been made for that system apart from slightly smaller level designs than normal.As to the story, without giving too much away it's a decent one. You play a teenage boy (of course) called Kor Meteor who has accidentally scattered the emotions of a girl (the eponymous Kohaku Hearts) while trying to save her from an evil witch. Kor is fun in his innocent easily pushed around way, while Kohaku gets to slowly recover her personality. To help repair your mistake you travel with her and her comically overprotective brother as you hunt for the pieces of her soul. As you might expect complications ensue. The characters are entertaining and the plot diverting. Like all Tales games there are short character skits that appear occasionally where you get to see the characters interact with each other outside of the normal exposition moments. These are often funny or character building so they help flesh out the story a lot.Gameplay is basically identical to other Tales games. The levels consist of a series of towns and paths which you access by traversing a world map. It's nice to see the world map back again after its absence in Xilia. It really does make the world feel larger. Leveling up is done via your Soma, a wrist device kind that works kind of like EX Gems. This process is refreshingly simple and effective. In battle the gameplay switches to a combat mode based off fighting games more than your average JRPG where you have to attack your enemies manually while your party follows the guidelines you set. Sometimes it's complicated, usually it's simple. One unfortunate change in this game is that you can no longer see the enemies approaching. Instead we get a random battle situation similar to Final Fantasy.If you enjoyed this game you might also want to check out Tales of the Abyss, the other portable Tales game. That one is a direct port from a PS2 title so it didn't need to make any of the compromises that this game did. On bigger consoles there's always Tales of Symphonia (the best of the bunch) and the newer titles Tales of Graces and Tales of Xillia. All of these games are pretty good, although it wouldn't kill them to put a bit more variety into character designs and gameplay elements.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RER9ZOHZ5SET7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N46SH98#wasThisHelpful","RER9ZOHZ5SET7","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To begin with I'd just like to say that the LOTR score is one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. The Hobbit series has generally been of similar quality, even if it doesn't always have the thematic richness of the first trilogy. That latter reason is why this album could never top ROTK, though it could certainly have wrapped up the Hobbit trilogy the same LOTR was. It doesn't quite achieve that for reasons that will be obvious as the review continues.The album starts off on a triumphant note. Fire and Water is a strong track continuing on directly from where the last film left off. Some might point out how that just shows how unnecessary a cliffhanger the ending of the last film was but that's an issue for the filmmakers and not the composer. As a track this captures the mood perfectly, although I'm slightly surprised at both how short and channeled the track is. I expected to feel the fiery terror swooping in from the sky, like I did with My Dear Frodo in An Unexpected Journey. This is more of a swan song to the glory that was Smaug's theme with elements of the heroic Bard theme thrown in. Bard's theme is actually fully on display here in a way that it hasn't been before and it sounds great. It isn't one of those grand display pieces like the Fellowship theme, but it has a certain quiet heroism that pops out along with a very angelic chorus at what I can only assume is the moment of Smaug's demise.From this point on it's like listening to a different album. Smaug is dead. His theme is no more. And just as in the previous album, without Smaug the soundtrack has no real focus. The next couple tracks are nice if unmemorable, dealing with the aftermath of Smaug. The score seems a bit more focused with Guardians of the Three where we hear the Rivendell theme appear in a somewhat heroic way that it wasn't designed for (but I really like) and then the Ruins of Dale where we get to hear Bard's theme again and bits of the Shire theme appearing in a subdued fashion. We also see hints of a new theme here, a harsh and militaristic one. Unfortunately the theme never really gets developed to any great extent and it remains its clearest here. The Gathering of the Clouds is more of the same, a little more heroic but still quite subdued except when it's being ominous.The final non-war track for a long while is Mithril. This is a very nice exploration and variation of what I guess is the mithril armor theme (I always associated it more with Bilbo when it showed up in FOTR). This is followed up by a very fitting version of the gold theme with hints of Smaug. It's harsh and unpleasant and absolutely perfect. One of my problems with the previous album was the absence of any unifying Company theme like they had in Misty Mountains Cold. Upon listening to this album I realized that the aggressively rousing theme at the end of DoS was actually the Company's theme. It works well here (especially when juxtaposed with Bard's theme) although I still prefer Misty Mountains for its sense of adventure.As far as heroic themes go I really like Bard's theme and wish that we could hear it belted out triumphantly in all its glory more. As the score continues his somewhat lighthearted and cheerful theme transitions into an organized military beat. This theme is the only one that really seems to get the development it deserves. When I thought about this album I assumed that the battle would feature a lot of previous themes blending together in clever ways. Instead, they play one right after the other in a slightly jarring fashion, and even these appearances aren't that common. It's odd, we have five armies here, and five established leitmotifs. You'd think we'd hear more of them apart from the moment of their character/people's introduction.And here we get to the battle music. It's nothing that great I'm afraid. Just generic action music. Actually, all the middle tracks are fairly bleh as far as I'm concerned. They're designed to not intrude on the story. There is one exception and it's probably my favorite track on the album. Sons of Durin is a really great track that brings the Company's theme in for a triumphant entrance. It's extremely aggressive and played on drums with lots of chanting. Wonderful. But then we're back to generic music again until we come to To the Death, where Shore tries something different. He's been giving brief hints in previous tracks of a theme that sounds like a sort of drumming heartbeat but it really comes out strong here. This is presumably the big tear-jerking finale so he pulls out all the stops. It hits its climax with a nice rendition of the theme they use for the Ents and certain other creatures which should play nicely with the battle's ending.After this the album calms down again and we get some nice quiet reflective pieces. The Return Journey has little new or exciting about it but it is fittingly sedate and feels like it's tidying up after the big battle. It's too late to be introducing new themes anyway so that's fine. There and Back Again is similar although it has a surprisingly dark variation of the heroic theme included for reasons I'll likely be more clear on once I've seen the movie. It ends us on a nostalgic note as we get the Hobbit theme and the Shire theme and the Ring theme all jumbled together to remind us what's coming up next for those carefree hobbitses.Unlike the, lets call it ill-fitting, I See Fire at the end of DoS, The Last Goodbye is a perfectly matching piece that is well suited to conclude this trilogy. Sung by Billy Boyd (Pippen from LOTR) as a sort of mournful lament it manages to end the series on a reflective and nostalgic note. Not nearly as depressing as ""Into the West"" it feels both sufficiently sorrowful and suitably like it's promising a well-deserved rest. This song works exceptionally well as either a wrap up to the entire series or a bridge between the Hobbit and LOTR. One of the things I really like about the songs in these movies is that the LOTR endings were all sung by female artists, thus catching a more atmospheric and thoughtful tone, while the Hobbit films are all masculine, capturing the more guys' own adventure that they're undertaking. It works very well indeed.I think this is the first time I've been genuinely disappointed in one of Howard Shore's Middle-Earth compositions. It's not a bad album by any means but it provides little that is new either. It's largely a rehash of earlier themes dominated by a massive battle that seems to rely surprisingly little on the score for establishing the mood. Part of this is going to be the nature of the film. A film score has to do what's best for the movie, even if that comes at the expense of the music itself. This one was always going to be dominated by battles, but apart from what sounds like the introduction of the major players the music is surprisingly unforceful. Maybe Jackson was afraid that the constant trumpeting of war music would wear out the audience. Maybe he was right. But either way it leaves us with a somewhat neutered score. Certainly it's not the triumphant finale it could have been.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC2KJUGFOZ1PR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJF2UJG#wasThisHelpful","RC2KJUGFOZ1PR","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This game is not a regular Persona game for the 3DS. That has to be put out there before continuing. There is no social gaming, no year-long adventure, no exploring outside the dungeons (labyrinth), no nothing. It's a very bare bones experience. Instead, what you do have is a whole lot of dungeon crawling and fan service (err, not that kind). This isn't lethal to the whole experience and if you go in with your expectations tempered in advance then you'll find yourself having a fun time re-entering the world of Persona 3 & Persona 4 and enjoying the character interactions that were the best thing about those games.The gameplay in this game owes little to Persona and everything to Etrian Odyssey. Those games feature a similar dungeon system, the same basic controls, and the same lack of options. They're also by Atlus, so it's not that surprising that they would copy their own system for this game. The way the dungeons work is this: you walk around in first person mode moving one square at a time using the directional button. The analog stick only allows you to look from side to side. After a certain amount of moving you will be attacked (you generally have warning when this is about to happen) and the game switches to a combat system not that dissimilar to the regular Persona one except that you have to manage which players are in the back row and which are in the front.There are also big monsters (F.O.E.s, short for the atrociously ungrammatical fusis oikein eidolon, or creature to live in ghost. Yikes) who you  should really avoid wandering around. These show up on your screen. They only move when you do and they follow set patterns that you can figure out pretty easily, so avoiding them is usually not that tough. The really unique feature of this system is that you are not provided with a map but have to create your own as you go along. This does increase the difficulty of your exploration but it also provides you with a certain satisfaction from actually completing it. Outside of combat there's little to do. The main screen in Yasogami High only has a text menu of options for things like buying new items, healing, or saving the game. The majority of your time will be spent in the labyrinth.Is this system a perfect fit for Persona? No. I don't think they'd have lost anything by giving you the option to run around your school outside of combat and interact with the various zombies outside. It would have given the world a slightly less limited feeling while not requiring a large amount of storage room or effort. But in general I think the gameplay works well for what it's trying to do. At the least it isn't jarringly distracting.The big thrill here of course is playing with these characters again, and that's where the real fun in Persona Q comes in. The characters are back and they're as well done as ever. All the voice actors have returned and bring their customary liveliness to the roles. Sure, you can't talk to them in private like you could in the main games, but they do have frequent conversations throughout your adventure. They have also been given a design overhaul to better match Etrian Odyssey, which doesn't take long to get used to but can feel a little weird. They look a bit chibi. Plot and characterization has not been the strength of the Etrian Odyssey series. Until the last one (Millennium Girl) they didn't even bother with them. That's why I never had much time for them.

"This game is not a regular Persona game for the 3DS. That has to be put out there before continuing. There is no social gaming, no year-long adventure, no exploring outside the dungeons (labyrinth), no nothing. It's a very bare bones experience. Instead, what you do have is a whole lot of dungeon crawling and fan service (err, not that kind). This isn't lethal to the whole experience and if you go in with your expectations tempered in advance then you'll find yourself having a fun time re-entering the world of Persona 3 & Persona 4 and enjoying the character interactions that were the best thing about those games.The gameplay in this game owes little to Persona and everything to Etrian Odyssey. Those games feature a similar dungeon system, the same basic controls, and the same lack of options. They're also by Atlus, so it's not that surprising that they would copy their own system for this game. The way the dungeons work is this: you walk around in first person mode moving one square at a time using the directional button. The analog stick only allows you to look from side to side. After a certain amount of moving you will be attacked (you generally have warning when this is about to happen) and the game switches to a combat system not that dissimilar to the regular Persona one except that you have to manage which players are in the back row and which are in the front.There are also big monsters (F.O.E.s, short for the atrociously ungrammatical fusis oikein eidolon, or creature to live in ghost. Yikes) who you  should really avoid wandering around. These show up on your screen. They only move when you do and they follow set patterns that you can figure out pretty easily, so avoiding them is usually not that tough. The really unique feature of this system is that you are not provided with a map but have to create your own as you go along. This does increase the difficulty of your exploration but it also provides you with a certain satisfaction from actually completing it. Outside of combat there's little to do. The main screen in Yasogami High only has a text menu of options for things like buying new items, healing, or saving the game. The majority of your time will be spent in the labyrinth.Is this system a perfect fit for Persona? No. I don't think they'd have lost anything by giving you the option to run around your school outside of combat and interact with the various zombies outside. It would have given the world a slightly less limited feeling while not requiring a large amount of storage room or effort. But in general I think the gameplay works well for what it's trying to do. At the least it isn't jarringly distracting.The big thrill here of course is playing with these characters again, and that's where the real fun in Persona Q comes in. The characters are back and they're as well done as ever. All the voice actors have returned and bring their customary liveliness to the roles. Sure, you can't talk to them in private like you could in the main games, but they do have frequent conversations throughout your adventure. They have also been given a design overhaul to better match Etrian Odyssey, which doesn't take long to get used to but can feel a little weird. They look a bit chibi. Plot and characterization has not been the strength of the Etrian Odyssey series. Until the last one (Millennium Girl) they didn't even bother with them. That's why I never had much time for them. But the addition works really well here and makes the game feel more like Persona.The really impressive thing here is how they've managed to incorporate two separate stories in the same game.

"This game is the Japanese version, but there is an English version out there. Gamestop has the exclusive for this one so it is only available at that store or (more expensively) through third-party resellers here. You can also find the English version on the UK site, and for the prices the resellers are charging you might actually be better off ordering it from there.I'm not going to say the Tales series is necessarily predictable, but when you put one of these games in you know pretty much what you're getting. The characters will be variations on classic Anime tropes as you navigate your teenage protagonist through a series of battles based on a combination of button mashing and tactics. In terms of design and style they all follow a pretty tight formula. The main variations come from the plots, which (while they always share features like multiple worlds and a powerful church) are all unique and clever with a lot of enjoyable world-building.Since the elements that make up a Tales game are so standard there are really only two major questions that need to be answered about this game: how good is the story and how well does the game adapt itself to the portable system? As to the latter the answer is pretty well. The graphics on the Vita are very good and the game doesn't look substantially worse than Tales of Xilia on the PS3. The fact that this was ported from a DS game makes it even more impressive since there is little evidence of the compromises that must have been made for that system apart from slightly smaller level designs than normal.As to the story, without giving too much away it's a decent one. You play a teenage boy (of course) called Kor Meteor who has accidentally scattered the emotions of a girl (the eponymous Kohaku Hearts) while trying to save her from an evil witch. Kor is fun in his innocent easily pushed around way, while Kohaku gets to slowly recover her personality. To help repair your mistake you travel with her and her comically overprotective brother as you hunt for the pieces of her soul. As you might expect complications ensue. The characters are entertaining and the plot diverting. Like all Tales games there are short character skits that appear occasionally where you get to see the characters interact with each other outside of the normal exposition moments. These are often funny or character building so they help flesh out the story a lot.Gameplay is basically identical to other Tales games. The levels consist of a series of towns and paths which you access by traversing a world map. It's nice to see the world map back again after its absence in Xilia. It really does make the world feel larger. Leveling up is done via your Soma, a wrist device kind that works kind of like EX Gems. This process is refreshingly simple and effective. In battle the gameplay switches to a combat mode based off fighting games more than your average JRPG where you have to attack your enemies manually while your party follows the guidelines you set. Sometimes it's complicated, usually it's simple. One unfortunate change in this game is that you can no longer see the enemies approaching. Instead we get a random battle situation similar to Final Fantasy.If you enjoyed this game you might also want to check out Tales of the Abyss, the other portable Tales game. That one is a direct port from a PS2 title so it didn't need to make any of the compromises that this game did. On bigger consoles there's always Tales of Symphonia (the best of the bunch) and the newer titles Tales of Graces and Tales of Xillia. All of these games are pretty good, although it wouldn't kill them to put a bit more variety into character designs and gameplay elements.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M759ELXZM274/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQACETI#wasThisHelpful","R1M759ELXZM274","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been watching this film for a while and before I begin I should explain something of its troubled history since this really explains why we get the film we're seeing. This film seems to be a work of passion by first-time screenwriter/producer/director Michael Redwood who set out to tell the positive Christian story of Saint Katherine of Alexandria in response to Agora's presentation of the philosopher Hypatia, which presented a rather negative view of the early Christian Roman Empire. The movie was filmed in 2011 using funds raised from private investors through somewhat shifty executive producers who seem to have been dishonest from the start about the returns expected from the film. This dishonest behavior led to a series of financial difficulties after filming was completed, to the point where the film was held in limbo until it repaid its loans. It seemed for years that the film would never be released. Only when Peter O'Toole, whose appearance in the film amounts to little more than a cameo, died did the producers manage to get the finances cleared since they could now bill it as his last starring role. Now the press for the film is filled with touching stories about how O'Toole was desperate to see the film but they only finished the final cut 48 hours too late. No mention of the fact that it took them three years to do it. Calculating quite carefully that O'Toole's name wouldn't help them sell the film to a religious crowd they cynically renamed the film Decline of an Empire, stuck O'Toole's face in the leading role of the cover, and removed all references to Katherine or Christianity in general. From the back cover this is described as the story of Constantine's rise to power as he searches for his missing childhood friend. And now several new accounts have been opened on Amazon propping up immensely positive reviews for the film. The producers are again shamelessly pushing their film in whatever way they feel will earn them the most money.I can't really hold any of this against the finished film. I don't know how involved the writer/producer/director was involved in these practices and it certainly wouldn't be the first time that higher ups gutted a promising film to make one that better fit their limited conceptions of what a film should be. But either way it's something that prospective buyers should know. A film stands or falls on its success at telling a story. Unfortunately, the film fails there as well. And in many other areas as well.PlotThe story here is a muddled mess. It jumps back and forth between Britannia and Egypt with little concern for consistent stories in either. Constantine is fighting Amazon women on Hadrian's Wall but he feels dissatisfied and searches for his childhood friend Katherine. Somehow the Britons are tied in with Katherine and worship the same god she does, right down to her symbol of the spiked wheel. Katherine meanwhile never seems to leave Alexandria in Egypt on the opposite side of the empire. The connection is never explained, nor can it be. Katherine is mostly a non-entity in what was originally conceived of as her own film. People talk about her, or more commonly they talk about her writings which are apparently brilliant but are never described or detailed. She's a prisoner in Maxentius' fortress because she's the most amazing person ever, but never do they establish anything she does that makes her amazing. So she wanders (mostly silently) through the hallways as people we don't really know with motives they never explain plot confusing schemes around her. Her story ends unexpectedly about twenty minutes before Constantine's which gives them room for an epic battle. Just kidding. The combined armies of the two emperors of the Roman empire consist of five men.There are a lot of things that happen for no real reason. This is presumably largely due to botched editing and not the script, but that can't excuse all of it. How for example is Constantine connected to Katherine? This is the most important element in the story and it is basically ignored. Most of the dialogue (particularly in the Alexandrian scenes) are intoned dramatically as if fraught with meaning but they are generally nonsensical. Some samples below:""She speaks languages. I want to know why.""""Where were the gods in our last battle?""""Rome defeated Hannibal's armies with help from the gods.""""Hannibal was an old man. Seventy by the time we caught him, and that cost how many thousands? Don't quote history. It doesn't fit your mouth.""Lines such as these are met with thunderous applause or exaggerated emotion. The big speech in which Katherine is meant to defeat the assembled nobles rhetorically is rambling and vague and repeated with no passion or fire. I can sum up the argument as follows: you're wrong because you're a bunch of stupidheads. I've seen more convincing arguments in video blogs dedicated to proving One Direction is the greatest band ever. At least they have passion when they talk.In short, the script is rambling, unfocused, and vague, relying on cliches and silly dialogue to convey emotions it doesn't understand how to express. This is basically because the film isn't sure what it wants to be. Despite its subject matter it isn't really a religious film since it never outlines any articles of faith apart from a belief in God. What little religious content there is here is neutered to the point of total blandness. It even ends on the utterly colorless dedication ""For those who suffer at the hands of others."" On the other hand Constantine's story is neither an adventure to rescue a lost friend (since he never really looks for her) nor a political drama about his succession and opposition to Maxentius. Things just happen.HistoryThis film bears no relation to any kind of history. Constantine's career has no resemblance to his actual life. The Constantine here is a young low-ranking officer risen from the ranks serving under Constantius (who is not a relative of any sort), who grew up in or near Alexandria where he developed an intense and inexplicable attachment to a young girl (for no defined reason), who served in a series of disastrous campaigns until he was able to secure peace with the Amazons (seriously wtf?) raiding south of the wall by treating them with respect at which point Constantius declared he wanted him to become emperor (for no defined reason); who then personally assassinated Maxentius when the latter's army failed to appear for battle (for no defined reason), and immediately rushed to Alexandria to find Katherine. The real Constantine was the son of Constantius, who served mainly with Galerius in the east before returning to his father a few months before he died; who grew up in Illyria and the imperial court where his main companions were his future opponents, who fought only briefly in his father's entirely successful British campaigns fought north (not south) of the wall until Constantius died, after which Constantine had himself declared emperor and remained in Britain and Northern Europe for six years until he was able to invade Italy and defeat Maxentius (who was only one of four emperors at the time) after which he stayed in the west securing his empire never venturing east until after he defeated Licinius in 324, 18 years after he became emperor. Clearly he was in a rush to find her. He's not even connected to Katherine in the stories anyway. It's impressive that they managed to tell his story in a way that got not a single fact right.More surprisingly for a Christian film the presentation of Katherine is completely off as well. It includes none of the elements that were recorded in the Saints' Lives and even changes the most unique aspect of her legend: her martyrdom by beheading after the giant spiked wheel she was due to be killed on broke at her touch. Instead she's turned into a Jesus substitute, right down to the crown of thorns. Theologically, the entire film amounts to nothing deeper than multiple gods are dumb. It has difficulty achieving even this point since it doesn't even ridicule them so much as take for granted that they are ridiculous. You don't even find out Katherine's a monotheist until halfway through the film and the explicitly Christian connection isn't made until the last twenty minutes. When it does become explicitly Christian it verges on being blasphemous since Katherine has been receiving full credit for these teachings with no hint that she might represent a wider religion.A few other ""minor"" inaccuracies:The Egyptians were not Arabs and therefore could not be forbidden from positions of influence because of that. Furthermore the Arabs were perfectly capable of rising to high office, and there had even been one on the imperial throne about seventy years before this. Maxentius wasn't in Alexandria but Rome, making the entire East/West divide nonsensical. The battle of the Milvian Bridge involved more than two people and wasn't fought under a little footbridge over a ditch. Two people fighting isn't even a battle.ActingEdward Fox is fairly entertaining to watch. He has screen presence, but he simply repeats every line in the script in exactly the same classy monotone. The rest of the cast varies between dreadful and barely passable. Peter O'Toole's performance in a very minor role (he really only has one scene though he's visible in several) is completely unmemorable. It would probably be better if he had been given real lines, but he mostly reacts to lines that make no sense. I can't tell if he's overacting or reacting to a completely different scene that had actual depth. Constantine has no real charisma and seems to just walk through his role. The girl playing Katherine is completely flat and displays no semblance of life or emotion. In fact, she rarely speaks despite this being Katherine's main distinguishing characteristic. The guy playing Maxentius is entertaining in his exaggerated craziness, although he isn't really given any screen time. Everyone here knows they hit a stinker and they don't bother with more than minimal effort.CinematographyMainly this film is a series of close ups with long and unmoving shots. Sometimes the camera lingers on one actor in a conversation for minutes at a time, even as other characters are deep in their monologues. Battlescenes are small-scale and cheap looking. I know this was a low budget production but since the battlescenes were unnecessary to begin with I don't feel bad criticizing them for their flatness and lifeless nature.Honestly, I went in expecting to see a trainwreck of a movie and that's what I found. But even I was impressed at how badly it all worked out. While it could easily have been a better film with a different edit it is quite obvious from what survives that it was never going to be a good film. It doesn't even have it within itself to be a decent film. It fails utterly as a historical film, a religious film, and a film in general. It is astounding what an absolute wreck this film is. It has to be seen to be believed, and that's as close to a recommendation as I can give.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KNIRVR2W5TY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KH57UUG#wasThisHelpful","R2KNIRVR2W5TY5","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off the novel Johnny Tremain is both one of the greatest children stories and one of the greatest revolutionary war novels ever written. Published during the Second World War it has never gone out of print since and rightly so. As source material it is perfectly suited to be given a movie adaption. And when the movie sticks to following the book it is rather entertaining in a 1950s Disney sort of way.The first half hour is close enough to the book to entertain the fans. The character of Johnny has been changed from arrogant and cocky to pure and innocent in the best tradition of Disney films which can hardly come as a surprise but to expect anything else out of a kid's movie is to be let down. The second half hour loses the mood but keeps near the plot. The Boston Tea Party is entertaining although the singing after it is unforgivably Disney. But by the last half hour the book is thrown to the winds as we see the war first hand. Something about seeing laughing children dancing around the countryside as they shot at redcoats struck me as kind of disturbing for a Disney film. Obviously war was a great adventure that people could enjoy in a typical '50s fashion where nobody but the bad guys got hurt and everyone could share a nice drink afterward. Oh, and somebody who is supposed to die, whose death gives the entire book meaning, doesn't. That would be too dark for a Disney film.Now if I thought that any of those additions were beneficial to the movie I couldn't really complain, but none of them worked. The first battle was alright but the psychotic murder kids having fun killing redcoats was just awful. The producers probably couldn't see why this might be considered 'creepy'. The acting from the lead is awful and he doesn't seem to have been in anything else afterward. The guy playing Rab seemed to bring a little of the distant charm described in the book but the script doesn't give him more than one or two moments. Walter Sande as Paul Revere was good as were a few of the founding fathers but nothing to write home about.On the plus side the sets are marvelous. I've never seen colonial Boston come to life so well since (even the excellent John Adams miniseries didn't really feel as lived in due to a slightly greater distance from its characters), largely due to an absence of Revolutionary War films. The Battle of Lexington is moderately well done rather obviously leaving open the question of who fired first. And the first half hour entertains. So in conclusion: good book, good sets, bad everything else. Remake anyone?","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TZ2GOEOEJHPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JM6F#wasThisHelpful","R2TZ2GOEOEJHPB","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This wasn't a great film. Clearly it was trying to be, but somewhere along the way they forgot to figure out what they were trying to say. Is it an anti-war film? Is it pro-war? Is it about man's inhumanity to man? Is it just supposed to be good fun? Having the answer to all that be ambiguous might make it seem like this film is taking a more realistic approach but it doesn't feel realistic, just lazy. I honestly don't think they ever thought about what kind of message they were trying to convey. And that's why despite having a few decent battle scenes and an interesting setting it never really seems to catch your attention.The plot of the film is pretty basic. The Aussie light horse is in Palestine fighting the Turks. Sooner or later there's going to be a major cavalry charge, but there's no real anticipation for it. Most of the film is the soldiers dealing with each other, engaging in minor skirmishes, and other stereotypical soldier stuff. There's also the painfully stereotypical nurse love interest, who falls for the hero instantly despite not knowing him and having hundreds of other soldiers to choose from. Most of the rest of the incidents, while generic war film tropes, work significantly better. There's a soldier who isn't able to kill people who's crisis is generally handled well. The new guy introduced into the tried and tested unit is another. The film is taken up with these and there are more hits than misses in this regard. The big battle at the end of the film is the battle of Beersheba, the last successful cavalry charge. A subject like this seems perfect for a gung-ho war film about the high point of the ANZAC cavalry forces to counter the anti-war approach of Gallipoli, but as I said before the film never really settles on what it wants to say.One nice thing about it is the relatively low amount of Pommy-bashing. There is a bit of conflict with the obligatory stiff-necked and humorless British officer, but they also feature a scene where the British soldiers cheer the Aussies on to the embarrassment of the men who are looking for a fight. Furthermore my favorite character in the film is a British intelligence officer. He's every bit the cold and aloof officer you'd expect, but he's smarter than the rest and actually plays up the Aussie perceptions of him to good effect in one hilarious scene. The rest of the characters are somewhat hard to distinguish so this man stands out the more.A few more minor problems with this film: the scenery which is supposed to be in Israel is really obviously southern Australia. All deserts do not look alike, and Beersheba isn't nearly as deserty looking as they seem to think. The other minor problem that occasionally becomes a major problem is the choice of how to portray the enemy. Both the Turks and the Germans speak perfect English. Since this is World War I and the uniforms aren't as distinctive or imprinted in common memory this occasionally makes it difficult to tell which guys are the good guys. Especially when they're not facing the camera. They don't have many scenes, but that just makes it harder to tell when the film has switched focus to the villains. Also, the final charge goes on forever. I was reminded of Monty Python and the Holy Grail when Lancelot keeps running up the hill never getting closer.Overall not a bad film. I know I've gone on about the negative points, but that's just because they are the most notable things about this movie and some of them would be so easy to fix. Most of the film is decent enough. Certainly it's worth watching if you're interested in the time or just like war films or Aussie movies in general. I certainly can't think of another film that spends so long with the cavalry. Just don't go in expecting a masterpiece.Available as a better DVD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27QJWQ0LRFAO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000F4O7#wasThisHelpful","R27QJWQ0LRFAO2","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Just don't go in expecting a masterpiece.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PDUG0QYQ2NV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CJ2E5I#wasThisHelpful","R2PDUG0QYQ2NV7","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was a lot more effort put into this film than I had anticipated. Paul W.S. Anderson tries his hardest to give us a full old-school historical epic complete with stylish cinematography and some inventive camera angles. Unfortunately, the material he chooses to invent would have given the cheesiest of '50s epics pause. A young gladiator's family was killed by an evil Roman senator and now he seeks revenge. A young noblewoman falls in love with him but she is forcibly engaged to the same evil and lustful senator, who wants her only because she has refused him. About the only thing missing to make this identical to the worst of the melodramatic 19th century melodrama that it seems to be imitating is the tragic tale of persecuted Christians. It certainly has the tiresome wholesomeness that you can only find in '50s epic or Christian made-for-TV movies.This outdated content mixes poorly with the modern style with which the story is told. So at the climax of the terrible love story where you might expect a low end gladiatorial revolt or heroic rescue we get instead a remake of the scenes from Gladiator. Instead of a final showdown with the villain featuring fancy swordplay we get a chariot race through the center of town. Cliches like the villain kidnapping the heroine are reduced to even greater absurdity when they're combined with such destructive imagery, since now his narcissism seems nonsensical given that he is willing to die just to ensure his petty grudge does not get lost. And a character like Milo, who is basically the same revenge-driven angry man as Maximus from Gladiator, seems completely out of place as the self-righteous 50s patronizing heroic type. Seriously, when you can say that The Last Days of Pompeii felt more real then you know you're in a bad place.The film is aiming to capture at least three different things simultaneously: bad 19th century pulp romance, modern mindless action movie excess, and general realism. It might be a surprise to see that last one thrown in there since it merges so poorly with the other two, but there are numerous behind-the-scenes glimpses where Anderson demonstrates some of the research he did for the film, including a near 100% accurate model of the town (probably the most realistic looking Roman city since Rome) and the lightning flashing in the eruption column. Then he immediately explains why he added moronic excess to that reality because it just wasn't 'cinematic' enough. Thus the very fine looking Plinian column spouting from the volcano is spoiled by the giant fireballs that seem to pop out of nowhere. The ground caves in opening vast and inexplicable caverns underneath the beautiful looking town. Oh, and we get to see all our leads magically petrified by the blast, turning into the famous frozen bodies formed in the 19th century by archaeologists pouring concrete into the holes left by decayed corpses. Audience can sense this unreality. The ground does not just fall away conveniently whenever it seems dramatically convenient and the the flaming balls of fire feel like the absurd addition that they are. In fact, the efforts at realism make the absurdities even more unreal since they do not blend together well. Any attempt at creating a sense of real danger is lost by making the destruction so conveniently over the top.If it were possible to see beyond that you would notice the wonderful sets, the beautiful costumes, and the inventive camerawork. But the filmmakers don't want to give people a moment's pause to savor such things. The only thing that matters is the plot and this is so melodramatic as to be unwatchable. I was filled with a sense of sadness watching the obvious passion put into such a wasted film and I feel very sad at all the wasted opportunities. If it had picked one of those three styles to go for then it might have been alright (I don't think Anderson has it in him to make a film that's better than alright) but in trying to match three completely separate styles he managed to make a film that is tonally jarring and lifeless.There were a few fun scenes and while the destruction is so overdone as to feel generic it can occasionally provide entertainment value. And of course there is also the camp value of the whole affair, though if you truly want camp you're better off seeing the films this is based on.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAB0TWQ2PKD7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J11U5EK#wasThisHelpful","RAB0TWQ2PKD7U","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was thinking about how to sum up this film and I think I can do it in one sentence: Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun ride. There. Full stop. The producers set out to make a film that would be as exciting and appealing as possible to fans of space opera. And they succeeded big time. Enough time has been spent establishing these worlds and their peoples (the makeup for the alien races is particularly impressive) to make them feel real and alive. The film consistently dazzles with its dramatic visuals (one sequence is set inside the rotting head of a giant space creature) but always ties these to its sense of style. The film swaggers (there's no better word) from planet to planet as we explore the galaxy with Quill and friends. The action sequences, when they happen, are original and inventive and are often as not set up with truly hilarious moments. The space combat is well done as well, although there isn't as much of it as you might think from the trailers. The characters mostly get off the ship to do their fighting.The characters are what makes the film wonderful and it's a minor miracle that they work at all. The Avengers faced the difficult task of taking all of their diverse heroes and having them combined together in a way that didn't feel like overkill or having any of them feel underwritten. Guardians has to introduce you to its five leads, which it does quite well, and in addition bring in at least seven new characters all with their own distinct personalities. It should feel overstuffed but the wonder of the film is that it flows from one encounter to the next very naturally without ever losing its trademark humor. You know who Peter Quill is within seconds of meeting him. As soon as you watch him going all Indiana Jones after some ancient artifact as he dances to the tune of '70s rock song Cherry Bomb on his Walkman you know who he is. The other characters are all strong and established with a minimum of exposition so that we can watch them feud and bicker with each other, the best part of the film. If they made a sequel called ""Guardians of the Galaxy Sit in Their Spaceship and Do Nothing But Fight With Each Other"" I'd still watch it.The villains are good as well, with one exception that I'll come back to. Ronan is a pretty typical supervillain. He's a religious fanatic and a terrorist who aims to ""cleanse"" the galaxy. He may not be well developed but there isn't really room for it. He's one scary dude and that's all that matters, which gives him an air of menace absent from most other Marvel outings. Gamora's adopted sister Nebula is basically his sidekick, blue, bald, and fierce. She's underused but very much dangerous and distinctive. The weak link here is unfortunately Thanos, who only shows up in person once. I have to wonder if this scene was added in late because it looks terrible. Thanos' armor is really lame and looks like cheap plastic. His face is not at all intimidating and he doesn't seem to have the ability to make any expression beyond a faint smirk. After all the excellent setup he's a real disappointment. This is possibly my only complaint about the film.On every other level the film is a resounding success. The rebellious and angry attitude is obvious right from the beginning and seems to match the tone of the script perfectly. These are characters who have a reason to be mad, they have a reason to be on the run from the law, and when, in the end, they decide to help save the galaxy it feels like a genuine chance at redemption for a group of people who truly need it. You care about these guys and their problems and want people to see them for the good people that they are. Even the angry little raccoon with a chip on his shoulder and the giant muscleman with anger control issues and an overly literal mind.The film is quirky too, although not so quirky that it alienates people. Think a slightly less crazy version of Farscapeonly with a higher budget and better action. Mostly it's just good-naturedly odd in a knowing and playful way. Looking at this film as a Marvel film really isn't helpful. It is that, but it's unconnected to the main universe in terms of tone and approach. There are no brooding superheroes here, only a crew of outclassed and outgunned everymen going up against an enemy who can overpower them with a glance. The film never gets bogged down in its own ponderousness and while you can laugh at the characters you can feel for them as well. The key measure of a good movie is that I left the theater wanting more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KF6YD6KHTNOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NNM95Y#wasThisHelpful","R3KF6YD6KHTNOY","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a decidedly unexpected and unusual film. It takes the biblical story of Noah and then develops it in ways that you don't really expect to create something utterly alien yet strangely relevant. What I really appreciate about this film is how unclear and allegorical it is. Biblical films filled with the self-certainty and unquestioning authority of the '50s tend to be pretty dull. There is never any question of what is right (whatever God says basically) and never any possibility that God will allow the heroes to suffer in following his commands. Many modern day viewers will likely be put off by such fanatic certainty and unquestioned self-righteousness so it's nice to see a film that still keeps the point intact but brings the issues more in line with actual human emotions.The story is the traditional one taught in Bible school but it follows unusual interpretations. For a start the word God is never once uttered. Instead he is referred to as The Creator. Also present are fallen angels known as The Watchers, giant hunks of beings trapped inside moving rock. The first segment follows Noah's attempt to decipher his visions, and the intense emotional scenes are well designed to be difficult to understand without guidance. The next section follows Noah as he builds the Ark. This section has the interesting addition of an army led by Tubal-Cain, the self-proclaimed king of the world. Not surprisingly he wants on the Ark. This bit is a major addition but I think the story needs him if it's going to work. If you're going to have an apocalypse movie you need to see the people who are going to be dying, and if you're going to be following the 'it was God's will' angle then you need to show how utterly depraved the people about to be smited are. Tubal-Cain allows the film to do both, essentially having its cake and eating it too. Then the flood happens and lots of epic visuals appear. What might not be anticipated is the epic battle scene as Tubal-Cain tries to take the Ark. It's fairly short (some have even said gratuitous) but to me it feels like it relieves much needed tension before the coming catastrophe. Plus it gives Tubal-Cain the chance to utter the best lines in the movie: ""I am not afraid of miracles."" ""I give life and I take life away, as you do. And I am like you, am I not?""The story so far is very compelling. What follows varies. The initial days or hours after the storm are impressively gloomy and allow for a retelling of the creation of the earth. Then it starts getting into the complicated issue of what to do if God wants you to destroy mankind (and whether that's really what he actually wants). During this Noah turns into a rather harsh and unlikeable character who is in favor of killing babies rather than possibly failing to live up to God's will. It's an interesting idea but it drags on for over half an hour and begins to feel quite tiresome. I'm all for the questioning of his sanity and exploring his survivor's guilt but there needs to be something else happening to give the story focus or interest.I think the truly spectacular thing about this film is the visuals. This was evident even in the trailers but watching wondrous events told using nothing but visuals is awe-inspiring. Highlights include the creation of the world (told in seven day format but through an evolutionary lens), God's messages to Noah, the fall of the angels, and the spreading of life-giving water to the far reaches of the world. Noah's prophetic dreams are an especial delight since they tell of a communication through symbols and traumatic images rather than words. Visuals of mass death are intermixed with more symbolic violence such as the black soil bleeding at his touch. Noah has to work his way towards the Creator's goal and his understanding may well be flawed. The cinematography is a delight here. Filming in Iceland was an inspired choice. The earth there looks barren and dead while massive green solitary peaks rise from the ground turning a mundane sight into an extraordinary one.That's not to say the film is without problems. The environmentalist vegan angle is a rather unwelcome intrusion. It's not that certain elements of it can't be incorporated into the story, it's just that his disgust at the eating of meat overwhelms his otherwise sensible presentation. For example, while overhunting and pointless destruction are good targets for demonstrating cruelty and debasedness, the repeated use of meat as a symbol of perversion and sin is rather preachy and pretentious in a movie that is otherwise admirably above such things. There is not one single positive or even neutral depiction of meat-eating and putting so much focus on their 'crime' of being carnivores detracts from the other horrors they commit. At one point the trading of female slaves for meat to eat is presented as if both 'goods' are equally unjust. It distracts from his point, which is one that needs to remain understated. That's a minor annoyance though. The carnivorous instincts of the villains are generally brief and near the beginning. Once the meaty elements (heh heh) are out of the way the environmentalist angle is fairly unobtrusive.It's really fascinating to see the difference between the reception here and that from critics. And it all seems to come down to one issue: is the film accurate to the Bible? And for God's sake people why does it matter? No film is going to be 100% accurate, that's why they're called dramatizations. They add or remove material as necessary to make the plot more interesting or exciting. I'm a History PhD student so I'm used to going to movies and seeing them foul things up. All the time. I can't remember the last film I saw where they got the facts so accurate that I felt like I was just nitpicking. Maybe Lincoln? And even there you can argue that they got the motives and urgency wrong. More to the point, why aren't people used to Biblical films being inaccurate? Just like historical films every creator is going to have to make compromises. Even popular films like Son of God and The Ten Commandments aren't always accurate. Heck, the Bible contradicts itself on numerous occasions, but that doesn't matter if you're a believer because it captures the essential truth. Same with films made from the book. If they capture essential issues and truths then does it really matter if they get details wrong? I really do think that most of this hate isn't from the fact that the director changed things, it's that he included a very liberal environmentalist message and it gets people's gall up to see the Bible being used to convey ideals they aren't used to seeing justified Biblically. It's not as if other films don't change the message. There was never a real anti-slavery or capitalist work ethic message in the Bible but you see them all the time in Biblical films because that's how people want to interpret them. Well now somebody's come up with a different take on it and if people don't like it they can bash it all they want, but the idea that it's just them wanting the Bible to be followed exactly is absurd.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R51IL2QDULMYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBGWP3Y#wasThisHelpful","R51IL2QDULMYR","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good biography with a subject about whom there isn't much recorded. Antiochus III was king of the Seleucid Empire from 222-187 BC. There is better info for his life than for most of the kings before or after him since he encountered Rome at a pivotal point in their expansion, but this does not change the fact that the sources are fragmentary, undetailed, and usually from an outside perspective.What this book does very well is provide a sense of what it was like ruling the Seleucid empire and how effective Antiochus was as one of its most successful kings. The general impression is one of competence but never brilliance, with a tendency to get too carried away during battle (following Alexander's example of heroic kingship) and occasional misjudging of the political climate. Antiochus himself remains a bit of a blank slate, although his drive and ambition is readily apparent. Oddly enough the first section of the book, which covers the part of his reign before the encounters with Rome that generally received more attention from ancient historians, is the most successful at defining his character. Seeing how he handled internal politics and gradually emerged as master of his own court was interesting and seemed to genuinely show facets of his personality. In later chapters he appears more or less as the invisible instigator behind major events, rarely emerging from a general summary of his behavior.Inevitably this book raises many questions that cannot be answered. What was Antiochus like as a person? Exactly what did he do on his eastern campaigns? Even basic questions questions about the structure of his court are often vague. But for a work covering what can be known this biography does a very good job. For more information on the Seleucid army see Bar Kochva's The Seleucid Army: Organization and Tactics in the Great Campaigns, from which the author bases much of his battle information.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UV9P63DOMWWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848844638#wasThisHelpful","R1UV9P63DOMWWE","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Immediate note of importance: this is a Japanese game that is not only in Japanese but also won't play in non-Japanese systems. There is a UK port in English but this will only work on European 3DSs. If you want to play this game on a US system you're likely to have a long wait.The Inazuma games are a series that focuses around a middle school soccer team that has to face off against other soccer teams in an increasingly difficult series of matches. These soccer battles are complete with special moves (such as kicking flaming soccer balls at players' faces) and ridiculous characters as is normal in Japanese Anime. The gameplay is divided between these soccer matches (controlled on the bottom screen by the stylus) and RPG elements where you walk around the city fulfilling quests and leveling up characters. Both are fun, and the increasingly more absurd plots add greatly to the battle elements. This time the enemy is the Holy Road, an organization that controls Japanese soccer so that no team is greatly superior to another. Soccer is managed to such a degree that teams are given the results in advance (including the score) and expected to play to them. Naturally Raimon ignores this and leads a soccer revolution against the emperor, which provides a nice rebellious theme to the game.Unlike the rather disappointing Inazuma Eleven 3, Inazuma Eleven Go! has been redesigned for the 3DS from the ground up. Instead of the Super Nintendoesque sprites of the first trilogy the entire world is rendered in stylish 3D maps. These maps are focused more on looking pretty than looking fancy so they don't really take anything away from the game. In fact I prefer the Animeish design to that of the original, which featured characters that were a little too blocky to be considered cute. In fact, the only problem I have with the new graphics is that it is now much more difficult to recognize your players during battle. The easiest way of doing this is to hit start until their names show up underneath them, but it'd be nice if this wasn't necessary. The soccer battles continue to be played on the bottom screen (I'm not sure how else they could have done them) but everything else is on the upper screen which allows for a widescreen view of significantly better quality.The gameplay hasn't been altered much at all. The biggest change is that they've added an even higher level of special moves to matches so now the low end maneuvers such as headers don't really work anymore. This means you burn through your TP at a much faster rate. At the top of the new system is the kenshin, a sort of special summon that you can use to give your characters power. Not all characters have these kenshin so it can be quite hard going, especially early on. These kenshin are so overpowered they're a bit broken, meaning that when a player has a kenshin activated they are basically unstoppable. Plotwise this is a boon since it means the challenge feels real, but from a gaming standpoint it can be a real nuisance. Once you get your own kenshin it becomes more fun and the game resumes its entertaining ways. Having seen the Anime I expected to hate the kenshin, but they actually worked pretty good and didn't utterly derail the existing system. The game still has some overly plotted battles, but the goals in these has become better defined with a glowing circle indicating where you need to get your character to with the ball. There are also less of them, which is good. Another improvement is the removal of the outdated random battle system. Now to level up you travel the map looking for the red dots which indicate a team wishes to challenge you.The only real downside to the game is that the original characters are gone. No more Endou Mamoru or Goenji Shuya with their distinctive design and entertaining personalities. This game takes place ten years later and features an entirely new cast of characters. In the lead is Matsukaze Tenma, a first year student whose idealism and energy enervate the team into fighting the directives of the emperor. Shinsuke comes in with Tenma and is a small guy whose main character trait is being plucky and loyal. Shindou is the captain of the team and he's basically a musician whose powers allow him to conduct the team like an orchestra. Tsurugi is the cool ace striker, who doesn't take his hands out of his pockets even when making his special move. He's there as a mole to make sure Raimon fails, but he's fun to watch. Unfortunately these are the only characters who are really memorable. Everyone else is either bland or vacillating too much to leave an impression. Still, these four are cool and the supporting cast isn't as obnoxious as in the Anime. They might not be as good as the original crew but they're not bad either.You may notice that I'm using the Japanese names for everything here. It's because, even more than in the previous games, the localization is atrociously bad. I don't know why they think that we can't handle foreign names but they've really gone out of their way to make the English ones feel even more foreign than the Japanese ones could ever be. For example Tenma is now Arion Sherwind, while Shindou has become Riccardo Di Rigo, and Shinsuke is Jean-Pierre Lapin. Worse names are to come with Subaru Honda, Wanli Changcheng, Michael Ballzack (seriously), Doug MacArthur, and Hugues Baudet. Even terms are not immune from change with the original kenshin (reasonably translated as avatars in the Anime) now called fighting spirits. The only coolish name they've created has been Tsurugi's Victor Blade. Worse still, they've apparently run out of actors who can do cockney (which was bad enough in itself) and are now giving characters random nationalities. Shindou is now Italian, replete with bad accent, while Shinsuke is French. We've also got Spaniards, Americans, Portuguese, Koreans, and Chinese, all of whom are actually Japanese. Given that most of these names aren't English I can only repeat the question: WHY CHANGE THEM?!? And yes, just like in 3 they are speaking random phrases in those languages whenever they're given the chance. It's uniformly horrible. About the only entertaining one is Tsurugi, whose bizarre Russian accent is so stereotypical and amusing that I actually bother listening to it.Names aside the plot is entertaining and the battles fun. The new kenshin system works well and the few improvements to the system offer genuine refinements instead of just changing things for the variety. I think this game is a marked improvement over the last one and is on the level of the first two games in the series. High praise indeed considering all the advantages that those games had over this one, including characters, originality, and setting. After playing 3 and having seen the Go! Anime I thought I was tired of this series. I was expecting something tired and derivative but that wasn't at all what I found. Well done guys.For people new to the series this is the fourth game in the main set. The first three are for the DS and will play on US systems, although 3 isn't available in English unless you have a European 3DS. In Inazuma Eleven Raimon went up against the evil Teikoku (Imperial) Academy in the Football Frontier (the predecessor to Holy Road) to determine the best team in Japan. Inazuma Eleven 2 (Firestorm and Blizzard) ups the drama by having them face aliens intent on conquering the world through soccer. From this game on the series has released multiple versions of each game, the only difference being the characters you can recruit and some minor plot points. These are the last ones available in English. In Japanese there is Inazuma Eleven 3 (Spark, Bomber, and Ogre) goes back to a soccer competition (with humans) only this time it's global. There's also the other version of Go! (Shine/Dark) which has different characters from the original cast show up. For the Japanese 3DS there are also the two sequels to Go!, Chrono Stone (Raimei and Neppuu) and Galaxy (Big Bang and Supernova).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R309FA1ODK00BF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005O65Q3Q#wasThisHelpful","R309FA1ODK00BF","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

About the only entertaining one is Tsurugi, whose bizarre Russian accent is so stereotypical and amusing that I actually bother listening to it.Names aside the plot is entertaining and the battles fun. The new kenshin system works well and the few improvements to the system offer genuine refinements instead of just changing things for the variety. I think this game is a marked improvement over the last one and is on the level of the first two games in the series. High praise indeed considering all the advantages that those games had over this one, including characters, originality, and setting. After playing 3 and having seen the Go! Anime I thought I was tired of this series. I was expecting something tired and derivative but that wasn't at all what I found. Well done guys.For people new to the series this is the fourth game in the main set. The first three are for the DS and will play on US systems, although 3 isn't available in English unless you have a European 3DS. In Inazuma Eleven Raimon went up against the evil Teikoku (Imperial) Academy in the Football Frontier (the predecessor to Holy Road) to determine the best team in Japan. Inazuma Eleven 2 (Firestorm and Blizzard) ups the drama by having them face aliens intent on conquering the world through soccer. From this game on the series has released multiple versions of each game, the only difference being the characters you can recruit and some minor plot points. These are the last ones available in English. In Japanese there is Inazuma Eleven 3 (Spark, Bomber, and Ogre) goes back to a soccer competition (with humans) only this time it's global. There's also the other version of Go! (Shine/Dark) which has different characters from the original cast show up. For the Japanese 3DS there are also the two sequels to Go!, Chrono Stone (Raimei and Neppuu) and Galaxy (Big Bang and Supernova).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZDFNDAK92LX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005O65PW8#wasThisHelpful","R2ZDFNDAK92LX3","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The 2DS can't really play a 3DS game for longer than 3-4 hours, putting it well below the operating time of the original DS and even the Vita. However, that's only for 3DS games. The system can run on battery for eight or more hours when playing DS games, which isn't really any worse than the DS itself. The reduced battery life is just the tradeoff you get for superior graphics. There is no way around it. The one battery-related thing that does bother me though is that the sleep mode isn't very good at conserving energy. If you leave the 2DS sleeping for two days without a charge it will run out of battery. I assume this is related to Streetpass and could be resolved by simply turning the wifi off so I'm giving it a break on that score.The 3DS comes with with a number of programs preinstalled including System Settings, the eShop, Activity Log, Nintendo Zone, 3D Camera, and Mii Maker. These programs are fairly self-explanitory and cannot be deleted as they are essential to the functioning of the system. I'm not particularly happy with the eStore. It seems rather clunky to use, and crashes frequently. It's nice that it can background download, but it makes everything up to that point far too difficult. The 2DS can play downloaded games rather than using cartridges, and the fact that it uses standard memory cards means that this isn't that difficult or expensive to do. A major plus over the Vita and its Vita-exclusive memory cards.Also preinstalled are Face Raiders and Augmented Reality. These are both short games designed to be used with the 3DS's camera. They add digitally created figures to what appears behind your 2DS and allow you to, for example, shoot men with your face on them who fly about your room in little balls. It's pretty cool, and a real shame that no games have been made to take advantage of these features since. The other game on there is StreetPass. This is a collection of two games (though they can be upped to six if you pay for them) that depend on you collecting other players' characters via wifi. As you pass another 3DS in the street you will automatically sync with it and their character will show up on your Mii Plaza from which you can play games. I don't know of any other system that has social gaming features that make you feel as involved as this.

It is of course, the most expensive of the three options. The 3DS is somewhat cheaper and fits in pockets easier, but I personally don't like how boxy it is. The 3DS-XL is all smooth lines and is only slightly bigger when you consider the increased size of the screen. But if small size really is important for you I'd go with the 3DS. The 2DS is really only for people who don't expect to carry it around in their pockets. The one-piece construction makes it stronger, but it does mean that it is less protected and you need a jacket or sweater to carry it in. The fact that it doesn't have 3D isn't much of a loss, but the low price can be a real gain.

The 3DS can't really play a 3DS game for longer than 3-4 hours, putting it well below the operating time of the original DS and even the Vita. However, that's only for 3DS games. The system can run on battery for eight or more hours when playing DS games, which isn't really any worse than the DS itself. The reduced battery life is just the tradeoff you get for superior graphics. There is no way around it. The one battery-related thing that does bother me though is that the sleep mode isn't very good at conserving energy. If you leave the 3DS sleeping for two days without a charge it will run out of battery. I assume this is related to Streetpass and could be resolved by simply turning the wifi off so I'm giving it a break on that score.The 3DS comes with with a number of programs preinstalled including System Settings, the eShop, Activity Log, Nintendo Zone, 3D Camera, and Mii Maker. These programs are fairly self-explanitory and cannot be deleted as they are essential to the functioning of the system. I'm not particularly happy with the eStore. It seems rather clunky to use, and crashes frequently. It's nice that it can background download, but it makes everything up to that point far too difficult. The 3DS can play downloaded games rather than using cartridges, and the fact that it uses standard memory cards means that this isn't that difficult or expensive to do. A major plus over the Vita and its Vita-exclusive memory cards.Also preinstalled are Face Raiders and Augmented Reality. These are both short games designed to be used with the 3DS's camera. They add digitally created figures to what appears behind your 3DS and allow you to, for example, shoot men with your face on them who fly about your room in little balls. It's pretty cool, and a real shame that no games have been made to take advantage of these features since. The other game on there is StreetPass. This is a collection of two games (though they can be upped to six if you pay for them) that depend on you collecting other players' characters via wifi. As you pass another 3DS in the street you will automatically sync with it and their character will show up on your Mii Plaza from which you can play games. I don't know of any other system that has social gaming features that make you feel as involved as this. I understand that Japan has something similar with cell phone games and I believe there was something like it for the PSP, but over here the only competition is Vita's Near, and StreetPass leaves Near in the dust. There's just no benefit to using Near whereas with StreetPass you get to play games with people you run into, even if they're not involved any more than that. Rewards include hats and uniforms for your Mii character.A major problem with the 3DS when compared to its predecessor is that games are now region-locked. European games cannot be played on American systems, nor can Japanese games. This is a real problem for me as I have a European 3DS. So at the moment I can't play games like Shin Megami Tensei IV, though I suspect that they'll release it in Europe eventually. Fortunately, the DS cartridges are still region-free and can be played in any system.The 3DS comes in three versions: the base model 3DS (this one), the 3DS-XL, and the 2DS. Now, the 3DS is fine as a system, but its screen is just as tiny as the DS's. The 3DS-XL however has a screen that's almost twice as big while still fitting comfortably in your hand or your pocket. It also has a longer battery life, giving you perhaps an extra hour's usage. Even if you only want to use it to play DS games it's worth the upgrade. It is of course, the most expensive of the three options. The 3DS is somewhat cheaper and fits in pockets easier, but I personally don't like how boxy it is. The 3DS-XL is all smooth lines and is only slightly bigger when you consider the increased size of the screen. But if small size really is important for you I'd go with the 3DS. The 2DS is really only for people who don't expect to carry it around in their pockets. The one-piece construction makes it stronger, but it does mean that it is less protected and you need a jacket or sweater to carry it in. The fact that it doesn't have 3D isn't much of a loss. I have friends who swear by the 2DS, and I can see its advantages, but if you expect to bring it everywhere I'd go for one of the other two options.To sum up: the 3DS is an excellent gaming system that improves on what didn't work on the DS while keeping all of the features that worked. If it features gimmicks like 3D and motion control they can be easily turned off or ignored. It's a small price to pay for quality. Anyone wanting a portable gaming system has no reason not to turn to the 3DS. I was never a fan of portable games since I came to them back in the days of Gameboy and Game Gear when 2D sprites were the way to go and difficulty settings often unforgiving. But the 3DS has made a convert out of me and consumes far too much of my free time.

"Pros:Quality gaming engine is able to improve noticeably over DS gamesHigh-quality upper screenAn ever increasing and high quality game libraryBackwards compatible with DS gamesEasily portable with a protective lid sheltering the screensCons:3D is mostly uselessNo second analog stickRegion lockedThe 3DS was released two years ago and is only just recently reaching its potential. I've had mine for a year at this point and I can definitely say that I've noticed the number of people I encountered through StreetPass skyrocket in the past few months. I used to be able to walk down the street without picking up anyone at all. In fact, I went through the London Underground in rush hour and only had five hits. But now I walk down through my fairly small town and I pick up ten new people every time. It's made it almost tooo easy.The reason for this surge in popularity is obvious. The 3DS was marred by a rather dismal set of release games that was dominated by ports from the N64 and PS2, such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Star Fox 64, and Tales of the Abyss. It was the same way for the first year and a half as everyone tried to figure out what to do with it, with the strange 3D features and motion controls putting some developers off. Fortunately, the system got over that and now has its own unique games like Fire Emblem: Awakening, A Link Between Worlds, and Pokmon X.As to the 3DS in general, the system is basically the same as the DS with improved graphics. Why improve on perfection I suppose? That machine was a near-perfect gaming platform with many classic games. The graphics however, were often quite blocky and sometimes ugly. The 3DS improves on that although most games keep the unrealistic style of DS games. They just do it better, with cartoony graphics that actually look like cartoons. Some of the visuals on the 3DS can be pretty amazing, but there are few games that show them off to the full. I think that the graphics level is somewhere around that of the PS2, as can be seen in a number of direct PS2 ports. This is good enough for a handheld system and means we can finally get rid of the blocky little shrunken men that dominated DS games. It's not as good as the Vita, but since 3DS games are rarely about superior graphics that doesn't matter. Most of the best 3DS games would have worked just fine on the DS, they simply look nicer with better graphics. And that sums up Nintendo's strategy to a T: If it ain't broke don't fix it. And since the 3DS can do DS games better than the DS as well as play higher end games (Ace Combat looked pretty good on its screen) this system offers a lot more chance for expansion while allowing Nintendo to take few risks.The big gripe everyone has about the 3DS is the 3D part. And yes, it isn't great. If it wasn't for the fact that I dislike the non-clamshell design of the 2DS I'd recommend going for that. But the problems with the 3D have often been overstated. Yes, it rarely adds anything to the gaming experience; yes it means you have to hold the system at exactly the right angle to see it; yes, it can sometimes cause headaches; but then you can simply turn it off if you don't like it. There's a little switch on the side that makes it dead easy. I don't know of any games that require 3D to function so you don't really lose anything. What I generally do is put the 3D off when I'm playing the game, but turn it on for cinematics. Because animated cutscenes in 3D look absolutely superb. Sometimes they has left me utterly blown away.The motion control elements of the 3DS are similarly gimmicky, although I can see more potential for their integration into a good gaming experience. Under no circumstances should the two gimmicks be used together. The 3D is dependent on having the 3DS at a constant distance from your face, so if you have to move the unit around to use the motion sensors then you're going to get a headache quick.Another aspect of the hardware that gets people a bit upset is the battery life. The 3DS can't really play a 3DS game for longer than 3-4 hours, putting it well below the operating time of the original DS and even the Vita. However, that's only for 3DS games. The system can run on battery for eight or more hours when playing DS games, which isn't really any worse than the DS itself.

"Pros:Excellent gaming engine with the graphical capability to play pretty advanced gamesHigh-quality OLED touchscreenDual analog sticksEasy PSN functionality and download supportBackwards compatible with PSP and PS1 gamesRegion free gamesCons:Lack of good gamesNo internal memory and expensive proprietary memory cardsPortability issuesBackwards compatibility only applies on digital games purchased through the PSNThe PS Vita is an excellent system marred by only a few design flaws. The best part of the hardware for me is the dual analog sticks. These are a major bonus since fpss basically require them nowadays. Not only are there two of them, they are also of excellent quality. One of the things I always disliked about the PSP was the analog stick that was flat to the surface and rather difficult to use. The 3DS has copied this design, although they made it more ergonomically comfortable. The Vita however, has two that stick out from the system, just like on the PS3 remote, allowing much greater control and ease of movement. There are sensitivity issues since the sticks are smaller than their PS3 equivalents, but once you adapt to it the controls are almost as easy to use.The second best thing about the Vita is the OLED touchscreen. This touchscreen is absolutely beautiful and has excellent resolution. I thought the touchscreen aspect was just a gimmick, but some of the games have made excellent use of it allowing them to compensate for not having back bumpers (L2/R2 buttons). Well, technically they do have those in the rear touchpad, but it is so touchy and difficult to use that it might as well not exist. The big plus of this touchscreen is that it is much more sensitive and reliable than the 3DS's. You can type with fair accuracy using only your finger, and responses on one section of the screen rarely result in unexpected reactions from another. It does tend to make the screen oily, but that's the price you pay for all touchscreens.The graphics on the system are amazing, although all that talk of them being almost as good as the PS3 is garbage. They fit comfortably between the PS2 and PS3 level of graphics, with the result probably being a bit closer to the Wii than the PS3. With the smaller screen it is easier to hide bad texture maps and glitches. That doesn't take anything away from the system. On the small screen those graphics look amazing. I'm not sure where these graphics fit when compared to the 3DS, but they are definitely an improvement. It's hard to think of any 3DS games with high graphical requirements since they tend to aim for cartoony and exaggerated worlds, but I can't remember any that even come close to pulling off Uncharted: Golden Abyss. At a guess, I'd say that the 3DS reproduces approximately the same graphics as a PS2 (as can be seen by their virtually unchanged ports of PS2 games) while the Vita is a bit higher (as seen by their improved ports of PS2 games). The difference is more one of style than capability, with Sony focusing on realistic games that show off their graphics engine while Nintendo does what they usually do and try to create fun, cartoony games. The graphics leap between the 3DS and the Vita just isn't that high. Certainly not enough to recommend getting a Vita on that score alone. The biggest advantage they have graphically is that their screen is just better quality, and doesn't waste energy on 3D that nobody uses.I've heard some complaints about battery life but I don't know what all the fuss is about. My Vita plays for about five hours without recharging, which is a good hour or two longer than my 3DS does. I appreciate that the older systems lasted longer but that was because they had less graphics-intensive games. You can still play those games so it isn't a problem. A DS game on the 3DS can last all day, and playing a PSP game on the Vita is likewise. The Vita also has an excellent sleep mode. I found that the system drains far less quickly when asleep than the 3DS does. Besides, it was really only the DS generation of games that worked like that. Previous systems often had terrible battery life (see the two-hour long Game Gear).The layout of the Vita is basically that of a Playstation controller with a big screen in the middle. The two analog sticks are in the proper places and are reasonably sensitive. The PS button has been moved to the left corner and glows when the game is on. The start and select buttons have become a bit crummy since you have to push at quite a difficult angle to get them to go down. The two bumper bars are very responsive, and look quite stylish. The rear touchpad is useless. Comfort-wise the system is very nice, fitting neatly into your hand with some nice pads at the back to support your grip. The system is somewhat heavy, but that's never been a problem for me. The game does suffer dramatically in portability when compared to its competition. Not only is it larger than the 3DS-XL (or the PSP for that matter), it is also bumpier and less protected. With no DS clamshell front to protect it the Vita's screen is dangerously exposed to sharp knocks. I can also assure you that the two analog sticks, despite making gameplay amazing, mean that the Vita will never comfortably fit into anyone's pocket. There are cases for it that will alleviate the protection issue, but the best that you can do is carry it in your jacket. And for some people that just isn't enough. It all depends how you use it.Software-wise the Vita comes preinstalled with some basic programs of varied utility. The main screen is an ugly series of icons accessed by the touchscreen. Sony is trying to make their system into a phone and I don't understand why. Still, it functions well enough. The browser still sucks and the maps app isn't particularly helpful. Due to the presence of a touchscreen the messages app has become functional. The PSN is extremely useful. In terms of new software the main addition is Near. It's trying to do what Streetpass does, but it does it badly. All you can do with it is see what people in your city are playing. It connects through 3G so it bases its records of local Vita users on the last location they signed in on. No, it doesn't continue to sync with other devices when you put it on sleep mode. That'd just be silly. It isn't like the 3DS which communicates with other consoles via wifi.Hardware-wise the only major problem is the proprietary memory cards, which are so obviously money-grabbing as to be insulting. Especially given the Vita's emphasis on downloadable content this is just a kick in the teeth for gamers. After all, some of their games aren't even available in physical copies. And if you want to download any PS1 or PSP games (which look amazing on the new screen btw) then you're equally screwed. Worst of all, since there is no internal memory you need to buy one of these cards to play any game, whether or not you intend to download games. And a good card can cost half as much as the system itself. It's disgraceful.Another silly feature is the 3G option. There's no point to having this since there aren't many online games for the Vita, and most of the other internet functions will require you to connect to a more reliable wifi hub anyway. 3G is expensive and difficult to arrange with your local provider. Maybe this isn't the case in Japan, but it is in the US. And of course, even if you get service it isn't going to be as good as wifi anyway. Besides, what's the point of playing online games outside anyway? When you're in public you can't exactly shout into your mic to inform your teammates that they're being morons. Not that you could do that anyway since the Vita only supports 3G for turn-based combat and Near. Any first-person shooters will have to find some wifi. 3G also drains your battery in a heartbeat. Unless you live in an area that has no broadband internet connection but still gets 3G I can't see the point of it.To be perfectly honest, even this isn't enough to prevent people from buying the system. What might serve as more of a deterrent is the games catalog. The Vita has been out for two years but is still suffering from a lack of truly great games. The best new games to come out thus far are Uncharted: Golden Abyss and Assassin's Creed III: Liberation. They also gave Persona 4 an awesome port called Persona 4: Golden. All of these games came out in the first year, when enthusiasm for the new system was still fresh. There has been little since. The 3DS was suffering from this too until fairly recently, with the most popular games being ports from older systems like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Tales of the Abyss, and Star Fox 64. Now the 3DS is picking up steam with Fire Emblem: Awakening, Pokmon X and Y, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, and Shin Megami Tensei IV, but the Vita seems stalled.One of the major pluses of the system though is its easy access to the PSN. A gigantic library of PS1 and PSP games are available for download. Yes, these were available before, but only for the PSP. Now you can access them on the Vita's high def screen and use dual analog sticks for control. This can be really helpful even on PSP games that have replaced the right analog stick with the top bumpers. There are also demos and free content that adds greatly to the experience. Much better than Nintendo's eShop. Or maybe that's just the opinion of someone used to the PSN. Like the PS3 games are region-free, though DLC is region locked. You can also have only one account connected to your Vita which means no more copying games from different accounts. You have to reformat the card every time you change.To sum up: I really like the Vita. On a strictly hardware level the Vita is clearly superior to its closest competitor (the 3DS), even if that system has advantages when it comes to portability and convenience. Its biggest problem is the lack of good games, and that's hardly the fault of the hardware. Like the 3DS it's had a slow start, but hopefully it will pick up now that the price has gone down and a new and cheaper model has been released. PS4 functionality should also help them. If you're willing to bet on future successes then this system is well worth it and the backlog of PS1/PSP games should keep you occupied for quite a while. If you're waiting for that one brilliant game that makes the system worth buying... it hasn't come yet. But hopefully it will soon. If you are planning on buying this system though go for the wifi only version unless you can find this one cheaper. 3G support offers nothing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PN2YJ110J74H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071NH8B8#wasThisHelpful","R3PN2YJ110J74H","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Now the 3DS is picking up steam with Fire Emblem: Awakening, Pokmon X and Y, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, and Shin Megami Tensei IV, but the Vita seems stalled.One of the major pluses of the system though is its easy access to the PSN. A gigantic library of PS1 and PSP games are available for download. Yes, these were available before, but only for the PSP. Now you can access them on the Vita's high def screen and use dual analog sticks for control. This can be really helpful even on PSP games that have replaced the right analog stick with the top bumpers. There are also demos and free content that adds greatly to the experience. Much better than Nintendo's eShop. Or maybe that's just the opinion of someone used to the PSN. Like the PS3 games are region-free, though DLC is region locked. You can also have only one account connected to your Vita which means no more copying games from different accounts. You have to reformat the card every time you change.To sum up: I really like the Vita. On a strictly hardware level the Vita is clearly superior to its closest competitor (the 3DS), even if that system has advantages when it comes to portability and convenience. Its biggest problem is the lack of good games, and that's hardly the fault of the hardware. Like the 3DS it's had a slow start, but hopefully it will pick up now that the price has gone down and a new and cheaper model has been released. PS4 functionality should also help them. If you're willing to bet on future successes then this system is well worth it and the backlog of PS1/PSP games should keep you occupied for quite a while. If you're waiting for that one brilliant game that makes the system worth buying... it hasn't come yet. But hopefully it will soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXR5F2BM7K53W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O6EATE#wasThisHelpful","RXR5F2BM7K53W","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The question here is obviously whether a game for a portable system can achieve the same level of epic scale that the Uncharted series is known for. The answer is partly yes and partly no. The graphics are great and even if they can't compete with the PS3 they're still capable of showing off the meticulously crafted vistas that Uncharted is known for. I know this because I spotted them occasionally as I was running from things. This game rarely stops and shows off what it can do. There are few moments of awe amid the action, not even during climbing scenes when you have little else to do. The levels tend to be repetitive jungle. In a lot of ways it's quite a lot like the first game in that it rarely leaves a single region. Towards the end when exploring a massive underground city the game finally comes into its own and shows what it can do, but it needed more moments like that and it needed them sooner.I also felt that the game was sorely lacking in the epic setpieces that were the highpoints of previous games. Even if just in a cinematic, it would have been nice to see stunts so insanely reckless that you give out a silent cheer. Those games are structured around massive events, with most of the plot taken up in explaining how Drake gets from event A to event B. Their absence betrays a certain lack of inspiration more than any system limitations. As I said, in the scenes where they do show off the scenery it all holds up quite well. There are some beautiful backgrounds if you move the camera around to look away from where your focus is. I see no reason they couldn't have done more. They're playing it safe rather than taking risks and that's not what Unccharted does.As to the rest of the transition, it's all there. The witty writing and excellent voice acting and animations are all present. The characters are as great as ever. It's a prequel so there's no Chloe or Elena, but instead we get good old Sully as well as new characters Dante and Chase. Chase basically takes Elena's role as the conscience and prod, although she's a lot less altruistic. Dante is a fun antihero who gets to be both helpful and treacherous whenever the situation calls for it. Guerera is the typical South American strongman rogue general with little to distinguish him from other such characters. Some people have complained about the new characters being less interesting than the old ones but honestly, apart from Chloe in the second one the only really memorable characters have always been Sully and Drake. The other characters are rarely interesting, and I will at least remember Dante. His constant plotting and self-justification was fun to watch. The plot is as twisty and convoluted as ever, even if it is restricted to South America. This time it involves Visigoths, Conquistadors, and the city of Quivira. It's as loopy as ever and never lets up for a moment.Combat plays out basically the same as on the PS3, although it can take a little while to get used to the contours and responsiveness of the Vita system. There have also been a number of new features added, mainly connected to the touchscreen. To perform melee combat you now have to swipe your finger across the screen. This usually works surprisingly well, although if you're caught by surprise it can be quite hard to get your fingers into position in time to do anything. They also have a new feature that lets you take charcoal rubbings of various statues using the touchscreen. This works quite well and feels natural. The scraping of dirt off artifacts feels rather less so, but it isn't massively intrusive. You can use the rear touchpad to climb ropes and the front touchscreen to climb walls, but they never force you to use it. Occasionally it is even helpful.Honestly, the lack of ambition is the only real problem I have with this game. Maybe sticking to a South American context was important for texture storage reasons, but there's no reason they couldn't have taken better advantage of the vistas that they actually did have. It does have a rather weak ending, but it's nowhere near as anticlimactic as Uncharted 3, where the inevitable collapsing city began for no reason and the bosses barely featured. Uncharted games tend to have weak endings, probably because they've used up all of their amazing scenes just getting there. Golden Abyss is actually slightly better on that score, despite having the final boss fights take place in QTEs. Aside from that it features everything that you love about the Uncharted franchise: witty dialogue, fun characters, and exciting plots. If it is on a smaller scale than the latest adventures that doesn't mean much. It isn't that much less globe-trotting than the original Uncharted.If you haven't already, you should definitely check out the previous games in this series: Drake's Fortune, Among Thieves, and Drake's Deception. They are all better than this game, though not by much. Drake's adventures are just designed for the big screen. Which makes the success of this game a bit of a marvel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y0R4VN5U2MX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SW8OS#wasThisHelpful","R2Y0R4VN5U2MX1","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think it's fair to say that I'm not a big SRPG fan. I enjoy RPGs more for their plots and characters than for their combat systems. And I suck at tactics. With the exception of Fire Emblem: Awakening I haven't really enjoyed any SRPGs. So my review is a little biased right off the start. But the tactical side isn't the problem I have with the game. I do have a beef with some aspects of the game, but that element isn't one of them. I'll cover my problems first so that I can get them out of the way and highlight the good aspects, which are also very good.This game is (for the most part) a 2D game. You select areas in Tokyo to visit and then your character goes to a still image of that area with character cutouts inserted on top. There is no animation of any kind, just 2D drawings. Kinda like Professor Layton. The battle maps are in 3D, but once you enter combat you simply have a still image of the opposing team. When they attack you they get slightly bigger and they flash when they're hit. That is the extent of the interaction. I have to state right now that this whole thing really bothers me. A lot more than the tactical side. It worked fine for a game like Professor Layton, but here it feels really cheap and uninvolving. It brings back bad memories of the text-based RPGs of years past. Is it really too much to ask for basic villain animations? Even Final Fantasy managed that back when they were on the PS1.The second annoying aspect of this game is the difficulty. Under no circumstances should you buy the DS version of this game unless you are a mega gamer. The 3DS has added an Easy difficulty setting which I put it on, and the game is still kicking my butt. I have friends who are better at SRPGs and who got the DS version, but gave up midway because it was just too difficult. Why the designers felt the need to punish us I don't know, but it was not a good idea. Bad Guys hurt.The good part of the game is the characters and plot. Tokyo is under a very quiet demon invasion and the area where our characters are located is ground zero. The authorities have sealed it off and are preparing to do something horrible to eliminate the threat. More worryingly, the protagonist is now able to see what is essentially a death clock over peoples' heads. And nobody's clock shows more than a week. His friends only have a day. His cousin gave him and his two friends DSs (way to be meta Atlus) that allow them to fight and recruit demons of their own. The goal isn't to save the world. All you can do is survive, and that alone'll be tricky. It's a great concept and one that they exploit quite well.The characters are great too, and in the 3DS port they are fully voiced. The voice acting is excellent and well worth getting the 3DS version for. There is a sequel to this game on the DS, but it might be worth waiting around for it to be released in an upgraded 3DS port too. I understand that one has already been released in Japan so it's only a matter of time. On the whole I have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand I enjoyed the plot a great deal. On the other, I found the gameplay to be cheap and boring. Depending on what you want out of a Shin Megami Tensei game that will either ruin the game or not be a problem. For my part I'll give the second game a go if it ever comes out in the west. The plot and characters were enough to keep me interested.Shin Megami Tensei games have a good track record. There are the Persona games which are also set in the modern day (Persona, Persona 2, Persona 3, Persona 4). Additionally there are the main games (most recently Shin Megami Tensei IV which is set in a fantasy kingdom) and Strange Journey.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EQCS7Q5TTCY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I09286#wasThisHelpful","R1EQCS7Q5TTCY7","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rhythm games are not my sort of thing. That's why I found myself surprised to be enjoying this game so much. The main advantage that this game has over its competitors is a good story, with gameplay features borrowed from Professor Layton, and extremely catchy beats. I found myself humming the tunes from this fairly shortly after playing it for the first time.The plot of the game is focused around a young Frenchman called Raphael, who goes around by night disguised as the notorious Phantom R, an art thief of great style and sophistication. The police are baffled at the ability of this young redheaded thief in a fashionable suit and fedora to disappear. Undoubtedly they asked the random redheaded civilian with glasses and no hat for information, but he didn't see anything. It's that kind of game. Raphael is searching for his father, who went missing years before. During his pursuit he finds himself entwined in the risen Emperor Napoleon's dastardly plans to take over the world. Fortunately his men are susceptible to timed dance moves.Sound ridiculous? Good, it's meant to. The plot is one of the most entertaining things about this game. Amusing and insane it takes our heroes on a tour of Paris and its environs. And Paris is very much on display here. The city looks gorgeous, even in the 2D that dominates the gameplay. When you do get to see a cinematic cutscene (in glorious 3D no less) it really sours.The rhythm games are cleverly based around this plot. For example, when sneaking into the Louvre you have to follow a beat to hide behind convenient statues and avoid the guards. When fighting Napoleon's men you have to punch them as they bounce at you in synchronized fashion. When eluding policemen on roller skates you have to jump or duck to avoid capture. And my personal favorite: you get to defend yourself against your archrival's PI child Charlie who attempts to apprehend you by kicking a flaming football at your face. They're all fun, not a little bit silly, and have a catchy beat.The parts of the game not revolving around playing rhythm games owe a very large debt to Professor Layton. Not so much the puzzle aspect, but the way that you move your character along a map and use the touchscreen to interact with the characters and scenery on it. They even have playcoins you can collect by tapping random areas of the screen. The character and street designs are very nice. These are seen at their full effect when the cutscenes start. These cutscenes are beautifully animated and really capture a spirit of adventure. I wish they would make this into an Anime so we could see it all animated. The 3D is used to good effect in these, especially the first cutscene which has Raphael dancing around a room filled with chandeliers. The rest of the game doesn't use it much, and it's often easier to just turn it off.Most of this game takes place on the bottom screen. The top screen has a map and is used for all the wonderful 3D cutscenes, but when traveling you pay attention to the touchscreen. In battles the top screen becomes important. These battles alternate between having you tap buttons on the bottom screen with your stylus and hitting buttons. No, you don't have to do both at the same time. That would be horrifyingly difficult.The downsides to the game are fairly minor but annoying. The rating system is messed up. The game doesn't record your best scores, only an average of all your scores. This means that if you want the game to save you getting an A-Rank score you have to get it right on your first time. Which is almost impossible. Another flaw is the grading system for these ranks. It is too heavily focused on what your last move was. You can get a perfect score right up until the end and then flub only the last note, dropping you down to a C-Rank. It's very irritating.If any of this sounds compelling try the demo. It's available for free on the Nintendo store. This is one fun game even for non rhythm game fans. While the game doesn't always add up to the sum of its parts, nevertheless it provides a fun ride.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U7C7T0CBEWS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NDIXL2#wasThisHelpful","R3U7C7T0CBEWS9","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My main target in this review is to examine the quality of this game for fans of Persona 3. If you want a basic review that looks at this game in isolation then there are plenty of other impressive reviews on this site. It may seem a little harsh to judge the game in comparison to its predecessor, but these games are so unique I can't think of anything else to compare them with. And Persona 4 doesn't come off at all badly in the comparison. No sir. In many ways this is the superior game.First, a question of gameplay and format. This game is divided between fairly standard dungeon crawling and some innovative social gaming tied around the life of a Japanese high school student. The dungeon crawling is a bit repetitive, hindered further by randomly generated dungeons that all look the same. The social gaming is something else entirely. You spend most of your time dealing with time management, dividing your life between schoolwork/social activities and demon fighting. The chance to live out the life of a Japanese teenager is a lot of fun and may leave you with strong flashbacks. I was surprised at how easily I settled back into life as a teenager. Apart from the obvious feeling of control it is hard to explain why this section is such fun. It just is. it's helped by strong side characters and the opportunity to develop stronger relationships with them. Improving your relationships improves your ability to fuse personas of their arcana. This is the same format followed in Persona 3 and, presumably, the upcoming Persona 5. It's hard to argue with success.After the success of Persona 3 this game tried quite hard to make itself unique rather than just a knockoff sequel. To do so it moved the setting from the city to the small country town of Inaba. Everyone knows each other in a small town and this leads to a lot of social stratification. One of the main themes is the gulf between the local kids and those (including you) who moved in from the city. Also moving in from the city is a shopping mall called Junes, which is taking customers away from smaller local stores and causing a lot of resentment. This sort of social commentary was completely absent in Persona 3. A less successful change is the switch from having monsters show up on a full moon to having them show up on foggy days. This feels a bit forced, and makes me hope that future installments will simply list their boss fights in advance so you can better prepare for them. In the end, you usually have about two weeks to complete a dungeon, but it'd be nice to just have them say that since you don't dare count on it less you run out of time.In another major change the protagonist and his friends are left to discover their abilities by themselves instead of joining a pre-existing team. This leads to a lot of exposition early on that kind of drags the first part of the game. Unlike Persona 3 which gripped me pretty quickly, it took me about fifteen hours to get really into this game. It took over three hours just for the dungeon-crawling segment to appear. By far the biggest change to the game's format is the inclusion of a mystery at the core. There is a serial killer on the loose, one who will murder their classmates through supernatural means unless they can stop him. His identity is a closely guarded secret (though it's a little obvious when you think about it) and provides a continual sense of threat. Another major improvement over the last game is the more psychological approach the game takes to the characters. To gain their ability to use personas characters must confront and accept their inner shadow. This shadow is a mirror of them that reflects their innermost secrets and fears. It is a perfect opportunity to see what truly drives these characters. You get to the heart of them in a way that you couldn't just by talking to them.The best aspect of the characters in this game is that who they appear to be on the surface is usually the exact opposite of who they are underneath. The most obvious example of this is Kanji, who appears to be a hard dude of legendary proportions but is secretly gay and confused about his masculinity. Something I've always appreciated about the Persona series is its realistic depiction of friendships. Your initial impression of someone isn't necessarily telling you all there is to know about them and their behavior is different depending on who they're with. They even remember to have traits known to one character but not others. For example, Chie always knew about Yukiko's odd sense of humor because she had been close to her for longer, but when Yukiko started being more open she got a little embarrassed at hearing it in public. And then there are passing moments when you realize that you don't know a character as well as you thought, like when Chie mentions in passing that Yosuke calls her up at night to tell her dirty jokes. Yikes. It's as if these characters have lives that don't always revolve around you.The gameplay has also been improved. Added is the option to control the actions of other characters, which means no more useless game overs because you get hit by a status effect and your teammates are useless. The game still ends if the protagonist gets knocked out, but at least you can reduce your chances of that. There are a few other tweaks to the combat system as well. Now you have to try each different form of attack in order to find out an enemy's weakness. It always seemed a bit cheap to have Yuuka just tell you. Another improvement is the addition of a Defend option, which is so obvious I can't believe that 3 lacked it. Knocking an opponent down is also less effective than in P3 since once they get up they can immediately attack. Fortunately, this applies to your characters as well.The dungeon crawling is still present in excessive amounts, but instead of just going into different floors on one building (Tartarus) each character you rescue has their own castle. These castles all feature essentially the same thing, but they have at least worked on making each new castle feel unique and structured to that character's personality. For example, Yukiko's is basically a prison shaped like her family's hotel while Kanji's is a bathhouse. They even change the layout of the rooms to better fit the style. Nice. Another plus is that you no longer have to worry about finding a portal every time you want to escape. Instead you use items called Goho-Ms which take you to the entrance. A major difficulty is that the entrance no longer heals you, and paying the fox to do so is reeaally expensive unless you do his missions. So your sessions in the TV realm are quite limited in terms of time.The feel of the characters is quite different from in P3. In that game you're part of an awesome team of shadow-hunters who hang out in their own dorm and have a great sense of camaraderie. In this game you're chilling with friends and occasionally leading rescue missions into the shadow realm. I love the feel of being part of a team of cool guys but it's hard to argue with the feeling that comes from hanging out with friends. The guys here are not quite as memorable though. Yosuke seems like a somewhat diluted version of Junpei from P3, Teddie is pretty annoying (although he grows on you a bit), and your silent protagonist is a bet too cool and stylish looking for his own good. Kanji was great but I missed the unquestioned coolness of Akihito. The girls are unquestionably better though. Yukiko is pretty much your typical colorless Japanese heroine, but aside from that they all have unique and entertaining personalities. Even Yukiko isn't all bad since her inner struggle is, like all the leads, very good, and she occasionally gets a few quirky character traits. Since these are the romance options this is a major plus as in P3 you could basically go with a girl you don't really know or try and hook up with colorless Yukari or crazy scary Mitsuru. It has to be said that there is a lot less pathos in these characters since, while they're all struggling with something, they never feel like the wounded emotional wrecks the guys in P3 were. This makes it an easier game to go back to since you can slide back in at any point without too much trouble, but it may leave you feeling it's a bit more superficial.An oddity given the game's plot is that it seems rather lighthearted for the Persona series. The lighting is bright and colorful and while the plot goes to some pretty dark places it always returns to the same cheerful world. It's a little bit incongruous with the moodiness inherent in much of the game. The open and communal SEES dormitory, for example, has been replaced with your uncle's cramped house where it's usually just you and your quiet cousin who sits on the floor watching TV since her dad rarely comes home. It feels very lonely and isolated. But then you hit the menu and everything's golden and fine. :-) This is reflected particularly in the character designs from the main character (absurdly cool instead of wannabe hipster) to Teddie (too darn cute). The mystery-centered plot also seems less epic in scale than the end-of-the-world one in Persona 3. It's more focused in that you know the victims personally, but less widespread in that their number is few. This is a more intimate piece and perhaps this is fitting given the small-town setting.It's really a toss up for me which game I like best and it often depends on my mood. When I first wrote this review I was firmly in P3's court, but when I went back to that game it was harder to get in than I remembered. The improved mechanics of P4 help at every point and since the characters are more your friends than your coworkers it feels like a nice relaxing summer vacation. Sometimes you want a more intense adventure and that's when you turn to P3, but most of the time I find it easier to just pick up this game. The plot is compelling, the gameplay superior, the town charming. This is a game that stands on its own and does so well. I respect it for continuing the same gameplay as its predecessor while being completely different in plot and setting. It is in every way a success. The mere fact that people can argue about which is the superior game proves that. If you liked Persona 3 try this. You won't be disappointed. If you like JRPGs or the idea of social gaming appeals to you then try this game. It may be a bit slow to take off for plot reasons, but once it does so it is immensely fun and highly addictive.Is this better than Persona 3? Dunno. Is it better than everything else on the market? Yes. Try it.All of the Persona games are also available on portable systems: (Persona, Persona 2: Innocent Sin, Persona 3: Portable, and Persona 4: Golden). Only Persona 3 and 4 have social gaming. The other two are more typical JRPGs with a lot of dungeon-crawling and plot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HON6CWRSJ0T2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001C6GVI6#wasThisHelpful","R2HON6CWRSJ0T2","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I love the feel of being part of a team of cool guys but it's hard to argue with the feeling that comes from hanging out with friends. The guys here are not quite as memorable though. Yosuke seems like a somewhat diluted version of Junpei from P3, Teddie is pretty annoying (although he grows on you a bit), and your silent protagonist is a bet too cool and stylish looking for his own good. Kanji was great but I missed the unquestioned coolness of Akihito. The girls are unquestionably better though. Yukiko is pretty much your typical colorless Japanese heroine, but aside from that they all have unique and entertaining personalities. Even Yukiko isn't all bad since her inner struggle is, like all the leads, very good, and she occasionally gets a few quirky character traits. Since these are the romance options this is a major plus as in P3 you could basically go with a girl you don't really know or try and hook up with colorless Yukari or crazy scary Mitsuru. It has to be said that there is a lot less pathos in these characters since, while they're all struggling with something, they never feel like the wounded emotional wrecks the guys in P3 were. This makes it an easier game to go back to since you can slide back in at any point without too much trouble, but it may leave you feeling it's a bit more superficial.An oddity given the game's plot is that it seems rather lighthearted for the Persona series. The lighting is bright and colorful and while the plot goes to some pretty dark places it always returns to the same cheerful world. It's a little bit incongruous with the moodiness inherent in much of the game. The open and communal SEES dormitory, for example, has been replaced with your uncle's cramped house where it's usually just you and your quiet cousin who sits on the floor watching TV since her dad rarely comes home. It feels very lonely and isolated. But then you hit the menu and everything's golden and fine. :-) This is reflected particularly in the character designs from the main character (absurdly cool instead of wannabe hipster) to Teddie (too darn cute). The mystery-centered plot also seems less epic in scale than the end-of-the-world one in Persona 3. It's more focused in that you know the victims personally, but less widespread in that their number is few. This is a more intimate piece and perhaps this is fitting given the small-town setting.What has changed between the original PS2 version and the Vita remake? Not a lot from what I can tell. Admittedly, I've never played the original, but I watched my roommate do it. The graphics on Golden are greatly improved, though it's hard to tell unless you do a side-by-side comparison. Some of the backgrounds seem to have been rebuilt from scratch to provide a more detailed or realistic setting. Particularly noticeable are the atmospheric effects which were often surprisingly poor on the original, though it looked fine at the time. More obvious are the improved polygon count which makes circles look like circles. The only thing that hasn't changed much is the character models. I suspect that the texture maps have been improved, but apart from that they look the same as they did originally. And of course everything has been moved around slightly to accommodate the cinematic ratio. They could have just cropped the scenes at top and bottom to make them fit, but instead they redid it entirely to give you a wider view. Does this add significantly to the playing experience? Not really. but it's sure nice to look at. This game could never compete with other Vita games in terms of realistic graphics (see Uncharted: Golden Abyss), but then the Animeesque graphics are part of the style of the piece. And realistic or not it has never looked nicer than it does here.The biggest addition that I'm aware of is that you can now call for help from other players over the internet. It is such an inconsequential feature that I never used it. More interesting is that you can now access a series of videos from the main menu. These include previously viewed cutscenes and Japanese trailers for previous Persona games. Rather better are the series of video lectures given by Mr. Edogawa from Persona 3, which explain the Jungian philosophy that the game is so strongly influenced by. We also get a new opening animation which is very nice. There are two new social links, including a girl in the velvet room and Adachi. Chie and Teddie have new voices, which for her is an improvement though Teddie sounds the same. They have added the ability to go to the beach and there's a bonus skiing holiday that you can go on. There is also a brand new ""True"" ending that I haven't gotten yet. It's basically another bonus boss. None of these are particularly big changes but they are nice. I appreciate the ability to carry the game with me wherever I go, but if that's not an issue there's very little reason to upgrade to this version if you have the other. The Vita isn't particularly portable anyway.It's really a toss up for me which game I like best and it often depends on my mood. When I first wrote this review I was firmly in P3's court, but when I went back to that game it was harder to get in than I remembered. The improved mechanics of P4 help at every point and since the characters are more your friends than your coworkers it feels like a nice relaxing summer vacation. Sometimes you want a more intense adventure and that's when you turn to P3, but most of the time I find it easier to just pick up this game. The plot is compelling, the gameplay superior, the town charming. This is a game that stands on its own and does so well. I respect it for continuing the same gameplay as its predecessor while being completely different in plot and setting. It is in every way a success. The mere fact that people can argue about which is the superior game proves that. If you liked Persona 3 try this. You won't be disappointed. If you like JRPGs or the idea of social gaming appeals to you then try this game. It may be a bit slow to take off for plot reasons, but once it does so it is immensely fun and highly addictive.Is this better than Persona 3? Dunno. Is it better than everything else on the market? Yes. Try it.The three other Persona games are also available in portable format (Persona, Persona 2: Innocent Sin, and Persona 3), although all for the PSP. I'd recommend downloading them through the PSN instead so you can play them on the Vita. The screen is much better for it and having two analog sticks means you don't have to use the upper bumpers to look around. Only Persona 3 has social gaming. The other two are more typical JRPGs with a lot of dungeon-crawling and plot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J93ALRLOQAQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007W8S2MG#wasThisHelpful","R1J93ALRLOQAQ2","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is horribly addictive. I found myself engrossed playing it night after night, even after finishing the original on the PSN. It was just fun to go back into that world on a handhold console so that I could bring it everywhere. I think that this is the rarest of games: the kind that keeps you interested over a long period of time, but doesn't demand that you spend every waking hour on it. I found that about 2-3 hours a day was enough to satisfy my interest, while still keeping me eager to play it again the next day.The main advantage of the PSP version over the original is that it gives you the option to create a female protagonist. This changes all the relationships you have and introduces several variations on certain characters. They've learned from the improvements they made for Persona 4 and now most of the social links are with your fellow Persona users instead of random schoolmates. That's with the female social links. The male ones are the same as in the original. Like the original game the design for the girl lead is first rate. She looks much less emo and more perky than the male protagonist, but at the same time she feels like the lead in the game and not some side character that we've had thrown in. They do a remarkably good job of integrating her.The battle system has also been reworked to bring it closer to Persona 4, so you can now control all of your characters instead of just the protagonist. The downsides of the PSP version come from the decreased storage size of the UMD. This means that you can no longer walk around the various locales in glorious 3D, but instead have a 2D map and a cursor that you move to select your character's actions. It isn't actually as bad as it sounds because it does mean you can get around faster. And the walking around streets wasn't the key draw to the game anyway. But it does make the day-to-day events less interesting. More regrettable are the absence of the cinematic cutscenes, replaced by scenes using the in-game graphics. I wish that they had waited until the Vita came out and released it there so they could take advantage of its superior capabilities, like they did with the Persona 4 remake. The characters are at least still voiced, with the alternate lines for the female protagonist recorded by the same cast.This game can be pretty easily divided into two separate sections: the social gaming and the dungeon crawling. The social gaming is complicated so I'll cover it later. The dungeon crawling is pretty basic RPG fare. You run around Tartarus (a giant dungeon that takes the place of your school in the Dark Hour) and if you hit any of the little monsters running around you enter a turn-based battle mode. The combat system is fairly standard as well, although the ability to knock characters down and issue an all-out attack can be both a lifesaver and a massive nuisance. The biggest problem with it is that you can only control your character and not any of the others, which can lead to massive defeats that could be easily avoided since the death of your character results in a game over even if everyone else survives. Tartarus is divided into over 200 floors whose layouts are randomly generated each time you visit. This all becomes rather repetitive, but somehow the rest of the game can make up for it.The social gaming is the truly innovative part of this game. I understand that social games are popular in Japan, but they never took off over here so it feels completely fresh. You spend your day as a secondary school student in Gekkoukan High. You go to class, make friends, and attend societies. At night you can go to Tartarus and kill demons. The game takes place over most of a schoolyear so you have plenty of time to do all four. The day is divided into five main periods: early morning, morning, lunchtime, after school, and evening. Most of them are scripted (it is a school after all) but you have control over what you do in your afternoon and evening slot, as well as during your Sundays. You can choose to go out with friends, study, or do solo activities. You can even play a game within a game which I think kicks you down to the level with crumbling skyscrapers. As you make friends you establish things called ""Social Links"" which allow you to build better Personas (the main fighting mechanic) and have character development. Otherwise the social gaming would be fairly unconnected to the main quest.The control you have over your character's life is compelling. Depending on your decisions you can get a girlfriend, make friends, ace tests, bomb tests, etc. It really feels like leading a second life. I was surprised at how quickly I settled into the mode of a high school student. In some ways the dungeon crawling is actually a distraction. In other ways it is the glue that ties everything together. Without the supernatural element I'd probably have bored of the school life a lot quicker. And without the school life I'd have bored of the dungeon crawling in a heartbeat. It's quite strange how well the two work together.Two other aspects that must be discussed: story and characters. The story here is really good, even aside from the character-development scenes. The sense of impending doom is captured pretty well by the end, even though the repetitive attending of lessons does rather lesson its impact. The only real problem with the plot is that it is (by necessity) repetitive. My favorite events are the scripted ones like the beach holiday (mandated by Japanese law to appear in every Anime) and the school trip but generally you have complete control of your life except for once a month when the shadows arrive. Also, towards the end it seems to lose its focus, only to regain it in a slightly odd direction that doesn't seem to work as well. The characters are all strong, with Akihito, Junpei, Mitsuru, Ken, Yukari, and Aegis being the chief standouts. Err, I think that's pretty much all of them. At any rate, it feels great just hanging out for a year with these cool guys in their sweet dorm.This game has a few problems but they are minimal (the Sumerians were NOT writing in 4000 BC dammit! Stupid teachers and their inaccurate questions. grumble grumble). The elements I worried I'd despise (such as the social gaming, the emo-looking protagonist, and the loud rock music during fight scenes) turned out to really help pull me in. The game as a whole is compelling and draws you into the life of a normal Japanese schoolboy in a way no other game can match (I assume fighting demons by night is normal for a Japanese schoolboy, right?). But really, anything bad I had to say about the game would be nitpicky. If you have any interest in RPGs at all then play this game.Quick note: the original version of this game is available on the PSN if you have a PS3. The PS2 original and the expanded FES are also available still. Honestly, there's no point not going for FES if you can. Apart from the absence of a female protagonist it is still the preferred version. There is also a sequel called Persona 4 (also available as Persona 4: Golden for the Vita) which is arguably even better. It's set in the countryside and has a more lighthearted murder mystery angle. It streamlines some of the control issues and the dungeons but keeps the social gaming. The first two games (one and two) didn't have this and aren't so interesting as a result. They are still worth playing for their stories (especially 2) but you never feel as close to the characters as when you're controlling their daily lives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21CEINBO8AOM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00356GVRW#wasThisHelpful","R21CEINBO8AOM6","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have some misgivings about this album. On the one hand it is full of excellent music and well worth buying if you liked the previous installments in this series. On the other, it tends to be rather repetitive and relies strongly on relatively few cues (far fewer than LOTR) which it repeats again and again. For the first half of this album I was extremely disappointed. It is entirely derivative and features nothing that we haven't heard before. The Flies and Spiders track was particularly disappointing because the scene is one of my favorites. I started to despair. But then as the album progressed I found the music gradually getting better. Starting, I think, with The Woodland Realm new themes start to appear and old ones are used in a new fashion. It makes me wonder if he had already planned some of these cues before they split the two films into three because everything up til then would have fit in very well at the end of the last album. At any rate, from this point on the quality slowly rises until it reaches a pitch that is as good as anything in the LOTR albums. If it had been this way from the beginning I would have had nothing but high praise for this album.The Woodland Realm manages to seem elvish and ethereal while avoiding sounding like Rivendell or Lothlorien. I think it's my least favorite of the three, but then I really love those other themes. It certainly holds its own. The Forest River is also good, as is Barrels out of Bonds (though slightly more derivative), but the really great stuff hits once we reach Laketown. Protector of the Common Folk is a delightful little track that sounds very whimsically medieval (but in a good way). I believe it represents the Master of Laketown's theme and it is developed even more strongly in Thrice Welcome. Girion, Lord of Dale is a sad piece with some very moving humming towards the end.After this we head off to the Lonely Mountain and the score really shines. The key element here is the presence of Smaug. His theme (heard briefly in My Dear Frodo in the previous album) rises to new heights here. And very impressive it is. My Armor Is Iron and The Hunters in particular feature its blaring trumpets at full blast. Strangely enough the track Smaug doesn't focus on it too much, but instead seems to push Smaug's seductiveness and dangerous charm. It's a very effective track, especially since it does what Smaug does and gets you so lost in the wonder of it that you forget about the danger until the cue roars at full blast. There's another theme in the mix here which I will think of as the greed for gold theme, and it provides a wonderful impression of great wealth and temptation. Inside Information features a lot of it, very effectively intercut with Smaug's theme. The album spends a lot of time in Smaug's lair and I have to wonder what they're going to do in there that takes up all this time. Whatever it is it'll have a great musical accompaniment.And then there are the last two tracks. These are a bit odd. The ending song, I See Fire, is a bit tame. The song itself is decent enough, it's just that it feels like it should be accompanying a slow motion montage of the entire company laughing and hugging. That's not really what I want from my Hobbit films. I'm curious to see how it works in the film. The last track is entitled Beyond the Forest. Anyone hoping for a repeat of the wonderful extra tracks of the first Hobbit are in for a disappointment. The track itself is alright, but nothing memorable.And so we come to my feelings of the album as a whole. This album isn't what I was expecting from a Hobbit soundtrack. Missing is any bombastic adventure theme to link the tracks together. Instead it is tied together by a string of tracks that play off of suspicion and greed. Not that some tracks don't have great action cues, but they're missing the one unifying theme that we saw in Misty Mountains Cold. I don't believe we even hear that theme once. This piece is dominated by dark and brooding music instead. In a way it's fitting that Smaug should suck the innocent exuberance out of such a quest, but at the same time I think we could have done with a few more grand moments that aren't dark and moody. The album holds up well thematically, but if this movie has already succumbed to gloominess I can only imagine what the next one will be like. The plot for this film still has a good deal of adventure to it, but the next one will be dominated by themes of corruption and betrayal.None of that takes away from the quality of the album as a whole. It's still better than almost anything else on the market. I'm rather torn between this album and the previous one actually. That one was more consistent qualitywise, but at the same time felt a bit like a retread. Apart from the Misty Mountains theme the most original music came in the bonus tracks at the end. This time the album builds in quality until the very end. For all my misgivings this is easily a five star work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z2OGOKW0D9SA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFT182K#wasThisHelpful","R1Z2OGOKW0D9SA","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the Bond film that many people probably never see. There is one reason for that, and I think only one: the actor playing Bond. This was George Lazenby's only time as Bond, and then it switched back to Sean Connery for Diamonds are Forever and then to Roger Moore in Live and Let Die. It's easy now to imagine different actors playing Bond, but in 1969 Sean Connery WAS Bond. It was not at all clear whether he could be replaced. And Lazenby's sole attempt didn't convince anyone. I'll have more to say about him later. Because there is a lot more to this movie than just the actor playing Bond.The most impressive thing for me about the Bond franchise is the way in which it manages to adapt so effortlessly to whatever age it was made in. It started off quite dark and gritty except for the over-the-top villains in their fantastic lairs. As the '60s progressed the attempts at realism declined and the gadgets grew more and more extreme. The '70s got even more campy with Bond becoming little more than a parody of himself. Even in the '60s the series had never exactly reflected reality, but by the '70s it wasn't even pretending to. The franchise had teething problems in the '80s as it attempted to return to its serious roots, but it never managed to compete against newer action vehicles. The '90s saw Bond reborn, in a more general action-hero role. Now instead of being part of an elite force he became more of a lone wolf, like '90s action heroes. Then the '00s came up and the franchise rebooted in a dark and gritty return to the franchise's roots, again in keeping with the darker and more aggressive action heroes of the decade.The reason I bring this up, is that On Her Majesty's Secret Service rather breaks the mold. It is probably the closest film to the Bond of today. Reading negative reviews from the time one feels like they are describing the elements that they put into modern Bonds. Criticisms that the film had removed the gadgets and oddities that dominated earlier ones sound like inadvertent praise. That's exactly what people want in a Bond film. Modern touches in this film include: a greater focus on Bond's character, which is no longer just invulnerable superspy; the aforementioned decline in gadgets; an increased role for the romantic interest; conflict between Bond and his employers; rapidly edited action scenes. At the time much of this was not appreciated, which is why it was never as successful as other Bonds.The other reason of course, is George Lazenby. His presence cannot be ignored. There has been a lot of criticism of him over the years. Many have said that he was flat and uninspired, often comparing him unfavorably with Sean Connery. I think that a lot of the negative comments about him are due to this being his only outing. His is certainly not a polished performance, but he showed great promise in his first outing. Given a few more outings he could have made the role his own, and his performance here would have been seen as simply the first stage in his development. After all, Connery didn't gain all of his trademark lines and quirks until several movies in.The thing with Lazenby though, is that you never quite get a handle on who his Bond is. He plays his cards fairly close to the chest and there always seems to be more that he is not saying. In fact, he seems to be a bit of a chameleon, sometimes being tender and sometimes hard. It may be bad acting or it might not. All that I know is that it works for the role he was given. This Bond is enigmatic enough that you can believe he actually is a spy, but displays enough genuine emotion that you can buy him as a man in love.The rest of the acting is a lot easier to qualify: it is excellent. Telly Savalas makes a worthy replacement for Donald Pleasance as Blofeld. His version is much less sinister and rather more charming than Pleasance's. This makes him much less of a blunt stereotype and more of an actual threat. I think that people are more likely to remember Pleasance's iconic take on this man, but Savalas' comes a worthy second. He just enjoys himself so much. Diana Rigg is excellent as Tracy, the woman who captures Bond's heart. She is damaged and not completely right in the head, but also resourceful and direct. She's no pushover like so many Bond girls.Another aspect of this film that overwhelms is the score. This is Johnn Barry's best Bond score, dominated by a main theme that features no words. Oftentimes this is the theme used when you might expect to hear the Bond theme, and it works just as well if not better.There is a lot that is unique about this film, but the movie itself is still unmistakably a Bond film. It may be more realistic than others, but it still has supervillains with massive lairs, absurd action scenes (including two wonderful ski chases), a lot of girls for Bond to seduce, and general '60s cheese (including Blofeld locking Bond up in the only room in the fortress that contains an escape route). But it has more heart than any of the later ones (except perhaps Casino Royale). This Bond can be a callous cad, but he can also be afraid and have his heart broken. The final scene is heartbreaking, and when the music brutally transitions into the triumphant Bond theme it feels like a kick in the teeth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R4FR6I8GQVQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004RG65#wasThisHelpful","R3R4FR6I8GQVQ9","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is a marked improvement over the previous one. While that game was about defeating opponents through soccer and winning the Football Frontier, this one takes a slightly more extreme approach. Aliens invade and threaten to destroy the world through soccer unless they are stopped. You spend your time leading what is essentially the human resistance to defeat the enemy soccer teams. It's every bit as silly as it sounds, but then this is a series where you shoot flaming soccer balls at people's faces so reality was never really an issue.The benefit of this plot is that the scale has expanded. The original took place entirely in Tokyo (not that you'd know it from the regionalization which seemed to do its best to hide the fact that it took place in Japan) but in this one you travel across the country looking for players to fight with you. There are some real winners here including a new forward with serious issued called Froste, the Prime Minister's daughter, and a surfer dude. The larger map allows you to travel to more areas and it genuinely feels grand in scale, again unlike the first one.Like the last game this one is a winning combination of RPG elements and soccer battles. The RPG elements are mainly focused on plot and character fluff, with random battles thrown in there to allow leveling up. Soccer battles are controlled by directing the players via the touch screen. It takes a little while to get used to the controls, but once you do it becomes quite simple. To make it more interesting than a regular soccer game your characters have special techniques that allow them to flatten their enemies, replace the ball with a bomb, or other such crazy maneuvers. The battles can be challenging, but none of them are impossible (unless scripted to be) and if you spend enough time leveling up they shouldn't pose much of a challenge.That's not to say the game is perfect however. There are a few too many scripted defeats where nothing you do can affect the outcome, yet you have to play it out anyway. And some other scripted events require you to get the ball to one character, who is the only one capable of avoiding/defeating the enemy. But the biggest problem by far is the voices. The lead character (Mark Evans) is dubbed in some horrible cockney dialect that sounds terrible and seems nonsensical given the Japanese context. I've been horrified to discover however that he is in fact the best voice of the lot. As bad as he is, the voice actor is actually trying. The rest of them are just reading off cue cards and cashing their paycheck. Particularly incomprehensible to me is the decision to give each Japanese town a different (English) dialect. So Hokkaido in the north is given a northern accent (complete with constant ""I were""s and ""lads"") while ""Fauxshore"" in the south has a Yorkshire accent (with the word ""blimmin"" being inserted in EVERY SINGLE LINE OF DIALOGUE!). Villains of course, sound Southern.But that shouldn't take away from what is still a very good game. After all, that's what the mute button is for. Even if it does mean you don't get to listen to the awesome music. The gameplay is fun, the storyline OTT and entertaining,  and the characters a marked improvement over the original where the only interesting ones were Mark, Axel, and Jude, with occasional bits from Kevin and Nate. The pieces here all come together in a much more appealing way, making it feel more epic and more personal. All in all a grand success.This game comes in two editions, Firestorm (this one) and Blizzard. The two games are identical except that they have a slightly different set of characters you can recruit and a bit more character fluff for Axel and Froste respectively. This division is expanded in the third game which has Spark, Bomber, and Ogre editions. Unfortunately, these have only been released in Japan, so playing them will be difficult if you don't know Japanese. There was a UK release, but it was only for the 3DS which means it won't play in any American systems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11VYWKRO6KZL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EMRG86#wasThisHelpful","R11VYWKRO6KZL4","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a bit disappointed in this book. Most of this is from the fact that it was significantly shorter than I had expected, which is at least partly Amazon's fault. This site doesn't show that this book was designed for an audience of students aged 9-13, which isn't likely to be the ones looking for it on here. It's so basic that it includes three whole pages explaining how centuries work. This is a very basic work which only has 95 pages, which covers 2200 years at around seven or eight pages per era.As to the quality of this brief presentation, it's perfectly fine, but there's no getting around the fact that it doesn't have the space to really explain anything. I feel like this book is a good introduction to a subject that doesn't have anything beyond that, or at least not in English.If you want to find a more in-depth look on classical or medieval Armenia then you're out of luck. There is a book called The Kingdom of Armenia by Mack Chahin that covers the same period as this one, but 2/3 of that book is focused on the kingdom of Urartu, which came before Armenia. The remaining 118 pages offer slightly more than this book, but are again of a very introductory level. The only thing better about the current book is the illustrations which show something of what the Armenians would have looked like at this time. There is also Vahan Kurkjian's A History of Armenia, which at least devotes the proper amount of space to the topic even though it is often inaccurate or misleading. Simon Payaslian's The History of Armenia is (like Chahin's book) focused mainly on one era, which in his case is the Armenian Genocide of World War I. This means that he's finished with classical and medieval Armenia in 100 pages. Lastly, there's The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century which is probably the best you're going to find on this topic. It isn't really a narrative history of the nation, but a collection of essays on topic connected to the Armenia of this period.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQIIRNLM81O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0685374106#wasThisHelpful","R2NQIIRNLM81O9","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a military biography of two Late Roman imperial brothers: Valentinian I and Valens. A military biography of these two makes sense as Valentinian is famous as the last powerful emperor of the west, who repaired the frontier defenses and campaigned in barbarian lands, while his brother Valens is famous mostly for losing the battle of Adrianople, the battle that allowed the Goths to establish a permanent foothold in the empire. The two lives are not exactly symmetrical or even often connected (events in the east and west rarely intersected militarily), but they are both undoubtedly known for their campaigns.As with previous Pen & Sword books this one is well illustrated. It has numerous fine diagrams, maps, and illustrations which all help in understanding the events described. It's even better than Hughes' previous work. Unlike many of his previous works this one has a good deal on non-military events too, particularly in years where there weren't many wars. In addition to the Gothic, Persian, Alamannic, Quadic, and Pictish wars Hughes details the magic trials and building programs of both emperors. Sometimes it feels a bit out of place, but in general I found it aids understanding of these emperors.This book is divided up in an annalistic format that has each chapter represent a single year. He did something similar in his book on Aetius, although it worked better there. In Aetius he was detailing the career of one man operating in a relatively narrow region. Here he is describing two men on opposite sides of the empire. The annalistic approach feels like a distraction and adds unnecessary confusion. For example, the ""barbarian conspiracy"" is introduced in 367, then he goes on to discuss the Goths and Persia, and then in the next chapter he returns to Britain and the imperial response. The Armenian and Germanic campaigns are similarly split between multiple chapters. Just as confusingly he is often forced to mention incidents from other years anyway since events don't happen in isolation. A regional approach like he took with Belisarius would have been far more suitable for this material. Alternatively he could have divided it by the emperor involved.I wish that Hughes had done what he did previously and focused on a single man whose career has been neglected by modern accounts. Valentinian is famous, but has never had a biography written on him. As a (relatively) well-documented emperor whose career was quite important it is about time he was served with a close study. Valens on the other hand has the excellent Failure of Empire focused on him. Hughes thus feels he has to constantly justify his choice of Valens, and he does this in the usual scholarly way by finding flaws with the previous work. The reason that's a problem here is that, despite repeated protestations that Lenski's work is biased, he doesn't disagree with it that much at all. He claims that Lenski viewed Valens as a bad emperor when that book offered a substantially more nuanced view. A mediocre emperor perhaps. A poor general, but one skilled in many peacetime areas. Hughes' conclusion says the exact same thing. The result is that a good deal of the sections on Valens feel like a rehash of that book. The sections that are different I usually disagree with. His sections on Armenia are particularly confused with him relying heavily on the largely fantastical work of P'awstos Buzand, whose spelling he alternates between P'awstos and Pavstos (occasionally abbreviated BP) so often that the reader could be forgiven for thinking them two separate people. At any rate, any historian who records dozens of campaigns in half as many years with numbers into the millions cannot be relied on for troop strengths even when the figures he provides seem semi-realistic.Hughes' work on Valentinian though is first-rate. Even though it is fragmented by the Valens material enough gets through that a clear overview of his reign can be understood. Hughes emphasizes correctly that many of Valentinian's achievements are overstated, but he sees a real core of truth behind later exaggerations. The problem of course, is that he is dead by the year 375 leaving us with only Valens for three years. Fortunately he covers Gratian's (Valentinian's son) rule during this time, but from here on Valens absolutely dominates the narrative. The book is of course ruled by the shadow of Adrianople, and Hughes spends an appropriate amount of time setting up the battle. While I wouldn't say he adds much apart from some excellent campaign maps, his account goes beyond being merely satisfactory and serves as quite a good introduction to the battle.I think that this is my least favorite of all Hughes' books. The focus on two separate emperors and his annalistic chapters are both questionable decisions, but they prove disastrous when combined. Although still readable, it makes the task of sorting out events needlessly difficult. Unlike his previous books he never offers much insight into the personalities of his protagonists, who remain distant figures throughout. It is in fact slightly inaccurate to call this a military biography of their campaigns since it is more of a history of military activity during their reigns. The material in here is good enough to be worth reading, but it needs some serious reorganizing before I can come to like it.Incidentally, for another take on the battle of Adrianople I'd recommend The Day of the Barbarians. It's a bit sensationalistic but it covers the events well. It's also a lot shorter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHN12RNMUBDD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848844174#wasThisHelpful","RHN12RNMUBDD7","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is a bit of a step down from the previous two. The basic plot of the game is the same as the first one: the Raimon Junior High soccer team competes in a series of matches to defeat all their competitors in the Football Frontier, only this time it's the Football Frontier International and their competitors come from all over the world. This is a bit of a step back from Inazuma Eleven 2, where the team took on aliens who were trying to conquer Japan through soccer. Going back to just a soccer tournament is kinda a letdown, and there's no way to avoid that. That doesn't mean it can't still be good.This title continues the same gameplay of the previous entries. You face random soccer battles where you have to score a goal with four players. You also face full matches where you fight with your entire team, using special moves and special tactics to defeat them. This is mixed in with RPG elements of walking around town and recruiting players. Put that way it sounds kinda dull, but it really isn't. The character fluff is great and the soccer battles suitably challenging. There is only one major change to gameplay here:  you now get exhausted quite rapidly and are constantly switching players out. I suspect that this is because most of the soccer battles are rather easy and they wanted to make the game as a whole more challenging. Whatever the reason, once you level up your stamina the problem goes away and the game returns to normal.This game is the Japanese version, so while it will play on a US DS the menu and dialogue will be in Japanese. Which is a bit of a problem obviously, unless you speak Japanese. I know that there are sites online that translate these, so anyone interested enough in playing this can find a way to do so. This game is the same as Inazuma Eleven 3: Bomber and Inazuma Eleven 3: Spark, the only difference being that this game focuses on a new team from the movie (Ogre) while the others focus on Rococo and Fideo respectively. For anyone with a European 3DS these games are also available as Lightning Bolt] and [[ASIN:B00BG4R0KM Bomb Blast, which are in English but are also replete with horrible cockney accents and names.The game's problems come with the advent of the story. And there really isn't anything special here that we haven't seen before. The FFI advances just like the regular FF, even to basic structural elements. I can't say any more without spoilers. The matches have just a few too many plot-railroading moments where you can't control the game. This is combined with occasionally sloppy plot devices, like how Fubuki suddenly develops a broken leg and has to stay behind with no setup or warning. Also, there are four hospitalizations, and of those four characters three hid their illness from their friends and three needed operations to cure terminal plotitis. It feels just a little bit overdone and stale.Another problem this time round (and one they didn't suffer from before) is the characters. Endou, Goenji, and the rest are as cool as ever. Fideo's great, and so are some of the new guys. But then you get the two most annoying characters in the series: the coach (who I shall always think of as Snake) and Fukou. As you might remember from the last game, Fukou's kinda a dick. He doesn't get any better here, although his story is partially saved by a late piece of character development where you realize just how much Kageyama screwed over him and Kidou. Snake has no such redemption because the game seems to think he's utterly brilliant. And there's nothing quite so annoying as seeing everyone fawn over a character you can't stand. Coach's problem is that he is the worst coach in the entire world. Rather than tell his players what they should do, he gives them a series of arbitrary tasks that then lets them learn the skills they'll need. Like locking them in their rooms for no reason. Or making them practice in the mud. Or banning Endou from playing. He has super secret reasons for all of these, but he maintains the idiotic attitude that if they don't work out why he's doing what he's doing for themselves then they deserve to lose. What a pro.Honestly, the plot may be repetitive, and several new characters a nuisance, but the core of the game is the same old Inazuma we already love. It ties up a number of the loose ends and resolves the series on a decent note. I might wish that it didn't feel quite so tired, but at the same time I was glad to be returning to a world I enjoy. I can't exactly say I never got frustrated playing it, but the good definitely outweighs the bad. I'm not so sure that will still be true if they ever adapt Inazuma Eleven Go and Inazuma Eleven Go 2: Chrono Stone, but that's a different story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22FQSKEGL4CPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046ECA1I#wasThisHelpful","R22FQSKEGL4CPN","A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product is very thick/dry so care must be taken with application to use just the least amount that will cover and to feather/blend the edges.  It covers quite well.  As the box says, it is intended for very high coverage.  To get that kind of coverage requires a layer that sits on top of the skin and will probably be noticeable at close range. The color that I received, Sand, is a better match for tieback of my hand (which have gotten somewhat tanned and where it covers freckles very well) and a little dark for my under eye area (which is much lighter since I am careful to use sun screen).  The color Sand is on the yellow-golden  side, not cream or pink tinged at all.  Your skin has to be absolutely smooth to use this.  If there is any dryness or flakiness the product will accentuate that.  So for these areas you have to blend with moisturizer, which helps application but of course also reduces the opacity of the coverage.  This product is ""okay.""

"This is a very convenient way to get turmeric into your daily routine.  I have been using turmeric for quite a while.  I have been buying turmeric pieces at the supermarket and pulverizing it/blending it with fresh ginger, lemon juice and water.  I drink some of this almost every day.  It takes some time to do the preparation, so having these turmeric capsules is a welcome supplement to my supplements.I am absolutely convinced that the natural inflammatories such as bromeliad (which you get from fresh pineapple, also available in capsules) and turmeric are potent and effective.  I have had problems with my knees -- meniscus tears -- for years.  Every so often I will move the wrong way and my knee will lock and instantly become extremely painful.  I have found that if I really load up on turmeric and bromelain (ideally in natural form but I always keep capsules in the house in case I cannot use fresh and it is an emergency) I can reduce the time it takes for the knee to ""unlock"" by 24 to 48 hours.  I have had these episodes three or four times and am just amazed at how effective the pineapple/bromelain and turmeric have been.Ubervita is a well-respected company.  While these capsules seem expensive they are powerful and safe.  Which is more than you can say about many pharmaceuticals.  I do like using the fresh Turmeric roots but they are not always available so these capsules are a great back-up and a whole lot more convenient.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R203GVS49G3YTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RN5Q3K#wasThisHelpful","R203GVS49G3YTS","A15T487HNTIOF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15T487HNTIOF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If this is the first book about miniature poodles that you read, you will probably think it's great.  Between the time I ordered it and the time it arrived, I did a lot of reading online, and by the time this book showed up I had already read most of what it contains.  If you come to it after reading around on The Poodle Forum and watching You Tubes about how to groom and trim nails, you will be less impressed than if you pick this up first.  There is a great deal of useful information about how to find the right dog.  But a lot of the information is generic, and applicable to any breed.  Also as in joys books of this kind,  some of the information is presented as gospel.  For example, the author talks about the benefits of early spay neither.  He has a great deal of company here, but it is worth noting that early spay neuter may well not be in the best interest of the dog's long term health.

There are lots of books out there about the mechanics of training.  This book is unique because it helps you understand how your dog is reading you, and therefore, why your training  might not be working.Or worse, why your behavior may be having exactly the opposite effect from what you intend: Just the other day I greeted my neighbor's sweet Golden on the sidewalk by coming up to her and patting her head, only to find out from this book that this was a total affront and the very worst way to approach any dog.

"I have a small facial epilator that I love so was happy to have an opportunity to have this Panasonic combined epilator and shaver.  The Panasonic unit comes with two heads, one for epilation and the other for shaving.  It also comes with a charger, a little brush for cleaning (you might miss this as it is the same color as the packaging and very small), and a pouch that is large enough to store all the components.The Panasonic is recommended for use as an epilator only on the legs below the knee and on the top sides of the forearms.  Not the face, and not the bikini area.  As a shaver it can be used in all the usual places.Because I have been using a facial epilator, I was prepared for the sensation of having the hairs pulled out.  Not pleasant but really no big deal, quite endurable on the legs. (no interest in using on arms).  It leaves the skin much cleaner/softer than shaving.  I am really pleased!  I would probably never have purchased this but now that I have it I can say that it is really worth having.  It has made a very noticeable difference with respect to the smoothness of my legs.It is a very competent shaver; easy to use and did a fine job on areas where you cannot use the epilator.The two heads are very easy to pop out and re-install.I am really surprised at how much I like this, despite the fact that I have already been using a facial epilator for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14MQU8G9H3ED4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XN1PQIE#wasThisHelpful","R14MQU8G9H3ED4","A15T487HNTIOF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15T487HNTIOF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow I am editing my review and increasing to 5 stars.  After using for a week I can see a definite difference in the area under my eyes.  I almost cannot believe what I am seeing.  There is significantly less puffiness and the area looks lighter.  I am quite skeptical about the power of over-the-counter preparations, but this really has made a difference.  Thinking of purchasing a back-up jar of this even though I have barely made a dent in the first jar.This eye cream is fairly thick/dense.  It does not have a lot of slip -- you need to pat it on.  It doesn't feel very emollient, but it stays in place without migrating.  It is entirely fragrance free.  If you put it on before bed, you can still feel that it is on your skin in the morning.  It is paraben-free and non-irritating.  I do believe that it may have slightly reduced under-eye puffiness, but that could be wishful thinking.  I prefer this to the Kiehl's Avocado Eye Cream, which I had been using before getting this.  The Kiehl's has a lot more slip to it but does not feel like it is staying put nearly as well as this eb5 eye cream.  The other product that I have used on my eyes is Sukin Moisturizing cream.  This is not an eye cream specifically but it is also paraben free, non-irritating, and works very well as an eye cream -- does not migrate and moisturizes well.  By contrast the eb5 is thicker/tackier and feels more present on the surface of the skin.  The Sukin is more moisturizing but does not stay on the skin as long.  I think I prefer a slightly lighter weight product such as the Sukin for day; the eb5 is better for night as it seems to stay on longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37Q9DXTIEVKXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHZC06E#wasThisHelpful","R37Q9DXTIEVKXJ","A15T487HNTIOF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15T487HNTIOF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ticks all the boxes for me.  I rarely wear make-up but when I do, it is because I want something that will cover the darkness and veins below my eyes.  But I also want something that is moisturizing, not tacky.  Something that glides on easily, and does not settle in pores.  Something that feels good on, which means basically feeling like nothing is on.  As we all know the best makeup is the one that improves the appearance of your skin but doesn't look like you're wearing make-up.  This product really does strike that balance quite well.  The tube says ""avoid eye area"".  I found it to be fine in the area below my eyes, but did not put it close to my eyes.  It is absolutely non-irritating on me, has no fragrance and is oil free, non-comedogenic and paraben free.  It feels moist on but does not have any shine to it.

"Design books are my crack, and this delivers quite a high.  It is a gorgeous book, large (10 by 12) with full excellent quality large, full color photos on nearly every one of its 250 pages.  The book features fourteen projects designed by the team of three architects.  They are all ""shingle"" style, but they vary widely from contemporary to traditional.  Many of the houses are brand new but several are renovations and expansions of existing residences.  My personal favorite is the second one -- a Craftsman style house that was renovated and added on to.  The shingle style is so interesting architecturally because it provides a great deal of freedom.  There is no one dictated set of principles or geometries, as there would be, for example in a classical Georgian.  The Shingle style house can be symmetrical or not, it can be any size, with any kind of trim and fenestration.  There is enormous range among the fourteen houses featured here.  There is a short essay be one of the three architects for each of the fourteen projects, describing the siting, the challenges and the design philosophy and principles.  Each house is photographed lavishly, inside and out.  I will never design or have an opportunity to live in a house as glorious as any of these but for a short while at least I can take pleasure in seeing what some of the best designed houses look like.

The new Chamberlain unit is belt driven rather than chain driven (like the old unit) and is impressively quiet.  I had not even realized how loud the old one was.  The old unit had a more solid robust feeling but the new unit is certainly up to doing the job.  The installation was not easy -- doable but a challenge.  The directions contain many warnings about following specific guidelines to avoid ""death or injury"".  We are very pleased with the operation of this unit and amazed at how quiet it is.  But be forewarned:  the installation is not a slam dunk.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QKNJZUG7PXO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UGZYOM#wasThisHelpful","R3QKNJZUG7PXO8","A15T487HNTIOF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15T487HNTIOF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This moisture cream contains the usual suspects: water (though it is ""mineral spring"" water), glycereth-26, cyclomethicone, glycerin, aloe barbadensis -- you get the picture -- mostly the same stuff you find in most moisturizing potions, from the least to most expensive. It is paraben free, which is good.  But I really did not care for this for two reasons: (1) it leaves a sticky feeling on your skin and (2) it has a  chemical scent that I really do not like.  Reaction to fragrance is a very personal thing.  Others may like it but I for one really do not.

"I have no trouble falling asleep initially, but like many my age I wake during the night.  As you age your own production of melatonin wanes so that you ""break through"" to wakefulness during the stages of  the sleep  cycle that bring you up out of dreaming.  I had been waking several times every night and had difficulty getting back to sleep.  This product does work quite well.  But, the instructions say you should hold it under your tongue for about 40 seconds.  You should not just put it in your mouth and swallow right away.  So, to hold it in your mouth under your tongue you have to kind of sit up in bed, which in itself brings you more into wakefulness.  Taking the pill (1/2 of a 3 mg pill) was easier.

"Received this through the Amazon Vine program.  This replaced a Lynksys E8350 which is several years old.  Worked great but has been dropping the network a lot lately.  (Isolated to the WiFi as my Macbook stayed connected fine at the Apple Store).  The new OnHub router comes in an elegant package with cords -- including a long and short so you can get the OnHub to a place where it is more or less out in the open, which the directions strongly suggest.  It was supposed to also come with a quick set up guide and did not, but the guide is available online.  Once I connected to power the OnHub downloaded a new update (you find out what's happening on your IOS device, where you have downloaded the OnHub App).  This took a few minutes, during which you are placated with folksy messages such as ""You have time to make a cup of tea.""  Once the updates are downloaded and installed, the OnHub finds all your devices and you just connect to them in settings.  I had to re-enter the password into the Brother printer but once I did it was up and running.The OnHub provides good signal strength throughout our old house (lathe and plaster walls).  It is located on the main floor and wifi is fine on the third (attic) floor.  Pages are loading much faster than previously.One of the nice features of the OnHub is that you can go into the App and tell it to prioritize one of your devices for a designated period of time so that, for example, if you want to use the iPad to watch Downton Abbey you can funnel all the wi fi bandwidth to the iPad for a couple of hours or however long you wish.  In our house it is currently supporting one printer, one MacBook Pro, two iPhones and an iPad with no problems.I am thrilled to have this.  It really is extremely user friendly and a very welcome replacement for our sick and dying Linksys router.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BAVCVUPXAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ALA9LA#wasThisHelpful","R38BAVCVUPXAL","A15T487HNTIOF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15T487HNTIOF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this watch through the Amazon Vine program.  This is a man's watch and I am a woman.  I wanted this watch for a specific purpose and this watch and this watch is a great match for my needs.  This is a large and very heavy watch.  The large white numbers on the black dial are very easily read even from a distance.  The watch is moisture proof and both feels and appears very heavy duty and durable.I go to heated power vinyasa classes nearly every day.  The clock in the room is not visible from where I like to be.  I really need to see how much more of the class remains in order to pace myself.  Had been taking my dress watch into the room but felt uneasy about putting it down on the front edge of my mat in this very hot and humid room.  And could not see the face well from a standing position.This Invicta Men's watch is perfect for my needs.  I can see the numbers clearly even when it is on the floor and I am standing.  I have no worries about the heat and humidity harming it.  So I am more than pleased as it is a great match with the requirements of my specific application. There is no date or other features but that is fine with me.  But I would caution that it is a heavy and bulky watch which I cannot imagine being worn on an all-day every-day purpose except by a quite large person.  It arrived in a gorgeous bright yellow elaborate case with generous yellow suede padding so would make for a great gift presentation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YRL2WGOJ5CO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011N5PRNU#wasThisHelpful","R1YRL2WGOJ5CO9","A15T487HNTIOF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15T487HNTIOF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love short stories and have read through this collection every year.  It is actually a little melancholy to receive this now and to know there will not (or ever again) be a story by Jphn Updike or Philip Roth (who stopped publishing a couple of years ago) or Rayond Carver or Andre Dubos or James Salter. . . the list goes on.  But this was the first time I received a collection  in whichI didn't recognize a single name.  No Alice Munro, no Ann Beattie . . . .I am giving my age away and so may as well confess while I am at it that my tastes in short fiction run toward the traditional (have you already guess that?)  I appreciate but do not really enjoy the black humor, the magical realism that so many contemporary authors are drawn to.  I was happy to find that many of the stories in this collection were very much to my taste.  Several, I loved.  One in particular, ""Lady Lazarus"" gripped me and held me from beginning to end.  This story alone was worth having the collection for.If it were not for this annual collection I would likely lose touch with contemporary fiction.

"Just had to add my vote to all the other reviews.  This really works.  And I too have found that it nearly completely ""healed"" a vertical split in one of my finger nails.  For years I had been polishing my nails and then had the bad habit of pulling the polish off the nail when it would start to chip.  Then I used nail products like Nail Tek that only seemed to make it worse.  Finally after forswearing all nail products for a while, I came to understand that even in their natural state the main problem was lack of moisture, not lack of hardness.  The first product I tried is Trind Nail Balsam, and that made a huge difference, used twice a day.  Then I came across this and have to say I think it is even more effective.  The Trind does moisturize the nails but the CND leaves a very light protective coating.  I continue to use both products as often during the day as I can.  My nails finally look healthy, better than I can every remember them looking.  I will never use polish on them again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R498X4ZZAN3PG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6IC4BE#wasThisHelpful","R498X4ZZAN3PG","A15T487HNTIOF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15T487HNTIOF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is so expensive (which is why I gave it four stores rather than five).  But it is truly better than any other sunscreen I have tried, and I have tried many.  This is a ""physical"" sunscreen rather than a chemical sunscreen.  After reading about the two types I decided that I wanted to use only a physical sunscreen even though they tend to be thicker and less lovely from a cosmetic point of view.  They protect just as well and they are felt to be safer, as some of the chemicals used in chemical sunscreens are questionable.The Clarins sunscreen has a wonderful texture -- amazing slip and goes on so smoothly, but with no feeling of oiliness at all.  It is slightly white on your face for a moment, but quickly becomes completely sheer.  Once you try this, you're hooked as all the other sunscreens feel so much heavier and greasy by comparison.I continue to use a really heavy duty screen on my face when I swim laps -- my face is white when I head out to the pool.

"When I acquired a pre-owned LV Cabas Mezzo I did a lot of research on products to protect the vachetta leather.  This bag has vachetta straps and a vachetta bottom.  It had already developed an even patina.  The bag was made in 2003, and kept in a dust bag for nearly the entire past 12 years.  So everything I report about my experience applies only to vachetta that already has some patina.There are many people reporting their experiences on The Purse Forum.  Among the many products, two brands seem to have the greatest following for treating and protecting vachetta.  There is that very expensive vachetta kit which has its loyal followers.  A tiny 50ml bottle of conditioner will set you back over $20 and even this brand has some users who are not happy about what happened when they used the product on new vachetta.  And then there is Apple.I have used Apple Garde and Apple Conditioner on other bags and after doing all the research I decided to try it on my new-to-me Cabas Mezzo.  I used the Garde first and then the conditioner.  The Garde did not change the color or texture of the leather at all.  The conditioner darkened the leather very slightly, and left the leather feeling smooth, and the straps were even more supple than before.  I am greatly relieved and completely satisfied at least for now.There are all kinds of warnings that you should not use anything at all on LV vachetta, and that LV warns against using anything.  And yet the vachetta is very vulnerable to water spotting and soiling.  After doing all the research it seems that the best approach is to use nothing on new vachetta.  Wait until the bag develops a light to medium patina, and then condition and protect.  The problem is -- what do you do while you're waiting?  Some people actually sun tan their bags for a few weeks.  My bag was stored away like a fine wine.  There really seems to be something of an advantage in acquiring a pre-owned bag if you can find one in great condition.It is curious that there is no manufacturer's site that you can find online, nor are there clear directions provided.  Which should be applied first -- the Garde or the conditioner?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCPME8K91TX0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B6F88N4#wasThisHelpful","RCPME8K91TX0O","A15T487HNTIOF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15T487HNTIOF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used this with great success on several bags.  Recently acquired a  2003 Vuitton Cabas Mezzo.  This bag has vachetta straps and a vachetta bottom.

"There is nothing especially revolutionary about this product -- it uses a HEPA filter, a carbon filter and a fan.The good:  it works very well even on low speed.  And it is quiet on low speed.  (rather loud on high speed).  We have an aged dog who is no longer trained (she is pretty out of it).  She spends a lot of the time in the basement laundry room, which we have lined with towels that are washed daily.  Still, the room smelled awful.  This unit made a very big difference after only a couple of hours.  We were very impressed.The bad:  You have to replace both the HEPA and carbon filters every few months (interval dependent on usage).  I went to the Fellowes web site to check prices.  This is a new model of air purifier and the parts for it (9406402 carbon filter and HEPA filter 9406502) are not up on the site yet.  But the price of HEPA filters for the other models range from about $40 to $60.  The carbon filters are less -- $!0-$20.So we have a little bit of the Gillette razor blade model going on here.

"What I like about this:  The colors are excellent because there is a good range from very light vanilla to very dark charcoal, and there are some very useful medium- dark taupes that are great for every day.  The box containing the palette is a nice quality solid plastic that will keep the shadows safe, and it is quite small -- about the size of an iPhone 6. The rose colors are pretty and fairly subtle.What I wish were different-- only two of the twelve are truly matte. Six  are slightly to moderately shimmery.  Four are very sparkly and probably will not be very useful, at least for me.  I would have preferred more matte colors.  The shadows are a little crumbly-powdery.  They're OK but if you compare to Urban Decay, the difference is pretty apparent.  These are fine especially at this price point.  It's fun to have a palette and much more affordable here than some of the other brands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZKYO2ZFHWKSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKP1M2K#wasThisHelpful","R2ZKYO2ZFHWKSK","A15T487HNTIOF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15T487HNTIOF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Have been using these for decades!  I had really bad frown lines.  For years these really helped.  But the frown lines were so persistent that I decided to start getting Botox -- and have been doing so for several years.  But I continue to use the Frownies every night!  I think it helps the Botox to last longer -- just my opinion, but everything you can do to make those muscles quit working and just atrophy from lack of use has got to be helpful.  I am so used to putting on the Frownie at night that it has become part of my lights out routine and I just feel something is amiss if I don't have one on.

"These tools are really substantial and solid, not thin and bendy like other silicone tools I have seen.  They have a good feel in the hand and are a pleasure to use.  They are heat proof to 480 degrees so no worries using them on things straight out of the oven or in boiling water.  I was surprised at the size -- they are on the small side.  Not a real problem as I have larger spoons and spatulas.  But if this is going to be your only set you may feel the need to augment with some larger tools.  The bright red color is not my personal favorite but it serves a function as these are easy to spot in my crowded kitchen tool drawer.

"I purchased this based on the reviews.  Was really anxious about having to do the installation but am happy to report that it went very easily.  I have Time Warner cable internet, and no phone or TV at all.  I  disconnected the old TW Ubee modem and connected this to the power and then directly to the computer.  The install page with the MAC number came up immediately.  My page instructed me to call Time Warner.  I got a helpful person after just a few screens.  It took a few minutes to get the modem activated, and then the TW person made sure that it worked when I switched from direct connect  to my WiFi router.  I am on the TW standard tier and routinely do the test to make sure I am getting the speed that I am supposed to be getting .  So I didn't expect to see an improvement when I swapped modems but in fact pages are loading a lot faster now.  I wish I had not waited so long to get my own cable modem!!!!The primary reason that I had delayed was the fear that if I ran into problems that TW would back away and blame the problems on my modem.  But so many people have their own modems now and are reading about how to deal with the cable providers that it seems that there is a lot less risk in going with your own modem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R54FQKSK03DIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJHDZSI#wasThisHelpful","R54FQKSK03DIK","A15T487HNTIOF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15T487HNTIOF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had the Aqua Sphere Kaiman EXO goggles and liked them but found them to be too wide so I ordered these.  The Kaiman Lady Swim goggles are only a tiny bit less wide than the regular  Kaiman EXO but it is enough to make a difference -- these fit on my face with no overlap on to the swim cap.  Have worn them for half a dozen long lap swims now and they have not leaked, or fogged.  I would not mind if they were even a bit more narrow.  The primary size reduction seems to have been on the vertical axis -- they are not as deep as the regular size.  They suck in fairly tight around the eye (though I do not have any problem with them hitting my lashes), and they leave rings on my face.  But they do work.  The material that provides the seal is not as soft as the EXO and I kind of regret that I did not order the Lady EXO.

"This is a very attractive hard cover book filled with recipes for juices, smoothies, soups and salads.  There is a brief introductory chapter narrating the author's experience recovering from breast cancer and regaining health, which she largely attributes to her green juice regimen.  But this is essentially a recipe book.  I got a lot of new ideas and found the recipes very useful, if a bit repetitive.  I am really glad to have this book as a reference.  However, I do think you can find many recipes for green and other juices, smoothes, soups etc online so it is a luxury to have a book dedicated to this.A couple of other observations:  the author says she has tried many juicers and prefers the Breville Juice Fountain.  I have this product.  This is not a review for the Breville Juice Fountain, but I will just comment that, while I agree with the author that the Breville is a great solid machine that makes juicing easy, even fun, it is also a big heavy unit --- it is either going to take up a lot of space on your counter or be a very heavy item to store away and take out every time you use it.  Also, it does come apart easily for cleaning, but the mesh strainer requires several minutes of careful scrubbing every time you use it.  It is not a trivial clean up job.Also, the focus of the book is on green -- kale, spinach, celery, cucumbers -- which I accept, but I do think that a more balanced approach would be welcome.  There are four recipes that use carrots but the author states that carrots contain a lot of sugar and so she doesn't use them that much.  No mention of beets at all.  So, ""Daily Greens"" is great as far as it goes, but it does not really offer complete coverage of the array of nutritious produce that you can use for juices and smoothies.All in all, a very pleasing and useful compendium of recipes, but with a few caveats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R322YPN7ENGO86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631060325#wasThisHelpful","R322YPN7ENGO86","A15T487HNTIOF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15T487HNTIOF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I use wireless speakers (UE Boom do a great job) as a rule for outdoors but thought these would be a great option.  My husband was able to wire these up and once installed, I had fun testing it out.  The speakers are water resistant not waterproof so placement was key.  This sound system incorporates bluetooth and it works more than 20' but less than 50.

"(3.5 STARS) I got this software for basic book keeping and it does that and a whole lot more.  This version includes the most options and allows for three users which was a primary concern for me.  Let me start by admitting that I do not have a background in accounting so the software was not as intuitive as I would have liked and I'm not using it for a small company but for a 40+ committee.  The options were amazing and it offered professional grade invoices and financial statements.  It can be set up to manage direct deposits, print checks and a whole host of small business needs (payroll, inventory, audits, etc.) that I do not require at this point.  This software is overkill for my purposes but would work well for a small to mid sized businesses.

I like the cup of coffee it brews, being able to see the water level and adjust coffee grounds, and the thermal carafe is a thing of beauty but the plastic filter is a major disappointment (especially considering the amount spent). The plastic looks good (albeit cheap and it soooo wasn't) for the first month or so and then the wear shows. Also, it can get clogged and overflow on occasion.  Thankfully, I've earned from previous attempts at replacing my aging Krups coffee machine and keep it as back up because this one lasted five months before being shelved.

"I have a wireless UE Boom speaker so I grabbed the opportunity for a wireless UE Boom 2 speaker.  I've posted a photo to show the differences.  The UE Boom 2 is the one on the right.  While the speakers are the same size, the cases are different.  The amazing 360 sound quality is the same but the wireless range is DOUBLE from the original.  I didn't break out a measuring tape but the claims of 100 ft is about right.  They kept the large + and - volume buttons (just tap to use) which is super convenient and they added the function of tapping the top of the speaker (use two fingers or it won't work) once to pause/play and twice to skip a song.  This feature is very cool but did not work consistently.  They also changed up the recharging and jack features.  They are on the bottom of the Boom speaker and on top under rubber flaps on Boom 2.  I prefer the open ports (more convenient) over the covered but I'm assuming it keeps it cleaner and helps prevent loss of function.  They have also improved the playing time.  I get around 9-12 hours on the original and 10-13 on the Boom 2; granted, a slight improvement but I'll take it.  I cannot find a way to double up a Boom and Boom 2 speaker but I have a call into Logitech to see if this can be configured.  Overall, I LOVE the sound quality, convenience, and mobility these speakers provide and at the same cost as the Boom, I would recommend these for double the wireless range.  I might even spring for the Mega Boom speaker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROW3G5S4I99UT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014M8ZO8S#wasThisHelpful","ROW3G5S4I99UT","A18S2VGUH9SCV5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18S2VGUH9SCV5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My favorite mascaras are Benefit (Are They Real) and Smashbox.  I ordered this based on the details and figured it was worth a try as it's much cheaper than my favs.  Overall, it provides good coverage and the price is a deal.  I'm not a fan of the funky container as I keep trying the open the wrong end - the  slimmer end is the base (not sure who thought this was a brilliant idea).  The wand is slim and has a lot of short bristles and does not apply as smoothly as I'd like but that may be due to me being used to the long and fuller wands of Benefit and Smashbox, which makes coating every lash easier.  It took me 4-5 swipes of the wand to get my lashes fully coated.

"I was thrilled by the performance and multi functional cleaning uses of this Bissell steamer at first but after a month of constant use, the detachable function no longer works.  I was looking forward to receiving this steam mop/cleaner and opened it as soon as it arrived.  I may have even grabbed it out of the mailman's hands I was so excited to try it. I have 2 dogs, 2 cats and 2 boys that all seem intent on making the house as messy as possible.  It's a never ending battle.  It was easy to assemble, fill with water and use (I added a few drops of fresh lemon juice to the water, I have no idea if this is a good idea on certain flooring).  It left my floors clean and with a fresher scent.  The water container lasts for a more than a medium sized room.  I really needed this for the attachment steamer that easily disconnects from the mop to steam clean certain chairs and sofas that I see pets slinking off of in the morning.  I currently use Febreeze(TM) but figured this was a better way to actually remove pet smells instead of masking it.  There isn't an attachment made for upholstery cleaning  but we used one of the small ones and it worked like a charm on the sofa and chairs for the first month.  I also used it to clean around my kitchen and it did an amazing job at getting rid of the gunk between my counter and undermount sink but I doubt I'd use it every time I clean.  Unfortunately, the handheld steamer would no longer operate once detached from the mop (stuck on ready button) and as strictly a mop, it works but the draw was the multiple uses of one device.UPDATE:  After hearing from Bissell, I contacted customer support (1-800-237-7691) and did not have the best results.  Bottom line, I probably caused the issue by adding fresh lemon juice and even though it's not a chemical and I've used it with other steam mops and cleaners, it was the likely culprit.  I am still disappointed by customer service whose english was limited and did not provide help.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R296RSG25RD1IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LS47SA#wasThisHelpful","R296RSG25RD1IX","A18S2VGUH9SCV5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18S2VGUH9SCV5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have gone through close to a printer a year and figured at $100-150 a pop, it was smarter to move up to a higher end model.  I ordered this model and I could hit myself for not doing this sooner.  I'm not sure if it's the brand as my previous printers were HP, Lexmark or Canon or going up to a higher end model but it's a winner!  The only downside is the real estate it takes up but it more than makes up for it in performance.  Heck I'll build it it's own cabinet if it keeps performing so well.  Our printer gets used daily.  It needs to handle two school kids (have you seen the homework they have?), business reports and newsletters for school.  I really hate reading instruction manuals and this printer was very user friendly and intuitive to set up.  A cd was enclosed for convenience but drivers can easily be downloaded.  I called customer support when I had a problem printing from my iPad but it was user error, not the machine, and they were nice about it.Printer Overall:+ Ink cartridges last up to 2 years and are cheap to replace - NOT SURE, have to get back to you on this.+ Can easily set up wi-fi printing - CHECK!+ Can print easily from your iPhone, iPad and other devices - CHECK!+ Can handle volume printing without issue - OH YEA!  A 72 page monthly report was printed and it never stumbled.+ Up to 30 pages can be used on Auto Feeder - CHECK!

"Mix two very active boys, two dogs and a backyard and you get filthy clothes by the end of the day.  True story, I once had a pair of shorts that could stand up by itself because it was so caked with dried mud.  I sat folding their clothes thinking they looked really dirty and knew I had to try a new washing detergent because I can't spray their whole shirt with Shout.

"I am NOT a fan of this coffee maker.  I love coffee.  I depend on it to get me through the day so having a tasty and reliable source of it is almost a ""need"" and not a ""want.""  I have a trusty Krupps coffee maker but it's getting really old and I was looking to upgrade.  I ran across raves about Breville being the king of coffee makers and decided on this model, despite the high price tag. I should have checked the reviews here first.....Breville is suppose to be the top of the line coffee maker but my Krupps brews just as tasty a cuppa and costs a heck of lot less.  I was forced to read the manual to be able to use all the features but didn't end up using many as they performed inconsistently.  I cannot detect much of a difference between the mild to bold taste feature when brewing coffee although the boldest setting does have more depth, sometimes.  It doesn't seem to work all the time but I'm not sure if that is dependent on the type of coffee grounds used.  I did like the ability to brew for a cup, a travel mug or a pot of coffee.

"Not sure how I ran across this book but I liked it enough to look for and read others by this author.  The back story of three men who formed a brotherhood while in Serbian refugee camps was interesting and one of them, Niko, is a background character in the Dance Series (Tap Dance).  I hope his story is next but didn't mind meeting Brand in this intro to the series.  Love that it's a complete story and didn't end on a cliffhanger but leaves you wanting to know more about other characters for future books.  The heroine, Reese, was a good match for Brand and the author knows how to write interesting characters.There are plenty of sex scenes without going overboard.  I liked the suspense element to this story but found it to be more fun fiction then realistic (MC resolution and family issues).  There were minor editing issues.  I'm feeling a definite Kristen Ashley influence but in a complimentary way and not a ripping off another author way so if you like KA's books and are looking for something to read, I highly recommend this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LNVH5MF51616/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GT5MPNK#wasThisHelpful","R2LNVH5MF51616","A18S2VGUH9SCV5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18S2VGUH9SCV5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very basic wireless router for a simple set up.  I would recommend this for those with few wireless gadgets and simply need a wireless connection without much fuss and the parental controls feature.  It was easy to figure out, connect and get it up and running.  This was ordered to provide a simple wireless connection for a parent with no tech savy and this model appears to provide exactly that with solid performance.  I also like the parental controls feature that allows you to block access and really like the low price (~$30).I will report back on the parental controls feature (great idea for grandparents) and if there are any problems but so far, it works smoothly with no issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X5Z5YSWATTQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZJU6NY#wasThisHelpful","R1X5Z5YSWATTQG","A18S2VGUH9SCV5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18S2VGUH9SCV5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this one for two reasons: (1) needed to save space on my kitchen counter and (2) looking for a cheap but functional microwave.  Five months later, I'm still happy with this purchase.  I paid around $140 for a high end name brand microwave that took up a lot of space and wasn't very user friendly (needed to read the manual to use functions) and this one I got on sale ($60) and find it performs the same, maybe even better.This microwave does not have a push button to open the door like most; instead; it has a handle that takes some getting use to - my kids constantly move the microwave when pulling on the handle to open the door.  Not the best design but I still like it over my old one.  It has plenty of useful buttons: beverage, pizza, dinner plate (love this one!), frozen veggies, fresh veggies, popcorn and soup.  This microwave defrosts without cooking and doesn't seem to overcook food as easily as others I've used.If you are looking for a space efficient microwave that provides a lot of function at a bargain price, I recommend this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30XUI7TCZYL22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014E65YQ#wasThisHelpful","R30XUI7TCZYL22","A18S2VGUH9SCV5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18S2VGUH9SCV5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was a sweet enough story but it was too inconsistent to recommend.  It has the tough alpha male with a gentle side and  affable heroine but their story didn't gel.  Maybe it was the overtly sexual daydreams the characters have about each other but [SPOILER] when they become a couple, decide to live together without sex......for a REALLY long time.  Seriously!?!  This didn't make much  sense.

"How does Jessica Clare (Jill Myles) do this?  Make me read a book series about fictional reality tv series?  I stumbled across the first book in this Games Series (""Wicked Games"") and now eagerly look for each new one as it's released.  This fourth book is based on a Big Brother type format and although it contains familiar characters (from the 2nd book, ""Playing Games""), it's not necessary to have read previous books.  The author took a character I disliked and turned him into swoonworthy within a couple of chapters.  That takes talent.If you are a fan of those reality tv game shows, this book will really appeal to you and if you're not, it will still appeal.  There is something about this author that sucks me into her stories.  Maybe its her well defined characters, witty dialogue, sexual situations without being too vulgar (think R rated), plot lines that keep your interest or maybe, she just knows how to write a great story.The beauty of this series is that you don't have to have read the previous books to get it.

"I liked the first book in this trilogy (White Trash beautiful) so I got this book as soon as it was available.  I was happy to revisit the lives of Cass and Tucker.  Although Cass was a little whiny in the first installment, she had plenty of reasons to be that way so I cut her slack.I liked how the author highlighted the rock star/regular person relationship rather than ignore the inherent issues like  most books in this genre.  Cass deals with serious issues and certain passages were gut wrenching.  Jealousy and alpha male hotness abounds but too much whining from Cass prevented me from rating this book higher.  At certain sections I wanted to yell at Cass to get a backbone.  She was unhappy being labeled fragile by Tucker but acted that way and sniveled far too many times.I will not be in a hurry to get the final book in this trilogy but I will read it, probably from my local library.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B55Z2BD4E655/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSBVDQ0#wasThisHelpful","R3B55Z2BD4E655","A18S2VGUH9SCV5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18S2VGUH9SCV5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have used several different types of pencil sharpeners - battery and electric with lousy results.

The pencil shavings are neatly stored in a see thru container that easily slides out and locks back into place after emptying.

I liked the blend of young love, private school drama and espionage.  The spark between Taylor and Colt is full of heat and teen angst.  There's a lot to like in this story.This is the first in a two part series with the next one (Tempted) due out shortly so although this book does leave you hanging, you won't have to wait long for the conclusion.  I appreciated knowing upfront that it was a two-part series.  Am I the only one who gets ticked reading a story only to find out it ends on a to-be-continued note?The price listed might warrant better editing but at a little over 300 pages, reasonable for a good story.

"This is the first book in the Duke of Brimstone series.  It sets up the mythogical land of CHALYS, a Monaco type place where modern technological is not allowed and there's a forbidden area shielded by dark woods where things that go bump in the night live and no human has survived to tell tales.The author certainly knows how to set an intriguing scene and this story is no exception.  This forbidden area is ruled by Brimstone and his friends include werewolves, vampires and other paranormals.  It's got a dark brooding Hero and a feisty heroine like others in this genre but the author knows her way around dialogue and writes a compelling story.  So why not 5 stars?  Maybe Marian Tee set too high a bar (I've read several of her books, PARK and VIOLET and SUIT and FANGS were amazing) or maybe too much time is spent setting up this new world when it's around 150 pages but either way, it still works.The writing is witty and hot and worth the price and time to read it.

The glitter effect is pretty cool but when using, be sure to cover your face and clothes since it sprays all over.

I only wish this author had more available.This book is a mix of mystery and romance with the heroine (Katie) narrating the story with a very funny and unique voice.  She is snarky without being too much and entertaining as heck.  Her relationships define her in the best way.  I love Katie's interaction with the Hero and her best friend from Kindergarten.

Between helping Bastien with a super interesting project/mission and trying to figure out the key to Doug's  new fame, Georgina is busy. The story moves very quickly and is almost always interesting and awesome.The Bad: The one not awesome point: Georgina's flirtation with Seth worked in the first book , but as a relationship in this book it turns annoying. They can't be together physically. She needs to have sex with other men. He accepts that? To be with her? Why?

"The Good: Another painful book for Merry. Another book where she proves she's strong enough to handle all that is thrown at here, even when she doesn't always believe in herself. A huge amount of action in a relatively short period of time means the book is extremely fast paced. Now down time, no opportunity to emotionally deal with all that's being thrown at us. Hamilton is on a role with consistent plot progression in the last few books and Swallowing Darkness takes us into some very unexpected places. Choices are made. Serious choices. Choices that readers will love and hate at the same time. The main question after this book is - where do we go from here?

Frost's backstory was an important inclusion here, really explaining who he is and why he's different than the other sidhe.The Bad: This is another shorter book and I sincerely believe it should have been combined with Mistral's Kiss to make one larger novel that would fit better with the flow of the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18HGFBE80UIR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345495918#wasThisHelpful","R18HGFBE80UIR1","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Good: I really enjoyed the entirely of Rose questioning her own sanity. The way it was effecting her ability to perform up to her usual standards put her on the same playing field as some of the other students. It also made her more relatable. She's no longer only tough, rule breaking, does what she want girl. She's growing to consider others, and not just Lissa. She's finally getting some real answers with Dimitri and honestly, that's a huge part of my love for this book. We so needed progress in that area.The Bad: The ending left me annoyed. Yes, it does it's job of making me need to know what will happen. But it just felt wrong. Out of left field, and not in a wow what a shock type of way. Also, this book was really long. Much longer than it needed to be. We rehashed the past over and over when a vague bit and here and there would have done fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BYGOB4SSLR00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595141979#wasThisHelpful","R2BYGOB4SSLR00","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: Puck is amazing and Ash isn't bad at all either. The love triangle works because both of the guys in Meghan's life are so different, but equally as good for her. It would make sense for her to be with either one of them. There is a good amount of action in this book, some twists and a major surprise or two. The pace is extreme and it was extremely hard to put down once I started.The Bad: Meghan makes some strides in growing up, accepting the world around her and not whining all the damned time. Now she only whines about 50% of the time and is annoying, yet tolerable. While I love her story, her personality grates.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10PSDRYB4JRJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373210183#wasThisHelpful","R10PSDRYB4JRJ9","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: The Cat and Bones dynamic is super sexy. They're very close, but at the same time, they're starting all over again after having been apart for so long. They're still learning about each other and what has transpired in their time apart. Some decent revelations here, mostly unexpected. The mystery didn't feel like a traditional mystery in that we were searching for answers as much as we were seeing how the characters were dealing with the problem. We were waiting to see how everything turned out for them.The Bad: I had to keep reminding myself that this wasn't the first book in the series and that I had actually read the previous book. While Cat was a familiar character, her situation was much different that the previous book. The world building has been established, but there was a huge amount of government job specific building that really made it feel like we were starting over. Normally, that would be fine, but being only the second book in the series, I would have wanted to get more character centric progress as opposed to having to rework a lot of what we had experienced in the first book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32DZOW44H7IK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061245097#wasThisHelpful","R32DZOW44H7IK2","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: V's backstory was completely laid out, surprising and totally emotion pulling. We learn what he's been through to make him as troubled as he is now. As with all the previous books in the series, no matter what you think of the main brother of the story going in, you can't help becoming very attached to him as the story goes on. His future destiny is equally as unfair as his past and seeing him struggle with it - vying between destiny/duty and love kept me completely glued to the page. No huge battles with the lessers here, which I was quite thankful for as they are the worst part of the series for me. We get to see the other brothers stories continue to unfold in bits and pieces we didn't know we were missing.The Bad: Jane wasn't a great fit for V. Yeah, she's willing, eventually, but she feels too available to his wants. Or something. It's hard to describe, just a gut feeling I had the entire time I was reading their time together that they just felt wrong. And I would have liked it if V hadn't found it necessary to hold back so much every time things got a little frisky. I get being scared, but if you have to hide this much of your need, maybe she isn't the girl for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JA2OHI4CH194/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451222350#wasThisHelpful","R1JA2OHI4CH194","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: I think this is where the TV show veers sharply away from the books. This book has a ridiculous amount of surprises, even for the avid show fan. You go in expecting one thing, or if you watch the you are expecting something different, what you get is something completely off the wall unexpected - and that's sort of amazing. Huge, HUGE, shocking revelations in this book just blew my mind. Sansa and Jaime really shine here, their stories fleshing out and growing their characters. The book slowed down a lot on the action and replaced it with political intrigue and setup for future events. The pace was slow but completely engaging.The Bad: I hadn't noticed while reading, which probably says something, but this book only covers half of the characters. The last section of the book mentions that this installation in the series focuses on those close to King's Landing and that the next book will focus on those farther away like Stannis, Daenerys, Jon and Tyrion. So, while very long, the book only covers half of the current story. The next book is supposed to cover the same exact time period, which really should have been covered here. I would have rather had half the time covered, but all the characters - all the story lines playing out at once.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S6YGPA0WADZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055358202X#wasThisHelpful","R1S6YGPA0WADZ9","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: I postponed reading this book for years. The cover screamed cheap romance and the title made it seem like it was selling the raunchy aspect over plot of any kind. Needless to say, I went into this book with a very closed mind and expected a large amount of eye rolling during my read through. I found myself pleasantly surprised. Yes, this is paranormal romance. Yes, there are sexy times. I usually enjoy both, by the way. But nothing here was cheap and easy and the book was chock full of exciting story elements. The psychic race was done uniquely, creating a whole unexpected set of obstacles.The Bad: The world building slowed the pace significantly,  but it had to be done. Sascha was internally repetitive at times, making me want to slap her silly for harping on her ""brokenness.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DZ9WSWHRU8M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425212866#wasThisHelpful","R2DZ9WSWHRU8M9","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: I love how this series slowly unfolds the whole paranormal side of things. As the third book, the faerie stuff is coming into the forefront. We still get a ton of answers regarding the ongoing mystery of Olivia's parents crimes, but we also get a lot of the why and how of the town of Cainsville itself. There is a love triangle building up steam, but it's weird. Olivia is sort of stuck between Ricky and Gabriel, but Gabriel has more issues than any character in any book EVER, so romance isn't a possibility for him. The love triangle thing is a predestined deal of sorts, so it's going to play out regardless of its realistic possibilities, which will likely lead to some very interesting events in the future.The Bad: Not a thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EQ0UI2MTRER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052595306X#wasThisHelpful","R1EQ0UI2MTRER","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: Lots of sexy times, a little more hardcore than we've seen before in the series. Variety is good in a series with this much mating going on. Significant increases in power move the story along and give the reader some interesting possibilities for the future. Merry remains awesome, as she masters diplomatic issues and the hardness that is necessary in the world of faerie.The Bad: Mistral's Kiss is significantly shorter than the earlier books in this series. Normally, not a huge deal - but here it's extremely noticeable in the lack of single book mystery. The entire book pushes forward the series but lacks anything that would make it stand out in the series as important on its own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ1NWW1NPCGDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345443616#wasThisHelpful","RJ1NWW1NPCGDN","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: Merry and her men continue to be awesome, navigating the deadly political situation they've been thrust into. A murder mystery in the Slithen mixes the world of magic and faerie with the human forensics. I love how everything Merry says or does changes the whole of faerie. Her every action seems to push the plot into a new direction. You never know what the magic may do.The Bad: The book moves at a quick pace the entire time, except when things get sexy. Those scenes seem to go on at a snails pace. Which makes very little sense since Merry is usually in the middle of a time-sensitive perilous situation when the clothes start coming off. All of this is important to the overall plot of the series, but it would be nice if the pace was balanced throughout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R105ZQ4GKF8WXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345443608#wasThisHelpful","R105ZQ4GKF8WXQ","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: This series is comparable to the Once Upon a Time TV show, except it's a little more messed up. It pushes the envelope more, taking the well known characters into darker places. And that's pretty awesome. Some very good twists in this edition. Definitely plan on continuing on with Fables.The Bad: Animal Farm wasn't quite as good as the first volume, but that's probably tied pretty closely to my dislike of the George Orwell book of the same name. This volume loosely follows the happenings in that book and that particular plot line never works for me.Also: If you enjoy these graphic novels, you have to check out the video game, The Wolf Among Us. It's phenomenal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11J20MS9Z0BZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140120077X#wasThisHelpful","R11J20MS9Z0BZW","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: I continue to read this series in utter disbelief. Jaw hanging open, more often than not. I struggled reading A Storm of Swords - reading as fast as possible to find out what was going to happen next, while trying to slow myself down enough so I didn't miss anything. It's hard to explain my addiction to this series. The characters are so good. So well developed. So complex, that we keep uncovering things we never expected. I am constantly surprised at every plot twist, yet I know I should expect the unexpected at every turn. Nothing is ever as it seems, even when it couldn't possibly be other. If that makes sense. The writing in these books gets under your skin. Martin making you question your initial opinions. Making you love the characters you should be hating. Making you root for things that make you a very bad person. It sort of makes you crazy in the best possible way.The Bad: Not a thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FB4YE1NX2QXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055357342X#wasThisHelpful","R2FB4YE1NX2QXH","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good: The characters in this series continue to amaze me. They are so wonderful. Or horrible, depending. So many secrets, lies, hidden pasts waiting to be uncovered. I never know what was going to be revealed next. The political intrigue plays out in often scandalous fashion. The more I read these books, the more I see the series as primarily historical fiction with a hint of magic thrown in now and again rather than straight high fantasy and that really works for me. A little easier to put down than the last one, but still a very quick read considering the length of the book. Can't stop, have to keep going, have to know what happens next.The Bad: Thing dragged a little more here than in the first book.

"The Good: I'm not a fan of Nora Robert's romance novels, so I dragged my heels in getting around to read her pseudonymous In Death science fiction series. I should not have done that and now have over 40 books I'm excited to catch up on. The mystery is really fantastic and edgy - doing well to illustrate the world Robb is building here. Roarke is a fascinating character, much of his life and history is hidden and rumored, making me want to know it all the more.The Bad: Eve is strong and smart. She's also super annoying when it comes to men. Her budding relation with Roarke is the basis of half the series so I can see why the author would push the issue, but her choices in relation to him are career suicide. Her risk taking based on lust makes her character hard to root for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNVJ79DFFSFUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425148297#wasThisHelpful","RNVJ79DFFSFUL","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Good: I loved this book, and that was a huge surprise. I was vaguely intrigued way back when I heard about this book pre-release, but once I got my hands on it I continually put it off. I love the 80s, but 80s gaming isn't my specialty. I got sucked into the book immediately and read it for hours after I had planned on going to sleep. I picked it up the next day and didn't put it down until I finished it. I was completely enthralled, loving the 80s movie and music mentions, even if the gaming went a bit over my head at times. I often found myself thinking that this was the coolest book every written. The stakes were high, always, and the world was so creative - virtual and real world.

"The Good: People rave about this series. I just didn't get the appeal. From what I had heard, it seemed like every other generic fantasy epic saga. But I sort of wanted to finally check out the TV series (5 seasons behind everyone else) and I have a need to read the books before seeing the movies and shows based on them. So I went into A Game of Thrones expecting to be bored quickly and often. I was absolutely shocked at how quickly I got sucked into the story. I read this book for 3 days straight, did not put it down. Read it walking from one room to another. Read it and woke up with it on my face after my 3 hours of sleep, only to continue reading it immediately. I had to know what was going to happen next. I came to care about the characters in a painful way. Painful, because even those who don't read the series and watch the show know of GRRM's need to kill everyone all the damned time. The book was long. It was very detailed. It is also one of the very few books that carries its length well.

Same horror, same creeptastic situations, same level of danger and excitement - just with teenagers as the main characters.

"My 5 and 6 year old daughters love this playhouse and I totally understand why. It's got lots of pieces and plays fun music. My 2 year old is completely indifferent to it though. Which works out well, as the rocket ship garage refuses to stay attached if moved even slightly and my older kids get annoyed when the baby plays rough with it.This is an attractive set, but the music is loud and doesn't have a volume control. The pieces feel are sturdy enough to withstand most play, as long as they aren't stepped on my adults. Overall, a decent toy for a the higher end of the suggested age group set.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZY10ZXZ885YG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J49UTP4#wasThisHelpful","R2ZY10ZXZ885YG","ABMX8XUNPR3LP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABMX8XUNPR3LP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't even begin to explain the freedom a cordless vacuum brings. There was this small corner I just couldn't reach, in almost every room in my home. They're all finally clean.This thing is light. Perfect for going up and down the stairs. It has a low profile swivel head, allowing for easy access into even the toughest to reach areas. They're is no place in my home I can't reach with this vacuum.The batteries last 25 minutes each, more than enough time to vacuum my 4 bedroom 2 story top to bottom with an extra battery to spare almost every time.Unfortunately, the hose is short. Like, wow short. It connects to the removable handle to reach further, but this makes it less than flexible and still doesn't give as much reach as any of my previous vacuums.

"I have bad luck with coffee presses. I've gone through 3 in the past year so far. I seem to have an issue with knocking the glass carafe into things when it's hot. Seems that shatters even the supposed ""shatter-proof"" carafes.That said, the Kona french press is still standing and functional. A small miracle, really. Or, more likely, it's the plastic carafe holder. While not as glamorous as the metal holders, the plastic seems to absorb the bumps and keeps the glass intact.My only complaint is the filter design. Coffee grounds get trapped in between the lip of the filter and the plunger. The entire thing needs to be taken apart to get them all out.

"The Good: Panic was an exciting read. It made sense in a way that I think will connect with a lot of people. Kids living in a small, go-nowhere town pool money and compete in a dangerous contest for a chance to get out and have a different life. The characters were really interesting and I had a hard time putting the book down. I just had to know what was coming next and how everything was going to work out.The Bad: I love a good epilogue and the last chapter is pretty much that. Two months or so in the future, we see how the characters are doing. What lost me was the extremely heavy-handed moral of the story blatantly written out in the last few paragraphs. If the book had ended two pages sooner, it would have been perfect.

Some people are going to end up on the same path they started on. I loved that we get pretty definite answers to the few remaining questions lingering from the earlier books and that we knew where everyone is off to, for the most part, now that high school is over.The Bad: This book didn't flow nearly as well as the earlier novels in the series.

"The Good: Great interwoven mysteries I didn't see coming. Yuki is getting more interesting and it's about time. Maybe she just needed some male interaction. I especially loved Lindsay in this book, and her having to come to terms with being part of a married couple as opposed to just an individual who only consider herself.The Bad: I would have loved to have seen a ton about Lindsay's wedding, since we've been leading up to it since almost the start of the series. It was glossed over so completely I thought I may have missed a book between the last one and this one. Also, in certain instances, main characters should die.

"Bought these because I do some living history costuming and they have a bit of a look like some that people wore back in the (way) old days.  Went 1/2 size up as people recommended - thank you!  Although, the pair I got had a full 3/4 inch difference around the top between the left and right boot.  Returned for a different pair, fingers crossed.  The ONE complaint I really have is that there isn't very much padding in the footbed.  I have very high arches and can't walk for long without some shock absorption.  These aren't horrible - I did order another pair - but I would think twice about these if I planned to walk miles or wear them on a long trip or something.

"For several years EVA Arizonas were hard to find.  I ordered a pair from Germany and have literally worn them out - holes in the soles - so was thrilled to see I could finally get an easy, affordable replacement.I absolutely live in these things in the summer.  I have super high arches and am a supinator, so have to have a lot of cushioning underfoot.  I also do a lot of yard work so need something waterproof.  I can wear Crocs, but the wide width makes my foot slip around so they don't quite fit right.  Like the story about Goldilocks and the bears, these are just right.  The material underfoot is squishy like a yoga mat - plus they weigh almost nothing.  I've also ventured into the Madrid and the EVA Gizeh's and have nothing but good news to report.I think I'll hoard a few pairs of these in case they again become hard to find.

"LOVE!  I have another pair of Madrids in the two-strap style and I have literally worn them out - holes in the bottom.  I ordered another pair and when they arrived the footsole was a lot harder, more like molded plastic than soft rubber.  So, I ordered these from Amazon knowing I could easily return them in case of a problem.Not to worry.  They are FABULOUS.  I have super high arches and am a supinator so I have to have a lot of soft cushioning.  These are NOT hard, they're cushy and comfy, and I'm already living in them.  I bought the pink color in a 39 (fits my US 9 foot fine) - think I'll try the red ones next.  (Edit: the red ones are similarly awesome.  Now for black and whatever color they make ;))I tried on some white ones in a store and the footbed did feel a little harder.  If you get white and they're too firm, try one of the other colors.I was afraid they'd be too loose and I'd kick them off.  I have a somewhat narrow foot but they fit just fine.

"I'm a big fan of Case Logic for various reasons - the price point is pretty reasonable, and the products seem to hold up well for the price.  This little case is no exception.Honestly, I ordered the case with nothing in particular in mind - it seems like I've always got something that will fit in one of these little jobs.  It could be a small camera, maybe a slew of charger bricks, or similar.  What I like about these is, the size is pretty reasonable, which makes the weight not a problem if I choose to purchase several of these to transport items in a suitcase.  They're even fairly well water resistant, with a liner which will keep your stuff from getting soaking wet if you're stuck in a shower.  Caveat: I wouldn't hold one under a faucet or leave it out in the rain, but for a short hike or a little sprinkle you should be OK.The only criticism I might have is that this is black - if you put it inside a suitcase with a black lining you might inadvertently over look it.  If it came in alternative, brighter colors I might have been tempted to go for that instead.  Also, don't forget to put a small luggage tag on your case - the handle makes that easy to do - so it can find its way home should you misplace it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U7TO4XJITWNW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5ROEIW#wasThisHelpful","R1U7TO4XJITWNW","A3T7BTQBVRJDOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7BTQBVRJDOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Get ready to start drooling to go to Scotland!  have been contemplating such a trip myself for ages and honestly I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out - I understand the pound sterling is finally at a reasonable exchange rate vs. the American dollar.This tourbook is laid out pretty well as one might expect, with the various things to do in different locations.  Where it really stands out I think is the practical advice - what times of year are good for certain things and little need-to-know items like what gear to bring or what to wear.  Readers are also advised with local faux-pas to avoid, down to which sports teams are favored in certain areas.  I also like the historical perspective, which is important when visiting a place with such a past.  The book includes a full fold-out map of Edinburgh and many other helpful layouts of various cities.  Maybe I'm just easily amused, but I always get a kick out of the rulers LP print in the inside of their book jackets ;)If I were to make one criticism it might be something like additions for specialty shops or restaurants.

"My husband and I recently got onto the GoPro wagon as I am a scuba diver and he's a fiddler about the house one of our favorite uses for our cameras is strapping them to the birdfeeder to watch our little critters dine.  We have rapidly accumulated cases, chargers, etc. so it's getting to be time to think about organizing it all.I guess I hadn't realized this case was quite so big.  That's both good and bad - good in the sense it's going to be harder for me to mislay than I might otherwise.  If it had come in a color other than black I might select that, since I tend to mislay black items in black suitcase interiors more often.  Of course it will however take up more room in your luggage.One thing I really like is how lightweight it is.  For years I've been using Pelican brand plastic cases to protect my camera gear but those really weigh a lot, particularly once you get them loaded with metal camera lenses.  With suitcases ever more expensive to check, a less-heavy solution is really a boon.  I get the sense the closed cell foam in this case will do a good job protecting my gear without all the added weight.I've owned Thule brand cases and protectors before, so can say that these are really well made - the zipper is sturdy and obviously won't come apart too soon with wear.  I'm not 100% crazy about the foam being pre-formed (some foam-filled cases are what's called 'pick and pluck' so you can size them to preference.)  That said I think it'll work well enough since it's got a couple of big squarish holes where I can cram in my miscellany. ;)  I also like that it's got the carrying handle on the corner so I can attach it to something with a carabiner.I suspect my spouse will be getting one of these for his birthday soon!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35KY6X3RVKTT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8K9TUC#wasThisHelpful","R35KY6X3RVKTT5","A3T7BTQBVRJDOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7BTQBVRJDOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's great to have a stapler that can handle pretty much whatever I throw at it without binding up or leaving the last couple of pages to fall out and get lost.  The ONE downside is that I'm going to have to remember to buy the special staples for this magnificent item - but given that Amazon delivers things so quickly that likely won't be too big of a problem.I have disproportionately small hands, so was sort of worried about the strength that would be required to fire metal through 40 sheets of paper.  Luckily that really hasn't been an issue, since the construction of the stapler is such that leverage does the work rather than your knuckles.  I even was able to staple together some material that had a bit of a hard plastic coating on it without too much trouble.  For the price you really can't beat this item.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37RFF5VE7YNAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NLVDFM#wasThisHelpful","R37RFF5VE7YNAA","A3T7BTQBVRJDOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7BTQBVRJDOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just another plus size woman who LOVES this suit.  One detail, though that I didn't notice in other reviews:  I wear a size 18W in most street clothes, but had to order up THREE sizes (to a 24W) to get the correct size in this bathing suit.  Luckily I read the sizing chart on the seller's website before I ordered.  That being said, there is nothing not to love about this suit - it's fully lined and perfect for my purpose (scuba diving).  Really had to look long and hard to find one that didn't send the wrong message with too much flesh exposed - I am just not interested in appearing to be trying to 'pick up' the married men in my scuba group!  Think I'll order a couple more of these suits just in case they stop making them.  I also ordered some of the swim shorts and the coverup shorts for this suit, all of which appear to run at least two or three sizes too small but are well made and fabulous otherwise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V905MDLON8VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004I7BKDM#wasThisHelpful","R3V905MDLON8VW","A3T7BTQBVRJDOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7BTQBVRJDOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have extremely high arches and am a supinator so have to wear shoes with a lot of cushioning.  These are so awesome I can hardly believe it.  I'd buy another pair if I hadn't already bought the Neevah, which is basically this shoe in a short boot.  Oh, and the Kaleen, too.  :)I have some other Ugg short boots I have worn absolutely to death for the past six years, which is why I won't ever buy the off brands - real Uggs last forever.  My experience is that the wool will eventually pack down, which is why it feels so tight at first.  These will feel too tight for the first several weeks or even a couple of months, but eventually they'll be heavenly.They're also going to be a little bit waterproof.  Not sure I'd wear these out in a flood, but they're going to be better than the suede boots that do sometimes show water stains.  I expected them to be really warm - and they are somewhat casual looking - but I didn't expect them to be fabulously comfortable.  Really really love these.

"In a nutshell (tee hee), my critters went bananas over this.  I often joke that the definition of happiness is a blue jay with a peanut, and the four that visit my yard regularly were some joyous birds this week.Honestly, the mixture in this feed seems human-food grade.  I saved it to start putting it out on a very cold day and the three or so cups I put out that first day were gone inside an hour.  That's actually the one downside - it's surely not going to last very long.I placed some down on the sidewalk under the birdfeeder and the chipmunks and squirrels loved it as well as the hairy woodpeckers, white breasted nuthatch and cardinals that visit my feeder.

"I have an older edition of this cookbook I've used to rags and am pleased to say this new one is awesome.  IMO, a key to weight loss is learning to achieve great-tasting food without overuse of needlessly caloric ingredients.  As a pescetarian, it's also important to me that some of the recipes are vegetable-heavy.This fills the bill nicely.  Really tasty entrees are included and there's even a 'vegetarian entree' section.  One of my favorites so far is the North African Chickpea and Vegetable Tagine.  Speaking of sections, the cookbook is organized helpfully - categories include ""small plates,"" ""seafood entrees,"" ""slow cooked favorites"" - there's even a small ""fruit and frozen dessert"" section.On the downside, this isn't the hugest cookbook I've ever seen.  It's nowhere near as large as Moosewood or even Joy of Cooking.  But it's well-curated, IMO.The book itself is pretty interesting, also.  It's actually a small three ring binder, so it's easy to move favorites up to the front or take out pages if you need to carry them to the store.I find these books are my favorites more due to the quality of the recipes than anything.  None of the recipes require ingredients that are extra hard to find or contain overly complicated directions.  I would imagine my household will be using this new edition to pieces for years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RACIIUGR8CT21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544343492#wasThisHelpful","RACIIUGR8CT21","A3T7BTQBVRJDOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7BTQBVRJDOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For whatever reason my particular metabolism runs through calcium more quickly than some people.  If I don't get enough my hair starts to fall out and I get horrendous insomnia and a host of other health problems.  Pill-type supplements do a little bit of good, but in order to avoid all the problems I really need the mega-protein (and calcium) dietary additives.Pure Protein doesn't have as much calcium as some supplements, but it's also got fewer calories.  It costs lots less than the powder from the vitamin store, too.  I like the flavors - this one goes well with both milk and a kind of powdered peanut butter I sometimes use to make a 'banana split' smoothie.

"Hadn't thought I would like this, since it's noticeably thinner than other duct tapes.  As it turns out I like it a lot, since mostly I use duct tape for packing up things I plan to return to manufacturers or send to friends.  It's much stronger than regular packing tape but thin enough that it isn't a pain to tear, plus you get more on the roll so you don't run through it so quickly.Downside: it doesn't come in cute colors like other brands, but who cares if you're just using it to seal boxes.

"I admit I was initially very skeptical.  Have had problems with similar mixers having not nearly enough 'torque' to the point they wouldn't effectively crush ice, which IMO you really have to have for a smoothie.Not the case here.  This is almost shockingly strong.  It will vaporize a glass of ice into orange juice and fruit within about fifteen seconds.  And it has two containers, since you'll be using it a lot.  The best part is the rubber 'feet' that stick it to the counter so it doesn't jog all over the place or make a mess.This is going to be fantastic.  I was getting pretty tired of using my king-sized blender to make smoothies, since it's an older model I can't put in the dishwasher.  Just too cool to able to easily wash this and not have the huge blender carafe from my other model sitting around in the sink, yucky all the time.  No issues with getting the blade off and back on.  I like this so much I think I'll buy a couple more for Christmas gifts or in case they stop making it.

"Have been buying Wahl brand clippers for years and have some that are probably 15 years old.  Agree with others on the smooth, easy operation.  What's important to me is that the clippers don't seem to injure the skin of my shaggy Maine Coon mix cat, who sometimes gets gunk stuck in his fur that needs to be removed.  Had gotten used to some rechargeable clippers I bought a couple of years ago for my boy, but they never seem to have a charge when I need them.  I have to plug them in and wait a while for them to charge up, which means kitty is uncomfortable until they're ready.  It's nice to have the corded model again, especially one that's long enough to reach across the room if needed (we live in an old house without a ton of outlets).I've been casting around trying to figure out what blades fit this clipper and which smaller blades will work for my less densely-coated cats.  Will update the review once I try a couple of options on that.These are certainly more expensive than some other options, but believe me when I tell you they're an investment and you'll have them for years.  Beats going through several pairs of clippers that are cheaper but add up over time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRZOIHVFBO3HO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8KC5IU#wasThisHelpful","RRZOIHVFBO3HO","A3T7BTQBVRJDOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7BTQBVRJDOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Edited, about three months later: Whatever was making my fan squeak and knock eventually worked itself out.  It's now pretty silent and I sit in front of it constantly while watching TV. Have upgraded my review to five starts, b/c I've been using the heck out of this thing!**Reminder: This fan DOES NOT OSCILLATE.  It's fixed, and the idea is that it moves the air around in the room.  You can set it upright or horizontally.  Either works great - it moves a lot of air and is really comfy if it's a hot day and you're sitting in front of it.One problem:  It makes annoying noises.  When it's on its side, it squeaks.  Upright, a knocking noise.  I think it's just something to do with the air-moving mechanism.  Hopefully it won't stop working.  I probably just got a bad one, since others don't mention these issues.I have a similar Lasko brand upright tabletop fan and I really kind of miss the oscillating action, tell you the truth.  The Vornado probably moves as much air, though, and if I weren't sitting right next to it the noise probably wouldn't be so bothersome.  The styling of it is pretty nice; it's snappy-looking, as opposed to the industrial-looking airmovers you sometimes see.The fixed nature of it really makes me feel like it should include an air filter.  It would do a great job probably, considering the volume of air it moves.  I'd probably buy this again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35VU14UBPAA3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3A47VM#wasThisHelpful","R35VU14UBPAA3Z","A3T7BTQBVRJDOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7BTQBVRJDOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hey everyone, just noticed that the headline for this item reads 'messenger bag', which usually is a sort of large floppy bag you can fit a laptop and some notebooks into.  Please note that this DSLR case is in fact mostly just a DSLR case - I have no idea why they're calling it a 'messenger bag.'That said, it's pretty nice!  It's definitely big enough to fit your DSLR into along with a couple of lenses, or a higher-end point and shoot with some accessories.  It's got the kind of styling that I personally really like - with a detachable lens on, it can be organized so the camera faces down and rests on some padding - then the weight of the camera isn't on the end of the lens.  That said, the dividers inside are completely removeable, so you can arrange this however you like.  (There are two of them and they're fuzzy with velcro on both ends - they 'grip' to the soft inside of the bag, and the hold is what I would describe as 'very firm.')The bag does have a small outside pocket and two 'grab straps' so you can pick it up from the front or the top.  The description advertises 'water bottle pockets' on both sides and I'm personally not sure what I think about that - a SMALL water bottle, sure, but anything larger than that like a Camelbak bottle certainly isn't going to fit.  You likely could fit a small fixed lens or a packet of filters.  The pockets are deep and the top is elasticized, so your stuff shouldn't fall out with normal use.It's nice and thickly padded.  The strap has a nice rubberized shoulder grip pad; the drop is about 24"" from the top of the bag.  The back of the bag is mesh padding, NOT a pocket, which will be a pro or con depending on what you're looking for.The real selling point of this bag, though is the semi-concealed pocket at the bottom of the bag that holds a weatherproof cover.  HOW many times have I wished for this when caught outside in a sudden shower while taking pictures?!  Many many scenes of panic while trying to cram a camera bag under my coat come to mind.  These bags are fairly well water resistant but they are NOT waterproof, which means your stuff will get damp.  Thrilled to find they have finally tuned into that fact and included a cover.  BE AWARE the cover is folded and the case comes with it stowed into a dedicated bottom pocket - I turned the house upside down looking for mine, sure it had been left out of the package, until the truth slowly dawned (and now I'm embarrassed!  :))In my mind you just can't have too many of these bags.  I inherit another DSLR every time my semi-pro photographer spouse upgrades, and it's nice to have everything packed into its own bag so I can 'grab and go' depending on what I need to shoot.  Downside: Smaller than other similar bags in this price range.  Upside: The smaller size means less unnecessary bulk and weight if you don't have a lot to carry.  If what you want is a bag to house a DSLR or a higher-end point and shoot with an extended lens, this will probably suit your needs beautifully.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q165MRFIK4A7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZJ11PO#wasThisHelpful","R3Q165MRFIK4A7","A3T7BTQBVRJDOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7BTQBVRJDOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have one of these that I keep in my car and I use constantly for everything.  Recent great story: was at a home and garden show at a local fairgrounds.  I have no idea why it didn't occur to the organizers to account for the fact that people would be buying big, bulky plants, but I saw people make several trips to the car.  They were carrying big ferns and palms spilling dirt everywhere, while I made ONE trip using my fabulous wagon!  Everyone kept asking me where I got it.  Honestly someone should sell these at the home and garden show!It carries absolutely a ton of weight - over 100 pounds (though I probably wouldn't try 200).  It's easy to collapse and to get out.  I love mine so much that I recently saw another one on sale and bought it just to have a backup in case they quit making them.  I paid around $100 for my first one, it's nice to see the price has dropped.People are mentioning local retailers and honestly I have seen them at K mart, but if you live in a rural area or away from a big box store I'd say it's well worth paying the shipping to get one of these awesome carts.  They're made really well - the stitching is well done and doesn't come out, the bottom is thick and padded, and the wheels are sturdy.

"This stuff really lives up to the claims.  It seals odors an order of magnitude better than competitors, and I tried with a big box used by five cats!  It also has superior clumping ability as advertised and I like the smell - much less like chlorophyll than competitors.The only downside is it's really expensive for how much you get.  A 10"" square box that's 3"" deep is at least eight or nine dollars everywhere I've checked - and since you'll be fishing big clumps out of it I wouldn't even really expect it to last that long.In a nutshell, if you have only a couple of cats, you'll probably be really happy with this litter.  Personally, I plan to buy it if I can find it on sale.

"One thing I like about these is, they're only open on the top - some protectors are open on the top and one side so it can be a little harder to get your documents to stay in.  They're nice and heavy, as advertised, and the hole punches seem like they're not going to tear out so your pages come loose.Mostly I use these for recipes - I like to cut them out of the newspaper and just paste them to a page and throw the whole thing in a notebook.  It's better than having scraps of paper floating all over our house that I can't ever find when I need them.  Since I'm going to be using them a lot I also like having a nice heavier protector.

"We have a five-cat household and typically we buy traditional litter due to the higher expense of the scooping stuff.  However, got a box of this to review so here's my 2 cents.It's good litter!  Basically the claims as to the smell seem to be correct.  After a few days of heavy use by our brood, the box wasn't exactly a flower garden but noticeably better than other litters.  The smell of the product itself is fairly pleasant - a little more perfume-y and less like chlorophyll.  It was nice to smell this on our long-haired part-Maine Coon rescue kitty, whose fur really traps odors, as opposed to what he sometimes smells like.It also clumps pretty well, in line with the claims on the box.  I wasn't just overwhelmed, but again it was noticeably better than some competing brands.  There was one wet area that came up mostly in one piece as opposed to my having to go through the box repeatedly.The only downside?  This stuff costs plenty.  The box I got is about 10 inches by 10 by 3.5 or so, so it's not a whole lot of litter, despite weighing 14 pounds.  If you have one small cat and a box will last you a while, then go ahead and buy - but if you have a whole horde of cats, it's probably going to take you the full box and to my mind this isn't a super-terrific financial decision.  That said, I'll be keeping an eye out and buying some on sale where I can find it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R363ZMN9HPJNWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8MDKBE#wasThisHelpful","R363ZMN9HPJNWN","A3T7BTQBVRJDOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7BTQBVRJDOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Like that it has a detachable cable so I can use either the older iPad cable for my old tablet or the new Lightning connector.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I5U4SCB4Y1C0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2ZQ6ZI#wasThisHelpful","R2I5U4SCB4Y1C0","A3T7BTQBVRJDOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7BTQBVRJDOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EDIT JUNE 8, 2014: The headline of this review was: WOW!  Intuitive user interface, improved functionality over other optionsHowever, I can't get the program to sync with my online family tree - at all.  Meaning, not one time have I had a successful sync.  The program constantly says I've unlinked my tree from the program - which isn't correct.  I've tried linking and unlinking my tree, downloading my online tree to start from scratch with a new GEDCOM, letting the program run for several days with 'media processing' in the background.  To no avail.One reason I wanted this program is that I have a lot of incorrectly entered place names - various abbreviations and such, that I need to clean up.  It would be so awesome if I could do that locally, then upload my work, but the lack of sync prevents that.  Apparently this is a long-running, known issue with FTM, which is too bad.I cannot recommend this product at this time.  A couple of stars b/c it does at least keep a tree you import from a GEDCOM in decent shape and will allow you to run and print reports from it.  You can also sort your tree by place name, which is more difficult functionality to find than you'd think.*Old review as follows*:Long story short, I'm migrating from Reunion 10 - a genealogy software package for Mac I've been using for a long time.  There's a lot to like about Reunion, so I'm not interested in trashing it as much as in mentioning the (better, IMO) user interface and utility offered by FTM3.I'm an 'advanced beginner' when it comes to genealogical work.  A few members of my family migrated from England to Virginia in the 1600s (to be followed by others) then traveled west to Kentucky and Tennessee, which were the Western frontier of the 1800s.  In my opinion it's a fascinating story and one I can't really get enough of, so I spend quite a bit of my free time trying to dig up details on these relatives.  Friends, I have found tales that sound as though I'm making them up!  In my case it's been absolutely true that you don't know what you'll necessarily find when you start digging into your own family history.Not having had much luck joining genealogical societies, when I first got started I did some research to see what program for the Mac I could use as a repository for these stories and details.  Enter Reunion by Leister Software - it's good enough, will save your people into a database and will allow you to perform the usual searches by tree, overview, pedigree, whatever you like.  Their customer service is terrific.  However, its default data entry screen is somewhat clumsy - media is entered in a different area, there are only a couple of customizable screens you can look at when viewing an entry, and the 'Find' function is somewhat difficult to use, having two search windows - I know, this makes no sense to me either.I know opinions differ on Ancestry.com as a research source.  Admittedly, Ancestry's user-submitted family trees are often riddled with errors - children born after their parents' deaths and similar.  However, using it to fact-check good information can be highly useful.  Since my family roots in the USA go back so far, I often have to sort through information dated before counties or even states were formed, and that means I have to get creative.In one example, I found traces of my 5th great grandfather in Kentucky in 1797, just before Logan became a county, and found a few notes about him in a local library in the Military records section.  1797?  Too late for the Revolution - thanks to Ancestry I now know he was a veteran of one of the Indian wars, and their copy of the paperwork saved me a trip to the National Archives in Washington.  I have many many other similar stories.  It's even possible to get in touch with your distant cousins using Ancestry's messaging system to compare notes with them.  So, for me it's highly useful to own a copy of software that will download and sync with my online Ancestry family trees without my having to download separate copies of my databases and media sources and enter each, plus its description, by hand.Another GREAT fact about Ancestry: You're allowed to download and keep your own records on your family whenever you want - no EULA contracts to sign or Digital Millennium Act threats claiming these records to be the property of someone else.  That's really refreshing considering how many companies try to ""monetize"" your personal information as a profit center these days.Since I've been working on my database for five or six years now, it's gotten huge - over 1400 entries, with many of them dating to the mid-1600s (and even the Middle Ages) in Scotland and England.  Like many people I find the same place entries in my research over and over, and am contemplating a trip to the UK to visit some of these spots.  Was thrilled to discover upon installing FTM3 that I can now map places!  There really isn't another easy to use solution I've been able to find - websites that used to offer that service have been discontinued.  It's wonderful to see at a glance which relatives are assigned to each place name and to easily see on a map exactly where it is!  Especially when you're dealing with small villages in another country you've never visited, and you have no idea even in what general part of the nation they're located.  You can also see the migration pattern for each person in your tree, interesting in my case as generations traveled west.Just can't say enough about the superior user interface.  The media for each person is saved WITH the person's name and relevant dates and you can see it right there - no having to remember complicated steps to find each piece and to see what sources have been used generally for your tree.Another thing I like: LOTS more options for printing reports, which is useful in my case b/c members of my family often want to know how they're related to someone else.  You can see what the reports on your pedigree or descendants look like and can easily customize which people are included.  No having to remember highly technical terms and run each report four times to get it to include what you want.In a nutshell the functionality of this program is vastly superior to Reunion.  I feel a little guilty saying that since Reunion is stable, reliable and has kept my records in apple pie order for a long time.  However, the developers of FTM3 have clearly learned from users' feedback on the Ancestry.com site.FTM3 comes with an easy to follow, clearly written manual that reads like it was written by a native speaker of English, not a person from another country, so I'm sure I'll be picking up additional tips as the next few weeks roll by.  I'll update my review as I discover new options in the program.  The only reason I'm stopping short of five stars is that I had a little trouble syncing my Ancestry tree the first time I tried, but this may be a problem with my network - will update and add the fifth star if that turns out to be the case.  (Just a reminder:  back up your tree as a GEDCOM before you use this or any other program to mess with it.  You don't want to corrupt the data you've spent months or years compiling!)  EDIT: In contrast to other reviewers I only had a little trouble downloading my tree - it didn't work the first time I tried, but I rebooted the machine and tried again and there were all five of my trees in FTM3, ready for download.  I only downloaded one of the smaller ones to start, will report back after I've tried all of them.In a nutshell I think this would be a great program for a beginner to genealogical research.  You get a free 3-month subscription to basic Ancestry.com to sort of get a feel for the website and how it works - yes, this is likely a 'hook' to get you to sign up for a longer period, but in my case it's been absolutely worth it.  It's fascinating to learn about not only my own family's journey, but about the settlement and evolution of American history, in a context that means a lot to me personally.  I don't think you'll regret it if you purchase this program.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD0KFL418Z2PH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8JLILG#wasThisHelpful","RD0KFL418Z2PH","A3T7BTQBVRJDOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7BTQBVRJDOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought these for this year's Halloween costume.  Thanks to other reviews I learned they run a little small, so I ordered an 11 to fit my size-9 foot and a pair of thickish socks.  They fit fine.However, like someone else I had a problem with the laces being too short.  (My calves are fairly muscular from all the hill climbing I do here in bumpy Nashville.)  The shoe fit, width-wise, but I needed about 16"" more lace.  Shocking, I know - the laces that come with these a a full 10 feet long!Trouble is, laces are expensive!!  I looked at one of those custom-order websites and they wanted $18 for a longer lace.  I see someone else tried clothesline cord - I ordered a bunch of grosgrain ribbon in a cute zebra print pattern and am going to try that.  You can use heat-shrink tubing to fix the end of a ribbon like a shoelace: Anytime SHRINK TUBING SLEEVES ASSORTEDAnyway, I'd buy these again.  They do have a zipper up the side, which I somehow overlooked when I ordered them and was pleased to see.  Had been thinking I might trim the tops a bit and I can't do that because zipper, but it looks like I can roll them down fairly easily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OE2AXW9B9AZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3A96RM#wasThisHelpful","R3OE2AXW9B9AZH","A3T7BTQBVRJDOH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T7BTQBVRJDOH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Get comments on them wherever I go.  I liked my first pair so much I bought two more in different colors.Basically the top part of the shoe stretches out for your foot to go in.  I'm a little worried it may eventually stretch out too much, but it seems pretty sturdy and Crocs are crazy well made, so not *that* worried.The footbed is super-comfortable, which is one reason I like these.  I have very high insteps and require a lot of cushioning, these fit the bill.Another great aspect is that they weigh next to nothing.  I'm always looking for decent-appearing shoes to pack in a suitcase for a trip.  Of course, they're also totally waterproof, which makes them great for a beach vacation.These are fairly unbeatable.

"I was in the market for a portable power solution with quick charge technology. There are not many out there. So I applaud Aukey for stepping up to the challenge.  They are currently leading this sector of the market right now. I'm sure other providers will get this implemented in due time.When I saw this massive beast on sale, I immediately clicked on buy now so I could have it in two days!!The battery pack had a nice matte black finish. All of the letters on it have gloss black finish. It's very solid feeling and for being a bit bigger in size than a Galaxy Note 4, it has some serious weight to it. This isn't a battery that you can have in your pants pocket at the same time your charging your device.  Its not really designed for that.  I use the battery to replenish my removable battery pack from my Samsung Note 4 device.  It works well for that.The battery works great. After 45 minutes it charged my Note 4 from 35% to 100%  Excellent performance charging devices quickly.  I have recharged my Note 4 four complete times, and it's still showing a white battery status light.  This is some serious heavy lifting that this battery is doing.Now here's the bad news on this battery.After your device is charged, and the voltage draw drops below a certain level, the battery pack turns off.  So at night when charging my phone, it fully charges it very rapidly, and then it turns off, so in the morning, my phone is at 85% since it has been running background applications to download my pod-casts all night long. This is a problem with phones.  I know the auto off function is nice so you don't accidentally leave it on when you don't intend to, but it needs to stay on all night to keep my device topped off or have some auto sensing technology to kick on and keep your devices full when you are not paying attention.****RevisionAfter being contacted by Aukey that my battery might be defective they sent me a new unit to try out. In the process I upgraded from the Note 4 to the Note 5 phone. After using this battery with the Note 5. I'm not seeing the auto sensing tech kicking in as quickly. When using the phone it stays on powering the device consistently. When the phone goes idle it still kicks off.The next generation of this device needs to drop the current draw sensitively down a notch so it doesn't turn the battery off as soon. This isn't a deal breaker but just something you need to be aware of before making a purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UC4JMDNQMXBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ANE2IE#wasThisHelpful","R3UC4JMDNQMXBK","AF7AQHLX1UV1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7AQHLX1UV1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this little speaker. It has outstanding sound quality over some of the other units I have tested. It's also weatherproof as long as you have the rubber covers installed.It has two drivers in the housing.  A eight inch bass driver and a three inch driver with a peizo dome tweeter on top of it.The lights are a very nice touch. They are bright enough to light the surrounding area around the speaker at night.Improvements:Every once and a while I get a bad Bluetooth connection. Resetting the speaker usually resolves it.This doesn't do USB audio from your iPhone. That would have been a great feature to provide a better quality audio connection.Equalization would have been nice to tweak your sound.Take out some of the battery and give us a subwoofer in the bottom of this thing. There's a lot of space in this thing thats underutilized.Finally 1/4"" input would have been nice so you could use a microphone with it.The slot at the top of the device could be a little further back to allow you device it tilt back a bit more so you can see it better when this thing is on the ground.Overall this is one of the best sounding portable speakers you can get. A few more features at this price point would make it an excellent choice.I waited until it went on sale and got one for $120 so I had to get it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G88TBQXA39LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1D6ISK#wasThisHelpful","R3G88TBQXA39LZ","AF7AQHLX1UV1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7AQHLX1UV1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice case. It's the perfect size to carry my Phantom 3.  I saw it on YouTube as another user had purchased it and he was spot on. Perfect weatherproof case for this tool.I spent a little more time with my pulling of the foam so I could get a very tight fit with room to spare for other accessories.Got space for 4 extra batteries, an a iPad mini when I get them. You have room under the foam for the manuals so you don't misplace them.Excellent case for the money. I went with the orange case as it's very visible but not as bright as the yellow.Just a note if you need to put some foam back in after you pull it. It can be done with just a touch of 3M light spray adhesive. It's permanently attached after that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DXP935G12LKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001A1PTU4#wasThisHelpful","R2DXP935G12LKI","AF7AQHLX1UV1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7AQHLX1UV1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well there are only two options on Amazon for this type of device. I went with this one because I didn't trust a $10 device in my $2,000 laptop. Glad I chose OWC.I was totally surprised to find all of the tools, screws, and a full color step by step guide for every make and model of MBP. That was really nice. After reading the instructions, I dove into the install. Appears on the last generation 15"" MBP (Mid 2011 non retina) they switched to Torx screws from phillips on the optical drive parts. No matter, OWC included the tool to get then removed and nice new phillips head screws to go back in.I'm pleased with the construction of this carrier. Solid aluminum should be great for helping to dissipate heat. Everything lined up perfectly and after restarting my machine all the drives were working flawlessly.This is a good piece of kit to help expand your MBP storage. It's more expensive than alternatives, but you get what you pay for in most cases. This is one that's worth the extra coin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G6MBGRVGLMX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00724W0N2#wasThisHelpful","R2G6MBGRVGLMX1","AF7AQHLX1UV1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7AQHLX1UV1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I had 8 pounds of meat and used this press to quickly knock out 24 burgers.The trick is to place piece of clear plastic wrap on the top of your meat before you use the press, and put your wax paper cut out on the bottom.Perfect burgers, no mess at all, and I was able to reuse the plastic wrap about 20 times before it wore out and used a second piece.Great Product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GZQ0AQSX1A0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWHJUB4#wasThisHelpful","R2GZQ0AQSX1A0H","AF7AQHLX1UV1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7AQHLX1UV1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I guess the saying you get what you pay for is exactly right on this one.After looking at some reviews on amazon and YouTube. I decided to give this one a try.I'll start with the good points on this tool.Good stabilization once it was balanced.As a stabilizer I was able to get it balanced in a few minutes with a Nikon D7100 and a 55mm 1.8 lens. I was able to shoot some nice and smooth footage walking thru the house and then outside with the kids.  Didn't attempt to run since I wasn't quite ready for that on the first outing but it did a nice job taking out all of the shake of walking around.  I practiced for about thirty minutes before shooting and using techniques I have seen used by pro steadicam operators I learned how to pan and swivel my body to keep the footage smooth pretty quickly.Now that's about it for upsides here's the catchBuild QualityThe unit seems to be made out of light gauge steel. The paint was chipped the welds were not cleaned up making some of the transitions a little rough.The most concerning part was one of the SHC screws was broken and would not tighten up. It wouldn't back itself out either so I'm guessing that it broke at the end of the threads and since it had a shoulder on it, that it was just stuck.The gimbal ball is a steel ball in a brass bushing. This probably would work but the unit I got had a burr or something inside the ball that was causing the unit to stick every once and a while when moving side to side.  I was able to overcome it with two hand operation but this should not be needed. I lubricated the ball according to the instructions but it continued to stick and it would not level side to side on a constant basis without assistance.Lower Arc StabilityThe mechanism for the lower arch doesn't allow the position of the arch to be ""locked in.""  If you accidentally tap the lower section on an object it instantly becomes unbalanced and the camera points up to the sky or to the grown depending on how you tapped the arch.  Tightening the adjustment is difficult and you can never get it tight enough to not move at all.Lower Arch AttachmentAttaching the lower arch to the upper section requires you to slide in a section that has no locating pins into the handle section . If you don't get this section perfectly perpendicular to the camera mount plate the unit will be unbalanced to the right or left. The Nikon camera body is naturally heavier or the right side versus the left so on the first attempt to balance this camera I ran out of side to side adjustment to get it level so, you have to disassemble it, reposition the lower section arch and try again. Luckily I nailed it on the second try but others might not be so lucky.WeightsYou only get one half unit weight and six full sized ones. I could have used two of those units to be able to open up the bottom section a bit more to give my hand a bit more room between the handle and the bottom weights. The photo on the website was not the spacing that I had when I balanced my camera. I was able to get more space by bringing the camera back on on the stage and adding a spider quick release plate to add more weight, but it wasn't enough space for me to be able to move around a lot without tapping the bottom weights.ConclusionI got a unit that needed some better quality control. I honestly would have kept it if that screw wasn't broken. That was a deal breaker for me. The sticky ball probably would have worked it way put over time.  Finally there wasn't a carrying case with my model. Older models had a bag to hold it while traveling. Nothing was provided with this model so I'm moving on to a steadicam Merlin.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34X4ELSN4OQTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071AJSGE#wasThisHelpful","R34X4ELSN4OQTT","AF7AQHLX1UV1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7AQHLX1UV1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had a Heat and Glow fireplace for 4 years now, and we use it every evening to warm the den and not the rest of the house in the winter, because that's where we spend most of out time together as a family. No way I was paying $300 bucks for the company I purchased the blower from to come out and install a blower on a $900 dollar fireplace so we didn't get that option when it was originally installed. Didn't think it would make that much of a difference, boy I was wrong.My dad came over and said that he had installed one himself and that it was super easy,  so I went online and scooped this up.This thing comes fully assembled, wired and ready to go,  it was a tight squeeze to get the device in the housing, but if you take the rubber isolators off the bottom it gives you  a little bit more space to get it in there. Slapped on the temp sensor, plugged it into the AUX power connection and fired it up.After a 20 minute warm up the fan kicked on and heated up the room QUICK.Now I need to get a tempature control for the fireplace to turn it in and off automatically as it warms the room much quicker than I expected.The fan is louder than I expected, but it's a good trade off for the amount of heat this thing pumps out now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKFAQ55VA0HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00713SAQA#wasThisHelpful","RKFAQ55VA0HJ","AF7AQHLX1UV1Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AF7AQHLX1UV1Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an expensive version of cucumber slices on your eyes. I may not be the market for this sort of thing, but for someone who's into organic, spendy, gimmicky skin products, this product comes in a nice box with silver-bullet vials and a tray for each pair of eye masks. According to the three steps on each foil mask label, you soak both masks with the contents of a vial and place on your eyes for 10 minutes (or 15-20 according to their website description). I left them on for 20 minutes, and although they felt good and mosturized the skin under my eyes, there was no difference between the before and after snapshots I took, except extra-shiny skin. Like others said, the soggy masks are delicate and curl up easily; basically you need 10-20 minutes to just recline with your eyes shut, so block off time and put music on or something. I'd stick with good old cucumbers, or I'm sure there are just as effective eye treatments for less.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TXR4HPXLQRK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKOV3JE#wasThisHelpful","R1TXR4HPXLQRK2","A37D2TGTIXRV2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D2TGTIXRV2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As long as your roads aren't too bumpy and your device isn't too large, this should work. The holder is easy to assemble and the clamp adjusts to hold a variety of phones, although it was a tad too small for my Htc One with an Otterbox case. It fit my ipod touch just fine, though, and frankly I would be leery of putting a heavy phone or GPS on this. The velcro strap easily mounts or dismounts the holder from your handlebars so you can just take the whole thing with you while the bike is parked. On smooth roads, the holder didn't come loose or spin around, but that probably wouldn't be the case on rougher roads or trails - and I would be afraid of the skinny plastic stem breaking if there was a rough spill.

"With protein powder, good taste is relative, and this powder is okay in taste. I tried it with frozen banana, frozen berries and pineapple (three separate smoothies, not all together) each with 6 oz of water and 1 scoop of Vega. The banana was the best tasting, the pineapple was okay and the berry smoothie didn't do much to mask the gamey flavor of the Vega. If you don't require vegan or dairy-free, I'd stick to one of the whey powders for taste.

"We needed a foundation that was more suitable for our memory-foam mattress than our old box spring foundation, and this seems to be ideal. It has stiff wires rather than springs, a wire grid on the top, wooden slats on the bottom, and thick, attractive gray quilting around the sides. I noticed there aren't plastic reinforcements on the bottom corners like our old boxspring, so I just hope the corners don't get frayed.Delivery and setup were as easy as can be for getting a queen sized box to the second floor. Ceva, the delivery company, called to set up an appointment to deliver, and it came 6 days after it was ordered. I was relieved (after reading some older reviews) that it came in a cardboard box, and inside, the foundation itself was sealed in sturdy plastic. The delivery men put the box in our garage, and with the help of my 12-year-old, we unwrapped it and got it up to the bedroom. Note that the bed frame is not included, nor do the delivery people take away your old bed.Lying on the bed feels great, with no more squeaky springs or sagging feeling.

It could also be used as a storage bag for small dolls in general, like Polly Pockets or the ones that come in Happy Meals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R200NKX6V2FTLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVFC6IU#wasThisHelpful","R200NKX6V2FTLI","A37D2TGTIXRV2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D2TGTIXRV2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This mill is an attractive modern design (looks sort of 70's), sturdy, and even comes with pepper inside. It's easy to fill by unscrewing the metal ball on top, which is also used to adjust the grind. The metal grinder part works great and has a lifetime warranty; the rest of the mill has a 5-year warranty which is better than many appliances. Nice to see a company stand behind its product these days.The mill just comes in a plastic bag, and the wooden top has several nicks on it when I received it.

"If you really need a glass bottle instead of metal or plastic for some reason, I guess this will do. But after using this, I prefer metal or plastic.It's heavy and the shape makes it prone to falling over, making it impractical for running, hiking or the gym. It's definitely not ""one-touch"" and while the metal screw cap seems sturdy, it's not attached to the bottle so it's prone to get lost. The metal mesh strap is also sturdy but the clip is very hard to remove and not much easier to reattach. The neck is too narrow for ice cubes.

This doll is more for someone who doesn't ""play rough"" with their dolls. It has a very elaborate gown with small bracelets and earrings that detach, a small plastic purse, a mask with a handle that goes over the doll's hand, and a key-shaped hairbrush. There's also a doll stand which, instead of going around the doll's waist like most stands, snaps into the doll's crotch.

"It should be said up front that this needs to be set up using a compatible smartphone or tablet (Android 4.0 or above, or iOS 7.0 or up). You can monitor it through a PC browser, but you CANNOT set it up using a PC. So don't buy unless you have a compatible phone, tablet or ipod.When I saw this ""pet monitor"", I thought, why can't this be used as an indoor security camera in general? In particular, I wanted a camera to set up in the living room window facing our front door, so I could see if the person ringing our doorbell was a friend or just another window salesman. I've had a different camera for more than a year (Trendnet camera, provided by Vine for review) doing that job, but it was a real pain to set up and I can't figure out how to view it remotely or record video. Another camera I got through Vine took very grainy black and white pictures, was battery-operated and required a paid subscription for most features. This Motorola camera seems to have made both of those cameras obsolete.I set this up in under 15 minutes. I downloaded the accompanying Hubble for Motorola app on both my Android smartphone and my ipod touch, turned on the camera (it plugs into the wall), created an account/password and paired the camera with the app.The interface is very user-friendly. You can have up to 4 cameras on the account; each one can be given a different name and picture avatar on the app's main menu. Tap the avatar and you'll see a live stream at the top of the screen, and below it, a timeline of events. If a motion or sound is detected (by default, motion and sound detections are on; they can be easily shut off or put in ""do not disturb"" mode for up to 3 hours) then it will say when on the timeline, and if motion is detected, a 10-second video w/audio is recorded, hopefully long enough to catch a crook stealing packages from your porch. Motion and sound detection sensitivity can be adjusted; ""medium"" is enough to trigger someone moving right outside the door but not if a car goes down the street.Because these videos are cloud-based, I can view them from other locations, and get alerts on my phone when things happen. It was cool to get alerted from across town when my husband came home! Other remote features: touch the live stream, and you can take a snapshot, turn on the camera's speaker and say something (maybe freak out a burglar? LOL) or even play one of 5 lullaby tunes (just in case they market this as a baby monitor).The camera also has a temperature detector, which you can set to alert you if the ambient temperature goes above or below a certain number. I suppose that's useful if you have reptiles or other pets that need a certain temperature.I downloaded the app onto a 7"" tablet running Android Kitkat, a smartphone also running Kitkat, and an ipod touch with iOS 7.0, and all work well. The tablet is nice to have set up on a counter as a full-screen monitor. Because videos are sent up to the cloud and back again, there is occasional buffering and lagging. The ipod app keeps wanting to update firmware on the camera, and it keeps failing to load - I'm going to ask their CS about that.In addition to the smartphone apps, the camera can be monitored by logging in to Hubble's website. But again, you need the smartphone app to set it up. (May as well reiterate that at the end of the review.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLPJFBOKPB021/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIL7YVI#wasThisHelpful","RLPJFBOKPB021","A37D2TGTIXRV2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D2TGTIXRV2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Many of the pieces pop into holes in the two-tiered stand or store inside the covered ""bathtub"", and DD likes how the three pet jackets hang on hooks on the stand. There's an unboxing video for this on YouTube - apparently toy unboxing is a very popular genre there - and after watching it, DD gave me a demonstration of all the little pieces and really got into pretending to wash the three pets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31SA4XC2ND7ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVLIJAS#wasThisHelpful","R31SA4XC2ND7ND","A37D2TGTIXRV2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D2TGTIXRV2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A case like this is almost a must for the HTC One, because the slick metal body can make it slippery, and the Otterbox is known for top-notch protection.

Thanks Amazon reviewers for pointing that out!One thing that doesn't work when the Otterbox case is on the phone, is the volume-button pressing to turn on the camera when the phone is sleeping.

"This is my first real smartphone (I'm not counting the Palm Pixi Plus with the obsolete OS or Kyocera Milano which gets full after about 3 apps) and I love it. The slim metal case with gleaming gold (not gray like in the photo) speaker bars really makes it stand out and sets it apart from the ubiquitous iphones and Galaxys. People walking past my table in restaurants have stopped to ask about it. This phone looks like it belongs in an executive suite or Hermes bag instead of a teenager's locker.But beyond the looks, there are tons of impressive features; where to begin. The dual-lens camera, which turns on with a press of the volume button, has modes for a 360-degree panoramic photo or a selfie within a photo. There's also something called Zoe which I think makes short Vine-like videos (I had trouble figuring it out). You can edit photos with various backgrounds, filters or a 3D effect. The photo gallery app automatically makes slide shows of photos you took each day or for events, and you can add music and easily share them online.I also think the TV remote feature is really cool. Because it works with an infrared bar at the top of the phone like your regular remote, it doesn't require wifi or data unlike TV remote apps. It's easy to set up and it's great to just grab my phone to change the channel or volume instead of hunting down the remote.Oh yeah, the audio! Whether listening through the speakers or included premium earbuds, it sounds awesome. Both the included music app and the Amazon Music app work fine. I have Prime Music and have made a ton of playlists.The phone also works well as a phone. You can set it up to answer when you pick it up or by swiping, and the contacts list lets you add picture icons and all kinds of info. Everything's very customizable. The Blink Feed interface shown in the photo can be customized to add various news sources or social media. If you download the Fitbit app, the phone acts as a pedometer (no Fitbit necessary!) and displays your steps and other data on the Blink Feed screen. If you don't care for Blink Feed, it's easy to make a different screen your home screen and add widgets such as the clock and weather icons.This is a fantastic phone, even for a smartphone novice like me. HTC deserves to run with Apple, Samsung and all the other big dogs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDT3PQETCEHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JX4MD3G#wasThisHelpful","R1JDT3PQETCEHD","A37D2TGTIXRV2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D2TGTIXRV2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This case fits, although it's a tad large (made to fit both 7"" and 8"") and feels very sturdy. The only problem with the corner holders is that they either cover up the power button or the charging socket, but I fault Dell for that design, not Belkin.

"If you want a Dustbuster for carpets and stairs and money is no object, this might be just the thing. On hard floors, though, a Swiffer vac does as well or better for a tenth of the price.I had never owned a Dyson, so I was eager to see why it's so pricey and popular. It's shiny and attractive, with large and small motorized brush heads, a crevice tool and a small dusting brush head, all of which easily snap on and off the purple tube or the wall mounting unit. Everything's matchy matchy, even the oval silver wall wart. The unit is very light and unlike other reviewers, I didn't mind holding down the trigger.After charging the battery for a few hours, I tried the vacuum on my hard kitchen floor. While it picked up crumbs, it had trouble with bits of paper or cereal. I did a side by side test with my cordless Swiffer vac (around $50) which sucked the cereal and paper right up. Hmmm.Next I tried my carpeted stairs, and that's where the Dyson redeemed itself. After pressing the Max button, I had time to clean 4 steps before the battery died, and they looked like they had been shampooed. After recharging, I used it minus the Max to clean the rest of the stairs, the landing and part of the living room before the battery died again.Bagless vacuums are never not messy to empty, but the Dyson is about as easy to empty as can be; I put the canister deep inside a grocery bag and pressed a button to make the bottom flip down. I also had to clean a lot of hair from the brush heads, which are easy to take apart with a coin.This would be best for small carpeted apartments, or if it's worth this much to make vacuuming stairs easier. For a big house, though, it's not going to replace the corded vacuum.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSWLARZ5J7JF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPPOR1Y#wasThisHelpful","RSWLARZ5J7JF8","A37D2TGTIXRV2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D2TGTIXRV2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been looking forward to this book because I liked Nick's website and youtube videos, so I bought the kindle version before getting the hardcopy book on Vine. The book is big in format, with lots of photos and descriptions of exercises using all sorts of equipment from barbells and angled barbells (""landmines"") to dumbbells, kettlebells, balls, suspension trainers and your own bodyweight. Throughout, Nick explains the purposes of each exercise and routine (broken down into circuits, combinations and complexes). At the end are a break-in muscle building program, six sample routines where you alternate two workouts each, a bodyweight routine and an optional strength-cardio circuit called Fat Loss Five.All throughout, you're encourages to plug in or substitute exercises based on your ability and available equipment. But unlike New Rules of Lifting for Life, which organizes exercises within type based on difficulty, this book organizes them more by equipment used, and since there are no page numbers on the workout charts, you have to go back and search if necessary. I agree that an index is badly needed as well as page numbers on the charts (I wrote them in myself, in the book).The workouts themselves are fun and have a lot of variety, but they are long. With a warmup, I can't get them under an hour, and it's more like 90 minutes in a crowded gym. But they do work me out! I especially like the farmer's walk routine, and I'm learning how to use the landmine at the gym. I feel like I've gained strength more than fat loss at this point, but that's still a good thing especially at my age.I feel they could have done a much better job with the Kindle edition. There are no hyperlinks and the photos are tiny, although they are in color while the book is in black and white.

"My husband and I have been Dave Barry fans since way back when the Washington Post actually printed his column every week. Dave has also helped navigate us into middle age with his ""Turns 40"" and ""Turns 50"" books, which is why we were disappointed there was no ""Turns 60"" book.Dave helps make up for it here with a chapter on turning 65, appropriately titled ""Death."" In it, he tears up the usual topics of aging - Viagra commercials, junk mail for old folks, forgetting things - in his usual hilarious way, topping it off with a description of his funeral that I hope actually takes place and that William Shatner had better stick around for!Yes, after all these years, he does have familiar schtick like remembering some obscure thing from the 50s or 60s (here, a Beach Boys song) while forgetting something that society deems important (math).

"This case isn't cheap, but what a difference from the discount-store cases. The different materials and textures (smooth rose-pink fabric, matching leather and plastic frame and soft interior cloth touching the Kindle screen) are stitched together very well and held with a matching elastic band. I've been carrying this around constantly and nothing is fraying or coming apart. The Kindle snaps in and out of the frame easily, although there's no real need to remove it unless you're changing cases. To read the Kindle in portrait position, I simply fold the cover back so that the leather part is making sort of a ""lip"" on the right side of the Kindle, making it easy to hold without getting my fingers all over the screen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSPF3F351EWLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQZQRP8#wasThisHelpful","RSPF3F351EWLS","A37D2TGTIXRV2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D2TGTIXRV2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little disappointed that Just Dance went back to their generic Kids series instead of a Disney Party 2. The songlist includes Disney Channel's heavily-played ""Ready Or Not"" by Brigit Mendler, plus DC stars Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato and Nick star Victoria Justice, yet it's Just Dance 2014 (the ""grownup"" game) that got Disney's Prince Ali, from Aladdin.Still, if you have young kids and are concerned about lyrics or twerking, this game might be preferable. Like JD Kids 2, it has videos of kids dancing on colorful backgrounds, plus the make-your-own Just Create feature.I'm meh about this game, because some of the dances make you wonder what they've been smoking. ""Do You Love Me"" has a weird skit about a dog and cat and mouse, instead of a 60s-style setting like one might expect. Some dances seem a little complicated for younger kids. But there are a few fun gems, like the very disco-styled ""The Hustle.""If your kids are over 8, go for the regular Just Dance 2014. Let's hope for another Disney Party next time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE68QIQHWQY52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ER8HHIO#wasThisHelpful","RE68QIQHWQY52","A37D2TGTIXRV2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D2TGTIXRV2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using kettlebells for several years and Steve Cotter is one of the biggest names in the field, so I was looking forward to this book, and it's worth it. Steve goes over pretty much everything you need to know about kettlebells - different types, how to choose a weight, clothing, trainers, shoes, safety, no stone unturned, followed by full-page photo illustrated descriptions of kettlebell exercises plus warm-ups and form correction drills. There's even general fitness info like goal-setting and energy systems.

"I got a Kindle Fire HD a few weeks before I got this Dell Venue tablet, so I'm going to compare the two. They're both good, in different ways, and cost about the same.One thing I noticed right away about the Venue is it's more comfortable to hold. It's slimmer, slightly thinner and lighter than the Kindle. My female hands can comfortably wrap fingertips around the Venue but I can't quite get them around the Kindle, although a man might not have that problem. So I actually prefer reading Kindle books on the Venue, although the Kindle app for Venue isn't quite as ""fancy"" as the Kindle's (the Kindle lets you scroll a table of contents from the side, for instance) but it's more than adequate. (Also note that the Kindle lending library only works on the Kindle.)As others have noted, if you have a Prime membership, you can't watch those free movies on the Venue without some sort of hacking. If you like to watch Amazon streaming movies, the Kindle HD has a huge advantage there; very impressive stereo sound and slightly bigger picture. But the Venue has a micro SD card slot, which the Kindle doesn't, so you can use fingernail-sized cards to store movies, music and photos and access them without using wifi.The Kindle doesn't have a camera while the Venue has really lame ones, so I'd say that's a tossup, unless ability to Skype or other video communication is vital. The rear-facing one is grainy while the front-facing one is grainy and dark, and no flash.  The Venue also has a mike, which is fun to use with the Google Now widget that tells you what's on TV just by listening to it.The Venue lets you download apps from the Google app store and customize your screens more than the Kindle. Both tablets have good displays and touch screens (the Venue seems slightly more responsive). Battery life and wifi sensitivity seem alike. You can easily flip between open apps on both tablets; the Kindle's is a little more elegant with a scrolling side menu.Overall, this is a very nice little tablet if you're more interested in Google apps than Amazon movies, or have smaller hands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UJ1MV4K51304/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFVYSE8#wasThisHelpful","R2UJ1MV4K51304","A37D2TGTIXRV2N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D2TGTIXRV2N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I knew from the moment Dean and Lily met, this book was going to be amazing. Not only were they blatantly antagonistic towards one another from the get go, but it was actually really entertaining trying to see them one-up each other through out most of the book. It provided me with a lot of chuckles and full laughter too. You see, both Lily and Dean have very strong personalities and opinions. Dean is used to being in control at all times and he even micro manages, which means he's happy but Lily isn't. While Lily might be a decade younger than Dean, she's well educated and aware of how to make a restaurant successful and she's not afraid to tell Dean when he's making a mistake.To make things even more difficult, their personal lives are as intertwined as their professional ones. It doesn't help their respective best friends are romantically involved with each other, making it imperative they get along. With everything they've got going on, I loved seeing them transition from adversaries to lovers. I knew when they finally let go and gave in to the attraction between them, it would be wonderful, and it was. Even once they managed to get together, their personalities softened while still showed through their new dynamic. I really loved how they were unable to stay away from one another.I get abnormally excited when I find out R.S. Grey is releasing a new book. There's just something about her stories that I love. It's the humor, the blistering chemistry between her characters, and the yearning for more when I'm finished reading.  It's the fact they're impossible to put down, even if you decide to start reading at around 1 AM just because you're so excited it's finally available. It's not just all of the above. If you've read any of her books you'll agree with me; they remind me of the wonderful rom-coms film that used to be made and ones I loved watching. I miss those so much, but R.S. Grey's books mean I get those same wonderful stories in the best way possible; a book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CZBR3XCCBA3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015N7G8BO#wasThisHelpful","R3CZBR3XCCBA3I","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Life has a funny way of throwing a wrench into your plans. While that holds true for the characters in this book, it also holds true for me. You see, I've had this book in my possession for almost 7 months now but only recently had time to sit down and read it. I truly loved this book. It was so much better than I was hoping it'd be and I wish I'd read it sooner.All it took to capture my interest and attention was the prologue. It's just a handful of pages, but it shows the beginning and fall of an almost fairy tale like relationship. My heart broke for both Ruby and Aaron. Nothing was going to be the same for them after that. Redemption for Aaron wasn't going to be easy. He didn't come home from jail the same as when he went in. Plus being around familiar places wasn't as much a blessing as he'd have liked especially when the memories associated with those places didn't let him rest.Before I get into how much I loved Aaron and Ruby, I've got to tell you about the story as a whole. First of all it's amazing. There are so many turns and twists, each one larger than the one before it, changing the trajectory of the story. I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next for a very large portion of this book because I didn't see the majority of those twists coming. There was one in particular were I was chanting in my head as I read, ""Please don't let it be her. Please don't let it be her,"" over and over again. Besides being full of surprises, it was HOT! It's much hotter than any of the other books written by L.J. Wilson under her other pen name.Aaron completely stole my heart. I'll admit to being shocked when his crime was revealed, but getting to know him and who he was was allowed me to see the motive behind it. I loved how committed he was to his family and trying to do the right thing while staying on the right side of the law. I loved his determination to overcome all of the challenges he was facing after leaving jail and being thrust into unfamiliar environments. Most of all, I loved his unwavering love for Ruby.I loved Ruby too. She's down to earth and a natural beauty. She loves fiercely and loyally. She' was destroyed by Aaron's betrayal and her pain changed her. Ruby is considerate to a fault. She too had a resolve of steel. Aaron and Ruby together were incandescent. I could almost feel their attraction to each on a  cellular level. They were truly the keepers of the others soul. Of course their relationship wasn't smooth at all. There were moments when I wanted reach into my e-reader and get rid of all the obstacles hindering them from reuniting.L.J. Wilson has written this fantastic second chance romance that defies categorization. This book elements of so many different stories that are interwoven seamlessly and effortlessly. She manages to connect readers to a story told in the third person, something most writers struggle to do. You don't know what to expect but all you can do is devour each page frantically, at least that's how it was for me. When I finished this book I was left with an overwhelming sense of admiration for L.J. Wilson for this amazing story and wonderment as to how I was going to verbalize that coherently. I'm beyond eager to read the next book. While reading, I fell in love with not only Aaron and Ruby, but the entire Clairmont family. I have a feeling this entire series is going to be full of passion, drama, suspense, and discovery. I can't wait to find out for myself!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G9CU18457LFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TD5116K#wasThisHelpful","R3G9CU18457LFH","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not going to lie to you. This book was brutal. Karina Halle really out did her self. I don't know what it was but this book blew my mind in all sorts of ways both expected and unexpected.I think the reason this book hit me harder than I thought it would is because I was so emotionally invested in Javier Bernal. While Dirty Angels and Dirty Promises focuses on him, I first met him in Karina Halle's The Artists Trilogy. There was something special about him even then. Thankfully the Artist series doesn't have to read before this book, but Dirty Angels does. But I digress. I wanted Javier to find some semblance of happiness with Luisa, as much as someone like him could find.I've read all three books in this trilogy and I've got to say even having an idea about what might happen to Luisa and Javier still didn't prepare me for everything that went down. I was devouring this story at a furious pace when something happened that both horrified and sickened me. I had to put my kindle down. I stepped away from the book for about 20 minutes and then realized not knowing what was going to happen next hurt more, so I started reading again. There were a number of times when I felt like the story was going to overwhelm me. It wasn't just the violence and brutality that occurred in the pages, but also my feelings and those of the characters.Surprisingly enough, I never reached my breaking point; the point where things were so horrific or painful I couldn't take any more, and there were some truly horrifying moments. Weaker characters couldn't have survived, but Javier and Luisa are anything but weak. They're imperfect people who make costly mistakes and lose sight of each other amid grief and strife. How ever their inner cores of strength and resolve do not waiver or weaken a bit. Luisa truly surprised me in this book. I don't think I could come close to handling a tenth of what she endured in this book alone, but she somehow managed to remain strong and not lose her will to fight. I can't tell you how much I admired her for that.As Karina Halle says before the book even starts, this isn't really a love story, and she's right. It's what happens after the happy-ever-after when things don't go as planned. It's gritty, raw, and violent, but it's real. It's hard to look away from and impossible to forget. While this may not have been the semi sweet with a touch of violence story I was expecting, it was 100% true to Javier and Luisa, and a story befitting of them. It's the story I didn't know I wanted and I'm thankful to Karina for taking me out of my comfort zone. I don't know if I'm ready to say goodbye to Javier. He's managed to carve a special place in my heart for himself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29PJR0TVK131G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015D8LL3S#wasThisHelpful","R29PJR0TVK131G","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was a total surprise. I love stories where unlikely people are fated to be together. Seeing them struggle to mesh their beliefs and lives is always satisfying. It shows how even though you're meant to be, the journey isn't as smooth as one would think.  I loved how this story caught my attention from the very first page. I really liked the way Jill Myles built and introduced this new world to us. I really felt like I was visiting another world with all of these fascinating new beings.I can't say I sympathized with the Athonites much. Especially not the way they were treating the people they conquered like the Vidaris. I was amazed at how my feelings towards both the Athonites and Vidaris changed as I read the story. It wasn't like my allegiances switched between one people or another, but my perception of them did change. I stopped caring about who was who and was totally invested in Prince Graeme and Seri.To say Graeme and Seri butted heads and were opposites in personalities goes without saying. Both of them had very strong personalities and ideas about what their future would be like. Having to all of a sudden deal with being bound to the other was tough for both. I liked seeing them figure out how to work around their differences and come together both for themselves and their peoples. I also loved the connection they had with each other. Even when they were at odds, they showed a care and concern for the other that was touching.There aren't many moments in this book that made me laugh, but there were moments that made me cry happy tears. There were some sad and angry tears as well. There's a lot of action and drama that comes with nobles being bored for hundreds of years. The book will certainly keep you on your toes and captivated as the story unfolds. I would love to read more books set in this world. I hope Jill Myles continues to write in the paranormal fantasy romance genre. I certainly would read it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C807YX9BS9CO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XV240OG#wasThisHelpful","R3C807YX9BS9CO","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No one writes teenage angst the way Jessica Sorensen does. She has this way of reaching into my chest and bringing out all these emotions and feelings I had as teenager. I can't always relate personally to the experiences her characters have, but I can always empathize with them.I fell in love with Isabella from the first page. I hated how she felt in her own home. Her parents were no help or support and neither was her older sister Hannah. I wondered if it was any surprise Isabella didn't feel comfortable in her own skin. I liked how sweet Isabella was. Even with everything going on around her, I loved that she never gave up trying to reach her family. I loved how she was with Kai and Kyler even if they didn't give her the time of day before her metamorphosis.  I don't know if I'd be able to do the same if I was her. I would've given up on all of them a long time ago.When things happened at home that led to Isabella getting out of the toxic environment for three months, I was ecstatic for her. Granted she was leaving home with a broken heart of sorts, but she was out of the stifling company of her parents and sister. I loved seeing her blossom and bloom during her escapades with her cousin Indigo and grandmother. I also loved how she kept up with who she wanted to be when she came back and her new avatar threw lots of people into a spin. I hated how insecure she was even when she was getting lots of attention but it was easy to understand why when she'd been told she wasn't worthy all of her life. I was so glad to see Isabella coming out of her shell and making new friends as well as being friendly with old ones.I've got to say for  a seventeen year old, Isabella is remarkable. She handled numerous sticky situations with aplomb. I totally admired her for trying to find out who she was and where she'd come from. I also admired her for sticking to her guns to try and find out who she was and what she wanted. The way this first book ended, I know the second one is going to be difficult to wait for, but I have a feeling Jessica Sorensen will make my wait worthwhile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RKHDXSVRC6JY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013YR9IFS#wasThisHelpful","R1RKHDXSVRC6JY","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 stars!This book has been on my radar for a while. It had all the prerequisites necessary to catch my attention: a great blurb, two good looking people on the cover, and most important of all...athletes! Not just one, but two of them. That definitely wasn't usual and I had a feeling the book was going to special, but I knew the moment I read the prologue and was hooked and left with a lot of questions.I loved how the book took me back to the first time Jordan stepped off the plane, both anxious and excited. I could almost feel it coming off her. I really liked Jordan. She was down to earth, dedicated to her game, and determined to become successful at her sport. She wasn't going to let anyone or anything stand in her way, not after the sacrifices she'd made and those that had been made for her. I loved how she was with Brody. She really truly loved him. She was compassionate and caring.  He was important to her and she showed it. Jordan was so resilient, taking control of things as they happened and standing strong through everything that came her way.I adored Brody too. Brody might be the star of football team and have a bright future ahead of him, but he was as blindsided by his attraction to Jordan as she was to him. It didn't help that Jordan knew things about him he'd never let anyone know and that bothered him to the very core of his being. Brody wasn't used to being vulnerable. My heart went out to him when I realized how much pressure he was feeling and especially when he began to relieve that pressure in ways that were harmful to himself and those around him.At the heart of this amazing story is an internal conflict of self value and worth. It's about overcoming the challenges and hurdles life throws at you while everyone around you watches in glee as you falter. There were times when I felt both Jordan and Brody's pain as if it was my own. I can't say I agreed with all of their choices and actions, but I will say I understood them. Not everyone can be strong all the time. The people we surround ourselves with help shore us up and keep up strong. Brody didn't always have the right people around him and he wasn't always willing to reach a hand out to those who were.I've got to say I loved how the story captured my interest and kept it as it moved from the past to the present. Brody and Jordan underwent lots of upheavals and changes, but their commitment to each other never wavered. There were a few places where I felt emphasis wasn't given enough and others which I felt could've been handled differently. Overall though the book is fantastic and I devoured it in what seemed to be no time at all. I love how Kate McCarthy did her research and incorporated plenty of information about soccer and football. I loved how she made her characters feel real. In the end, my wait was worth it because I got an unforgettable story with depth and emotion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD3QWDP7S2WBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014IDFDQU#wasThisHelpful","RD3QWDP7S2WBU","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has left me speechless in all the best ways. It took me a little over two hours to read it, but I enjoyed every word of it. As a connoisseur of organized crime romance novel I can't believe I've never read any of Bethany-Kris's books before. I'm so glad the brightly colored cover of this book caught my interest and then the blurb ensnared me.Lily DeLuca does not want to return home, but she heeds older brother Dino's summons and comes home, only to find out she's been promised in marriage to Damian Rossi, a man she doesn't know. Damian is willing to do what's needful, but isn't counting on his attraction to Lily and Lily is also taken by surprise at how much she finds herself liking Damian.As things tends to happen in a crime family, trust is tenuous and all it takes is for one attack from an unknown entity to start pulling loose the threads that ties these four crime families together. No one is safe as the bodies start piling. I've got to tell you for someone like me who loves to read books like this one, I had no idea what was going to happen next. I was just as stunned as the characters when the story took a turn. Lily was shaken by revelations and so was I.I think part of what made this book so great was how the story focused on Lily and Damian, yet also included what was happening in between the Chicago Outfit families as well. It was incorporated in way that never let you feel you were reading two stories in one. I loved getting to know Lily's friends and other members of the family. Another part of the book I really loved was how it tapped into a wide range of emotions. It wasn't all tears and fears. There were moments of lightness and happiness as well.I loved how Damian and Lily were together. Granted the way they were getting married wasn't ideal, but I think they really suited one another. I loved how Damian softened when he was with her. For a man who'd always been alone and a shadow, he really took his duty of keeping Lily safe and happy to heart. There were some moments when I really felt Lily's pain like it was my own. I understood her fear, anger, and confusion and also understood why things had been kept from her.Honestly, I can't wait to read more about the people I met in this book, whether it's Lily and Damian or others. I have a feeling this series is just getting started and this first book has really set the tone for the others. There's mayhem, romance, violence, and death in this book plus secrets and manipulation. It all comes together to tell a story that will leave your heart racing, you on the edge of your seat, and left wanting more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34P8OLXCQAYXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013CPI8RQ#wasThisHelpful","R34P8OLXCQAYXH","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dirty Secrets continues with the third installment in the series. Things between Sinthia (Sin) and Core are heating up and I mean literally. The tension that's been growing in between them is at boiling point and it's fantastic to watch! Sin is being her scrappy sarcastic self, giving lip like a pro. Core is still the master of his domain and all in it as he tries to avenge his mother's death.I felt like this part is the hottest yet. Not only do Sin and Core burn up the pages, but the mystery and suspense also ramp up. There were some interesting developments in the story. I liked how the flashbacks to the past were included. It really helped me grasp what motivated Core and Sin as I was privy to moments and thoughts other characters weren't. Thankfully it's a fast read which is a mixed blessing. Especially since I wanted to read more at the end of this part. I felt like while Sin and Core made great strides with their attraction to one another, I was a little confused at how quickly Sin capitulated to Core's desires and demands. Plus the mystery surrounding Sin's parents is making me curious and something I would've loved to know more about.I'm really looking forward to the next part because I'd love to know how the story progresses from here. I have a feeling things are about to get a little more interesting for both Sin and Core as the puzzle pieces of their lives fall in place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7E5QTUY1D8SY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZEQI1CY#wasThisHelpful","R7E5QTUY1D8SY","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jay and Bridgett are coming face to face over a decade after they'd last seen each other. Back then they were in love and the future looked promising, now they have nothing but animosity towards each other. Of course nothing is as it seems as they slowly learn. The flame that burned brightly between them hasn't gone out making their interactions a bit more complicated than they'd like.I liked Jay and Bridgett. It's obvious there's history between them that's caused them to change. Jay notices Bridgett is no longer the lively girl her remembers. It's like the spark in her has gone out. Bridgett isn't the only one whose gotten cynical. Jay's attitude has changed completely too. The open man with lots of love to give is gone, leaving this current avatar in its place. I loved being in both Jay and Bridgette's heads. It really allowed me to grasp who they were and how they'd evolved. I was even excited when they allowed their instincts and bodies to override what their heads were telling them. I hoped their hearts would surely follow and lead them back to each other, but it wasn't easy.Tracy Solheim did a great job at making the plot, including the reason behind the breakdown of Bridgett and Jay's relationship make sense. She also makes their journey back to each other emotionally difficult, but necessary. Better yet, she makes you feel their pain and that added even greater depth to the story. I can't believe how emotionally intense this book was. My feelings were fully engaged and so were my senses. It wasn't just Jay and Bridgett trying to deal with both the past and its lasting after effects, but also their current situations which had them embroiled once again. There were a number of subplots involving the team and family members that were integrated flawlessly.It was wonderful seeing characters from previous books that I loved. They were integrated into the story in such a way you don't need to read their books before you read this one. Each aspect just added to the impact of the story. I also love how the past was incorporated into the story which cleared up a lot of things.  All in all everything combined to  leave me a quivering pile of mush by the end and devouring every page. I loved and thoroughly enjoyed every page of this story and sincerely hope there are more in this series to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D0UX2FTAW7CN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425281027#wasThisHelpful","R3D0UX2FTAW7CN","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't recall the name of the book I was reading before I started this one and stopped because it wasn't capturing my attention. I had no problem immersing myself in the Guild Hunter world Nalini Singh has so skillfully crafted. I read 16% in 45 minutes while walking on the treadmill at the gym and stopped when it was time to leave, mid chapter. Fast forward to midnight, about two hours later when I decided finishing the chapter was a good idea before I went to sleep...I finished the book at 3:41 am. There was no way I could put it down.I've long wondered about Naasir's origins and the special gifts and skills he brings to the trusted Seven, the trusted men in Archangel Raphael's circle. I had some feelings but nothing could've prepared me for his story. I was fascinated and spell bound. I loved that the story was told both through Naasir's eyes and Andromeda's. It really allowed me to get a great feel of what was going on in their hearts and minds, as well as what motivated their behaviors.Naasir is mostly feral and slightly civilized. I loved how he knew who he was and how confident he was. I loved how he wasn't willing to change for anyone, even if he was tempted to. He knew his value and didn't pay attention to those who didn't. I loved how he was respected for that as well. Naasir might have been alone and looking for his mate, but he was loved and respected by the men and women he worked with. His friends truly loved him, so he wasn't completely alone but he was still lonely. There were a number of scenes with Elena, Ashwini, and Honor that made me both happy and sad for him when he was reminded of this fact.I loved Andromeda as much as I did Naasir. While Naasir was quiet and observant, so was Andromeda. I loved how she was dedicated to her craft. I will also admit to loving she was bookish. I loved her thirst for knowledge. I really didn't like how her family treated her. I also didn't like how her life was placed in jeopardy for what she may or may not have known. I loved how she handled herself in these dangerous situations and finessed a way out of them. The only thing she really couldn't get a handle on was Naasir and her attraction to him. The two complimented each other beautifully. I loved watching them try and figure out each other while they tried to avert certain disaster from happening.Archangel's Enigma is more than just Naasir and Andromeda's story, even though it focused mainly on them. The story itself is phenomenal. There are twists and turns one could never imagine. There's action and intrigue. I loved seeing the other members of the Seven and from the Guild. I especially can never get enough of Raphael and Elena. I enjoyed seeing what was happening across the Refuge and in the other territories, even if it was nerve wracking at times. Nalini Singh stole my heart in this book, as she has with all the previous Guild Hunter series novels. She manages to write descriptively and with passion, making new worlds spring to life before my eyes. If you're someone who doesn't read paranormal, like me, she'll convert you to one and you'll be glad you did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ENIDS8QT69J3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA4ZUFS#wasThisHelpful","R2ENIDS8QT69J3","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 stars!Let me start off by saying how much I love the cover of this book. It's not just that the cover features one of my favorite things in the world, chocolate, but  also how it's arrayed. I love the pink polka dots too. It makes for a really memorable cover. I also love how it ties in with the story. The same goes for the title. It's one of those that fits the story and it's multiple aspects perfectly.Jessica Mallory, better known as Jessie, is looking to change things. She's not really happy with both her professional and personal life. She's emotionally invested in her relationship with her boyfriend Quinn (whom I didn't like very much) even though it doesn't seem like he is. She's ready to do something with her her talent and passion for making chocolate. I loved being in her head. Jessie is vulnerable and has many of the same insecurities as I do. It was really easy to understand and relate to her. I felt horrible for her when her sort of relationship fell apart and she was left feeling even worse than she was before. I loved that she had friends and a support system both personally and professionally, but hated how her immediate family wasn't there for her.I loved being in Nate Lancaster's head too. He's one of Jessie's really close friends and he's also the best friend of her""boyfriend."" To make things even more interesting, he's been in love with Jessie for a long time. With Quinn out of the picture, he has his chance to show Jessie what she's been missing all along. I think Nate was perfect for Jessie. Not only was he this hot body builder, but he was thoughtful and caring too. I loved how he put her first and supported her in whatever she wanted to do. I hated how his love was unrequited for so long, but Jessie was a smart girl and didn't remain blind forever.Watching the dynamic change between Jessie and Nate was a lot of fun. Of course it wasn't so much for Nate, but that man was patient. The two of them had amazing chemistry and watching them with each other made me feel light and happy. Of course not everything was smooth sailing, and it took a couple of emotional bumps for them to work some things out. It wasn't all emotions and feelings though. There were some good bits of laughter as well. I must say the baby shower scene is my favorite. I literally could not contain my laughter. It was wonderful.Of course this book flew by quickly. I would've loved to have seen Quinn get his comeuppance, but my anger towards him quickly faded to pity. I would've also loved more interaction between Jessie and her parents or at least a reason as to why they disregarded her completely. My heart hurt for her on that. I loved seeing Jax and Wren again and seeing how wonderfully they're doing. I had a strong hankering for some pasta with marinara after the scene on the farm.  Natalie Charles has done a wonderful job at making her characters feel real and people you'd want to be friends with. She also does an amazing job at using language so descriptive you can almost see, taste, and touch the things she's taking about. I loved this trip to Archer's Cove and seeing it's inhabitants. I can't wait to go back and meet new people!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32JK05H286LLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSQBF3W#wasThisHelpful","R32JK05H286LLT","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first fell in love with Luka Ransom Riley-Hale in Thin Love, when his parents found and fought for their epic love. Thick Love, made me fall in love with him all over again. My concerns for the long wait reading his story were unfounded. I found Thick Love to surpass any expectation I had.This is the first Eden Butler book I haven't devoured, but savored. I had to slow down and absorb each word, nuance, and action. The book also showcases so many emotions and there was no way I could've done them justice if I read at my normal rapid pace. Instead of three hours, I took five to read this beauty.Don't get me wrong, I may have read at a slower pace, but I was entranced by the story and couldn't put it down.I loved how the book went back and forth between both the present and the past and from Ransom and Aly's points of view. It really helped give me a complete picture at what was going on in their lives that led to them being the people they were. I also loved seeing Keira and Kona again, a few years down the line from when they got their happy ever after. It was great to see how much they had and hadn't changed. I loved the way they loved and cared for Ransom. They worried about him, and didn't hesitate to meddle in his business or let him be when they knew he needed it.Ransom is a tortured person. It actually hurt me to read and see what he was going through and putting himself and others through. I wanted so badly for him to realize by doing what he was doing to himself, he wasn't living the life he should be. I understood his need and desire for penance, but it felt like he'd done enough. I mean he went through the steps, especially at home and at socially at school, but it wasn't enough. That's where Aly came in.I loved Aly. I mean she's strong and willing to do what it takes to achieve her goals. No one is going to tell her she can't accomplish something. She's also kind, loving, brave, and perceptive. Aly might be short and diminutive when it comes to stature, but she's got a core of steel and a temper too, that makes her seem much larger than she is. Aly and Ransom together are a thing of beauty. Aly is alone, and in a way so is Ransom. They have such wonderful chemistry. I felt like I was intruding on something special and sacred.One of the best things about them is the delicious slow burn. I loved how most if not all of the heavy emotional stuff was dealt with first. There was no way Aly and Ransom could've made it if they'd jumped into bed first. The emotional connection between them made the physical so much sweeter when it happened. And it was hot too, don't doubt me. I was pretty worked up.Eden Butler really delivered with Thick Love. This book is heavy on the feelings and emotions and the themes of forgiveness and love. I'm extremely happy to know there will be more Ransom and Aly in the future. I'm not quite ready to be done with these two, or Keira, Kona, and their other adorable children. I have no doubt that story will be as epic as this one. Ransom doesn't need to worry about the shadows his accomplished father and mother cause, or the shadow caused by their love. The shadow he casts with Aly is equally as epic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI4EAU8NRSY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147IA3RK#wasThisHelpful","RI4EAU8NRSY2","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any book written by Tracey Garvis Graves is highly anticipated and rightly so. I've only read two books by her, even though I own them all and she hasn't let me down yet. I was really intrigued by the blurb because the word hacker has mostly a negative connotation to it and I was interested to see how it'd translate into a love story. I needn't have worried at all.Kate is making a new life for herself. She's let go of her old life as a lawyer and decided to serve her community by operating a food bank in Minneapolis. I loved her for doing that. She was willing to take risks and follow her heart even if it means leaving everything safe behind. I loved how she never let Ian get away with anything. Even in the beginning when she was wary of him, she still managed to keep him on his toes.  I loved Ian. Calling him a modern day Robin Hood is a fair call. He's got his own set of morals. I loved how he was cocky and confident but not arrogant. I loved how he wanted to help Kate and those who came to the pantry for help. I especially liked how he challenged Kate.Ian and Kate had wonderful chemistry. It showed with every word and grew with every page. I loved how they were with one another. I almost felt like I was intruding in their romance, however I was very happy to experience their story. I was pleasantly surprised at how much hotter this book was compared to the other book by Tracey I'd read. It certainly suited Ian and Kate. I loved how Kate was with her family. I loved how they supported her through it all. I loved learning about Ian. He really truly did keep his secrets close to his chest. He also provided me with some food for thought. It wasn't just about his being a hacker, or learning about the kinds of hackers, but it was also learning about what happened when online security breaches occurred.There were some very tender moments in this book and there were some light ones. I did shed some tears, but it was inevitable. Tracey writes with such passion and emotion it's impossible not to get caught up in the story. My attention was caught early on and it didn't wane until the book was finished. I wasn't prepared for some of the turns the story took. I don't think anyone could. I'm hoping to get more Ian and Kate in the future. While I'm satisfied with the ending of the book I just feel like there's so much more left to be told and done. I know I'm going to feeling the after effects of this book for a long time to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21GRWVUJEBSJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCUGPXK#wasThisHelpful","R21GRWVUJEBSJ8","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hockey season is over and while legions of fans wait for it to come back, many readers like me prefer to get our fixes in the pages of a sports romances. Delayed Penalty is the first book in the Pilots Hockey series and it features a sexy Russian and his translator. It's a great way to pass some time.Auden is home for the summer. She's reeling from being cut from the soccer team and losing her sorts scholarship. Finding out her grandfather has a job lined up for her is a blessing, until she realizes who she's working with. Her initial meeting with Aleksandr didn't really go well. Of course their follow up interactions sort of continue in the same vein and it doesn't help she's attracted to him either.I liked Auden for the most part. She's not afraid to work hard. She takes her responsibilities seriously. She's trying to find a way to make it in the world, but she's still unsure of herself. I could really relate to that.  Aleksandr didn't make the greatest first impression. He eventually grew on me and I came to like him as well. It was very evident the two of them had chemistry. I was a little surprised when they just started making out. It just seemed sudden when before they'd been dancing around each other.The story is really interesting. I thought it was going to be mainly about Auden and Aleksandr, but then things started happening in the story that sort of shifted my focus away from them. I felt like there was too much going on and as a result the different parts of the story weren't given the development they needed. I had too many questions once I finished reading. I also got frustrated with Auden. She was quick to voice her opinion but slow to act, in particular when it came to things she didn't like. I felt like she brushed too many things under the rug. I'm a champion at avoiding things, but it felt like she could out do even me. There was a lot of potential to the story. I'm hoping the next book in the series will clear up my remaining questions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OO9MVK3IMB3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S3RK7O6#wasThisHelpful","R3OO9MVK3IMB3W","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I flat out loved this book. It had everything I look for in a story. I loved the characters, the story, and the way it made me laugh, swoon, and cry. It's perfect. I can't believe I'm saying this especially considering the way I love Tangled, but Sustained may have just replaced it as my favorite Emma Chase book. It's certainly unforgettable.Jake Becker is a driven man. He's set on becoming partner and nothing is going to stop him. He's not one for attachments other than those to his friends. Women don't compute longer than it takes for him to get them and himself off. He's an honest manwhore. So when he meets Chelsea incidentally and suddenly things are topsy turvy.I loved Jake and being in his head. He's hilarious. I loved how he was with all of the McQuaids in particular the younger ones. I loved seeing him change his perspective towards his future. I understood his battles between what he thought he should do and what he needed. Jake wasn't an easy man. He might be a complete shark in the courtroom and do whatever needed to win, but he wasn't heartless.Chelsea McQuaid is something else. I adored her. She's so determined to do right by her brother, the way he did right by her. I felt her pain and understood her fears. She was alone, but she was trying her best to deal with her grief and that of her nieces and nephews. She needs help, in fact all the little ones need help and it seems like Jake found his way into their lives at just the right time.There's this special alchemy between Chelsea and Jake. They spark and flare, but can't stay away from each other. While neither are paragons of virtue, both are dealing with their changing realities and learning from the mistakes they make. I loved watching them be happy as much as I did watching them make up after a fight or disagreement. Jake and Chelsea are real and easy to relate to, especially when they're messing up.I loved how much I laughed while reading this story. It's not just Jake's dry tone of voice, but also the kids. They had me in stitches. I also loved how easy it was to connect to all of them. I read this book in a couple of hours because I couldn't bear to put it down. In fact I devoured the first quarter of the book in thirty minutes. The pages just flew by as I fell for Jake, Chelsea, and the kids. I loved seeing Stanton, Sofia, and Brent again. Emma Chase has done a magnificent job with Sustained. I foresee myself doing numerous re-reads of this book. My words are inadequate but the book speaks for itself. You must give it a try if you like soulful, moving, romantic comedies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZV4VKZ6DQOJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WQF6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZV4VKZ6DQOJW","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 stars!I'm not going to lie, this book really took me by surprise. I was expecting the tried and true struggle between people who are in financially opposite situations but Monica Murphy definitely did it differently. I wasn't surprised to see how much I enjoyed the book seeing as I read it in a handful of hours.Gabe is different when he's away from his friends. I liked this Gabe so much more than the one I met in Fair Game. He's still the bad boy, but he's different with Lucy. It's like he's growing up and wanting to be someone deserving of her. For once he's not just thinking about himself and his needs, but someone else's. I loved seeing him with Lucy. He's caring, considerate, and being a gentleman when everything in his instincts is telling him otherwise.I liked Lucy too. She's a good girl at heart.She's hard working and trying to reconcile being cautious the way her mother has always told her to be with her own desires and need to be independent.The pull between the two of them is amazing. I could almost feel the heat through my e-reader and I was so glad I had a glass of cold water near by to help. I liked seeing Gabe off his game when it came to Lucy. I think it made it easier for him to approach her and then follow along with her game plan as opposed to his. I really wondered what they were going to do once their summer fling ended and I didn't have to wonder too long. I will say I was shocked when they ran into each other again. I know it says it in the blurb but I didn't read the blurb before I started reading, so it was a good surprise.When it came to their financial situations I wasn't a huge fan of the secret Lucy was keeping from Gabe. I understand why she was so hesitant to tell him once their relationship got started, but it seemed like it should've been an issue to begin with. I got why she did it though, especially thinking their relationship was short term, but still they both could've avoided a lot of unnecessary heartache. I loved seeing Shep and Jade again. Even cranky Tristan made an appearance and I have a feeling he has some dark demons.That being said, this book wasn't as heavy on the emotions as I was expecting to be, but I still really had a great time reading it. Gabe doesn't disappoint and I'm sure you'll feel the same once you get to know him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FRZ9U4P1WMSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TL9S4U#wasThisHelpful","R2FRZ9U4P1WMSK","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 stars!I've been a fan of Alyssa Goodnight's writing for some time. She wrote these amazing modern magical re-tellings of some of Jane Austen's novels that I absolutely loved. They really opened my mind to the idea of realistic magical elements in contemporary fiction. Then there was nothing from her for a while so I was super excited and happy to see she was publishing Just Say Yes.Max and Jade make a fabulous couple. They might not have found each other either without the meddling of Evie, Jade's thirteen year old daughter. Neither of them is looking for a relationship but the attraction to each other is stronger than their misgivings. I loved being in both of their heads and watching them try to be logical and play it safe about their feelings. I liked how Jade was more open minded than she thought. I loved how she was with Evie. She was firm as a parent should be, but she gave Evie lots of love and the understanding it was okay to try new things.I loved the role family played in this book. It wasn't just Jade and Evie, but Max with his grandmother and sister too. Yia Yia Cleo was a firecracker and I loved her. I loved how Max took care of them even when they it wasn't what he wanted to do. I loved how even though he had misgivings about what his sister was doing with her life, he still loved her. I loved how Max was with Evie. He was kind and friendly, yet also offered her support. He treated her as an adult and respected her wishes. I really didn't like Evie's father and his fiancee. In a way they were sort of responsible of Max and Jade meeting. However they didn't have very many redeeming qualities between them.Now coming to something unique. I love how food is used in this story. It's sort of like extra whipped cream on your piece of cake or pie. I've always loved food and stories that feature them in some way. I've read very few stories where the food plays an equally important roll as the characters. I definitely can not think of other books where the meaning and characteristics of foods have been discussed. It really made me think about the foods I like to eat and how they might be impacting my life and decisions.The first part of the book was a little slow. A little over a quarter of the way in, it picked up and I was hooked. I loved how there was a little bit of a book within a book. I would've loved to read more of it. I loved seeing Jade and Evie interact with their neighbors, Elena and Zoe. I loved the descriptive language Alyssa used. The Moran household is bright and colorful and I could almost see it in my head. I'm sincerely hoping this book evolves into a series because I would love to read more about Opal the kitchen witch, and others Jade and Evie met. I can already sense a number of interesting couples. If you're looking for a book that you'll surprise you with how great it is, this book is for you. I hope you read it and experience the magic for yourself!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHU82Q0YI9VVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105SAS1W#wasThisHelpful","RHU82Q0YI9VVY","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love unconventional romances. There's something fresh and unique about them. I love it when it's a historical romance a little more, just because I read them so sparingly these days. The Iron Princess is definitely stands out for a number of reasons. The first is the time period in which it is set and the second is the location. Even better, the story features some characters from a book that precedes it, although you don't have to read it to keep up with what's going on.Katia is the daughter of a powerful Jarl or warlord and she's received training in combat. She's no weakling. She's smart, brave, and proactive. She doesn't take no for an answer but will find a way to make things happen. I really admired that about her. Katia is also a little reckless even though she's got the best intentions at heart. I loved seeing her try to reconcile her attraction to Lothair and her desire to avoid marriage. It was very entertaining to see which would rule, her heart or her head. When it comes to Lothair, he also has power at his fingertips. He's also a child of nobility but the circumstances of his birth have soured him on his life, something I got. Lothair is looking to do something and finding a wife is not it.Lothair and Katia are both passionate hot heads, Katia more so. The two butt heads often and it strengthens the tension between them. The two had amazing chemistry and I enjoyed seeing them get along as much as I did seeing them bicker. I think part of the reason that works out so well is because they were thrown together in a high pressure situation. Speaking of which, I loved the history lesson about the politics of the time. I was on edge for a large portion of the book. I wasn't sure what was going to happen and since the story is very fast paced there wasn't much time to stop and ponder what was going to happen next.I think Sandra Lake has done a wonderful job at crafting a story that's suspenseful, romantic, and entertaining. I read this book in a handful of hours and in one sitting. It didn't matter if I was happy, on edge, angry, or sad, there was no way I could put this book down. My emotions were fully engaged. I don't know how Sandra is going to top this book, but I'm looking forward to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AL0ME78NZG9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV124Q2#wasThisHelpful","R1AL0ME78NZG9C","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I know what I'm getting into when I pick up a Hades Hangmen novel; a story that will tear me apart and then somehow put me back together. It's dark, violent, painful, but also equally full of hope and love, that eventually find themselves the victors. I don't know how, but it does and it's all I've wanted for Maddie and Flame from the moment I met them.By all rights Maddie and Flame are superhuman. They are extraordinary, not because of their respective beauty and rage, but for their inner strengths. They have the capability to withstand so much and they have. It was haunting to read about Maddie's experiences as a child in a place where she was hated and abused. It was even more devastating to learn the truth behind Flame's ""madness"". I wanted to crawl into the pages of the book so many times and take matters into my own hands. I physically hurt when I read about what forged them into the people they were.Flame and Maddie have had an interesting attraction to one another from the very beginning. They have this alchemy that is untouchable. It's like the other person is their lodestone, their port of safety in a storm. Perhaps it is just because they recognize the goodness and perfection in each other when all everyone else might see is the faults. I loved the way they were with each other. Even when there was no verbal exchange or physical contact between them, I could feel the peace the other's presence brought to them.I think this is the darkest Hades novel to date. If you've read the previous books you know I'm not saying this lightly. I was not able to cry. I was so hurt and angry, my tears evaporated in my eyes as they formed and I was left with a burning desire for vengeance in my gut. There were many, many times when I was shaken to my soul. I often wondered why it was I kept reading when it'd just be easier to stop, but I had to know what happened next. There were so many twists I could've never anticipated; for every one I guessed  correctly, there were probably three beyond my wildest imagination.Besides Maddie and Flame, I loved seeing Styx and Mae, Ky and Lilah, and getting to know AK and Viking better. Those two are truly Flame's family. I loved the way they cared for him and looked out for him. I loved the way Maddie's sisters looked out for her but allowed her to do what was best for her. I'm still amazed at how tiny, fragile Maddie soothed Flame the wild beast. I was ecstatic to see the Prez and VP with their old ladies doing well. They were the best examples for Maddie to see that she wasn't ruined and that there was a chance for happiness for her after all.In the end, nothing I really say can prepare you for the magnitude of this book. It'll play heavy with your emotions and it'll stick with you long after you've finished the book, but you'll be back for more. It's a book you'll devour like I did, even when I wanted to read with one eye closed so to lessen how deeply I was feeling what I was reading. Every time I read a Hades Hangmen novel I think there's no way Tillie Cole can out do herself, but she does and I'm left speechless. Flame and Maddie overcome so much to find happiness and I think experiencing an epic book hangover is worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIJS8L55Q7M8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013OJYRJI#wasThisHelpful","RIJS8L55Q7M8M","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coming home can be difficult, but coming home after losing someone important is even harder. Ajax is home but he's grieving the loss of his mentor and surrogate father Priest. He still hasn't been able to figure out why he and his brothers were exiled a decade ago and now he's tasked with calling his brothers home. Things have changed though, both in his city and family. The biggest noticeable change is Sophie Lombard, the daughter of the man he respects most.The attraction between Sophie and Ajax was instant and undeniable. It seemed like even before they'd exchanged names they were getting off with each other. I like how the insta-lust between them was not confused for insta-love on either of their parts. I really liked Sophie. My heart hurt for her knowing she'd lost her only family. I also hurt when she realized her father whom she'd sacrificed so much for hadn't cared enough to do the same. It was certainly jarring. I liked Sophie and her wits. She was smart and mostly level headed. She was reliable and responsible for someone so young. She also had a wild streak.Ajax was an interesting character. I liked him, sometimes. Other times I felt like he was too overbearing and rude. Ajax might have been short on words and emotions but the ones he shared and showed carried a lot of weight. I also felt horrible for him when I learned how he came to be a Deacon. I loved Ajax's loyalty and commitment to family, even if he knew pursuing Sophie broke the rules. Once he made Sophie his, she was his concern, even if she didn't like it.I think I liked watching Sophie and Ajax butt heads as much as I did seeing them get along. I was a little concerned about how blase they were regarding Priest's death especially when they realized it might not have been an accident. I don't feel like it was given the attention it deserved and when you have characters like Sophie and Ajax who have strong connections to the deceased, it felt wrong. I do feel like the murder mystery was pushed aside and Sophie and Ajax's bedroom romps took center stage. Now I'm not complaining because they were hot, but I would've liked the story and sex to be balanced. However since there are more books coming, I'm hoping that there will be more about finding the truth.As it is, I'm really excited to see Megan Crane writing something new and unfamiliar. It's definitely the hottest book of hers I've ever read. I like that she's pushing her boundaries. Overall, this book was a great introduction to a new story and characters and a great way to start off a new series. I'm already eagerly looking forward to the next book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1343VA3L6U4U0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEPS8TG#wasThisHelpful","R1343VA3L6U4U0","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm gutted...again. Pepper Winters took me apart piece by piece, page by page, and barely put me back together by the end of the book. She didn't spare anyone, let one Nila, Jethro, and the rest of the Weavers and Hawks. The only ones to enjoy themselves were Bonnie, Cut, and Daniel.I can't even type their names without shuddering. I know what I'm reading is not real, but that doesn't lessen my desire to reach into my e-reader and strangle them with my bare hands. I wanted the suffering of so many to end, and yet I couldn't force myself to stop reading and put the book down. I had to know what happened next. Nothing could stop me, not the fear in my chest or my anxious nerves.The Weaver and Hawk Saga is still such a mystery. Each debt has revealed something but with the massive shake up in the hierarchy of power and control, things have changed. With each new revelation, Nila is left with more questions as am I. She and I may have learned about Emma, her mother, but the questions raised about Jethro's mother and uncle have been left unanswered. The mention of a past couple bonded by and in the debt was also a small peek into what might be coming for her.Nila Weaver has an almost unbelievable will. She has been through so much and goes through so much in this book and yet she has limitless wells of strength. She relies on her different emotions to get her through the gauntlet she's facing. I admire her so much. The beauty and challenge of talking about this book is not revealing anything that could ruin the reading experiences for others. It's one that you've got to read to find out how it'll effect you.As someone who has repeatedly professed to not love dark romance with violence and mind games, I've become a huge fan of this series and Pepper Winters. It's become a not-so-secret addiction. I'm so invested in this story I couldn't stop even if I wanted to. Pepper is the queen of cliffhangers. I'm once again on tenterhooks about what will happen to Nila from this point on. Hope is such a precious thing and hers seems to be dwindling. Waiting as it always is going to be such sweet agony.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMUYUXP23M58R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6BY24Q#wasThisHelpful","RMUYUXP23M58R","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has been a long time in the making. I've known since I read Sugar Daddy that the Travis family was something special. Especially since I got to watch the Travis men and women fall in love with extraordinary women and men, all except Joe. I knew Joe needed to have his story told too. He was the one Travis male who didn't fit the mold. He was an alpha man with a softer side, and that created friction between him and his father who had certain expectations of his sons.What can I say about Avery? She's spunky, determined, and a hard worker. She might not believe in happily ever after for herself but she will go above and beyond to make someone else's special day be everything they dreamed off, no questions asked. There is no problem is too big for her to handle. She's organized and meticulous. She's confident when it comes to her work but she's insecure about herself and her looks. That's something we can all relate to. All I saw was a very capable young woman who underestimated what she had to share with someone else.I hated how Avery's family was unsupportive and belittling. The only one in her corner was was her half-sister Sophia. I loved her friends/employees. I loved their camaraderie. They really made Avery smile and laugh, and me as well. I loved the tension between Sophia and Steven. Their back and forth verbal sparring was truly exciting to behold and great foreplay as well. I was so hoping they'd get together. I also loved how they pushed Avery to leave her safe holding pattern. They provided both friendship and the boost she needed to relax sometimes and take risks she wouldn't have. Joe couldn't have had better allies to woo her if he'd tried.Joe was exactly what Avery needed. He was supportive and challenged her to step out of the confines she'd put herself in to keep her heart safe. You could tell Joe was really into Avery, even when she was trying her best to push him away. It was easy to see how much Joe had changed in the years and the lessons he'd learned from what life had brought him. I loved Joe's overall attitude towards life. Life wasn't always kind to him, even being a charmed Travis, but it was admirable how he took it all in stride. It's amazing how Lisa Kleypas managed to make me fall in love with him through only Avery's eyes. We're never privy to his innermost thoughts, only his actions, yet they were enough to win me over completely.I loved seeing Avery and Joe interact with each other. They had amazing chemistry. I can't tell you how turned on I was while reading this book. In terms of heat, it's all mostly suggestive, but the way it's written you can not only see it, but feel it. That takes true talent. Lisa Kleypas is a well known for writing great slow burn romances. She builds anticipation with precision and great technique.I was so happy to see the Travis-Cates clan together. It wasn't just Gage, Liberty, Haven, Hardy, Jack, Emma, and Luke, but it was seeing their strong bonds with each other and how their families had grown with time. It's nice to know how much has changed while not changing at all. I also loved meeting Ryan, a cousin to the Travis'. I fell in love with him a little in this book, and I would love to read a full length story featuring him one day. That man needs some honest love.Lisa Kleypas might have made us wait for this story, but the wait was so worth it. The story flowed beautifully and her writing bordered on poetic. I was able to ""see"" what she was describing in my mind. I devoured the story in handful of hours, but it felt like no time at all. I wouldn't have minded reading another hundred pages or two. I sincerely hope the wait between this book and her next contemporary won't be so long. I can never get enough of her writing and stories!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ARC0WBBTO99N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S52XQ56#wasThisHelpful","R1ARC0WBBTO99N","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't read very many books featuring males as the the romantic love interests. I've enjoyed the few that I have, but none as much as this one. This will be the book I compare all future new adult m/m books too and I don't say that lightly. I've always understood and accepted homosexuality, but I wasn't ever able to bring myself to read romance novels about it. I've certainly read my fair share of erotica with menages, but two guys by them selves wasn't ever a priority. I'm not exactly sure why but I discounted the feelings and emotions guys can have. I thought I wouldn't feel the same emotional connection as I would with a heterosexual couple or be able to relate to the protagonists. I was wrong.I was really surprised by how much I could relate to Wes. He comes across as confident and secure, yet when it comes to Jaime, the person he's loved for so long, he's skittish and terrified. I understood why his fears and his reasons even when he said and did things I didn't think were helpful or right. I loved Wes's personality. He was wild and up for anything. He was also kind, considerate, caring, driven, and talented. He knew what he wanted to do and he was going to make it happen. I loved how he was himself and didn't try to fit into whatever mold others wanted him to.I really liked Jaime too. Compared to Wes he was more relaxed and laid back. I loved the wisdom he gave as a counselor to his campers. It was as deep as it was simple. While I feel like Jaime had the upper hand in the relationship, I liked how he never abused it. I also felt like Jaime was the wild card in the story. Even being in both his and Wes's head never really made what they wanted completely clear. I loved the insight I got from it. I loved how Jaime was with his family. They were such an open, loving bunch. I completely got why Wes envied Jaime for that; Wes's parents were horrendous.Wes and Jaime had some amazing emotional and physical chemistry. I knew from the get go Wes was attracted to Jaime, but it was interesting watching Jaime figure out what he wanted. The intimate scenes between them were scorching hot. I mean I was seriously turned on! This book was full of surprises for me. I was surprised by how often I laughed and even by a few tears. Even more so were how many of my misconceptions about m/m romance were dispelled. Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy did a phenomenal job at writing this book. It's written seamlessly and you can't tell where one started writing and the other stopped. I'd definitely recommend this book to people looking for characters with a strong emotional connection with lots of hot, steamy sex!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ENYXEHJU6GZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LSLI9G#wasThisHelpful","R3ENYXEHJU6GZS","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read a great book, I often find it difficult to put into words how magnificent it is. I want to run pillar to post grabbing everyone shaking them while yelling, ""Oh my goodness, you have to read this book! You have no idea what you're missing out on!""Of course that tends to scare people more often than not, but I'll try my level best to do this book justice.There are some books that just read better in the silence of the night. I didn't start reading this book until 1 AM. I figured I'd read a chapter and then go to sleep. I didn't stop until I'd finished it at 3 AM. Even then sleep wouldn't come. My mind was wide awake even if my body was tired. I was trying to process how amazing the book I'd just finished was. It was truly a struggle. I must say the blurb is totally deceptive, but in a good way. You think you have an idea about what the story will be about, but then you're jolted by the very first page. It captured my attention and didn't let it go until I was finished. This story is dark, poetic, a deep romance, and even philosophical. It has some of the most profound lines I've had the pleasure to read.Leylah Attar took me on this incredible journey with Damian and Skye. I experienced so many emotions, among them pain, fear, heartbreak, hope, and love. There were innumerable tears. I couldn't help myself. It was impossible to foreshadow so many events in this book. Damian might have been explosive in his anger, but there were revelations in this book that rocked him as much as they did Skye and me. I couldn't believe the turns this book took. They were gut wrenching; some were easier to understand than others.  The themes in this story are universal and unforgettable. The one that stood out to me the most was the power of love and revenge.The Paper Swan is an epic story of loss, love, revenge, redemption, and forgiveness. From the first page to the last, it's just unbelievably amazing. It's best to go into this book as blind as possible so you have the best reading experience. The hangover this book leaves will last for days. It's impossible for it not to. Damian and Skye had an undeniable chemistry and a connection that is soul deep. When the connection the characters have with one another is so deep it shows in their mannerisms, speech, and movements. Words are not always needed to convey thoughts, emotions, and feelings.This is my first Leylah Attar novel. She's published two other books before this. She shows such maturity and promise. If she writes at this level now, I can't wait to see the heights she achieves.  This book will leave a lasting impression on you as it did me. Pick it up today and find out why!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23CA4DL3J4QNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HZC11G#wasThisHelpful","R23CA4DL3J4QNF","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't even know where to start with this book. I'm still trying to process all the feelings I had. First of all this book has blown me away. I knew this subject material wasn't going to be easy to read because Jay is known for writing material that's hard and real. I wasn't expecting it to affect me so much but I should have.Josh won me over from the first page. The prologue is long but by the end of it, I was fully connected to him. His emotions became my emotions; his fears became my own. I don't see how anyone could not love him. He's a dedicated father, willing to make sacrifices and be there for his child. He works hard and is trying to do the best with what he has. I loved seeing him with Tommy. I loved Tommy too. He had this innocence surrounding him that was capable of first piercing Becca's shield.What can I say about Becca? I knew from the moment she appeared that she'd been though some really horrible things. I knew I was going to be devastated when they were revealed, but I let my guard down and I let her in too. When everything came out and was said and done, it felt like I had a crater in my chest and a never ending food of tears. I was right. I wanted to reach into the book and gather her in my arms and rock her back forth as mother does a young child. She more than Josh, broke my heart.Josh and Becca had wonderful chemistry. It was easy to see how much they felt for one another. I really liked how they took it slow. Even with the overwhelming connection between them, neither of them was quite ready for the physical part of the relationship while they were still working on the emotional part. That being said, I got so frustrated with those two. Yes they both have gigantic baggage, most of it emotional. However the lack of communication between the two of them drove me nuts. It caused so many problems for them. They both had an extremely difficult time discussing the past and handling things, so I wished they could've trusted each other and they love they had for one another to see them though difficult times instead of falling apart.I loved seeing Chloe and Hunter from Where the Road Takes Me. They made brief appearances that had a lasting impact. I loved the family Josh made for himself; his step uncle Rob and aunt Kim, Grams (Chazarae), and Becca. There may have been times when Josh felt lonely, but he was never alone. He had an amazing support system. Josh and Becca's story didn't end on the last page of Kick Push. I sincerely hope to see the two of them in another book of any length. They may love each other with every fiber of their soul's but they also hurt each other to the core as well. I would've love to see them in some time when they've matured and can love the way they should. Their love is something beautiful and I can't wait to read more about it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29SWLB59UFZ92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ARRX2Y#wasThisHelpful","R29SWLB59UFZ92","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Look out everyone, Candy Seaborne is back in town and she's shaking things up! I've experienced Debra Doxer's writing before and so I know she can write a great story. However, I wasn't expecting it to be so mysterious and suspenseful. I loved the mix of young adult and adult themes. It makes sense there'd be a mix because Candy is eighteen and on the cusp of being an adult.I think what makes this book really work is that in essence, there are two different stories set in this one book. You've got Candy trying to re-assimilate with her childhood peers and stay on top of all the mean girls and then you've got Candy's life at home with her father and the secrets he is hiding. Both of them are written really well and when the two parts of Candy's lives collide it really gets interesting.I liked Candy. I understood her fascination and attraction to Jonah. I even understood her need to get revenge on those who did her and those around her wrong. I may have even chuckled at her pranks. I wasn't so sure why she wanted to be like her father given his interesting occupation, but I have a feeling I'll find out more about that in the second book. I think besides the pranks, which I thought were simple but perfect, I liked Candy because I could relate to her. I understood her desire to be close to her father. I understood her need to fit in. I got the fact she was unsettled by her feelings for Jonah especially considering her recent experiences with males in her life.I really appreciated how Debra Doxer included CREST, an auto immune disorder. It's something important to her as she suffers from it, and I really liked how it was addressed and used in the story. From start to end I was caught up in the story. I would've loved for it to be longer, but since this one ended quite abruptly I can't wait to read the next book and see what happens. You've been warned people, there's a doozy of a cliffhanger to match an equally awesome story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21MJMXVIW176E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011F9963G#wasThisHelpful","R21MJMXVIW176E","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love stories featuring love a second time around. It doesn't necessarily have to be with someone they've known before, but there's something infinitely more special about going into a relationship with past lessons and coming out stronger because of them. Julia isn't 100% ready to throw herself back into life, but knows she has to in order to help set the precedent for her daughter Analise.  Both of them are struggling with grief after the sudden loss of Adam, Julia's husband and Analise's father.My heart broke for both Julia and Analise. Most of us can relate to the shock of losing someone we love unexpectedly. Grieving is a process that takes time.  I understood Julia's hesitance to be social and go out, while also grasping how important it was that she do it. I adored Analise. She might only be ten years old but she's a shrewd judge of character and an unexpected font of wisdom. I hated seeing her hurt but I enjoyed seeing her grow too as a result. I liked Julia. She's down to Earth, sincere, and a wonderful mother. I really liked how she put Analise first at a time when her feelings and emotions were conflicted (even if she was also protecting her own heart at the time too). I loved seeing Julia deal with her friends/support group. They were really there for her in every sense of the way.I really enjoyed the story. I liked following Julia on her journey to opening up again and even finding a new love. I really liked how I really didn't know who/if she was going to find a new love until over half way into the book. I liked analyzing her interactions with the men from her life who had unexpectedly popped up again. There were only a few points where I felt the story could've been stronger. One dealt with a potential suitor.  I wasn't sure when he became a contender for her affections in earnest. They had good chemistry, but I didn't really feel the sparks between them in the beginning. I also would've loved to see those who caused trouble for Julia, Analise, and her potential lover get their just desserts. I also would've liked to know more about a secret that was revealed to Julia and the effects of them on a potential relationship.Overall, I really enjoyed the story. The characters are well written and easy to relate to. The story captured my attention from the first page and held it throughout. There were thrills, laughter, and some tears. I enjoyed seeing characters from the first book of the series making brief cameos and I may have an idea about whom the next book will feature. Marilyn Brant did a wonderful job at capturing all of the emotions of her characters and transporting me to Mirabelle Harbor. I loved visiting and can't wait to go back!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S2ZDCHHHWYGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106BJVUW#wasThisHelpful","R2S2ZDCHHHWYGF","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Waiting is one of the cruelest and hardest things to do. I've been anticipating this book since last October. I've counted down the days and thankfully my wait was fruitful; Truth or Beard was totally worth the wait. Penny Reid has this way of writing that gets to me every time. She manages to mesh humor, emotion, drama, and serious issues together in a way you'll love.Boy did I laugh. Jess and Duane both narrate and it's often as hilarious as it is hot to listen to their thoughts. There were even times when I laughing and turned on at the same time. That's disturbing since most people don't equate arousal with laughter, but it's done well. There were also moments when I couldn't control my tears. I wasn't all out sobbing, but there are poignant moments that took me by surprise. I feel like I devoured this book. The pages flew by I had no idea where I was in the story. All that mattered was reading it.I loved Jess and Duane. I loved how Jess pushed the envelope on what was ""okay"" with her over protective father and brother. I loved how she followed her heart and didn't let anyone disparage her dreams. She didn't let any one's opinion color what she wanted or how she felt, especially when it came to Duane. I loved how she fiercely she felt for him and his family, even if she initially fought her reaction to him. I loved how Jess was with Claire, her best friend. I admired the heck out of Claire too. I have a feeling she'll be getting her own story sooner than later and I can't wait to read it! Most of all I loved how brilliant and motivated Jess was. I admired the way she was bold and determined to get Duane fully invested in their relationship.What can I say about Duane? He may be one of the trouble making Winstons, but there's so much more to him. He's honorable, dedicated, and a planner. There was so much about him I didn't know and loved learning. I was taken aback at how much he felt for Jess. He was really a case of still waters run deep. I loved how Duane was willing to go all out for those he loved. That man was so not what I thought he was going to be. He might not be a charmer like some of his brothers, but his straight forward manner really made him who he was. He definitely knew how to woo.There's no denying the attraction between Jess and Duane. You could feel the heat radiating from them when they were together. I absolutely loved how Jess couldn't deny it even when she was upset bout finding out it was for the ""wrong"" twin. The back and forth between the two was delicious. It was easy to see why each had fallen for the other. I was slightly surprised at Duane's reticence to go in whole hog with Jess. Duane might have ignited everything that happened between them, but for most of their relationship, it felt like Jess was the driving force behind them moving forwards. If it's not already clear, I adore the Winstons. I loved seeing them with each other. The bonds that bind them together are strong yet resilient.This book was as close to perfect as it could be. The only thing I would've liked is for there to be closure for Jess about a secret that was revealed to her. My heart broke for her and I understood her confusion and pain. I have my guesses as to who the other responsible party is, but I would've loved confirmation. As it is, I'm already looking forward to the next Winston brother book.  I can't wait to come back to Green Valley, Tennessee and sit a spell. There's never a dull moment in that town.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15FGOQAGP9DT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIHMD2K#wasThisHelpful","R15FGOQAGP9DT","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I can't tell you how excited I was to read this book. I absolutely loved Boys Like You, and I was super excited to read about Trevor who played an integral part in Nate and Monroe's story. I must say I wasn't disappointed, and certainly very impressed with the story and its message.Trevor and Everly are an unlikely couple thrown together after Trevor awakens from the coma he was in.  Trevor was on top of the world; he was popular, talented, and going places. Everly was the preacher's daughter, a good girl, who knew the difference between right and wrong, and was happy with her life. Of course the Trevor and Everly that meet now are nothing like the people they were before.  Both of them have new realities to face that are causing them significant distress. It's what allows them to really see each other for the first time.I have to say I loved how the stark reality of both Everly and Trevor's situations were presented.  In Trevor's case I loved the details provided regarding what a person with a traumatic brain injury experiences. Knowing that information made relating to what he was going through and feeling so much easier to understand and relate to. In Everly's case I had a feeling I knew what was going on and it was devastating to see her struggle so much with her mother and her father. I really wished the situation with her mother had been handled differently. It really felt like their roles were reversed and it was too much for Everly. My heart broke for the entire family and what they were facing.I loved seeing Nate and Monroe again.  It was good to see them in a better more upbeat light. I must also admit I loved seeing the change in them as much as I enjoyed seeing Trevor's father in a different light. The man I met in Boys Like You was not someone I liked a lot, but one I understood.  The man I saw in Some Kind of Normal was phenomenal. He was supportive and loving.  In fact both of Trevor's parents were wonderful.I really do hope Juliana Stone writes more about not only Everly and Trevor, but maybe about Taylor, Trevor's sister, or Everly's younger brother. Juliana Stone does a great job at bringing her characters to life and making their problems seem like your own. I always feel destroyed by the end of the books but also slightly smarter and more empathetic towards what people might be facing. After all we're always trying to strive to be and project we're normal, when reality might be something different.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GJRXPXROL6HT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402291507#wasThisHelpful","R1GJRXPXROL6HT","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boy did the flame hit the fire in this book, in more ways than one. Thankfully Heat picks up right where Attraction left off. The sucker punch I felt at the end of Attraction quickly eased and things were getting better between the two wonder kinds. Which was great until I realized the growth Kaitlyn and Martin had undergone was once again stymied but this time it might be for good. And I was sucker punched all over again and this time it was so much worse.Let me back track because chances are your mouths are open with shock if you haven't read the book yet, but have started the series.  Here's the thing. Kaitlyn and Martin are both stubborn. I already know that, if you've read either or both books that are out, you know that. It's a given fact. Both of them have their own plans for the future and even differing ideas on how their ""relationship"" will play out. Seeing the two butt heads was interesting at first because it usually resulted in Kaitlyn playing her synonym game, but then things come to a head and all of a sudden they're facing major problems. Some of it is from internal conflict and the rest of it is from the outside world.I never realized how different Kaitlyn and Martin were in the way they thought until I read Heat. Of course both of them have had vastly different childhoods and experiences. It shaped them both in ways that were difficult for them to overcome. They clash regarding what they want and what makes them happy and it's not pretty. There were other people around them who also influenced their actions and I didn't like them very much. This part of Kaitlyn and Martin's story really showed the impact their parents had on them. I'm trying to be nice but I really didn't like their parents much.  Especially the chinless and spineless wonder that was Martin's biological father.  That man is loathsome.Of course I'm making it sound like this book was all strife and being stubborn, but it wasn't. Both Martin and Kaitlyn really invested themselves into what was happening between them. I loved seeing them laugh and realize they could be their true selves with one another. They were able to overcome many of the initial hurdles keeping them from being with each other. The chemistry between them was still as strong as it was in Attraction and I think it go even hotter in Heat. I love how the anticipation between them just continued to grow and grow and I was almost panting by the time they decided to do anything about it. There may have been a need to change underwear during this part. Hey, Martin might be a jerk face, but he can woo and he certainly delivers the goods.One thing I absolutely loved about this book was the realism in it. Penny really did a great job at capturing the intimacy, awkwardness, and discomfort someone having sex for the first can feel; it wasn't all fireworks and wonderful. Kudos to her for keeping her books real, smart, and authentic. This is why Penny's book are like chips.  They're addictive and you can't stop with just one. I'm not sure whether to thank Penny or shake her for taking Kaitlyn and Martin's story and braking it up into parts. I love reading about them every few weeks, but the story is so amazing, I want to read it all at once and all right now. Capture can't come soon enough. With the way things ended between Kaitlyn and Martin in this book, it's going to be next to impossible to wait patiently to see if they can overcome this hurdle.  They're both so stubborn, maybe too stubborn. I can't wait to see how they overcome the new challenges that have been thrown their way. I have a feeling the resolution will be spectacular.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQZPY3LT3PWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UQH820M#wasThisHelpful","R2NQZPY3LT3PWP","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read a handful of new adult romantic suspense novels and they've all been wonderful. I can now add Blackout to that list.  This book gave me a sense of familiarity and then in the next moment would pull it all away and leave me feeling like I was reading something brand new.I was really intrigued by the characters, Teal especially.  Returning home is the catalyst for the blackouts to start again, especially when she's near the swamp where she was found ten years ago.  I could completely empathize with Teal's feelings about coming back and discovering you weren't ""cured"".  I was surprised by how Darius ""Dare"" Tucker treated her when they first saw each other after so many years. However once the reason why became known, it made sense he'd have so much animosity towards her. It made sense he'd have changed beyond recognition from the gentle boy Teal had known.It's hard to deny the chemistry between Teal and Dare but I wasn't happy with how they showed it or dealt with it. It seemed like every time Teal saw Dare he was with another girl and using her. I didn't like how that didn't turn Teal off, but instead turned her on.  I was also shocked by what happened when they finally did get together. The intercourse they had was rough, almost too rough. Then there was their lack of contraceptive use and the reasoning behind why didn't seem believable or plausible. I did like the use of objects and symbolism in this story.  The use initially seemed to be unrelated to the story, but then it would somehow become extremely relevant to Teal's journey towards the truth.The mystery behind the incident in Teal's past that caused her bodily and mental harm was really interesting.  I liked how slowly Teal was having flashbacks that seemed to be giving her hints into what happened that day.  Soon the mystery became convoluted by the addition of someone stalking Teal and perhaps a murder or two.  There was also drama with Dare, Teal, and the other women he was seeing. It all came together to make a great story, except somewhere in trying to figure out what was going on with Teal and Dare and trying to figure out what was causing Teal to lose consciousness, I got lost. When the big reveal happened, I was completely shocked, because I wasn't able to connect all of the dots even though I had guessed the identity of her stalker correctly.It might seem like I was overly critical of this book.  The story was great.  It grabbed my attention from page one and I was really into the story until the last page.  It's just that certain things pulled my attention away or confused me. This book left me reeling. I was so surprised by some of the twists this book took and the revelations left me feeling shaky. Had I not gotten lost at some point, this book would be perfect. It was a great introduction to Chris Myers's work and I'm now really intrigued about his other books.  I'd love for the other Tucker brothers to get their own stories as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G1E73RFC0XSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WH8AVJ8#wasThisHelpful","R2G1E73RFC0XSI","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking forward to seeing how the trajectory of Jake and Haven's story was going to change after the end of part one. I wasn't disappointed with the story.  Jake and Haven had misconceptions and their own hangups to overcome and it seemed like it wasn't going to be easy for them.I think what I found most interesting about this part was the introduction of new characters.  They were important to Jake and his past and I found it surprising how he handled it.  I think Jake handled the person with more aplomb and respect I'd have given them.  I also liked how Jake and Haven didn't jump right back into what they had before.  You could really tell the feelings they had for one another left them shaken and they were tentative around each other.While this part didn't end on a cliffhanger, I am still eager to see where the next and final part takes us (me, Jake, and Haven). Their story has gotten more interesting while retaining the chemistry they have.  This part went by too quickly.  I'm hoping Jake and Haven can work out what's holding them back from one another for good.  I have a feeling their relationship will be tested once again before all is said and done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21H311A1OLKUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGRB00A#wasThisHelpful","R21H311A1OLKUT","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love it when unlikely couples come together and go the distance. In this case, it was nerdy, geeky Lyla who was best friends with college athlete and stud Beck. The two might not seem like they're meant for each other, but they've just been friends until Lyla decides to change herself.I liked Lyla and Beck.  They were good together, having a firm relationship basis with their strong friendship.  I liked how Beck was there for Lyla when she needed him, and how she knew she could count on him.  I really liked the chemistry they had together, both as friends, and then as a possible romantic couple.  I liked Lyla for for being a good friend to Beck when he needed it and even when he did't want it. I felt like she fought the most for him to see how good they could be.Here's what bothered me about the story.  Makeovers are fine, but it didn't take Beck to truly desire Lyla until he saw her in skimpy clothing, makeup, contacts, etc. He already liked her as a person, but he didn't desire her until then. I also didn't like how Lyla used someone being rude, insensitive, and mean as the impetus to change herself.  I did like how she took charge and didn't hesitate to make changes when she decided on a plan of action.I read this book quickly and it was enjoyable for the most part.  The story flowed smoothly and there were no huge surprises.  I did enjoy seeing Beck and Lyla deepen their friendship while trying to figure out a new equilibrium as lovers.  It's hard to believe this is Cindi Madsen's first new adult novel.  It was funny, sexy, and sweet, but not too explicit, so I think readers who are familiar with her stories won't be too scandalized by the content. I think she did a great job and look forward to seeing more new adult novels from her in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RP0ZO3Z1EYC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFT476O#wasThisHelpful","R2RP0ZO3Z1EYC9","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been waiting to read this book from the very the second I finished reading Bad Romeo in October.  That's over six, very long months to find out what happens between Cassie and Ethan, but I'm happy to say the wait was well worth it. I fell into the story from the very first page and felt happy and satisfied after reading the last.Broken Juliet answered all of my questions and filled in all the details I was missing about Ethan and Cassie's relationship, starting from the first day they met. I found myself often astonished by what happened between the two of them. Both Ethan and Cassie are complex characters.  They're heavily influenced by their pasts and it shows in their actions and responses.  Insecurities also play a huge role in the destruction of their relationships with each other and a very large hindrance to any sort of reunion they might have.One of the most surprising thoughts I had while reading this book was, ""Ethan and Cassie have come full circle."" In the past Ethan held all the control in the relationship and Cassie was helpless against his whims.  Now in the present, Cassie held the reigns and Ethan was the one trying to convince her to let him in. She sure didn't make it easy for him and I completely understood her reticence to let him in.  A person is once burned, twice shy, but Ethan had decimated Cassie more than once and in this case a third chance was too risky for her to take easily.This duology was the perfect showcase for the power of heartbreak and love. Ethan and Cassie made so many mistakes and they kept hurting each other, sometimes purposefully and other times inadvertently, but the bond they had was undeniable and unbreakable even with the distance between them physically and emotionally. I was spellbound as bits and pieces of the past were revealed and then made relevant to their present. The growth of these two from the first page of Bad Romeo until the end of Broken Juliet is significant and visibly noticeable.The saga of Ethan and Cassie is a masterpiece that will enchant, captivate, and entrance you. It's impossible to put down and even harder to forget. Leisa Rayven has done a phenomenal job at delivering a story with characters I don't think I could ever tire of reading about. I can't rave enough about how amazing this book is. I hope to see glimpses of Ethan and Cassie in the future and I will eagerly be awaiting Leisa's next release.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJKR8S3IIR7E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O79HOGI#wasThisHelpful","RJKR8S3IIR7E7","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I talk about anything else, can we all please take a moment to reflect on the amazing cover? I'm not someone who usually pays much attention to them, because I'm always eager to get into what's between the covers, but that doesn't mean I can't take a moment or ten to appreciate one. Now that that's done, I can tell you all about how much this book amazed me and entertained me.I haven't read many books by Elle Kennedy, but I'm beginning to realize how talented a story teller she is. She somehow manages to take a guy who messes up with a great girl and turns it into a journey of self discovery and growth for the both of them. I was hoping for something funny and hot, but instead found a story that is mentally, physically, and emotionally engaging while also being impossible to put down.I loved that the story was told from dual points of view.  It was great being inside John ""Logan"" Logan's head and in Grace Iver's too. There were no guessing games about what they were thinking about or about how the felt about each other.  However the real fun for them began when they tried to figure out the mess their ""relationship"" had become. I was totally surprised by how easy things felt between Logan and Grace, especially with them being on opposite sides of the social hierarchy at Briar University and polar opposites when it came to personalities, but it turns out none of that mattered at all.It's hard to pin point what it was about this book I enjoyed the most.  It's a three way tie between the chemistry, dialogue, and issues Logan and Grace faced.  Logan and Grace had wonderful chemistry. While things may not have started out slowly between them, I really enjoyed seeing the relationship between them develop.  I felt like it was a slow burn, because they both had to work to overcome choices the other had made. I also love how much I laughed while I read this book.  Both Grace and Logan were extremely witty in their repartee with one another and in their own inner monologues and thoughts.  I thought it was adorable seeing Grace babble, but that's because I have that particular habit as well.College is a time to try new things, but as Grace finds, somethings don't change.  I empathized with her for the situation she found herself dealing with concerning a trusted friend.  I also understood her pain when Logan made the mistake that changed both of them.  I also understood Logan's pain, confusion, and torn feelings about Hannah and Grace. I even understood his desire and fear when he looked to his future and didn't like what he saw. I will say this though, even though Grace and Logan were each facing so many challenges and changes, I loved how resolute they were in facing them. When Grace needed support, Logan was there and vice versa.This series has quickly become one of my favorites.  I loved seeing Garrett and Hannah again.  I loved being surprised by Logan and Grace's interactions with one another. Seeing all four of the roommates interact and support one another, was also satisfying to read about.  They look at for one another as much as they tease each other. I loved watching Logan realize the error he made and then do everything he could to rectify it. That boy certainly knows how to woo. I look forward to seeing how Elle Kennedy tops herself with Dean and Tucker's stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSI0VFC7GK8K3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WASWK7Q#wasThisHelpful","RSI0VFC7GK8K3","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked the premise for this story. Past regrets and a desire for revenge changing to a new understanding and perhaps love? Sign me up! I was told this book was going to be funny and it was.  I really enjoyed seeing Gray and Sydney duke it out!Overall, I had high expectations for this book, and for the most part the book met them. I liked how strong Sydney was.  I liked how she could dish out pranks and orders.  I liked how she looked after her brother and friends.  I even liked how she was true to herself and secure in the knowledge of what she wanted.  Gray was likable for the most part.  I didn't really understand what motivated his need to get Sydney back for perceived transgressions.  I also didn't like how he was willing to transfer it to Jack, his team mate and Sydney's brother. Otherwise, I liked seeing Sydney and Gray verbally spar and try to one up each other.I even enjoyed seeing them work together, support one another, and realize what had kept them apart was all a mistake. While the story was great and I enjoyed reading it, I felt sort of a disconnect between me and the story.  Please bear with me while I try to explain. There parts of this book that were hilarious and others that were supposed to be funny, but that I didn't feel like quite make it to the mark. I also feel like there were lots of story arcs that either weren't completed or done enough justice, like the one with Nick, the guy Sydney had a crush on. The reason I'm having a hard time explaining the disconnect is because I read this book quite quickly, all in one sitting.I wouldn't mind reading about Gray and Sydney again. Or any of the other guys on the football team.  I'm glad I read this book. K.F.

"You'd think I'd be used to the fact I devour Sarina Bowen's books.  It doesn't matter if she's writing heterosexual romances or m/m romances, I'm guaranteed an amazing story and always want more when the book ends.  I loved getting to know Bella better and if Rafe was a real person, I would totally try to steal him away.I don't know who I loved more, Rafe or Bella.  Lets just call it a tie.  I loved Bella for her boldness and her willingness to take risks.  I loved her for being unapologetic about who she was.  I hated the fact others put her down for it. I loved Rafe for knowing what he wanted and sticking to it.  I loved him for the care and consideration he had for his family and friends.  I loved him for being upstanding and honorable, not just for Bella, but for everyone around him too. I also loved the fact Rafe was the virgin and why he had remained one for so long.  I also loved how he was patient with Bella in all matters. They were opposites but yet perfectly matched for each other.One reason I loved this book was because all of the issues Rafe and Bella faced and how they were handled. These are issues that are currently pressing and I have a feeling always will be. I hated what happened to Bella.  It made my blood boil, especially when she was not at fault and was doing the right thing. I completely understood and empathized with her reaction to everything, but it sucked seeing her brought low like that.  I would've preferred her to be the warrior I expected her to be from experience, but then again everyone reacts differently when notoriety is thrust on them the way it was on her. However, I supported her 100% with how she chose to get those who wronged her back.  I loved how all of her friends supported her, including Lianne an unlikely ally, Rikker, Graham, Trevi, Hartley, Corey, and others from the hockey team. It wasn't just in getting revenge, but trying to draw her out of the funk she was in.The best books are ones I enjoy reading and then have the hardest time figuring out how to convey why I loved them so much.  With The Shameless Hour, it's been a struggle to find the words.  In fact it's been that way for the entire The Ivy Years Series. Each book has been better than the last and I always look forward to seeing how Sarina Bowen will surprise me with the next story. I'm really hoping to read more about Bella and Rafe.  I wouldn't mind reading another book about them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X3X1RO3Y6ZJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2BQWSE#wasThisHelpful","R1X3X1RO3Y6ZJV","AH2VZM0CZPJ1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH2VZM0CZPJ1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read books with numerous cliffhangers.  I've always been eager to read the next book and taken some time to process the abrupt ending, but I've never been so stunned I wanted to grab the author and shake her by the shoulders while shouting, ""What have you done?!"" over and over again. Well Third Debt changed all of that. I can say this book has given me a serious book hangover.  How can I go on after experiencing such trauma at the hands of a story?The story picks up where the last book left off and it was such a huge twist I hadn't seen coming.  I was worried about what a separation would do to both of them and it seems my worries were for good reason. I felt both Jethro and Nila's pains at being separated. I also understood how adrift Nila felt at being thrust back into her old life after so long and having the blinders taken off. The reality she was facing was much different from the one she'd left when she was taken in Milan.Just when I thought I might have Jethro figured out, he turned the tables on everyone.  I couldn't understand what his condition was that caused Cut to hate him.  His behavior was also completely sketchy.  You never knew if you were going to get the strong arrogant guy, or the sympathetic and understanding lover. It wasn't just Jethro who was a mystery, Kestrel, and Jasmine, two of his siblings were just as mysterious too.  It wasn't just their knowledge of Jethro that made them interesting, but also what they wanted from Jethro and what had happened to them in the past, that I was eager to know.Once again Pepper Winters has written a very masterful story.

"Overall, a pretty good affordable large Android tablet with mediocre battery life.General performance is smooth. There arent any weird stutters or glitches. It just works. Pretty much stock Android Lollipop (5.0 not 5.1) with very little bloat.  The only pre-loaded stuff is 2 apps for controlling gesture-based functions like double-tapping the screen to wake it up or pinching with 3 fingers to take a screenshot, a note-taking app, and a little quick calculator/calendar/notes app that you can overlay over whatever else youre doing. Everything else is totally stock Lollipop!One quirk with Lollipop is that its default setting is to turn wifi off when the device is sleeping. This is supposed to save power, but on a wifi-only tablet, this disconnects you from the only way the thing can access the internet, so you don't get any notifications! You can fix this by going into the wifi settings, then hit the menu button and go to Advanced.  On the advanced wifi settings, there is an option for Keep Wifi On During Sleep. The default setting is 'never.' I changed this to 'always' and the tablet stayed connected to wifi just fine, and gave me notifications as I prefer.Build quality is nice but not exactly premium. Its not the absolute thinnest or lightest tablet out there, nor are its bezels particularly tiny. The back is plastic, but its nice, non-glossy plastic with a textured finish to it. It feels nice to hold, and also feels sturdy.Screen is good enough to be useful in most situations. 1920x1200 resolution makes for reasonably sharp text and viewing angles are pretty decent. The one downside is the brightness. I tend to like my displays pretty bright. For me, the lowest I put the brightness on this tablet is 75%, and I often crank it up all the way. At these settings I don't feel like it's too dim, but I'd prefer to not have to max out the brightness in order to get better battery performance.Cameras are halfway decent but unimpressive. The main camera is 5 MP and in low light it gets noisy pretty quickly. It's good enough for ""oh look at the cat doing that funny thing!"" type pictures but I wouldn't use it as my main camera. You look like a dork taking pictures with a tablet anyway.Sound quality is above average thanks to the 2 front-facing speakers on either side of the screen. Sound is clear but not much bass, and you can definitely make out stereo effects watching movies.The battery is only 5930 mAh which is pretty small for a 10"" tablet.  This is really the biggest downside. Battery life is by no means awful and overall the tablet seems generally power-efficient, but with the brightness cranked way up you're definitely going to notice the battery draining faster than you like. If you want amazing battery life this is not the tablet for you but I think overall the pros outweigh the cons.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VYF5C70VLGA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWM3SCU#wasThisHelpful","R1VYF5C70VLGA5","AJ0B1WKMHMMF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ0B1WKMHMMF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Judged only on the merits of salad spinners, this is more like a 4-star product. There are other salad spinners that have larger capacity, and are easier to get cranked up and spinning. This is a bit small and basic.BUT...those salad spinners take up a lot of space. I have a small kitchen and not a ton of storage space. I also have all kinds of kitchen stuff taking up space. So the ability of this salad spinner to collapse down is really what gets it the 5-star rating. Collapsing it definitely helps with storage, and also makes it much easier to throw in the dishwasher.So if you don't want a huge salad spinner taking up a bunch of space, this is a great choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M11TNP6HLZBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050EF6RS#wasThisHelpful","R1M11TNP6HLZBX","AJ0B1WKMHMMF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ0B1WKMHMMF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have wide, flat feet and I pronate. I buy a lot of sneakers for how they look even though they don't come in widths and aren't necessarily the best for my feet. But for working out I like to have a pair that are actually good for my feet.For my workout shoes, I've been a Brooks Beast guy for many years. The most comfortable shoes I've ever had were the Brooks Beast 8 from several years ago. I've had a couple of the newer versions as well. When it came to buy another pair, I tried the current Beast 14 but they were far too stiff and lacked cushioning.  So I looked for other options.Compared to my old favorite Beast 8, the Stabil CS3 isn't quite as sublimely pillowy, but it is still quite cushioned, provides great support for my feet, has enough flexibility at least for a shoe in the motion control category, and is noticeably lighter than any of the Brooks Beast versions I've had in the past. When I first tried them on I was concerned they weren't going to have enough cushioning, but after a couple runs they softened up considerably while still maintaining their support.Depending on the shoe, I will buy an 11 2E or 4E.  The Stabil CS3 is only available in 2E but I tried them and they are wide enough for me. So for you extra-wide wearers, don't be too scared off by the lack of 4E, these are worth a shot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ID38CYXJCWM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPU6482#wasThisHelpful","R3ID38CYXJCWM6","AJ0B1WKMHMMF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ0B1WKMHMMF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was all excited about the Tab 2 A10-70. Decent enough performance for the price, nice screen, mostly free of bloatware once you ditch the terrible stock launcher for something better like Nova.  But there's an annoying issue that I just can't live with: it maxes out at 720p video! I've tried Netflix, Amazon Instant, and YouTube and they all look like crap.  What's the point of a full-HD screen if the device can't actually play 1080p video?To give you an idea of how annoying this is, I pulled up the same movie in Netflix on both the Tab 2 A10-70 and on my PS3 hooked up to my 50"" tv. The picture on the 50"" tv, which is blowing the image up way larger than a 10"" tablet, looked consistently sharper.  It's impossible for me to ignore this when most of the time I watch video on a tablet lying in bed with the thing close to my face. The pixelated video is quite literally staring me in the face.Supposedly this thing is going to be updated to Lollipop soon (Lenovo's original specs say ""expected June 2015,"" so much for that since it's July 6 today) and maybe there's an off chance that it will start playing 1080p video with the update.  That's the only reason I haven't returned it yet.  If the Lollipop update doesn't fix the video quality, or it doesn't get updated by the time my return window closes, it's going back.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EYP8VC17S66Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TR05L9Y#wasThisHelpful","R2EYP8VC17S66Q","AJ0B1WKMHMMF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ0B1WKMHMMF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fit my '05 Grand Cherokee perfectly and do a great job of catching all the crap that gets stuck to my shoes or boots in Wisconsin winter. The tire tread pattern on them is helpful for scraping snow off my boots when I get in the Jeep.  Only real downside is the little grommet for the hook on the floor of the Jeep to go through on the driver's floor liner is so tight on the hook (to prevent leaks) that in the winter, it's tough to get the liner off the hook when the plastic material of the liner is cold and thus less flexible.

"I tried a couple cheaper FM transmitters before settling on the GOgroove X2 Mini. Both of the others were unable to broadcast a static-free signal to the radio in my '05 Jeep Grand Cherokee, on ANY frequency. The audio signal they did send was a lot quieter than regular radio stations.  So I decided to try a GOgroove, and for the most part I'm happy.The good news is, the signal from the X2 Mini is nice and clear.  I live in Madison, WI and was able to very easily find a clear station. It took a little more work on a recent trip to Chicago, but eventually I was able to find one there too. If you live in Chicago and are having trouble finding a good station, try 98.3, it worked well for me.Cons (none of these are a big deal, but worth mentioning):The stalk that goes into the power outlet is too long.  I've attached a picture of how far it sticks out from my dash.  I'm not sure if it's this long for a reason, but it would make more sense to not be so big. I didn't want the goose-neck regular X2 since that'd stick out even more.  But the stalk should be an inch or two smaller.The auto-tune feature lands on even-numbered stations like 102.2 but US radios mostly can only tune to odd-numbered stations like 102.3.  But it's pretty easy to find a station manually. Using the knob to tune it is a lot nicer than others where you just have buttons.There's no power switch. I have 2 power outlets in my dash, one switched with the ignition and one that stays on all the time. It's in the switched outlet, so when I turn off the car, the GOgroove turns off but the radio stays on, and I get static. I'm training myself to turn the radio off when I turn off the car.Overall though, these cons are pretty minor, and given how poorly some of the other FM transmitters I tried performed, I'm just happy the GOgroove puts out a clean signal with relatively little fuss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJC0VDOB4NMIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FV8P24#wasThisHelpful","RJC0VDOB4NMIM","AJ0B1WKMHMMF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ0B1WKMHMMF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't had the sealing issues that other reviewers have mentioned.  Not sure if the manufacturer has improved the seal over time since those reviews are from several years ago.  My one annoyance with this tire gauge is it has what looks like a power button, but that's just for the little flashlight on the end of the tip. To actually turn the gauge on, you hit the 'SET' button. I went to use the gauge after like 6+ months of not messing with it, forgot this quirk, and thought the battery was dead. I bought new batteries for it, pressed the not-power button, and when the gauge still didn't turn on I realized, oh yeah, what about the 'SET' button? So...the slightly counter-intuitive buttons led me to purchase new batteries probably sooner than I really needed to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BQJKEI114R3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B6JJUK#wasThisHelpful","R2BQJKEI114R3N","AJ0B1WKMHMMF7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ0B1WKMHMMF7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a few fancy watches, but I recently left a desk job to cook in a restaurant and didn't want to mess them up in a kitchen. I wanted a cheap water resistant watch with a day & date display, and countdown timer. This one does the trick and looks pretty cool too. I really like how when you go to set it, it has a little icons that show you which button will adjust what setting. So you don't have to remember secondary functions for the buttons while setting a timer or alarm, because the watch tells you what the buttons do.The only thing I'd change is that in countdown timer mode I wish there was a way to quickly put the timer setting back to zero. You can reset the timer to the last setting you entered, but if you want to enter a new setting you have to adjust the timer setting using the +/- buttons.

"I upgraded to the Expert Mouse from a Kensington Orbit w/ Scroll Ring.  Hardware-wise, this thing is really nice.  It's kinda huge, especially with the included wrist rest attached.  Ball is nice & big with good inertia.  Right out of the box it was a little rough but after a couple hours of use is already starting to smooth out so I'm sure will be fine. The scroll ring isn't quite as good as the Orbit.  It's made out of a soft-touch rubber material, but is covered in a ton of tiny ridges so ends up feeling a bit rough to the touch.  The Orbit's scroll ring uses the same rubberized material but has much fewer raised ridges that are spaced farther apart--it actually feels soft unlike the Expert Mouse.  But other than that I really like the Expert Mouse hardware.The Kensington TrackballWorks software DID NOT WORK on my office PC, running Windows 7 Professional x64 SP1.  I installed ""TrackballWorks 1.1 for Windows (32-bit,64-bit) (Windows 7)"" from Kensington's site. I attempted to change button settings with it but the settings, while showing in the program, had no effect.  I uninstalled TrackballWorks and instead am using X-Mouse Button Control (just google it) that does work for setting button functions.  This combined with the built-in Windows mouse control panel for pointer & scrolling speed works well enough.If Kensington got their software working better then this would be a 5-star review.

"I've had this trackball for a couple years.  Overall it's pretty good.  I use it with the included wrist rest that clips on to the edge.  It's reasonably precise, but the ball also has enough weight where you can fling the cursor around the screen when needed.  I also like the scroll ring.  I can use it while still keeping 2-3 fingers on the ball, and I now am pretty good at using both the ball and scroll ring at the same time.  I strongly prefer this setup over a traditional scroll whell stuck on a trackball.I wish the ball were a little larger & heavier as this would aid both in precision and flinging the cursor.  I'd also like a third button or the ability to click the scroll ring.  With only two buttons, I have to Ctrl-click to open a link in a new browser tab and I'd prefer the ability to do this one-handed.  Cordless would be nice to help clean up desk clutter but a corded trackball is way less annoying than a corded mouse, because unlike a mouse the trackball stays in its place on the desk.I recently bought a Logitech Wireless Trackpad, but within a couple hours got sick of it and went back to my Orbit.

Didn't need particularly huge bass and decided to give the T3100 a try because their satellites have both a midrange AND a tweeter.  Most computer speakers, even plenty of expensive ones, just have supposedly full-range drivers on their satellites which go neither low enough to blend with the sub nor high enough to give crisp cymbals etc.  I hooked up the speakers and was pleasantly surprised, they really do have a pretty decent range of sound.  It took a bit of moving the sub around underneath the desk to make the bass sound like it's part of the rest of the sound (tip: center it between the satellites) but am more than thrilled with the sound quality for the price.

The chocolate in the bags comes out a bit salty after mixing with the pretzels, but in this case, that's ok.I can recommend this treat since I love Hershey's and their chocolate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OGDBQAXLKIIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QQ4UBY#wasThisHelpful","R3OGDBQAXLKIIZ","ABQEKKRD6WZFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQEKKRD6WZFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, this is a good product - not without flaws. Set up is fairly intuitive and part of the app, although I am of an age I still prefer having an instruction booklet. The laser sometimes requires calibration, again in the app. The image  depends on Internet connection quality on both ends, your mobile device and the Petcube, and not just on speed but most importantly on signal quality. Bottom line - it's not going to be perfect all of the time, it will freeze up and cause frustration as with many tech devices.Note - this is not a night time camera - if you want to view your pets on at night, leave a light on. You can take images of your pet and post them on the petcube wall, allow selected friends to also view your pets (they down load the app after you've given them permission to view).The smaller your dwelling is, the more likely you'll see your pets. I set this up in the family room.

"The overall system & idea are great - 5 stars. I gave 4 due to the technology skills required to set it all up. If you're familiar with Wifi, routers, ethernet, usb then this is no problem at all. I'm in my 50's so I get this (barely), but I those less exposed to technology are going to carefully follow the step by step instructions (which are very good, just a lot to absorb). It's not a plug this in and let it rip.Start off with a controller (AA Batteries not included). Connect to power source, then tv, then internet (Wifi or ethernet - I suggest ethernet, less likely to have problems). There is a camera that can be installed above TV or on a flat surface. Once this is done, the kids can play.This is similar to Wii - games that get you up & moving. It's educational for the kids. The games, puzzles, shapes adjust to the child's learning curve and help with cognitive skill building.Heads up - if you buy only the gaming system, there is one game pre loaded. If you want to maximize the gaming potential, you'll want to also get the Disney Froze:Arendelle Video game. This set up comes with one controller, if you want multiplayer, then you'll need an additional controller.Summary - good gift for grandma/grandpa to get the kids - the price is compatible with other games for older kids.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HKXK718371ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1PPGM#wasThisHelpful","R3HKXK718371ED","ABQEKKRD6WZFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQEKKRD6WZFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very good ear buds. They produce crisp, clear sound - even at max volume in my Ipod. Not a lot of bass sound, even when I tried adjusting the equalizer to bass boost.The ear buds have magnets on the back so they can stick together - not sure how needed that is. They are advertised as tangle resistant. I tested this out by mashing the cord together as if it were at bottom of back pack or tossed around. They were slightly easier to untangle than standard cords.These were in grey color, which does not make them look as sharp as others, but again, if you're buying just for the sound, these are excellent for treble and mid range, ok for bass which is why I gave 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSSBR0XZ0ENR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LY86XG#wasThisHelpful","RSSBR0XZ0ENR5","ABQEKKRD6WZFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQEKKRD6WZFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The spatula and Cuisinart manual do fit as well, but there are no specific spots for them - this would be a good enhancement should they ever decide to do that. Nice to have a designated area for these very sharp blades. Lessens chances of spouse or kids cutting themselves.

"This Cuisinart is very quiet - I could not hear my wife using it and I was only 10' away, like that a lot! Our old machine was very loud. This has 2 bowl sizes, which is nice if you only want to chop an onion or something small, and if you want to set aside the small ingredient while using the large bowl for the rest of the recipe. Shredding disk was quick and efficient.The instructions say you can put everything but the base in the dishwasher on the top shelf, but it was easy enough to wash by hand. With the sharp blades, I prefer doing it by hand.I wish it came with a safe and easy way to store the blades and disks. I will be looking online to find a storage case, but I could not find anything in the instruction booklet that suggested a way to store the accessories, other than the warning that you should not store them in the unit. cord storage is not great. it is under the heavy base, and you have to manually wind it around the bottom, so not convenient to use. would be better if the cord was retractable, as the base is heavy and holding it up to wind the cord is cumbersome.Bottom line  excellent & recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TPMZT0VBZ9BH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WA4UI42#wasThisHelpful","R1TPMZT0VBZ9BH","ABQEKKRD6WZFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQEKKRD6WZFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a wireless mouse before, so I knew how to install this. It's intuitive, but they should still have directions for old people like me who sometimes  struggle with new things. I'll share my experiences in case you need them.Insert the  'wireless receiver' (that's the small USB thingy that goes into your laptop). Turn on the mouse, button is on the underside on/off. You'll want to remember to turn it off when done, one downside to wireless mouse. You can link up to 3 devices with this. I only have one, so ok. The white light on the bottom of the mouse blinks for a few seconds and then the connection is made & you're ready to go.What I like - the battery is internal and rechargeable. A USB cord is attached to do this and that is a nice feature. The other wireless I had used a standard battery. This mouse is everything they said it is in terms of use. It's accurate, fast & versatile. If you press down on the scroll button, you can change the setting from click to no click. Being older, I like the traditional click feel of a scroll wheel. There is a small square button behind the scroll wheel that allows you to move mouse in any direction. In other mice (mouses?) you press on the scroll wheel for that option.Due to the very small initial frustration of setting this up, lack of documentation and no place to put the receiver (which is called a 'dongle'), I decided to rate this a 4 because it is far better than my old wireless, the battery is rechargeable but there should be a place on the mouse to store the dongle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14WIM45GUC5N4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y09IWGQ#wasThisHelpful","R14WIM45GUC5N4","ABQEKKRD6WZFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQEKKRD6WZFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can't stand up in this tent, the measurement from bottom of tent to the top is 3' 6"". Enough to sit up, but that's it. FYI, the bottom of the tent tapers down so it's not a perfect square.

"The back pack I've been using was given to me over 20 years ago, so when I picked up this Kelly Capture bag, the first impression was how light it is. This is an excellent choice for day tripping, bike riding, camping if you're not carrying huge loads. Lots of thought went into the design to provide the user with many easily accessible exterior pockets and loops for snack bars, water, swiss army knife, etc.One of the main advertising features of this backpack is the front phone/camera holder to film your activities. Since this cannot hold the larger, current generation smart phones without adaptation, I knocked once star off. My wife's phone fit - barely - and with doubt as to how safe that would be. Personally, I'm not going to use this feature much, so what I have is a really great, lightweight, durable backpack.

"I've been a fan of Steven Zaloga since I first started collecting books back in 1983. I have come to respect his writing and opinion. Armored Champion may be his best yet. It is a superb book for beginners since it addresses so many of the considerations needed when discussing tank vs tank combat. Firepower, protection, mobility, reliability, cost. This is not new, but how this information is presented is top notch as are the printing, paper and illustrations.Zaloga breaks it down by nation and by time period. He further breaks down analysis by what a tank crew would choose (expensive tank, world beaters) vs what a battlefield commander might choose vs what a nation would choose. Sometimes, those decisions are different and Zaloga outlines why. He supports his decisions with excellent tables, charts, clear B&W photographs and narrative. His choices are sometimes controversial, something he welcomes to promote discussion and differing views. The bibliography and appendix are detailed, helpful and come from many sources, foreign and domestic.For the more experienced reader, there are still many insights, details and facts to be gathered, the summaries of each nations tank development alone make this a worthwhile purchase. This is not a color photo walk around, it is a highly informative treatise on tank developmentThe reader's digest view of this book  buy it, it's an excellent collection to the library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GIPT8C8URKPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811714373#wasThisHelpful","R1GIPT8C8URKPD","ABQEKKRD6WZFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQEKKRD6WZFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As with all products, the key decision for me is value for your dollar. If you demand better performance, these Pulstar Spark plugs will help improve your vehicles performance as advertised, will you notice a difference of 7%? The average person probably not, but those who are motorheads, those who love to race and need every added increment of improved performance, yes.New spark plugs will outperform older ones, regardless of cost, another factor to consider for the average driver is the cost per plug vs. the improvement in fuel economy. If you have to replace four, six or eight plugs, how long will it take to break even on fuel costs.I'd recommend these spark plugs to those who love racing, quick acceleration and are willing to pay that extra bit for them. For the average driver in average conditions who use their car for commuting, I'd look for good reliable plugs and keep the difference in cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CDQN6UKCIQZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KD5Z1QK#wasThisHelpful","R1CDQN6UKCIQZM","ABQEKKRD6WZFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQEKKRD6WZFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this for my wife. She likes that she does not have to change styling tools when she wants to add body after straightening her hair. This does not straighten hair alone, but worth trade off for 1 item to do 2 tasks. It straightens hair and can do large curl, but not good at making tight curls. Good at adding body with the large brush. 4 out of 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IAEY8LPEGI9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOJ9008#wasThisHelpful","R3IAEY8LPEGI9Y","ABQEKKRD6WZFA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQEKKRD6WZFA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I actually didnt expect to like this. Pretzels are about as tasty as sticks to me. But this was surprisingly yummy. The sweet chocolate drizzle is my favorite part. Despite the chocolate, its not too sweet. The popcorn balances it out.The brittle is made of popcorn, pretzels, toffee, and Hersheys Milk Chocolate. It comes in a cute brown tin that you can keep and reuse.4.5 - 5 STARS: I dont usually mention price because whats affordable to some might be expensive to others. However, at its current price, I think this brittle is too expensive. I could probably buy all the ingredients to this brittle (and add nuts), and still come out cheaper. But I cant deny its delicious. If I were given this as a gift, Id enjoy it.INGREDIENTS: popcorn brittle [sugar; dairy butter (milk); popcorn (popcorn, soybean oil); corn syrup; water; sodium bicarbonate; salt; natural vanilla flavor]; milk chocolate [sugar; milk; cocoa butter; chocolate; lactose; milk fat; soy lecithin; vanillin, artificial flavor; PGPR, emulsifier]; pretzels [enriched wheat flour (flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, and folic acid); water; salt; malt; dextrose; canola oil; yeast; sodium bicarbonate].","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKSBYN6NM4JGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013DT06FI#wasThisHelpful","RKSBYN6NM4JGZ","A34W7QA4J5UTOR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34W7QA4J5UTOR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS: The design is attractive. I like that it has an off and on button. The temperature can be adjusted on the side. Its easy to hold. The heat seems sufficient. It ranges from 266 to 410. It has a toggle so that you can lock it closed. It closes nice and flat. (I had a previous flat iron that left a gap wide enough that you could see a beam of light through it. Of course, it was useless.)CONS: When are they going to stop using the hard plastic case with no opening to package products? I was seriously afraid of the plastic slashing my wrists as I fought my way into this thing.I wish the cord was a little longer.When I used it on my daughters very curly, very thick hair, it straightened enough to go from being at her shoulder blades to stopping at the base of her spine. Her hair was mostly straight with the occasional recalcitrant spiral curl. But, it was hard work. If I didnt go over each section of hair very slowly, there was little discernable effect at all. I admit that I didnt use the highest temperature setting because Ive never used any sort of heat on her hair and I was being cautious. I dont know. Maybe it would have worked better if Id washed, blow dried, and then flat ironed her hair.

"PLOT: After an uncharacteristic one night stand, Laura finds herself pregnant with Daniels baby.PROS: I thought Laura and Daniel were likable characters. I like that he didnt turn out to be a player.CONS: The biggest issue with this story is that far too much of it is told as a summary. The majority of the final chapter summarizes about two years of their life. That would be fine it the final chapter was an epilogue. Its not. Because most of the story is told in a summary form with little action or conversation, it makes the reader feel removed from the action. I felt like I was reading a history book. And guess what? It was just as boring.I dont consider this much of a romance. Other than their initial meeting and when she tells him about the baby, theres not much interaction between the two of them. The rest of their interactions are summarized. We dont even get his point-of-view until the story is about 70 percent over.I detested the authors habit of calling Daniel the fireman or the captain. To a lesser extent, she called Laura the young woman. Each time she did it, it just took me out of the story and made her characters seem flat. No one thinks of themselves in those simple terms.OF NOTE: Daniel buys her a stuffed toy and Laura puts it in the crib with the baby. Its a small detail so I wont list it as a con. But I did want to mention that as a new mother, youre probably told a thousand times by your pediatrician and other literature to never put items in the crib with the baby (even at their feet) because of the risk of SIDS.2.5 - 3 STARS: I had to force myself to read each sentence and not skim the lengthy boring bits of summary.

"PLOT: Farah and Dougan meet in an orphanage and fall in love. Theyre children when they marry. Dougan kills a man trying to protect her and is sent to prison where he is killed. Seventeen years later, Dorian Blackwell, a former inmate with Dougan, finds Farah and proposes marriage in order to protect her.PROS: I really liked Dorian and Farah and found myself missing them when I was finished with the book. I had my reservations about reading this as I was worried it would be too dark and depressing for me. Thats not the case at all. Fortunately, the author chose not to detail grizzly prison assaults in either flashbacks or conversation. Parts of the story were even funny. The pace of the plot was fast. I cant recall a dull moment. It was a very enjoyable read.CONS: Though I understand why there werent more segments written from Dorians point-of-view, I still found myself wanting to know more about what he was feeling and thinking at certain times.5 STARS: When I really like a book, I generally cant think of much to say about it and I certainly dont want to ruin it for other readers.

"PROS: You definitely feel like youre getting a gift. After opening the Amazon box, there was another box inside. Once I opened that, I was at the Cailler box. That was covered with a ribbon with a helpful description of the chocolates attached. Once I removed that and pulled out the box, it was wrapped in red paper. Beneath that was plastic wrap. Only then was I finally able to remove the paper on top of the tray and have access to chocolate.CONS: The chocolate was okay. I thought most of the flavors were sort of bland. It wasnt as sweet as Im used to. This may be a bonus to some, but I have a sugar addition. I did like the slight taste of salt in the caramel one. I disliked the dark coffee as it was bitter and just tasted like burnt coffee to me.

"PROS: It comes in an attractive palette with eight options ranging from nude to wine.CONS: This isnt what I think of when I think of lip gloss. The colors are more opaque than I was expecting. It also doesnt have the shine that I associate with gloss. Because of the opacity, the colors will not be flattering to all skin tones. Im just not bold enough to go out in a color that looks neon against my skin.Theres no listing of what these colors actually are. I know it starts with nude and ends with wine, but I have no idea what to call the colors in between. I suppose it doesnt matter so much since you can judge the color yourself once you apply it.The brush allows for accurate and less messy application, but it also takes more time to apply than simply using a tube. Plus you have to clean it after each use.When mine arrived, one of the little color trays had popped out and was sitting halfway on top of another shade.3 STARS: I wasnt crazy about the colors or the lack of shine.

"PLOT: Lucilles father is unstable and her mother has left her home alone with her younger sister.PROS: The story is told in first person from the point-of-view of Lucille. The pace is fast.CONS: If Id noticed the word poetic in the Jennifer E. Smith quote when she was referring to this book, I would have avoided it like the plague. This maybe a con for just me, but I hated the authors writing style. There are lots of short, choppy sentences. Theyre often one or two words. Used judiciously, this would be great, but its overused here. Though it made the pages fly faster, it quickly becomes annoying.I wouldnt have wanted to read this as a teen. I was a moody, bored kid and I liked the darkest characters, but I would have only read this if I was forced to do so. Id have thought it was boring and depressing. I mean, I can basically sum up the entire plot in two minutes. I find it weird that authors write these books for teens, but the teens never talk like teens. They sit around reading poetry and they know who Betty Page is. I had to look her up.The conclusion feels unresolved for reasons I can't go into without serious spoilers. There's probably a sequel already in the works.OF NOTE: The recommended age for this book is 14 and up. I guess thats okay. Id probably say 16 and up. Theres one incidence of underage drinking, some underage smoking, and a few swear words.3 STARS: Overall, I didnt care for the story. It didnt feel like a love story to me. The romance is a small equation in the book. I never really felt connected with any of the characters. If there ever is a sequel, I don't care enough about them to read it. I gave it three stars because other readers might find it funny and romantic. I did not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35Y72FYMKHZ84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544534298#wasThisHelpful","R35Y72FYMKHZ84","A34W7QA4J5UTOR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34W7QA4J5UTOR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"PROS: It has so many uses. I was surprised to find that you could even use it to file down rough skin on your feet. (I mix lotion and Vaseline after a bath and put on socks. My feet are SMOOTH.) It can be used for wet or dry epilation. It can be used on legs, underarms, and in the bikini area. You can use shower gel as a shaving cream when using it for wet epilation.Its very attractive and comes with a pouch to store it in.CONS: To be honest, I didnt use this and I will explain why. This was not the product for me. I wanted it to remove facial hair. Im not going to hold that against this epilator. I knew that it was a possibility since it did not list the removal of facial hair as one of its uses. That is one of the few areas that this epilator is not intended for.

"The core of these tissues have been flattened so that they take up less space. I compared the six pack to the pack of another brand that we had on hand. Flattening the core cuts the width of the pack down almost the width of an entire roll. Even when they are un-flattened, the core doesnt quite regain its round shape. It kind of looks like a rounded diamond. It still comes off the roll but with a bit more thumping around. But thats barely noticeable and not a deal breaker for me.As for the tissue, its very soft and plush. Thats because its three-ply. That can take some adjustment.

It takes over the book and takes away from the urgency of the mystery.Im not sure why the author bothered making Father Saenz a forensic anthropologist. I kept expecting him to use the computer he mentions to do a facial reconstruction to help identify the boys. Instead, the majority of what the two priest do seemed to be footwork that the police could have done. Its not until very late in the book that he uses any skill that would require either a forensic anthropologist or a dentist.OF NOTE: This story does contain some gruesome details. I guess I should have expected that given the plot. Still, I wasnt expecting mutilation. No matter what, its always difficult to stomach when children are the victims. There are even a couple of short sections told from the point of view of the victims.3 STARS: Overall, its not a bad book. Its not terribly exciting or action filled. The mystery is so-so. The moment the killer is introduced the majority of readers will identify him instantaneously.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R371QIL9HUMOOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616953985#wasThisHelpful","R371QIL9HUMOOZ","A34W7QA4J5UTOR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34W7QA4J5UTOR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"PROS: Maybe its just my husband, but he hates using a paper filter so much that sometimes he will skip coffee and have a cola instead. This coffee maker has a permanent gold tone filter. That does mean having to wash it out after each use instead of just tossing the filter.The instructions are easy to understand. Not that using a coffee maker is rocket science. But it sure made setting the clock and selecting options easier. All the parts are well labeled so I had no trouble figuring out the various parts.The warming plate has three options: low, medium, and high. I chose medium and found it keeps my coffee quite hot. There are two options for strength: regular and strong.CONS: If you drink coffee every day, youll need to replace the water filter every two months. (Its a small packet that comes taped to the coffee scoop. It has to be soaked for about ten minutes before placing it into the coffee maker.) You can visit their website to reorder it. There is also a number in the manual to call and order replacement parts. There is no price mentioned at this time. Though I drink coffee every day, I doubt Ill remember to order these in a timely manner.4 STARS: It makes a tasty cup of coffee.

Applying the product is quickquicker than using an in-shower lotion that has to be washed off. I really appreciate the convenience. The scent is light and not unpleasant.CONS: Though less time consuming that the in-shower lotions or applying regular lotion, patting yourself dry still takes more time than a brisk drying off.

Each time weve taken her to a childrens museum, we always end up having to pull her away from the trains when were ready to leave.

Its so simple yet my daughter is drawn to it again and again. The set is very durable and well made.

"The Bang & Olufsen H8 Wireless noise cancellation headset is comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  I used it both wirelessly with my Galaxy Note 3 and wired with my computer.  Using Bluetooth, the H8 paired with my phone easily.  From the Note, I changed the Bluetooth settings so that it would not call out while I figured out how to adjust the volume and other settlings for music from my phone. (I accidently called a friend twice when I first started playing with the headphones.) In addition to an audio cable, there is a USB cable to charge the battery with.CONS: For high-end audio equipment like this, I would expect an outlet plug and possibly a case, but their absences are not a deal-breaker for this headset  although I did take a star away for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S9TBMH9INJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R45Z2WU#wasThisHelpful","R2S9TBMH9INJ4","A34W7QA4J5UTOR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34W7QA4J5UTOR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The story is incredibly creative. I loved all the little details that enhanced the tale. The connection between Rym and Krysteena was steamy. As always with this author, the hero sounded yummy.CONS: So much is packed into this in this short story, it feels like it should be longer.

"PROS: I like the graphics and the look of the Sims. The scenery is beautiful. The homes are beautiful. I love the new roof styles.Customizing the Sims is fun. A great deal has already been said about creation so I wont add to that. There is a decent variety of clothing. Eventually you will find many of your Sims wearing similar clothes because you can pick out multiple outfits for them. As I like a certain look, it gets repeated often.Load times are quick. Im running it on a Windows 7 system and find the load times acceptable.CONS: It has been one glitch after another. I could care less about the loss of toddlers. They were the most difficult to care for anyway. Im happy they added pools. But what would make me really happy is not to have to go from one issue to the next. First it seemed that the game crashed constantly. Ive never had a Sims game crash this much. Move a Sim into a new home. Crash! Try to save a game. Crash! Try to exit to the neighborhood. Crash! Okay. Then that was fixed to a certain extent. Then I couldnt get it to shut down. That was fixed. Then Sims couldnt get food from the fridge without forgetting everything in their queue. Last week, I created a Sim using a Sim Id created previously in CAS. I changed his name, personality, eye color, hair color and hair style. Who knew that this would cause his alter ego (who was now an elder) to disappear altogether and be replaced by him? My new Sim was at once a new person and the old Sim. He was sort of in the old house with a grayed out picture and his wife was in love with him. And he was in the new home where he did not know anyone and was not married. And now I cant play at all. I click on a house and it acts like its going to load only to put me back at the neighborhood screen.There are minor details that are so annoying. When Sims marry their last name doesnt change. And the person they marry doesnt move into the house. You have to go to the neighborhood screen to move them. (And probably initiating a crash.) Throwing parties is a chore since you have a specific set of goals to achieve to make the party a success. There are a limited number of lots and Maxis filled many of them with expensive homes your Sims wont be able to afford right away. I could go on with the issues2 STARS: I skipped Sims 3 because I thought the Sims were ugly so Ive been looking forward to this game for a REALLY long time. As a fan that started playing with the original game, it pains me to say that this game sucks. I preordered Sims 4 a year in advance but if this latest glitch isnt addressed soon, Im going to uninstall and go back to Sims 2.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P3ZHUY2XHKTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFRN2KY#wasThisHelpful","R1P3ZHUY2XHKTB","A34W7QA4J5UTOR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34W7QA4J5UTOR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I figured these would be big for my daughter since she wears a size 8. A size 7 is snug on her. Growth spurts make having larger clothing a necessity. While they were a bit loose around the waist and too long, the fit was not as unsuitable as I feared. She can still wear them if I adjust the waist and roll up the bottoms or hem them.PROS: It has an adjustable waist. The material feels sturdy and I do believe the claim that they will resist wrinkles. I like the style.CONS: This material seems to be prone to picking up lint. It shows up especially well on the dark blue pants that I received. Its not as bad as some pants Ive seen, but it does mean I will be pulling out the lint roller whenever she plans to wear these.I dont know if its just this specific pair of pants, but the button is hard to fasten. My daughter is only six and still tries to put off going to the bathroom until the last second. (Because, of course, play is her primary concern.)

"My daughter has missed four days of school this year due to colds. I asked her if they were forming a sneeze circle at school and if so, would she please decline to take her place next time. She eats very few vegetables so I was hoping that these would help boost her immune system.PROS: My daughter can be a picky eater, but she likes gummies. I was still worried that she wouldnt like these. Fortunately, she did like them and ate them with no problem.Id also considered the opposite problem, that my daughter would like them so much that she wanted to eat a handful. Thankfully, it has a child-proof cap. (I also placed them in a cabinet out of her reach.)Theres a clear section in the plastic on the side that allows you to see how many gummies remain in the bottle.CONS: Maybe its due to settling, but the side of the bottle indicated that it was half full after two uses. My daughter is six so that wed used a total of four gummies at that point.4 STARS: It comes in three flavors: mixed berry, raspberry, and pineapple. Its too early to tell if these will help with the colds. Hopefully, shes had her share this year. Ill update when Ive had more time to see the effects.04-14-15 When these ran out, I didn't immediately replace them. And my daughter almost immediately caught a cold. I'll say it was coincidence.

"I have a serious sweet tooth so I didnt find these to be overly sweet. (By serious, I mean that my usual morning coffee is chocolate flavored. I sweeten it with about 5 teaspoons of sugar and a vanilla caramel flavored coffee creamer.) They were chewier and less crunchy than I was expecting. The squares are very tiny, smaller than croutons. I thought that they were a nice nutty snack. I ignored the serving suggestion on the packaging and finished them off in two sittings.

In my first test scan after setting it up, it scanned 39 sheets of paper  front and back for a total of 78 pages  in about ninety seconds. Much faster than my old flatbed scanner! It does a variety of paper sizes well. I did have a small issue with a set of business cards. The last card did not come all of the way out of the scanner automatically. The scanner opens so that I was able to remove it. Still it scanned each of the cards, including the last business card, completely. I like its compact size and that it can be cut off when not in use by holding the power button for two seconds. My husband is a college professor who plans on using it to scan copies of students twenty-page papers after he has marked them up, before he gives the papers back to the students, so that he has a copy of their first draft.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18L7LDDFE10K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBVUIV8#wasThisHelpful","R18L7LDDFE10K0","A34W7QA4J5UTOR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34W7QA4J5UTOR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PLOT: Its been two years since the death of Ben. Grey was days away from marrying him when he died. Bens best friend, Jagger, has been the support she needed to finish college. Hes also been secretly in love with her for as long as shes been with Ben.PROS: I liked the way everything was nicely tied up at the end. I liked how supportive Jagger was. For the most part, he was really sweet. I liked the bit of mystery as to who was trying to break them up. I thought it added an additional spice to keep me reading. I thought it was obvious who the culprit was and I was glad the author wrapped that up before the book ended.CONS: The characters are a bit over the top with their emotions. After two years, it seemed unrealistic to me that Grey would have been grieving to that depth. Im sure its possible for someone to grieve that long, but at times she seemed like she might have needed to be sedated or hospitalized.I was curious as to why she and Jagger went to college, and more importantly, why she bothered to finish since she got a job that she could have easily had before or during college. Its never stated what types of degrees they earned.4 STARS: I really liked the warm ending. Overall, I enjoyed the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JOP51QWPBSPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062358405#wasThisHelpful","R2JOP51QWPBSPH","A34W7QA4J5UTOR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34W7QA4J5UTOR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"PLOT: Kamryn and Brody meet and it is love at first sight. Unfortunately, hes married and shes hiding her identity.PROS: I liked the way it started with this instant connection between Brody and Kamryn. Since the story is told in first person from both their sides, you get to know how strongly they each feel for one another. I thought Kamryns feelings of jealousy and insecurity were entirely believable.I applaud the author for trying something different. Trying to turn an affair into a romance a reader can root for is rather defiant to the one of the strongest tenants of romancefidelity. I think she does this well by giving Brody one of the most non-marriages Ive ever heard of. The only way he could have been less married (other than divorce) would have been for them to have been actually separated.CONS: At the end, the author says this was based on a true story. Many times true stories are startling or hard to believe. It had me wondering what parts were real and which were fabricated since much of the story doesnt come off as believable. That Kamryn came from a rich family, I can buy. That she made enough money from gambling on horses to eventually open a bakery across the country? Not so much. There are other details that I thought were farfetched as well, but I wont list them all.There were some bits that needed to be stretched out and others that could have been shortened. The emotional connection between Kamryn and Brody doesnt feel fully developed before they are embroiled in this affair. The author skipped over their getting to know you conversations so their relationship soon seems to be all about angst and sex. It devolves what began as a sweet connection into a stereotypical tawdry affair.3.5 STARS: I generally enjoy drama and angst in a read, but lack of development made this feel as though the characters were being overly dramatic as opposed to being embroiled in any actual drama.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HPNXJG4WGI1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062299409#wasThisHelpful","R1HPNXJG4WGI1J","A34W7QA4J5UTOR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34W7QA4J5UTOR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Beautiful ... in its way, as are SO manY CRKT knives. Definitely one of the most fascinating-looking pocket knives I've seen (and have, now). This is a bit heavy for light EDC, and might ""agitate"" the uninitiated onlooker. But heck, it is nice!- Opens easily (for me)- It can be a bear to close ... a good thing, in its way- The blade spine is about 0.143"" thick! Yikes!-  Great edge & serrations. Fabulous!- Almost like a pocket kitchen knife... and one of the most creative, interesting designs ... but heavy!One observation about the finish: the edges of the grip areas are very finely machined ... and sharp. I took a .125"" ceramic rod in a pin vise and ""melted"" the edges, just breaking them. Some folks might not care to do this, and it is finicky work. I like doing that stuff, and the result retains the same grip, without the edges. (Only talking about ""breaking"" perhaps .001 or less!)Love it! Just looking at it is neat, using it is amazing.One last observation ... a one-hand opener is great when working, and a one-hand closer is useful, as well. This knife is very difficult to close with one hand, which may be a plus for some, and a minus for others. I bought it because it is a unique-looking and feeling design. It is not my favorite tool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX8S7D0PQMS6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYNEE0K#wasThisHelpful","RX8S7D0PQMS6V","A3QUZG4J7L8D4K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3QUZG4J7L8D4K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a VERY small card ... which is why I needed it. Long story short: old card in PCIe1, 2-bay graphics in PCI16, covering PCIe2, leaving PCI open.

"The hand fit on this is nice, and I like the easy-access to the battery compartment (magnetic cover).The adjustable resolution is good, but a bit awkward. You have to push both primary buttons and the wheel button simultaneously, and the LED inside the wheel flashes to inform you of the setting. Which seems funky to me, since your finger will be on the button when it flashes. Why not the side buttons? Who knows? Oh, well ...So far the one thing that REALLY ANNOYS me is the range. If the dongle isn't within two feet  of the mouse, the mouse hops, skips, jumps, freezes, and does just about everything you DON'T want a mouse to do. So, if you're planning on using this on a desktop (as I am), plan on getting a USB extension cable, too. The odd thing about the range (and i've experienced this with other mice, too) is that this mouse is a bit large for netbook/laptop portability. It is a full-size (but not ""orthopedic-ergonomic-monster-size) mouse. So to me, the size-to-signal range is a little odd.The programming features are pretty basic (no app-specific macros, etc.) which might turn some folks off. I settle for the wheel button to autoscroll/open new browser tabs (a must-have), left-side/page-down, right-side/page-up. There are a number of other off-the-rack options, as well. If you're looking for a Robo-Gaming MegaSword-Hand --- forget this one.This will do, for now. It's an OK mouse.

"What young boy does like cars, I mine they all do and some like my husband never out grow them, why I even played with cars as a child. They are six different unique cars that come in this set. They are manual operated which is nice for I didnt have to buy batteries and this makes it good for hand and eye coorrdination.Kids need toys that they have power so this encourages them to be more active. These cars and the helicopter can be played together like for example we pretended that we were in  a parking garage with a big  box we had and lined them up and let them talk to each other like the movie cars and set about a secert plan on how to save the garage from getting destroy from the evil Town Hall.They are so cute they have wheels that are easy to push on the carpet or on a tile floor and they didnt scratch my floor either thought you might want to know this. I really like how they how images of people inside of them to make them more realistic.There is a  helicopter with wheels and when you move it the blades go around how cute. There is a fire truck that has a ladder on top and it can be pulled up. There is a cement mixer that  has a mixer that can be turned up and down with a opening. I really like the yellow taxi it is just too cute too me.Each car is very sturdy and feels like it is quailty made with bright colors that have eyes and smiles all have happy faces to brighten your childs day. They can be played with together or alone, would be fun to use on a track too. These a would be a great additon to the cars your child already owns or is a great starter set.

The cubic zircona just dazzles in shine and brillance.

"The possibilites are endless!  There are so many differenet color and sized gears that your kid will be engaged for hours building and rebuiling his remote control car which needs 2 AAA batteries and they car needs 4 AA batteries plus there are stickers that he can place on the gears for the final touch! I didnt add the stickers because this is going to be a present.The gears and gears  remote car starts with a base to build on, where you want to add the tires which snap in place, Now I have to say that my husband was complaining when after he done this because he couldnt read the directions for they are in Japanese.  Working together we were able to assemble a design by looking at the pictures this is only thing I did like about this product.I over looked this in my rating due to the fact that benefits out weigh this one thing.It will bring you and your child if they would need your help together for a quailty bonding time. The gears and gears remote car has twenty different colored gears which are two different sizes that turn together as it moves around the floor with the remote controller. There is a front and back bumber, there are four wheel covers to help it move quickly around the room.I love that you can let your imagination run wild with the colors and  the designs that you can build with the gears.

"This toy was totally new too me I have always wanted to try a vibrating egg and add it too my collection but this is different for it has two eggs. I realy didnt like the purpose of the smaller egg but i have a good imaginaton so I used the longer egg for insertion and placed the smaller egg on outer areas of the same region.The egg is made good and has a very nice feel too it. It is very smooth with no rough edges to hurt the skin. I was amazed by the power these two eggs have the vibrations are super strong and fast. I needed two AA batteries that were easy to installed. The is a cute controller button that looks like a flower to me that I just turned up for more stronger vibrations or down for  less.They are waterproof so I was able to used them in the bathroom tub which made bathing alot more pleasurable.

"I really like the story behind this robot, it is very interesting and I love how he defeat the Breastmaster to become a  member of the Breast Ares Now he polices the planet to maintain peace on his planet. I have so much fun watching my husband play with this so cool robot. He is easy to control with a remote controller that needs two AA batteries for it and three AA for the robot.I love the design how  he has a shield and this is where he carries his weapons that shoots out from his chest with alot of speed. He has a lazer gun that he  that holds in his hands and it shoots out a awesome red light to kill the bad guys with that looks realistic. His legs are neat the are slim but below his knees are these big feet that are wide  and when he walks, the sound they make, sound like crunching/klanking metal.The sound effects to his actions makes this robot so much fun to play with. The shield on this chest lights up in a circle pattern which is bright and colorful. I love the sound when he is shooting his lazar gun it really  sounds real, just like a lazar gun would sound like With the remote control I was able to move his forwards and backwards and , side to side. Plus his arms move up and down. There is one buttone that plays music and is like he is dancing.On the bottom half of the romote I was able to make him move fast  with more speed. I like how before he fires his laser gun he shouts go go go, like he is commanding or warning people. My husband has been playing with it  for hours. I notices that if you leave the power switch on and not play with the robot for a minute or two it shuts off to perserve the batteries.This is the perfect gift for boys six or older in my opinion and as my husband is showing me his age.

"What a fun way to learn letters and numbers but is also educational. This is a great toy for parents to buy their kids who are three years older and up to express thoughts by drawing them on a dry easel board. It will keep you child busy for hours! It is a great way to help build a strong mind a fun teaching tool that is bright and colorful.I liked how it is a carrying case that when opened up can be turned into a desk so your child and sit and play while learning. Being a carrying case it will be easy to take places with you with a cute sturdy handle to hold. I was happy with how strong the legs of the desk hold up the table when I set it up it is very well made.You can keep the drawing board flat or it has to stand holders to up it upright to draw on. There are three holes one each side to place the colorful pens in fso they will be easy to get too. I really like the dry marker, it works good it was very easy to draw with and was super easy to wipe off with the dry eraser,It has all 26 letters your child needs to spell out words with and 20 number to learn with both the number and letters are magentic to stick to the drawing board. When I tried them the stuck easy and they stayed in place until I moved them. There are six magentic symbols that I think are cute to add to drawings.It was very easy to set up and will provide hours of fun while your child is learning. it is compact so it will not take up much space.

This is why I love the my string lights they are made with 20 indiviual LED powered dragonflies that light up powered by three C batteries. on a seven feet string They are super colorful and well made.There are so many different lighting modes to choose from.They are clear dragonflies to start with that are solid in color then they can flash but with three different speeds of flashing to choose from. I personally dont like the flashing lights for they make my eyes hurt but they do look pretty and this is what my girls prefer. I like the setting where they go from light shade of the color then it  builds strong and brighter then starts all over again.I like how they can be used indoors  since they are weather proof.

"This is a perfect phone just to have to only  make calls with. I bought it for my husband to have while I could find him a nice flip phone that was good but not over a couple of hundred dollars. The battery is the phone was great it would last for days before it needed charged again. The biggest thing I dont like about this phone is the numbers are very small I had to put on glasses on to read them and so did my husband. But as a backup phone is is good we put  it  for this purpose since we dont own a landline is nice to have on hand plus if one of our phones die again we will have a cell phone to make calls with.

"Edit 11/1/2015:For what it's worth, I was able to fix the timer by taking it apart and repairing a solder joint on one of the relays inside.  So if you're electronically inclined and your timer has failed, you might want to check for that issue.Edit 10/2015:I'm downgrading my review from 4 stars to one because this thing just died at the ""ripe old age"" of 2-1/2 years!I didn't misuse it... it was used exactly for its intended purpose, controlling a water heater.  But this morning we had no hot water, I did some electrical troubleshooting, and one of the switch contacts of the timer is open.  So I'll be buying a new timer... but not one from Intermatic.Original review 4/2013:The instructions were clear (for someone like me with some wiring experience), the unit was easy to install (likewise), and it works well.

"I just received these sprinkler heads, and what was notably missing from the package was extra nozzles.  Sometimes when you buy sprinkler heads they come with nozzles in a variety of sizes... these don't.  Thanks to Amazon's lousy product descriptions, it's hard to tell this before buying.If the 3.0 GPM nozzle it comes with (green color) happens to be the right size for you, you're set.  If not, you're gonna have to shell out another 7 bucks for a nozzle set... making these pretty expensive.EDIT: I took this from two stars to one when I did some research and discovered how poor Amazon's descriptions really are.  Orbit sells this item under two part numbers: the 55069 is this one and does not include the extra nozzles.  The 55059, also sold by Amazon for about A DOLLAR MORE, does include the nozzles.  However neither product description mentions nozzles or the absence of same.

"Update 11/2013: this effin' thing quit working completely!  If you read my essay below I thought I'd fixed the serious reliability problems it had when I first got it.  But a few days ago I noticed the lamp connected to it had stopped lighting on schedule.  I pressed the manual override button and... nothing.  When I looked at the timer, it appeared to have lost all its programming... again.There's nothing wrong with the lamp - when I plugged it directly into the outlet, it lit up.So this thing's going in the trash... I'm done with it.Previous review---------------Well... it seems many people like this thing, I have to say I do not!First: it's incredibly sensitive to the battery's connection.  Light finger pressure on the battery cover, or even vibration in the house from a truck going by, is enough to interrupt power from the battery.  When that happens, the timer instantly ""reboots"", and loses the time setting.  Apparently the actual programming settings are saved, but until you manually set the date+time the unit will not function.  This alone for me makes the unit essentially useless.Luckily I solved the above problem by opening up the unit and installing an electronic component called a capacitor across the battery - Leviton could have done this for an additional cost of about 50 cents but didn't.  The capacitor has fixed the above-mentioned problem but installing it certainly is not something the average person could do.Another significant gripe is its inability to handle certain programs that include both sunup/sundown and fixed times.  Example: in the winter, I want my lamp to come on at 5:30 AM and go off at sunup which might be around 8:00 AM.  As long as it's winter this works just fine.  But then this thing called ""summer"" comes along, and now the sun is coming up at 5:00.  You'd hope the unit would be smart enough to deal with that situation by just not turning on in the morning but no!  It turns on at 5:30 AM, then apparently wants to stay on until sunup at 5:00 AM... the next day!  In other words the lamp is on all day, negating the point of having a timer.  As far as I can tell, the only way to get around this issue would be to program the ""on"" time to be earlier than the sun could possibly come up... pretty lame.Lastly a less important issue.  The instructions helpfully tell you that you can enable ""permanent override"" to keep the output on or off by holding down the ""override"" or tethered remote button for a few seconds.  Okay, cool.  But the instructions unhelpfully do NOT tell you how to cancel that override!  I had to ask on Leviton's user forums and wait over a week for someone to respond and tell me that all you have to do is press the button again.  I might have figured that out for myself if I was able to see the display on the unit which has graphics to indicate what mode it's in.  But the unit is buried behind a table and not visible at all... that's why I bought a timer with a remote!","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVXU0YYV3AIZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040718V4#wasThisHelpful","RVXU0YYV3AIZK","A28Q94CXRMP2SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28Q94CXRMP2SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well I guess I'm going to be the minority opinion here... I'm reasonably happy with this TV but not jumping with joy.Just a little context: this is our 2nd plasma.  The first was an HP 42"" set manufactured by Panasonic.  I have no complaints about that one at all, it worked pretty much perfectly.A few months ago we decided we'd like to go a little larger and 1080p, and based on experience with the other set I pretty much limited my searching to Panasonic.  I quickly found the TC-P50ST30 here on Amazon, the price was good and the reviews were wonderful.  So we bought it.The first thing we noticed upon installation was the sound - it's lousy.  About a 3 on a 1-10 scale of all TVs I've ever heard (just counting internal speakers here) and the other Panny was a 10.  Literally the next day we ordered a cheap surround receiver so we could hook up real speakers.  That solved that problem.But my other 2 complaints about this set persist.  First is brightness fluctuations.  I've read a lot about those in the comments here and I don't think my problem is the same as others have reported.  My issue is whenever a bright scene comes up, the picture slowly grows dimmer over about 10 seconds.  Likewise, when the scene switches from bright to dark, the picture grows slowly lighter over a similar period.  It's like it's trying to make all scenes the same brightness.  I should mention this is with an HDMI connection from a FIOS box and it's possible it's the FIOS box and not the TV.  But we've got the old TV up in the bedroom connected to another FIOS box and it doesn't have the problem.  I should mention I've got all the various ""automatic"" features (like room lighting compensation and color correction) turned off.The other problem though I do think is definitely the set.  The picture flickers!  It's exactly the same as what's called the ""rainbow effect"" with DLP projectors - you see multicolored fringes around bright areas of the picture.  You can kind of learn to ignore it, but the old plasma did NOT do this at all.Other than the above, we're pretty happy with the set.  Color rendition is good, the larger screen and higher resolution are great.  3D we haven't tried yet but I'm sure eventually we'll give in to temptation!  The online functions, especally Amazon VOD are great.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LYOHHNCOAQ1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MME77O#wasThisHelpful","R1LYOHHNCOAQ1S","A28Q94CXRMP2SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28Q94CXRMP2SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this to use on Intex's smallest pool, the 8-foot easy-set.Basically with my setup, the thing just doesn't work.  The blue top ring that's supposed to float and control the skimming action floats too high, no water goes over its edge and it doesn't collect anything.  I'm using a pump that's above the stated minimum size for the skimmer (1500GPH pump, skimmer instructions state 1200GPH minimum), but I think because of the loose tolerances with which this thing is made, the water just goes through the underwater gap around the floating part, rather than over its top.Contributing to this I think, is the fact that while the instructions make a point of saying the skimmer has to sit level, there's no way to make it sit level in an easy-set pool, which has sloping sides!  It would probably be better in a framed pool.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37QHGHTDBTNY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00178IMPO#wasThisHelpful","R37QHGHTDBTNY5","A28Q94CXRMP2SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28Q94CXRMP2SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Received my book today and had a chance to look through it. I do like the Tiki theme which is something I haven't seen yet in adult coloring books. The pages are one-sided and an extra sheet between them will be needed if using gel pens because it might bleed through. There are about 8 pictures I really like. Others are a bit simplistic for me and a couple of the drawings seem to have pieces of clip art-type pictures randomly put together without any obvious cohesiveness.  I wasn't sure if I liked the picture of the canoeist at all until I looked at it long enough and decided that yeah, I can work with that, I will have to use my coloring prowess to bring to the forefront what needs to stand out from the rest of it but I've always liked a challenge.

"This is the first USB MIDI controller I've used, but I've used soundboards and mixers in the past so it wasn't completely foreign to me. And while none of the faders, buttons or keys felt luxurious, mechanized or very finely weighted and crafted... they didn't feel nearly as cheap as they should for this price. The controller is attractive and does not seem like it will break easily. Getting it installed and going did take some unnecessary time. You need to register your keyboard, download some very large apps/packages, register for and download Abelton Light (for free), and go through the installation steps. It can take an hour or more to set up depending on your connection speeds. Once I got the drivers and Abelton installed I thought I'd just be able to start playing around... not quite. I could control some things, but the keyboard and other options wouldn't work. There is an important step after installing, which is in the manual but I missed it at first, that has you set the correct MIDI ins and outs for Abelton. But once you do that, there's no mapping necessary. Which is a huge time saver and more than makes up for the lengthy downloads. It took a little bit of poking around to get used to Abelton, but after a couple of nights I was able to make some fun little jams. It's going to take some time before I can make anything good, but this is just the controller to get me there.On a side note, I also used it to control my photos in Lightroom using a program call MIDI2LR. It was fun to be able to use real sliders to control the virtual ones, and each button could issue a command like ratings, navigating photos, and changing modes. This controller (the 49key) is a little bit too big to use like this all the time, but I may just pick up a smaller or keyboardless unit for that purpose in the future.Overall, it's a really nice entry level controller that's easy to get going and will grow with you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKTKQR4WQVEB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVK2A3I#wasThisHelpful","RKTKQR4WQVEB9","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These come as six individual packs. So it's quite possible that your 6 may be different that someone else's, but like most others I got Boba Fett's Slave I instead of the Star Destroyer, and the X-Wing was with open wings. And while it's true that these are not solid metal, they are a lot better quality that the Micro Machine line, with better heft and details. I started buying these before, so this set did cause me to have some duplicates. If you're just starting out though it's a good way to go.The roughly 3+"" models come with a stand that also allows you to put your finger into, so that you can ""fly"" the ships around. This is a great idea, and works well with all of them except Slave I. Since it connects upwards to back of ship, Slave I is always in the landed position rather than a flying position. My six year old son loves them, and I've even decorated my own desk with some of the duplicates. Highly recommended as great Star Wars item that's well worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26TA9K8EGWNBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJYDHPK#wasThisHelpful","R26TA9K8EGWNBQ","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coming from the previous model Jabra Sport Plus, I found this to have several big improvements, however they made a few missteps in my opinion.Still the same as my previous set is Jabra's fantastic un-boxing experience, the magnetic box opens up fluidly and easily. Jabra still has one of the best pairing systems, and syncing it with my phone was very easy. The headphones still seem as durable as before, my previous set have been dropped, sweated on, rained on, forgotten, and generally abused but they always worked assuming it had batteries.The biggest improvement is the on cord controls. I hated having to fiddle with my ears to control volume, power and tracks, now the controls are on the cord, which is a huge improvement (although I wish the pace/status button was also on the cord). Next biggest improvement is the battery life, it has an extra hour and weighs less than my previous pair, plus the Jabra app will tell you an exact amount of life left. In the event that you do drain the battery, it charges a lot faster and 10-15 minutes will have it ready for most workouts. Also, the sound is also louder and clearer thanks to the noise isolating earbuds.Of little consequence to me is the Jabra Sport app. I tried it out, and it seem solid enough but since it doesn't sync up with any other service, so you'd pretty much have to start you training diaries from scratch with it, and I'm not ready to do that. It does fully support the pace button (Strava on Android did not), it also has a basic Cooper Fitness test and various running/walking/cycling modes including intervals.But with all these improvements and solid carryovers there are a couple of things I didn't like. Mostly it's my own preference against in ear buds... But I found between songs and when off I find the noise from them rubbing in my ear while running slightly annoying. Also they block out more noise than the previous on ear buds, which I find a little more dangerous with traffic. Also, the pace button on my Android phone just triggers the Jabra Sport app to open (maybe it works with other fitness apps?), this makes it less than useful to me, but since that button is on the ear piece I wouldn't want to press it anyways.Overall, I prefer these for time when I want to block out more noise, like work or the gym, but when I go running outside I usually stick with the older set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSS2K9CA8KIMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161D1CQ0#wasThisHelpful","RSS2K9CA8KIMM","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very impressed by this toy model that lives up to the ""toy"" qualifier better than most regular toys. The size is ideal, it big enough to have gravitas but can be held with a single hand to simulate epic dogfights. There's a button on the back that activates the thruster lights (a transparent piece of plastic in front of two leds) in a brilliant blue, as well as one of 3 sounds (engine roar, slow cannon fire, and rapid cannon fire) in sequential order. As for the ""model"" side, it is a beginner set, it easier to put together than it is to unpackage most modern toys that are strapped inside their boxes for in store presentation. There are 19 pieces and almost every step has a twin (top and bottom cannons, left and right window, left and right locking pegs, etc), so it's ideal for building with a young child since you can show how it's done and then let them do the other half.Overall, I like it a lot, especially since my 6 year old son is obsessed with Star Wars Legos, but also likes to play with his models. With the Legos it usually involves me spending countless hours finishing models he has tired of building, only to have them come back for regular repairs. With this we get both the joy of engineering our toys without the drudgery or risk of obliteration with regular play. Sure it's a lot less modular, but it's the Millennium Falcon, you don't mess with perfection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQYCP4LXU3Q2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125KV5TW#wasThisHelpful","RQYCP4LXU3Q2U","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It didn't work with either my 5S or iPad Mini 2 while they were in their case. The cases are the bulkier OtterBox style cases so I half expected that, but even a modest case would have trouble working in this. It would be nice if they provided adjustment that would allow for different case types (for example, it the side supports could be depressed so that a cased unit could make firm contact with the plug, and extra space at the bottom for port covers).Overall, my review of 3 stars is not because this doesn't work well, because it does without a case...

"For the price this all in one printer checks all the right marks. A scanner with an automatic document feeder, good quality color prints, and fully wireless between PCs and mobile devices.To set it up you simply take it out of the box, remove about 10 pieces of tape and plug it into the wall. Oh, and it's just a cord... there are NO bulky adapters... SWEET! Once powered on you need to download the app to your phone, it was fast and easy and the app found the printer quickly and asked which network to connect to. Once done the printer walks you through installing the ink and loading the paper. It then prints a calibration page and asks you to scan it. I wish it came with a few blank sheets, but you do have to have some of your own to get started. Printing from the phone is easy with the app, and there's another app for android devices that lets you print from more apps as well. To get it working with the PC I tried following the recommended online instructions, but it required an account setup... and turns out I already had an account... to SnapFish which HP acquired. Of course I didn't know the password to the account and had to ask for reset. The resets all errored on me and cause a lot of frustration to an otherwise smooth experience. I finally caved and just used the CD... which went much better. I wish the online method didn't need an account to complete, but it did and I couldn't try it. After all the setup the actual printing is very easy as is the scanning. The touchscreen was very responsive although it was in simple black and white.PROS:+ No adapter or wall wart on the power cord.+ Small footprint+ Simple mobile setup+ Scan from the printer to your phone/pc JPG or PDF+ Scan from your phone to you printer with auto straighten and enhance+ CD in box for much simpler PC installs+ Paper catch automatically swings out when printing and tucks away to save space+ Auto document feeder make scanning multipage PDFs a breeze+ Responsive touchscreenCONS:- Website for PC setup wouldn't let me sign up since I once had a SnapFish account, I tried to reset it but it always errored out.- No starter paper included and you need at least a couple sheets to finish setup.NEUTRAL OBSERVATIONS:* Touchscreen is black and white, but that doesn't matter* No memory card slots, but does support printer over wifiUnboxing and mobile setup: 5+ StarsWebsite for PC installs: 0 Stars for me (If you never had an account it might be much higher)CD for PC installs: 5 StarsValue: 5 StarsOverall: 4.5 Stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ7WJXGPD19O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SKI4X8#wasThisHelpful","RJ7WJXGPD19O2","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are looking for a low cost Windows machine to surf the web and run the occasional PC app, but don't plan on using it to store photos or play games (including sophisticated online games) then this isn't too bad of a deal. You get a reasonably nice touch screen computer in a lightweight package, that's much more capable than net-books of the past.But if you are storing photos of videos, you will quickly find the 32GB (of which only about 13GB is available) will fill up way too quickly. You can get around this by adding something like this: SanDisk Ultra Fit 128GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive (SDCZ43-128G-G46) which will give you more than enough storage, but you'll need to manage it as a separate drive and be careful not to lose it.As for streaming Amazon Prime video it worked pretty well and as long as you look at it mostly straight on the colors are rich and image sharp.  It can also be used in tent formation, but there are no sensors to detect it so the image will be upside down unless you flip the video. The way to flip the video is with the shortcut CTRL+ALT+Down Arrow [Up Arrow to return it back]. But watching video on this is best suited for small groups, since the picture is small, the sound is modest and once you move more than 45 degrees off center the colors begin to shift dramatically.The webcam, while low res actually has really good image quality for video chatting. The touchpad, screen, and keyboard are also as good, if not better than you would expect at this price, and the fully convertible screen does let this act like a tablet. But if you are looking mostly for a tablet, then you should probably get a dedicated one instead. The windows marketplace isn't nearly as robust as Apple, Amazon, or Google's and the slowish processor and limited memory are so busy running the heavy Windows OS that apps tend to run a little on the sluggish/slow responsive side.BEST FOR:+ Web use: Facebook, Shopping, Photo Browsing+ The one Windows app you absolutely need to run+ Your accessories (Printer, Camera, Etc) need a Windows PCGOOD FOR:+ Watching streaming video by yourself or with a friend or twoPASSABLE WITH:- Web games, mildly complex web games like Club Penguin load, but slowly- Photos, if you get additional storageBAD FOR:- Anything that requires a lot of memory, storage, or processor (e.g. Photoshop, Videos, PC games)","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OFH9X7BB5V93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KKFEPC#wasThisHelpful","R3OFH9X7BB5V93","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a reasonable alternative to giant slim jims. They don't taste phenomenal, but they aren't too bad either. A little on the salt and pepper sidem but well within the normal range of meat snacks. They are a lot less greasy than the ""giant"" 1 oz slim jims which may account for the significantly fewer calories. These 1.5oz sticks have only 90 calories, while the smaller 1oz slim jims have 140. I also prefer the firmness of the casing on these over other snack sticks (probably due to the much lower fat content). So if I was in a gas station with a choice between these and a slim jim I'd probably go with these, especially if I wanted to limit my calories.But I personally preferred the Old Wisconsin ""Honey Brown Sugar Turkey"" flavor better. Its added sweetness makes the flavor more balanced, although it does bump up the calories to a still reasonable 120. The turkey also has a collagen casing which improves the outside texture even more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27PHC5XR4ZEQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105DW2WU#wasThisHelpful","R27PHC5XR4ZEQR","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The packaging is reasonable, it shows the miniatures though a window and as soon as you open the box they all come out easily without a bunch of tie downs and tape. So far so good. The star destroyer looks great too when closed.But after this, there's a lot of frustration. First, getting the pieces to move harmoniously from closed to open takes practice so that you don't hold back pieces that are supposed to move and to not move pieces that should stay put. Plastic parts just seem to want to snap off at every turn. Getting it to stay in the locked opened position is also a challenge until it gets worked in. The back section (behind the thrusters) is poorly illustrated in the guide and difficult to open unless you know the undocumented secret. There's a little stop pin on the lower left side and if you squeeze your grip to open it, you only tighten it more. So a a light touch is required (or pry the shell away from the lock). There are also a ton of stickers that you have to put on, in some fairly tight spaces. I tired quickly of this and let me kids try, so now the whole ship looks sloppy. So the question is... Why do I still think it deserves 3 stars. Well because my kids still love it, and it's Star Wars. And despite the ship collapsing and snapping apart and looking like a scrap heap, they still have epic dog fights and light saber battles. So I guess Star Wars is still powerful enough to save a haphazardly crafted toy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZX3NUSPOL1QA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOFZSZK#wasThisHelpful","R1ZX3NUSPOL1QA","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall, this speaker has solid sound and build quality, it also has a few novelty features like usb charging and stereo pairing, but for the most part they're more gimmicky than useful. Also, while it's a simple speaker, you still need to start with the instructions, which is a shame since it wouldn't take much to improve it's usability.Sound Quality: 5 StarsIt filled the living room clear vocals and booming bass, the size of this unit is fully maximized for sound quality.Build Quality: 4.5 StarsThis thing is solid and fairly large. It looks as though it may be made of aluminum, but alas it's only a high quality plastic. Very sturdy, but different materials would make it more elegantUsability: 4 StarsYou turn it on by holding the power down, you pair by holding the play button down until you hear the pairing sound. There are no icons to indicate that this is the procedure for pairing. You have to already know, look it up, or guess (and since many other bluetooth speakers pair through the button button or a dedicated pairing button it's not certain you will). Once you get this down it works like any other bluetooth device and it remembers the last 8 paired devices. One nice thing is that it does come with an Audio-in jack with an Aux cable, which is a nice fallback that will keep it usable even if technology changes.Power Bank: 3 StarsThe power bank aspect is very limited. It's great for keeping the speaker portable and cordless, but as a charger it has the following flaws: 1) It only charges if the speaker is on, even if it's plugged in. This means if you don't want to use it as a speaker, you can't charge. 2) The unit automatically powers down after 90 minutes of Bluetooth inactivity, so charging will end too. 3) The unit is heavy, so you aren't likely going to carry this out into the remote wilderness or anytime you're walking with it. So chances are you'll have other, less complicated power sources for your phone. 4) Once it runs out of battery, you have to use it's proprietary charging plug, so if you left it behind and used up the battery to charge your tablet... then you're out of business until you get home. On the plus side, if you travel internationally, they provide adapters for nearly everywhere in the world.Stereo Speaker: 3.5 StarsI love the idea of this, and can only imagine that two of these working left and right channels would make any room or outdoor setting an aural sensation. But based on the instructions in the manual, it seems intimidating, non-intuitive, and prone to problems. First you need to make sure nothing is connected to either unit via Bluetooth, then you hold down the battery buttons on both speakers for 8 seconds. In another 30 seconds you will get another confirmation beep. You can then pair/connect to either speaker. You can turn off both speakers by powering off either one. However, if you want to skip the stereo pairing the next time, you must turn them both on within 5 seconds of each other... and then wait another 15 seconds for confirmation. None of these instructions on the unit either as instructions or with iconography. There are also warnings that other bluetooth devices trying to connect to the speakers will cause them to distort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R110X43R2SK1QO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1SBB9A#wasThisHelpful","R110X43R2SK1QO","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first turned this vacuum on my cats didn't scatter in every direction. That was my first clue that this vacuum was something special. On the low setting you could probably get away with vacuuming while someone was talking on the phone or sleeping in the same room. But is it quiet because it's weak? Far from it, when you lift it off the ground while running you can hear the loud acoustics of the engine that did startle the cats, but as soon as it's returned to ground it hums along sucking up dirt and debris with quiet ease. There isn't a hose to use, so cleaning crevices and stairs with small steps isn't this unit's specialty, but it's light enough that it's easy to carry up stairs and would do fine with larger stair landings. The cord is like that of a power tool, with a short lead that plugs into a long extension cord (included), at first this seemed odd but this makes a lot of sense if you need more (or less) length, need to fix cord damage, or just a simpler way to untangle. This is bag unit, which is nice in that there's no filters to clean out by hand, but most bag units fill up too fast and it can be hard to know when to change the bags out. This unit solves both of these with a HUGE bag (it's fills the entire upright compartment), that is easy to remove and seals automatically. Plus there's a light on the top that indicates when the bag is full. With 2 kids and 6 cats it tough on any vacuum to keep up, but this one is up to the job and does it without disturbing the peace. Highly recommended for home, pet, or commercial use.PROS:+ SUPER QUITE+ Very light+ Direct feed from vacuum to bag+ Huge bag+ Works well as floor sweep, fantastic on carpet+ All controls and indicators right at your handCONS:- No hose or attachments for hard to reach places- Bags are a little pricey, but are reasonable for their size and even better when bought in bulk","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H24PW8IVH79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSSNNGE#wasThisHelpful","R1H24PW8IVH79","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Between all the kids, cats and rabbits we've had over the years we've gone through a lot of deep/steam/power/spot cleaners. For the most part we've relied on the Hoover SteamVac line, even when they broke we replaced them due to their simplicity. But even the simplest upright SteamVac is a chore to setup, and then prep vacuum, steam cleaning an entire room, and finally cleaning out all the gunk. It means that stains which aren't in high visibility areas or that are hard to get to (like in the car), they often go untreated for ages. I tried a spot cleaner before, but between the cord and warm up time, it too became too much of a hassle to bring out.This unit on the other hand is super simple, very portable and a joy to use. The biggest caveat is that you need to charge it first and it does take about 4 hours to go from empty to a full battery. Because the lithium batteries are very good about holding a charge, this should only be an issue the first time you get out of the box. I took this unit through it's paces, from old juice, food, cat, and car stains and it did all of them really well. After turning it on, you pull the trigger to spray the solution over the area to be cleaned. You then have to work the solution in by hand with the brush instead of powered brushes that full size units have, but I found the spots came up quick enough that I didn't get fatigued. Finally, you angle the brush down so that you get a good vacuum seal to suck up the dirty water. Of the half dozen spot cleans I did, only one set-in juice spots are still slightly visible after drying out. I could, and probably will, go over it again, but most people would only see it now if they were looking for it (see photo with several small dark spots for a before/after). The separate clean and dirty tanks are also very easy to fill and empty.PROS:+ Goes anywhere cord free+ Every took has home on the unit+ Gunk/Hair catch on the handle is very easy to clean+ Unit is easy to fill and clean+ Battery lasts long enough to clean a household of small stains on a single chargeCONS:- Needs up to a 4 hour charge to use- The spray width is generous, great for large stains, but may over spray- The lack of powered brushes means some hand scrubbing is neededTIPS:* Plug it in after each use, the next morning it's okay to store away* For small stains or where over spray may be a problem hold it very close to the stain and use shorter pulls on the spray triggerOverall, the ability to clean difficult spots in the car alone make this a compelling tool. And while you're not going to clean the entire carpet with this thing, it is does make it very easy to get great results anywhere in or even outside the house without a lot of effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28KOFJWEILDRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010QZQMF0#wasThisHelpful","R28KOFJWEILDRP","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is actually a pretty cool toy. It's a miniaturized version of those marble machines you see in museums and my kids love playing with it. From cranking the marbles up the shaft (3 marbles are included, but we added a dozen more to make it more interesting) to watching them wind, plop and spin back to start. They even imagined the marbles to be the ""memories"" featured in the recent movie Inside Out. The building time was about 50 minutes (slightly faster than the estimated 1-2 hours on the box) and I enjoy the building before play aspect of toys like this and Legos.So why am I dinging it so hard in my reviews? Because I feel it doesn't live up to its potential. This is a precision contraption, if something isn't in the right place or the lifting apparatus in the auger gets pulled apart and then misaligned (this happened to me), or the pieces of similar but different heights are in the wrong place, then the entire thing doesn't work right. It would have been better if the back wall was a solid piece with peg holes for the various attachments like slides and gears. That way you could enjoy the physics without the time consuming assembling, and reassembling with every found error. The parts are slightly difficult to put together and even harder to diagnose errors and reassemble, I wouldn't recommend solo construction of this toy for children under 12. The other problem is that it falls out of alignment as you use it. So the crank stops engaging the auger as it is slowly lifted up from your hand's cranking motion. I've since instructed my kids to just spin the primary gear and that works well enough. In the end, I just wish they had either made it stronger and less modular or gone the other way and devised a way to make it a lot more modular and stable. As it is, you can't go too off book since the pieces have measured connection points and the beams are too many different sizes without extras.Overall, if you have a kid who loves the marble machines, or a physics loving teen then this is a nice gift, just be prepared to deal with a little bit of frustration for a lot of fun.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TQ1GEB4X74E5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXNJ45M#wasThisHelpful","R3TQ1GEB4X74E5","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are comfortable and slightly larger feeling than my other compression gear (110% and Camden), but they still squeeze nicely on the muscles to help prevent fatigue while running and improve recovery afterwards. If you find your current calf sleeve feels like it's tugging at your leg hairs then give these a try in the same size. I like that the back of the sleeve, where the calf muscle goes, has a printed design that helps ensure putting them on the right way and that they didn't get twisted once they are on. They don't have pockets for icing like my 110%'s, but on the other hand they are  a lot more breathable because of it.Overall, they're a nice quality sleeve that hits the sweet spot of price/quality, at about half the price of the big brands and a little less than double the cheapest brands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V9HZGOCRXNET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OCWRI7K#wasThisHelpful","R3V9HZGOCRXNET","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:This slide has a soft-ish air pillow to takeoff on and the blue side has a sprinkler system. The spinkler continues to a little pool with a sprinkler that my kids were most happy hanging out in after the fun of sliding wore off. It comes with attachments for both male and female hose attachments (although the instructions don't tell you how to attach the male hose) and a tear repair kit (although the most like tear is not really repairable). The price is quite reasonable even with what will typically be a single weekend of fun, so keep that in mind when purchasing it.CONS:The instructions are HORRIBLE, they don't refer to this slide in particular. They don't explain the difference between weight, drain, fill, or air valves and pockets. Nor do they tell you how to attach a male hose attachment or tell you where or how to fasten the stakes. The slide isn't very long and is very thin and hard on the body. Since the sprinkler is only on one slide, it doesn't work well for races, it's just a wide single slide in my opinion. Also, it says on the slide that the limit is something like 12 years, 5' and 110lbs (although it seems like a safety issue since it did take a couple of larger sliders, albeit with some pain). Finally the sprinklers on the end are too tempting for kids to put there fingers into which will cause tears that will only become exacerbated if you drain it improperly.WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:After meeting with a committee of adults, playing  here is what you need to know. None of this is properly covered in the instructions.1) The launch pillow fills up with air at the small air valve (similar to a beach ball). It is a very large area to fill, using a pump is the only practical way to go.2) On the sides of the billow are two drain valves, these are separate weight pockets. They each need to be filled with water and closed.3) At the end are additional drain valves. These just need to be closed for use. As the sprinkler system fills up the water will collect at the end of the slide. You simply open these valves when ready to drain and store the slide (If you don't the water will be forced through the small sprinkler holes are create serious tears).4) Finally you attach the hose by using one of the two adapters into (the attachment for female hoses pushes into the hole with the treads pointing up) or around (this donut looking adapter is pushed over the filling hole to create an internal thread which the hose screws into) the filling hole.OVERALL:It got the kids out there, but the 6 year olds were really too big for double sliding and the 8 year old was giant. There was fun to be had, we used some tear free soap to make it a little slicker and had a few successful runs and some wallowing in the pool at the end. It would have been nice if our ground was softer or the mat was padded. Once we tried to put it away however it did self destruct since I didn't know the importance of the drainage plugs yet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT9AGMV2MWEIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OW9KE60#wasThisHelpful","RT9AGMV2MWEIM","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"KNIFE BLOCK - 5 StarsThe first decision when picking this KithenAid set over another is most likely a brand/design one. Let me assure you the zinc wedge block looks and feels spectacular. It would go perfectly in a home with similar KitchenAid appliances, and will still draw complements without them. It is important to note that the 7 piece and 11 piece sets come with the same block, so you will want to finish off the set eventually if you start there or it will look like something is always missing. It comes with following slots (also note that the medium slots will hold small knives too):1 - Sharpening Steel Holder1 - Kitchen Shear Holder2 - Large Slots (1 open, 1 holding the Chef Knife)3 - Medium Slots (2 open, 1 holding the Bread Knife)3 - Small Slots (1 open, 2 holding the Utility and Paring Knives)* In case you're keeping score, that's 10 slots, the block itself counts as a piece of the set.KNIFE QUALITY - 4.5 StarsThese all feature a nice thick German steel blades. The tang of the larger knives are about 1/8"" thick. And once you hold it in your hand you can tell it's a quality tool. Compared to my last set of J.A. Henckels, which I was happy with they feel night and day sturdier and more confident. The sharpening steel is also very heavy duty, although I feel it's useless for the serrated utility knife and not ideal for the bread knife, but for the other two knives and shears it will do the job admirably. My only real con is that I would like the kitchen sheers to separate for better cleaning, other than that it's near perfect set, once you finish it. For me I think adding a large santuko and 3 more utility knives (for a total of 4 utility knives which will allow them to serve as exceptional steak knives for small dinner parties).OVERALL - 4.75 StarsOverall, the design impresses and the knives don't disappoint. My only caveat would be, make sure you plan on finishing the set or the 7 piece set will look spartan although if you're a serious knife person you might prefer the flexibility of picking and choosing the last pieces.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCVZ03OYVVA9N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFEC9EC#wasThisHelpful","RCVZ03OYVVA9N","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These balloons use a floating dis-solvable capsule that locks into the neck of the balloon to form a temporary water tight seal. The biggest problem with them is that they don't last long enough to prep them in advance. The package said that it would last 20 or 30 minutes, but from our hose during an early Florida summer they wouldn't last more than 5 minutes. Which basically means it will only work if you can fill and throw at the same time. This brings me to the second problem, the filler nozzle doesn't have a valve control. So if you don't have one on your spigot then it's near impossible to fill these up since you need the water to be off the put the balloons on the filler nozzle. Once you have filled the balloon the snap and seal usually works, and it is fairly ingenious, but the failure rate is higher than balloon bursts from tying errors. Overall, I'd only consider this if both sides had their own filling station and the water was reasonably cool.I personally settled on the Kaos tie-not system. It's a bit of plastic attachment that makes tying a balloon a simple and rhythmic 3 step process (flip, slip and pull) and doesn't require any fine finger dexterity. You can get them to fit a hose or in a portable pump. We (3 people with three tie-nots) were able to fill up 500 balloons in under a half hour the night before, and they pretty much all survived for an epic battle the next afternoon. This would have been impossible had we used the Zorbz which we originally bought.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XLPS9UOXP8GO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRGCZDM#wasThisHelpful","R2XLPS9UOXP8GO","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great basic BR player with Smart TV features. I've tried a few BR brands in past and like many others have settled on Panasonic BR players (mine current unit was the DMP-BDT220), which have served me very well and only recently had the YouTube channel been decommissioned by Google since it wasn't using the HTML 5 version of the client. So I was eager to see how they improved on an already solid machine. The first thing I noticed was the speed improvement. Movies loaded faster, same with the Netflix app (which used to take forever) and the other Internet features. The YouTube app is back and with a new interface. It's actually harder to use with the remote than the old one, but they have an easy way to pair it with your phone's YouTube app so you can easily cast your videos to the TV from the app. I also love that they reduced the size of the player, it makes it fit in a lot better with my other set top boxes.On the other hand there I still have a few complaints, they aren't deal breakers but I wish they would fix them before I get my next Panasonic BR player. Firstly is the remote control. The directional keys are shaped well and very useful, however they put shortcut keys with the same shape right above them, so it is way to easy to exit your app and jump to another part of the system instead of navigating as planned. A universal remote or the phone app mostly fixes this, but it's the number one cause of pain when I use the remote. The next two items aren't expected at this price point, but it would be nice to have an audio out of some sort (other than the one that goes through the HDMI) and secondly I'd like the ability to navigate and start the movie from the set top box itself, but there are not enough buttons to do this. It also supports Miracast which is great, but I don't have any devices that use it. I would really like it if they supported other casting platforms like chromecast or airplay in the future (ideally in a firmware update).PROS:+ Great form factor+ Much faster than previous models+ Good NetFlix, YouTube, Amazon, Vudu, and Pandora support+ One button shortcut to NetFlixCONS:- Remote makes it too easy to jump out of an app/feature when operating by feel.- No audio out (SPDIF or Coax)- No directional/select controls on unit","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RH1DZP28Z32J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQHMSZI#wasThisHelpful","R3RH1DZP28Z32J","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great loveseat with some really good bones. You can feel the structure and quality of the construction as soon as you sit on it. Even a group of heavy sitters didn't cause any creaking of sagging. The quality doesn't end with the frame either, the throw pillows are filled with real feathers that fluff up really well and are very big and comfortable. While the fabric looks and feels almost exactly like leather, I actually prefer the more humanitarian material that doesn't get sticky on bare skin. Overall the feel is very nice, with a medium/soft firmness and the arms are definitely comfortable enough to rest on. The only slightly negative comment I've received from any of my guests was that the seat wasn't as deep as my other couches. This is likely due to the fluffy, yet non-detachable back cushions. I don't think this will bother most people, but if you like very deep seats you may want to be aware of it. The bottom cushions are removable and reversible, which should extend the life of the seat if you get a stubborn stain.For me the delivery was quick and easy with the freight company dropping off the huge box directly into the garage. I did still have to unpack it and move it into the house myself (with a helper too). The feet are not screwed in for shipping, so it was fairly easy to put it on its end and twist it through the door. Once in, the big wooden feet twisted onto the bottom by hand. Much easier that other furniture that I've had delivered, but you should be aware that it's not full service delivery and you'll need a place to drop it until you can get someone to help you bring it in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7JW3E0EKSV3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QM2KYAQ#wasThisHelpful","R7JW3E0EKSV3N","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First setting up the serger was intense. It's not hard, but there are a lot of steps and ways to mess up, but with the help of the DVD with frequent pausing and rewinding I was able to get it threaded and running a poorly lit room in about half an hour. Now that I know how to set it up I'm sure I could thread the machine from scratch in about 10 minutes, maybe a little less if I take the short cut of tying the old threads to the new ones and much less with practice. The automated needle threading was very simple and with the exception of the tight quarters to pull the the thread through it was easier than any other machine I've used.Once the machine is set up the sewing was very easy to do and makes a nice finished edge or blind stitch with automatic trimming. With the other included accessories and configurations you can do sleeves, un trimmed stitches, fabric bunching and a lot more. I'm very excited to see what I can produce with it, but with just the starting configuration it already very useful for making sturdy sewn crafts quickly that look a lot more finished and professional. It worked with the standard spools of thread that I had laying around as long as you put the thread catch downward, but it looks as through it can easily handle larger cones which may work out better in the long run. It has lot of adjustments for a variety of fabric and stitch options. The nicest thing about the serger in my opinion is how thoughtful the accessories are for actual storage. The extended table stores all the feet, tools, pedal, DVD and instructions (although the later has to be folded to fit). There are no loose pieces to float around and get lost.Right now, I feel that it definitely worth the investment in time and money to get going. I'll have to use it a bit more to see if there's any gotchas that I'm missing, but so far it feels like a winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS27J0ZL5CXU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UI6UOTI#wasThisHelpful","RS27J0ZL5CXU5","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The GoodThis pizza oven really is very well suited for cooking thinner pizzas a little faster and more golden than other options. The 600+ degrees is hotter than most ovens and gets you closer to a pizzeria style finish. The marketing on the box mostly talks about frozen pizzas, but honestly I don't think I would spend this much money to cook a marginal pizza a minute or two faster. I think a better target audience would be for amateur foodies who want to make pizzas and could use it as a poor mans salamander broiler. It does a great job at cooking thin things very fast and crispy, as long as you're careful not to burn your food.The BadThe curved top keeps you from using the top as extra counter space. I know it's expected to get hot, but even it could have had a cooling rack top for you to cool down/keep semi-warm your finished pizza. The handle for the pizza tray attaches to the side, but the customer affixed plastic bolts don't seem that secure. The pizza tray isn't completely flat, which means you need to transfer your pizza before you can cut it.The UglyThe 5 settings are utterly ridiculous. They're labeled for the finished product (Bake, Frozen Snacks, Fresh/Frozen Pizza, Rising Crust Pizza, and Deep Dish)... In reality they are basically two setting 375 degrees and 600+ degrees (the Rising Crust setting claims to be of a lower intensity 600+). If you lose the little pamphlet you will not know what the temperature settings are. These ""dumb"" labels also don't have timing guide on them so you will likely have to keep a constant eye on it. Which is true even if you do know the appropriate time since the timer is not precise enough to rely on.In UseIt cooked a regular frozen pizza very well. Fast and golden, just as if it was made for this machine. For the rising crust pizza it cooked it to a golden burn the roof of you mouth done-ness, but to me it seem the crust wasn't given quite enough time to fully rise in the accelerated cooking time. For other frozen snacks, it worked okay if you kept your eye on them, but often times that wasn't enough. For example, the potato skins need to come out since they were getting carbonized, but the middle of the potato was still pretty cool and mostly ruined the experience. So overall this machine doesn't work so well in traditional baking, but it does excel for high heat applications, but it's a little pricey if your only application is frozen pizzas.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4V6XU3O95CVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2OZM66#wasThisHelpful","R4V6XU3O95CVB","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A word of warning, this book is written in Pig (it is a Pig's diary after all). If you are not fluent in Pig, and only speak Farmer or perhaps another dialects of Human, you should still be able to read it, but the grammar will seem off and you might find some words don't translate as well. You will also find that the plot is absurd and story points unrealistic.BUT, if you enjoy a good story with likable yet flawed characters, that moves in at a reasonable pace, and has both intrigue and adventure then this is the book for you. It's perfect for the early chapter book reader since it isn't too flowery with prose and the words are all easily decode-able (even when they are intentionally misspelled). Each character's name is written in a different font so it's easy to identify them as you go along (similar to pictographs). My 2nd grade daughter read it easily and found the story amusing, and I finished it in 2 or 3 sittings and enjoyed the story.

"This exfoliating soap is very close to perfect. The off white appearance with little bits of natural scrubby husks is very appealing to the eye. In the hand, the over-sized bar starts off a little too large for its sharp corners, but after a shower or two the bars fits well in your hand and feels great for longer than other soaps. The soap doesn't leave any funky residue and the exfoliating texture feels good. The only thing that I wish was different was the scent. It's unmistakably based off of the original Irish Spring scent, which smells clean, spicy and sporty. This isn't bad, but it doesn't match the look of the bar and makes it smell a little less ""mature"". I think I would have preferred a more neutral (like Lever 2000 or Ivory) or an earthy natural scent like Shea butter or sandalwood, but you get used to the scent pretty quickly and it's not so strong that it sticks to you.

"The chocolate cream filling is very similar to what you'd find in Pirouline or Pirouette rolled wafers, while the outer shell is much more like a Pocky sticks or other short bread style biscuits. Overall, I found them to be very satisfying, with the box being much more portable that the tins that rolled wafers come in. If you were to binge on an entire box without sharing you'd still be under 300 calories, well within normal ""candy bar"" limits. But the box is easy to share and should make for a fun responsible snack. Like others, I did have some broken pieces, but that's pretty much par for the course with any fragile filled snack shipped via UPS. For the most part however, I had a lot more full sticks than broken one and the broken pieces didn't take away from the experience since unlike traditional Pocky's there aren't any ""handles"" since they're filled end to end with delicious chocolate.In short, they're a nice snack and I'll be getting these again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D70UIXOOMT2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJCKI0G#wasThisHelpful","R1D70UIXOOMT2J","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This flat iron heats up a lot faster and maintained its temperature much better than her old one.  The cord is about 5' long and was workable from either sink plugged into our counter level outlets. She found it to be comfortable to use and didn't cause any noticeable frustrations. I could only ooh and ahh over the results which made her hair much smoother and shiner to the appearance.

"SHORT REVIEW: I received a review set and loved them (clean light, low power and good presentation) so much I bought more.LONG REVIEW:It's been a long road getting decent light in my loft. The room has multiple recessed outlets, but not enough power to supply all those 65 watt bulbs, a computer, TV, plus the surge from a vacuum cleaner all at once. To fix this I moved over to CFLs, but the colors were awful, some took time to warm up and when they did... they were often too bright, and worst of all they didn't last nearly as long as they should. I'm pretty sure their short life was due to mild power drops that wore on their circuitry, so even though I don't have dimmers in that room, I am happy that these are dimmable so that they are prepared to handle partial power drops. I'll try to remember to update this review when they do fail, but according to the estimates that may be in over 20 years ;). I found that these turn on very quickly, very near instantaneous, other LED bulbs I have take a tenth of a second till they illuminate, which is fast enough, but occasionally it make my second guess itself. There's no noticeable change in brightness once they're on either, very consistent. The power draw is now a fraction of a single bulb now and power is no longer a concern in that room. The odd shaped body is not noticeable once it's installed and the finished look is very nice and I think as good ,if not better than, the old incandescent flood lights. I'm sure if you were to put it somewhere else you would be an eyesore, but any other style of light would equally look odd in my ceiling.Overall, I highly recommend them for it's purpose in recessed lighting.PROS:+ Fast on+ Low power+ Finished look+ Consistent light+ Dimmable (which hopefully means long life with power irregularities)+ Reasonable price (especially when compared to other LEDs)CONS:- None (other that it might not look good for purposes other than it was designed for)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKJV9N9XW1BIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RCMLRGU#wasThisHelpful","RKJV9N9XW1BIO","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So the cable I got was more paler yellow than the cable shown in the photo. Which could be a bit of a bummer if you were expected a bright yellow cable. It's more of a pale yellow. This minor cosmetic issue is the only reason I dinged it a star.On the other hand, it's been serving it's purpose well. I use it to charge a phone plugged into a high amp USB wall adapter that is near the floor. The 6' length is ideal for this use. I also wanted my charging cable to stand out from all the other black USB cables on my desk, since they are plugged into data usb ports that don't charge as fast. I did plug it into a PC to make sure data transfer worked and everything seemed in order, although I will only use it as a charging cable because of it's standout (if not accurate) color.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2361JTQUNDK2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4SINK4#wasThisHelpful","R2361JTQUNDK2Y","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fully extended the cable is roughly the length of my arm. This length does limit the usefulness of it to car use, laptops and table top plugs. It is not really long enough to plug into a wall outlet that's a few feet from the nearest surface. But this is obviously best suited for travel, given that it's retractable which prevents tangles and reduces it's overall size, so it's plenty long enough most of the time.The cable performed well, it charged the phone in the same time as the Apple cable did plugged into the same adapter. The rubber shielding on the wire feels very robust and I'm not too worried about wear and tear breakage, but only time will tell. Finally the price is pretty good for lightning cable from a name brand. I've been bitten too many times from off brand cables that stop working with an new iOS update.

"From the synopsis I was really looking forward to it. It sounded like a cross between ""The art of manliness"", infographics, quick start guides to life's many joys and hobbies that may push you toward travel, but not necessarily. And while there are a few pages that get close to this promise or nods in it's general direction, the bulk of the book is a top 5 location list for X type of experience. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just generally not very useful. Sure the suggestion that you should splurge on a meal well beyond your means just for the experience is intriguing, but a list of 5 restaurants throughout the entire world is both limited and mostly unhelpful. I'd much rather have a quick guide to the types of dining experiences there are and how one is to conduct themselves. There are other things like types of entertainment, food, drink, learning, and life experiences that are perhaps worth pursuing, but again it almost never pushes you to how, but always to the where. And since there are so many ""wheres"" (about 5 per page spread), it is almost always just a small caption and not a travel guide, just a small travel tip at best.Now that doesn't mean it isn't a good gift book. It would make an ideal graduation gift for someone relatively under experienced in life, but has wanderlust in them. It makes a good impression in that it weights nearly 4 pounds and is gorgeously illustrated with photos on nearly every other page (making my argument of more fluff and less substance). Overall it does have a lot of ideas in it and a lot of places to visit which could stoke the imagination of someone who is just starting out and has the freedom (and hopefully the means) to travel. I just wish it was more informative and lived up to it lofty yet admirable premise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N74TZC94G19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743601646#wasThisHelpful","R2N74TZC94G19","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this car mount in theory, but it doesn't quite work well for me. Here's why. When the metal mounting plate/sticker is in the center of my phone (A Nexus 5) my NFC connectivity is seriously diminished, and when I add my case it's non-existent. I can mount the metal plate off center, but then the phone doesn't stay steady for the whole drive and can not me rotated. My car dash is excessively curved and textured, so I can't mount the suction cup anywhere on it, even with the smooth disk. On the windshield however it mounts fantastically, and even though I think the twist is a little difficult, it works really well. But once mounted I can only tilt in one direction (typically up and down). This works well enough unless you get a strong light reflection on your device, in which case a left/right swivel would've been a really nice feature.Okay so those are my specific grumblings... Keep in mind this is still a gorgeous and simple way to mount your phone in your car. If you don't use NFC, or if your NFC radios are in the top of your phone, you'll be fine. If your dash has even a rough but flat surface, you'll be fine. If you need to take your mount from car to airplane to rental car, it's ideally portable. If you have two phones, you're in luck, they provide two mounting plates. And once installed it's a joy just to stick your phone on and then just as easily pull it off when you arrive. If this is you, consider this a 5 star review. I felt I needed to point out the potential flaws for those in my situation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYRCDFZMLVNBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNU9L1Q#wasThisHelpful","RYRCDFZMLVNBC","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 5 year old son, runs this on a first generation LeapFrog Tablet. And compared to previous Leap Frog games, this one looks much more modern. The basic game and quiz mechanics are roughly the same, and fortunately they're still interesting enough to keep his attention. There are a lot of facts in the game covering both plants and animals. I was surprised to find him trying to repeat some of the flower facts that were for plants that had long complicated names.Unlike the math and reading skill games that both build foundation and are easy to match to a curriculum this one doesn't really teach how to ""do"" science. But it does cover a lot facts, that are mostly of the memorization type. But I do think with enough exposure something is bound to stick and form into a real abstract understanding of the rainforest.Overall, if you have a rainforest curious student, or if they're covering it in their curriculum then this is a great game.

"This bluetooth speaker is slightly bigger and a bit lighter than a hockey puck. It's easy to toss into any bag, and even comes with it's own little carry bag. It's much louder than the speaker built-in to your phone, and is works well for sharing sound in busy small room or a quite large one. The sound quality is good, not as great and full as the larger Amazon BT speakers or your car speakers, but it's better than you'd expect for a speaker this size. The main feature besides the low price for this is it's portability and its ease of sharing sound. Besides being simple to pair, it also includes an aux in jack, although it doesn't include an aux cable in the box. The battery lasts longer than my listening needs, and it easily charges via an included USB cable (micro to A). It doesn't come with a wall plug, so you'll either have to use your PC or your phone's charging port.PROS:+ Small and light+ Long lasting rechargeable battery+ Easy pairing+ Sound quality to size ratio is goodCONS:- Doesn't include a wall adapter or aux cable- Not rich enough sound to serve as you main speaker- Doesn't have NFC, although pairing is easy enough without it","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QFHCXND4K6JN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLJ55XG#wasThisHelpful","R2QFHCXND4K6JN","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is comprehensive. You won't find a lot of maxims that will try to convince you to run or encourage you. What you will find is a lot of sound training advice that is soundly targeted at those who already take running seriously. While there are small segments that are there to get the beginner started, the bulk of book is built around those running around 20 miles+ a week. I currently run about 15/wk, but find the advice and plans close enough for me to get a lot of value out of it. Overall, I can see myself opening this book a lot into the future. There are a lot plans that are based on good science and lots of experience. Hopefully it will help to keep me running strong well into my older years.PROS:+ A serious training manual that continuously takes into account the needs of an older (30+) runner+ Handicaps success measurement by age so you can always improve against you're #1 rival... yourself.+ Covers aging, form, stretching, recovery, speed, strength, hydration, nutrition, and plans for events ranging from 1 to 26.2 miles.+ A lot of graphs, charts, formulas, and online references.CONS:- This is not targeted to the couch to 5k bucket list type.- The bulk of the advice is based on those who have already built a 20 mile training base. That's a lot. I wish they had some tailored options for those who choose not to commit that much time to training, but still want to compete casually in longer events. I suppose that's more of Jeff Galloway's thing, but it would be nice to have a nod to this demographic.- While it mentions shorted track events and most of the training is geared towards distance running of greater than a mile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D4TOFBUKZO3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1450459722#wasThisHelpful","R2D4TOFBUKZO3A","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as the story goes it's an irreverent retelling and commentary on Little Red Riding Hood. Since our household likes other fractured tales including The Stinky Cheeseman, and Dumb Bunnies I was pretty certain that my kids 5 & 7 would like it. And indeed they did, laughing at a good number of the inane bits. The main observations by the characters are obvious but well noted. Namely, ""why do villains not strike earlier when they have the chance?"", and that ""fairy tales are often disturbing/gruesome if you think about it"". There are also a few other jokes and aware observer comments that round out the book.If you hate absurdity, you're better off passing on it.

"I found the Cafejo Sumatra Dark Roast to be smooth and rich, yet with a hint of lime. Most other K Cups I've used don't have enough flavor to support the large cup setting, and taste watered down.

I was surprised to find that he could identify each of the characters that the car was supposed to represent (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Hulk) other than Hawkeye. So I know the power of peer influence at school is working, as far as superheros is concerned anyways. I do wonder if the Venom car was included as pictured in the product photo (instead of Hawkeye) whether or not he would have known them all. As for the cars themselves. All of them were standard style Hot Wheels with plastic undercarriages and small wheels with the exceptions being... Iron Man which had a chrome bottom and the Hulk had monster sized wheels, both of which are both very appropriate.

"The little glitter globes are cute and my daughter adored them once they were completed, and easily made them herself. That joy and overall look of the mini globe is what earns this item 3 stars. A better kit could have earned 4 stars easily.The first disappointment with this kit comes when you realize that the box shows a lot more globes and figures than what comes in the set. It's because this set is supposed to be a display stand for other sets. Unfortunately it's not really that nice. It assembles slightly crooked, is bigger than it needs to be, and just has a cheap feel to it. This set comes with 3 princesses and 3 animal friends. These 6 figures fit into 3 small globes and 1 large globe that holds three of them on thones. These figures are tiny, about the size of mini squinkies (full size squinkies are twice as big), but when in the mini globe they appear much bigger. Once you are done building them however... The fun part is over. The glitter took much longer than the 10 minutes it said it would to dissolve and the only thing this kit lets you do from there is display them on the castle that has one awkward turnstile and some stands, but is overall boring. It would have been nice if there was some accessory supplied that let you take a mini-globe with you like in the jewelry Glitzi Globe sets.Overall, my opinion is that the Glitzi Globe concept overall isn't bad. It's relatively mess free glitter, princesses, snow globes, and crafts... a real win. However, this set is too little of that and too much in pointless plastic at pretty high premium. I'd recommend starting with a smaller set, and ideally one that lets you carry your little globes with you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8FZ6M1RC3KFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVWCKGO#wasThisHelpful","R8FZ6M1RC3KFN","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used a lot of different brand cards in my many SD and CF consuming devices, but for my serious work I always load in either a higher end SanDisk or Lexar card. The Exteme SanDisk line is usually the best value, giving high-end performance specs like higher-shock and wider-temperature (including subzero) tolerances, while not charging though the roof for the absolute latest cutting edge (often un-adopted) speeds that the Extreme Pros have.Even though I'm not recording 4k yet, the U3 spec indicates it's ready for it whenever I do. I am however seeing fair performance increase over my Lexar 400x card with still photography now. The buffer for RAW images on my a99 still fills up after 11 shots with both cards, but with the Lexar it took just shy of 9 seconds to clear the buffer and with this card it cleared the buffer in only 5 seconds. A fairly significant increase that under normal short bursts and releases should keep burst mode slowdowns away most of the time.Of course if your browsing cards and you want the fastest/biggest card regardless of cost, you should also consider the 95 MB/s Extreme Pro although the current version is not U3 rated, so you may actually be better off with this card if you're looking to record 4k video. One other nicety that comes with the higher end cards is that is comes with an image recovery software recovery license.

On glass they clean great even without a cleanser and of course they work well to clean up other hard surfaces or spills. The only thing about these that is a little off-putting was that the cloth texture wanted to cling to anything else with a texture. So coming out of the laundry they would hug other articles and had to be peeled off, and it also felt like it just barely wanted to grip onto any roughness on my hands.

"First the bad news. Like most of the other reviewers, I found the book to suffer from trying too hard to convince you of the importance of sound, but then actually coming across as insulting to its target audience (non-sound people) by telling them that sound is preeminent. I'm a visual person and my memory is quickest jogged by scents, and while sounds do impact me I usually mute as many sounds as possible. So no matter how much the author's zeal is (and it's great that he's passionate about his craft), the first 3 chapters are a bit repetitive in making roughly the same argument (lots of noise that get filtered, the right authentic sounds can break through and reinforce experience, etc). The anecdotes are interesting enough on their own, but get dry strung together like they are. The scientific reasoning for sound was subjective at best, reaction speed does not necessarily correlate with cognition and I'd argue that I make much more sense of the world lacking hearing than I would lacking vision. The only strong stance that I agree with him on is that bad (including wrong or inauthentic) sound makes things worse than none at all.The next portion of the book is great for someone looking into hiring or managing sound engineers, sonic branders, etc. It reads a lot like an executive summary on the subject. I wish this section came in a lot quicker. It's spaced out in headings so it's easy to skim/refresh yourself on the material. It doesn't give you the tools to create great sonic moments, but it does help you look for the right stuff and at least pushes you down the right path. After that, there's a little bit of commonsense type advise in using and noticing sound in your own life.The final chapter of the book however is where I wish he spent 3 or more chapters. The idea of using sound to communicate data or information was great. But if he then and tied it back to the scientific argument that sound received is faster. Couldn't he set up an experiment where people who react to onscreen data would be feed audible cues at the same time and see if over time they could react faster or more accurately than those in a control group?  That would be great information. And the subsection on sound feedback for user interfaces would be welcomed to be expanded out a chapter or two. He laments that tech people throw needless bells and whistles in, but on the other hand he points out how frustrating machines are that don't provide feedback. What are the best practices? When should sound be avoided and or added? Does sound work better or worse with accompanying feedback types like vibration or visual effects? Are some sounds naturally disingenuous with these other effects? Those last things and so much more I'd love to know about.So even though it's be easy to go along with the vast number of 3 star reviews, mostly I suspect because the first few chapters were tedious to get through (mostly because I was audibly disagreeing with him, and surprised he didn't point out that Chili's uses a ""sizzle sauce"" to create that table-side sound). But middle chapters were useful and that last chapter really got me thinking, so I'm upping my review a star.

The cards are photos so reading skills aren't required, a few symbols may have names that to be learned by the youngest of players (exclamation point, music note, etc), but with just a little bit of practice even a 3 or 4 year old could play this game with few handicaps or adjustments to the rules.Since each card in the 55 card deck matches every other card (but only with one image that matches), you don't have to worry about lost cards. The game is equally playable with half the deck as it is with a full one, if you want a faster game. The algorithm to make this happen is quite impressive and even when someone says they don't have any matches... it's fun to prove that their card actually does have a match, even if it is hard to find.We played a few of the rule variants and they ranged from medium paced giggly fun to all out rabid fast paced action, so no matter your style there's likely a rule variation that will suit you.The only con that I can think of is that their isn't a lot of strategy involved, but it more than makes up for it in speed, perception and fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FQCCB0AS0PAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039S7NO6#wasThisHelpful","R1FQCCB0AS0PAM","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These screen protectors did eventually install nicely, and they reduced glare (although not completely), so if they're priced right and you have your own microfiber cloth and hard edge/squeegee they may be worth a go.However serviceable they were however, I wasn't completely thrilled with set. This kit doesn't include a microfiber cloth, a debris sticker, or a squeegee. So I was hoping that it would go onto a clean screen easier than most protectors. I was wrong. As soon as I removed the protective backing from the side that contacts with the glass, it was like activating a static vacuum. I had several attempts at getting a micro-debris/bubble-less installation, and it wasn't until I had used accessories from another kit that I got it to install cleanly. It did align itself fairly easily and the cuts matched precisely with the sensors, camera, speaker, and home buttons, so there were no abrupt edges for your finger to brush up against, so that was nice.It might be important to note that texture is less glass like than other protectors, and more akin to a soft plastic (probably a result of it's anti-glare properties). It's not unpleasant and it hasn't caused any detriment to using the touch screen, but it may bother or delight some.PROS:+ Precise cuts+ Reduced glareCONS:- No (practically required) installation accessoriesPRO/CON:> The glare reduction will not allow remove reflections of a light source, so while it's easier to view in bright conditions it won't make it a beach reading device. The glare reduction will very mildly reduce the vibrancy of the display as well.> The texture is different than glass, so if you have texture sensitivities then you may hate it. For me it makes the screen ""feel"" cheaper, but doesn't cause any grief beyond that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJB4U0NXHUAFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQT0Q0E#wasThisHelpful","RJB4U0NXHUAFO","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since Mr. Sketch released the commercial with the little blueberry tooting, they have been elevated to the front my family's imaginations and we raced out to get the standard set. Being well pleased with the standard scents and colors I looked forward to getting to try out this new collection of scents and colors.The colors included were either earth tones (an Earthy Orange, Brown, and ""The most gorgeous deep grayish brown ever"" Brown) or florescent (Yellow, Pink, and a radiant Blue). If you already have a set of the standard colors, you won't get anything too new, although I found the ""Mint Chocolate"" Brown and the ""Blue Slushie"" to be very pleasing to look at. If this is your only set of markers, you'll definitely miss not having any shade of green or black. All the markers left good solid marks on the paper.The main attraction of course are the scents of each marker. None of the markers are labeled with their scent names, so if they ever get separated from their package or mixed with other Mr. Sketch markers, then they have to stand on their smells alone. The standout hits, and sure to never be mistaken, were Buttered Popcorn (it smells like the Jelly Belly beans taste like) and the Blue Slushie. The rest, except one, all smelled good and true to form. Most people I blind tested them on could either tell what they were supposed to be or immediately ""got it"" once they were told. The one exception was the Nacho Cheese... It was more like a spicy stinky old cheese with a hint of stale chips. If they were going for day old bowling alley nachos, they hit the nail on the head. This is the one scent that is more of a dare than a treat, but fun all the same.Overall, it a fun extra scents and colors. It would be nice if they had added a ""gum drop"" or ""lime slushie"" green and the standard licorice black, but I'm very happy with the pack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ89VOLB830W8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDNL4N6#wasThisHelpful","RJ89VOLB830W8","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I unfortunately broke my screen before I applied a case or protector to it, but I needed a safe way to operate it in the interim so I picked up this pack. It includes 3 protectors so I can use one now to protect my fingers and one later after the screen gets repaired and still have a replacement if that one gets scratched. Even over the broken glass it installed easily and only bubbled where there were chips present, and the operation was smooth to swipe on and clear to view through. I'm sure the final installation will be perfect since they also include microfiber cloth to clean the glass, a sticky thing to pick up fine debris, and squeegee card to work out any bubbles. It's really a great kit for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNLP5WJB98LLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GH5S1NK#wasThisHelpful","RNLP5WJB98LLP","AWH2AY17ZU7W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWH2AY17ZU7W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow.  David Wong burst onto the scene with the trippy, self-aware horror-comedy John Dies at the End.  I loved that book, even though it was rough around the edges.  I never did pick up the second book (an error I'm remedying right now), so I jumped right into Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits.  What a difference.  Wong has grown exceedingly well as an author.  This novel was hard to put down.Zoey Ashe, a rather poor person living in a trailer park, is suddenly thrust into a completely different world of eccentric billionaires and fame.  Her estranged father was a billionaire himself and left all of his fortune to Zoey when he passed.  Unfortunately, that's not really a good thing as she now has super-powered bad guys out for her blood and a giant payday.  The novel zips by in a flurry as she's forced to deal with a variety of evil people all wanting to do bodily harm to her.  Wong populates Fancy Suits with a number of fun, larger-than-life characters and finds a good protagonist is the snarky Zoey.It's not world-changing, but it is very fast paced and unputdownable.  Fans of Wong's previous novels will find much to love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XS60U3IIH2RZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250040191#wasThisHelpful","R1XS60U3IIH2RZ","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own the original version of the Pathfinder Adventure Card game and have had a lot of fun, both in groups and solo, playing through it.  What I enjoy about these types of games is the deck-building aspect, where as you go on adventures, your deck becomes stronger and you see progression not usually seen in card games.  It does a great job of mimicking the Pathfinder RPG experience.  Rise of the Runelord is still my favorite, however.  I feel like the progression and the characters are more interesting.If you're playing in a group, Wrath does a great job.  Firstly, the directions are expanded and easier to follow.  It offers a lot more options and has a few wrinkles that Runelords didn't have.  But I'll tell you this; it's much harder.  In particular, playing solo is rather difficult.  It was hard enough in Runelords, but here it feels like you have to pick the right character in order to progress.  I've had a lot of fun, though, in a group with both games.  Fans of Runelords, I'd recommend checking this one out if you've worn out your previous adventures.  Newcomers, while the rules are streamlined and easier to follow, I'd personally start with Runelords.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PVC6C7AND0AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601257457#wasThisHelpful","R3PVC6C7AND0AC","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So this product is lighter than I expected, but it's still very bulky.  The nice thing is that it works a lot more easily on stairs than a traditional vacuum cleaner and it cleans well.  Comparing it to a Dyson, I still prefer my Dyson simply because if you have a smaller space to clean, it has virtually no setup.  Whereas this particular vacuum would work better for larger spaces simply from a time investment.  It takes a bit to assemble and it kind of takes up a lot of room.  If you're looking for a backpack vacuum, this is a great choice.

"The Unnoticeables grabbed my attention from the first page with this short and succinct bit of ridiculousness:  ""I met my guardian angel today.  She shot me in the face.""I wish the rest of the book lived up to that statement.  I'm conflicted about The Unnoticeables, which was written by Robert Brockway.  Robert Brockway is a coworker of David Wong (who helpfully supplied a quote for the book).  David Wong, you might know/remember, wrote John Dies at the End.  I bring this up because it feels like The Unnoticeables could be in the same universe as John Dies at the End.  Unfortunately, I just think there are some glaring problems that kept pulling me out of enjoying the story he was telling.But I'm getting ahead of myself.  The Unnoticeables deals with two characters in two different time periods.  Carey is a punk from the 1970s, whose punk friends are vanishing because of Tar Men...literal people made out of tar.  There are also the titular Unnoticeables, people who work in conjunction with this tar fiends, who are...well, unnoticeable.  You'll see them, but when they're out of view you won't be able remember many discerning characteristics.  Meanwhile, in 2013, Kaitlyn is a stunt woman looking for work in a Hollywood that values ""networking"" over the actual ability to do the job.  She's struggling to get by.  Her friend Jackie invites her to a big Hollywood party so she can rub elbows with the high and mighty and against her better judgment, Katilyn agrees.  There, she meets a washed up teen heartthrob who played J.C. Sable (i.e., J.C. Slater) on a Saved by the Bell-esqe TV show.  He then tries to eat her, basically.  He's one of the Unnoticeables.  So now we have two time periods, where crazy stuff is happening and both of our protagonists have to save the world.The Unnoticeables switches back and forth between the 1977 and 2013 and you're just waiting for everything to come together.  Unfortunately, while the story hooked me, there were so many issues that popped up that pulled me back.  For one, I couldn't stand Carey.  He is a sexist and annoying character that every time he opened his mouth, I wanted to skip ahead.  Brockway tries to apologize for his behavior by making Carey say, at one point, something to the effect of ""yeah I'm a jerk, but it's how I live.  So, *shrug*"" By giving his character an apologetic out, he completely allows Carey to say or do anything, because, you know, circumstance.  I don't have a problem with unlikeable characters.  If done right, they can be incredibly involving (like, say, Libby Day in Dark Places).  But Carey just annoyed me.  I guess he was supposed to be funny, but I hardly laughed once I got a few chapters into the book.Unfortunately, I also didn't think the book tied up as well as I was hoping.  As the two time periods race toward their respective climaxes, I lost sight of what was really happening and by the end I didn't really care.  I enjoyed Brockway's writing style.  I just was disappointed with the book as a whole; which is unfortunate.  I really enjoyed David Wong's first two books so I was hoping that another Cracked.com writer would be equally as interesting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N09UV98H41MV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076537966X#wasThisHelpful","R3N09UV98H41MV","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't ever used an OtterBox case for any of my mobile devices.  I'm really bad, actually, at buying cases for my iPads and iPhones.  So, when given the opportunity to try this OtterBox iPad Air 2 Symmetry case, I had to jump on it.  I love it so much, I've ordered an OtterBox case for my phone.This review is really simply.  This case is excellent.  I absolutely love the minimalistic design.  It's a very solid fit for the iPad Air 2.  The clasps are magnetic and seal perfectly, giving the device a lean and clean look.  Like other origami cases, this one can unfold to create a stand for your iPad.  The back of the stand even has a circular device, so you can change the direction of your iPad and have it stand up vertical instead of horizontal.  It looks and feels fantastic.  But just a caveat; if you have an iPad Air 1, this won't work for your device.  I tried it on mine and it wouldn't quite fit.

"The amount of PS4 headsets has been relatively scarce until the last six months.  All of a sudden, they seem to be coming out of the woodwork.  But, for the longest time, it seemed like the only decent headset you could get was the Sony-branded wired and wireless headset.  For the last six months, I've been using the Sony Gold Wireless headset and, with a few notable complaints, have enjoyed it.  I'm always looking for a better headset, though, so when I was offered to try this SteelSeries PS4 headset, I couldn't refuse.I've written more than a few headset reviews.  I tend to break them down into the following categories: Sound quality, mic quality, comfort and durability.  For this particular review, because there's not a whole lot of *good* competition for PS4 headsets, I'll also compare my experience to the Sony Wireless headset, as well.Sound QualityI was surprised with how good the sound is with this headset.  I haven't had much experience with Siberia headsets.  I've mainly dabbled in Logitech, Plantronics, Corsair and Razer.  This headset has good depth of sound.  The bass is booming, but it's not overpowering.  Hearing voices is not a problem (I tried with a couple games and movies) and they all have a good timbre to them.  It doesn't mimic surround sound, like a lot of headsets try to do.  It's simply stereo, but the sound that's here is really nice.Mic QualityThis one is a bit trickier to test.  But I've used it in party chats and everyone can hear me fine.  It also does a pretty good job of not picking up other noises in the room, which my friends appreciate.  One nice feature that's reminiscent of my Razer headset is that the mic is retractable.  So if I'm simply using the headset, I don't have an annoying mic in my face.ComfortSiberia has taken a page from my absolute favorite (from a comfort perspective) headset: The Plantronics 770.  That headset was easily the most comfortable headset I have ever worn.  And the design here is virtually the same.  By not having a true heavy top, the headset doesn't press down on your skull.  Some headsets (the Sony Gold Wireless included) can sometimes feel like vice grips.  This feels as close to not wearing a headset as possible.  It's incredibly comfy and this is the biggest selling point for this.DurabilityThis headset feels very firm and sturdy.  It feels well-made and expensive.  Compared to the Sony headset, this one feels much sturdier.  I'm always afraid the ear cups of the Sony model are going to break off.  They feel a little wobbly.  This headset feels very secure and I'm not afraid of breaking it.Overall, I do prefer this headset to the Sony one, mostly because of the comfort and durability.  That said, I have two complaints.  The first is that it's wired, so it has to plug into your controller.  This is both a benefit and a hindrance.  The wire sometimes gets in my way and I have to walk around with the controller, or have it near me if I'm watching a movie.  But, on the flip side, you don't have to charge it like you would a wireless headset.  So it's a trade-off, but honestly I personally prefer wireless headsets.  My other complaint is kind of major to me.  This headset is lacking a  volume control.  Since sound between movies, games, etc. can oftentimes be mixed differently, the sound can be quiet in one and super loud in another.  In order to change the sound on the PS4, you have to exit what you're doing, go to settings, devices, audio devices and then change the volume...but you're also doing this without the game/movie playing, so it can sometimes be a guessing game on whether something is too loud or too quiet.  I'm not sure if this is a complaint about the headset, the PS4 for both...but the Sony Gold Wireless headset does come with a volume control on the headset.In the end, it's kind of a draw between the two.  I think overall this headset nudges out the Sony due to the durability and comfort.  The sound quality is a toss-up, based on personal tastes.  Both sound really good, personally.  But the lack of sound control is a huge detriment, for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWGNFFYMEZ8H7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3P4RI#wasThisHelpful","RWGNFFYMEZ8H7","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was offered a chance to review this item, I kind of chuckled to myself at the novelty of it but thought, ""well, I do need a new spatula!""  And, truthfully, this Grillight LED Grilling Spatula is kind of a novelty item on the surface.  But, I have to admit it's a little more useful than I expected it to be.  Firstly, the spatula itself is incredibly well-made and worked great when I used it on my grill.  It has a nice heft to it.  The first time I used the spatula, I didn't use the flashlight part of it.  I kind of laughed about it with friends.  Then, about a week ago, I got home a little later from work but wanted to grill some burgers.  It was a getting darker outside and with the way my grill is positioned on my deck, what remained of the sun was behind the grill.  So, I tried the LED light portion of the spatula and it worked wonders.  I could see the color of the meat and the light was perfectly pointed so that I could see everything I was doing.  It worked wonderfully.So there you go.  If you do a lot of grilling at dusk/evening, then this is a good purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16H5XO9XXM5M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2DPTZW#wasThisHelpful","R16H5XO9XXM5M2","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When a book has been translated from another language, a lot of the story rests on the shoulders of the translator.  A translator can make or break a book.  Sometimes, they'll literally translate everything and the result can be clunky.  Sometimes, they'll put more time into the translation--maybe they're an author themselves, or want to be one--and the results can be fantastic.  I'm not sure if The Truth and Other Lies had a good translator or not, but the result is clunky.The author, Sascha Arango, is apparently a celebrated screenwriter in Germany.  You can kind of get that feeling, reading this novel, because like a good screenwriter, the focus is on plot.  There's very little in terms of set decoration or lengthy passages describing the characters or their environment.  Clocking in at under 260 pages, it is razor-focused on the plot.  As such, I never really got a feeling for most of the characters, who've been reduced to archetypes, for the most part.  You got the ever-suffering wife, who is always pleasant and wonderful.  The dying book publisher who just wants a final hit before he passes.  The beautiful mistress/assistant at the publishing house.  The nosey receptionist.  The shrewd detective.  All crime fiction caricatures.At the center of the novel is Henry Hayden, probably the most unlikeable protagonist I have encountered since Libby Day in Dark Places.  He's selfish, egotistical, cold and calculating.  He's cheating on his wife, but, worse, he's a world-famous and rich author who hasn't written a piece of fiction, ever.  His wife is the writer.  But since she's the aforementioned Mary Sue, she doesn't want credit for the work and so our cold and calculating protagonist says all of the books are his.  Unfortunately, the mistress gets pregnant.  Henry decides to take matters into his own hands...and, well, causes a chain of reactions that push the story forward.  From this point on, Henry tries to stay one or two steps ahead of the police and the truth.I have to admit, the story kept me interested throughout most of the slim book.  Even though I absolutely hated the main character and found the writing to be unwieldy, I wanted to know how it would end.  Unfortunately, I also found myself re-reading passages because either the author or the translator was absolutely terrible at writing transitions.  The story would just make unnecessarily abrupt changes where you're not exactly sure what happened.  It did not have the flow that other great crime stories should.  It stuttered along.I did enjoy it, for the most part.  But I was hoping for something a bit better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX69O22NXH06K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147679555X#wasThisHelpful","RX69O22NXH06K","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While watching It Follows, the one thought that kept popping in my head was A Nightmare on Elm Street.  Not that the villain in It Follows reminded me of Fred Krueger.  Or that the plot was similar in any coherent way.  But the feeling the movie gave me.  That on-the-edge-of-your-seat feeling that you're watching something special and that you're not quite sure what's real and what's not.  While Elm Street movies started making the line between dream and reality very specific, the first A Nightmare on Elm Street made the waking life and dreaming life feel incredibly similar.  It kept you on your feet and added a feeling of surreality to the story.It Follows keeps that surreal feeling throughout.  Writer/Director David Mitchell creates a location that seems to be timeless.  And I mean that quite literally.  It's impossible to really nail down the time the movie is set...or if it's even truly set in our world.  On the outside, it looks like a typical American town.  But the small details offset this feeling.  One of the teens reads an e-book on a clam-shell e-reader.  But the teens watch old movies on an old-school CRT television.  The town itself has an 80s vibe to it, but there's aspects of it that feel out of place or vaguely futuristic.  It's also filmed in a kind of lackadaisical manner that adds to the dream-like quality.  Then, there's the score itself.  What a surprise it was.  It apes the techno musicality of 80s movies, but gives it a harsher edge.  As a lover of 80s horror and, in particular, A Nightmare on Elm Street, It Follows really struck a chord with me.Other horror movies were obviously an inspiration for David Mitchell, as well.  The villain in the movie slowly and assuredly stalks the teenagers, moving like so many slow-footed monsters from 70s/80s horror.  The idea behind the film, that of sex passing on some unstoppable demon that you are then forced to pass on, is reminiscent of The Ring.  But Mitchell never rips-off these ideas.  He uses them to create a wholly original concept.  The idea that this demon or monster can take any form, but is slowly walking straight for you is creepy and intense.  It's used to great effect in a lot of scenes, where the camera will pan and the viewer is instantly looking to see if someone is walking toward the victims or if it's just a casual passerby.It's an absolute gem of a horror film.  One I definitely recommend to any horror fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R187WZD8VEUW0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVXMYU4#wasThisHelpful","R187WZD8VEUW0F","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like some reviewers, I'm finding this novel a bit difficult to review.  I absolutely hated the way it began.  I understand that a novel has to begin somewhere, but the whole discussion/divorce/etc setup took forever for me to get through.  It was so poorly written and just pedantic for me.  But once all of the fluff got thrown aside and we actually got to the house, things picked up considerably for me.  In between the current story, we have some flashbacks to the charismatic cult leader that ties into the mystery/ghost story.  It's a little Charles Manson mixed with a ghost story.The actual ghost story is pretty decent, if not revelatory.  It's nothing too exciting or thrilling, but the mystery had enough of an edge to keep me reading in order to figure out how it'd play out.  Honestly, I have been trying to figure out how to review this one and it's gotten to the point that I had to submit something.  So sorry for not the best review.  The book's decent but not fantastic.  3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWBZELSD6KHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476783748#wasThisHelpful","R1HWBZELSD6KHU","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly, I haven't had much luck with the memory foam pillows. As a side-sleeper, I find them to either be too thick/hard or too thin/soft.  So I was surprised when I tried this one and, when combined with another normal pillow, had just the right amount of firmness to be supportive of my neck.  I personally find the whole ""cool"" pillow fad a marketing speak thing.  This pillow never feels cooler than a normal pillow to me.  Nor have any of the cooling pillows I've tried.But for me, this is probably the best memory foam pillow I've used.

"When I make drinks, I don't mess around.  I have been a loyal customer of the Margaritaville machines for about five or six years, now.  I absolutely love those, the way they blend/shave the ice and the way they output a great margarita.  But, they are super expensive.  I don't think this model stands up to those models, but again, for the price, it probably wouldn't.The Black & Decker model comes with a variety of buttons that can auto-make whatever drink you want (margaritas, daiquiris, shakes, smoothies) and it comes with a little book of drink recipes that go beyond the typical daiquiris.  The motor works nicely and while some reviewers smelled a hot smell, I haven't run into that problem.I still think I'll rely on my Margaritaville machines, but for the price it's a really nice drink maker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1POXQF516J8MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHBD10K#wasThisHelpful","R1POXQF516J8MA","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fluxx is such a weird and fun little game.  I'm a huge board game lover.  There's nothing more fun than getting a group of people together to tackle some hardcore games like Pathfinder Card Game or Arkham Horror.  But not all of my friends want to spend hours at a time slogging through a complex game.  For them, I bring out Sushi Go! or something similar.  Fun, deceptively easy and quick.  That pretty much describes Fluxx.Fluxx is a game I never played until this version.  In the beginning, the rules are simple: Draw a card, play a card.  But in the deck are a variety of cards that change the game: New Rule, Action, Keeper and Goal.  New rule does just that, introduces a new rule to the game.  Action cards have you do one time things like steal cards or eliminate rules.  Goals redefine what it takes to win and keeper cards are used to meet goals.Basically, as the game continues, the gameplay keeps mutating based on what you play.  There's not as much strategy as in other games; in fact, part of the fun of Fluxx is the randomness that results.  So those individuals in your group who absolutely have to win or are super competitive will probably scream in rage sometimes.Overall, this is a fun, relatively quick game that I've used in between longer sessions.  I think people enjoy Sushi Go! a bit more for that, but I do get a laugh out of playing Fluxx and I'd recommend it to those looking for a lighter, fun game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UFHRMWMLEEP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OETKWCE#wasThisHelpful","R1UFHRMWMLEEP9","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When is a microwave not a microwave?  Apparently, when you're using this product.  I was surprised at just how flexible this particularly microwave was, when compared to the old microwave I've been using.This Samsung microwave is compact and stylish.  I love the stainless steel look of it.  It's a little more compact than my previous model.  But it works really well.  I find that it cooks my food a little hotter/quicker than my previous microwave.  The grilling unit is what surprised me.  It works pretty well.  Obviously, for a lot of things I'll rely on my gas grill.  But it's a really nice feature that reminds me of a toaster oven.I've never used a Samsung microwave (honestly, outside of a TV and a vacuum, I've never used Samsung period), but they made a really nice one here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FJ2ID9B879IZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXRHIO8#wasThisHelpful","R3FJ2ID9B879IZ","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't normally do reviews like this one.  When I review something, I want to review the content and the show.  Not the way it's presented here.  I normally get annoyed when I see others do it.  But I just have to warn people that this version (and I'm guessing US's digital in general) is edited.  I've seen the British version, which is why I bought this when it was finally available here.  So imagine my surprise and annoyance that it's edited.  I didn't watch a lot of it, but they use the blurring to censor parts of it.  It's really annoying.The show itself is excellent.  Very funny, well-written and well-acted.  It's a great show and I'd recommend it.

"You know the type of movie this is.  It's like Open Water in a forest.  Or Frozen (the Adam Green one, not the singing one), except good.  Or All is Lost, except with more dialogue and less water.  Backcountry is one of those survival movies, ostensibly ""based on a true story"" in that, I'm sure someone, somewhere went hiking and was mauled by a bear at one point in history.  It's man (and woman) against nature.  It's filmed with real life bears!  It features all sorts of horror movie clichs!  It has a stupid lead!  It's...actually pretty decent.Backcountry tells the story of boyfriend and girlfriend, Alex and Jenn, who decide to go hiking through a Canadian forest.  Jenn is a corporate lawyer from the city where this nature stuff is completely foreign.  Good thing she has her seasoned outdoorsman boyfriend along to show her the ropes.  Alex is the aforementioned seasoned outdoorsman boyfriend...who spurns taking a map, gets rid of cell phones and doesn't carry a compass...so, basically he's pretty smart and outdoorsy.  The dialogue in the beginning is full of foreshadowing, with lines like ""I don't need a map"" and ""You know the biggest thing we'll see out here is a chipmunk.""  The box art will tell you that last part, at least, is not true.  Then, while hiking, more alarming things happen.  Alex drops a canoe on his toe but stupidly--I mean, stubbornly--carries on.  At night, they meet a strange man who will be called Eric Balfour...partly because I couldn't remember if he even had a name until I went to IMDB (it's Brad, by the way); mostly because he's played by Eric Balfour.  With an Irish accent.  Creepy Eric creeps them out.  Then, of course, they get lost, wind up in bear territory and...well...you know.What sets Backcountry apart from a lot of the trash that gets dumped on VOD and other survival stories of the same ilk is threefold.  The acting is actually really good and the characters mostly react believably to the situation they find themselves in.  I mean, aside from the fact that Alex, who, again, is a seasoned outdoorsy guy, ignores everything everyone says and doesn't adequately prepare for hiking through a large Canadian forest.  Missy Peregrym, in particular, is perfect as Jenn and her transition from urban lawyer to forest survivor is well done.  Secondly, the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.  Backcountry doesn't look cheap.  It's beautifully shot. Finally, my biggest problem with these survival-type movies is that the protagonists are always rendered passive.  They're either trapped in the ocean, swimming in place; or, trapped on a ski lift, sitting in place.  Backcountry puts more emphasis on an active survival.  They're not trapped in their tent.  They're trapped in a giant forest.  So, while the movie might not have been the most intense movie I've seen and while I might have a few problems with the way the tension didn't ratchet up enough in the last half of the movie, there's enough positive here to elevate it slightly above average.  3.5 stars. Worth a rental.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JAX3Z9PDNTEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UYKXY54#wasThisHelpful","R1JAX3Z9PDNTEV","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hour of the Knife is probably my favorite module I've ever run. It's also the most problematic and time-intensive for the DM.  Taking its inspiration from Jack the Ripper, here we have Paridon (London + Paris), a Victorian-esqe city where a madman nicknamed Bloody Jack is stalking women.  The adventurers stumble into Paridon/Ravenloft through the ever-present mist and find themselves at the scene of the crime.  Turns out, this isn't the first time this has happened.  Every thirteen years, for six consecutive nights, this happens and has happened for 156 years.  Because the heroes have seen the killer's face and are stuck in the foggy Paridon, they must discover who is doing it and why...before it's too late! Dun dun DUN!I love Victorian England.  I love the ideas behind Jack the Ripper and the whole atmosphere popularized by that time period.  So, in that regard, Hour of the Knife is immediately high on my list.  But the way the adventure messes with the PCs and the way the story unfolds is bold and unlike anything I've played, especially at the lower levels (4-6) that this is made for.  The encounters are difficult and wildly different from most encounters I've run.  The enemies have a sense of self-preservation and use hit-and-run tactics to wear down the PCs.  As a mystery, the story unfolds twists and turns that will keep the players guessing as to who's doing it and why.  It's a very well-made adventure....with a few huge problems.The biggest problem is that the DM running this can't be a newbie.  There is a lot of prep work to really flesh out this adventure.  Most of the adventure is written around the six consecutive nights and their murders.  During the day, the adventurers should be gathering clues and getting insight into both Paridon and the murders.  Unfortunately, the adventure only gives a couple ""Encounters"" and a handful of characters who only really have an embellishment to the legends surrounding the cycle of murders.  It's going to be up to the DM to flesh out the encounters, add more and find out ways to tease the backstory to their players.  If a DM runs this straight from the book, it won't feel as if the players are active in the investigation.  You could run it as written, but the PCs will become passive, simply passing time until the next murder where, hopefully, a clue will appear.  And then when they get to the end of the adventure, they'll really not have any clue as to what was really going on.  So, to make the adventure live up to its potential, the DM is going to have to do a lot of work, fleshing out the characters and making them memorable/personable and putting little clues or red herrings in place so that the PCs can be more active in actually solving the Bloody Jack murders.That said, the reason I absolutely love this module is that there are moments where the PCs will turn on each other.  And with a good DM, you can really feed that paranoia and that deceit.  Players will die in this adventure, which is another thing that surprises, particularly at these levels.  And the enemy behind it is malicious and cunning. I don't want to spoil the conceit behind the enemies, but they really are perfect for this adventure.  The first part of the adventure is all about building suspense and paranoia, and if played correctly, it'll be intense.  The second part has a couple great encounters that really drive the tension to the climax.  One takes place in a house, where the heroes are being stalked by a solitary individual.  And then there's the climactic battle and chases where the PCs are severely underpowered by the events surrounding them.I'm actually currently running this module, heavily modified, right now for Pathfinder.  So that was another hiccup to work through, since AD&D and Pathfinder are vastly different rulesets, now.  But it's working really well and my players seem to be enjoying it.  I've run this module in various forms about three times now and it's always been memorable for the players.  I think because it's completely different from the usual dungeon crawls and combat-heavy encounters, it provides a neat little break.  I'd definitely recommend it for an experienced DM, who enjoys fleshing out scenarios and characters and wants to interject some paranoia and some good-old-fashion suspense in their campaign.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R306ENAVV04QXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1560768924#wasThisHelpful","R306ENAVV04QXI","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Pale Emperor roars to life from the very beginning, shoving nasty blues-tinged funk in our faces.  ""Killing Strangers"" is a slowed down song, moving at a slinky pace before building to full-on Marilyn guttural screams.  On one hand, it's a little surprising for an opener because it shows a lot more restraint than I would expect from The God of...well, you know.  But on the other, more pressing hand, I've always found that Manson's opening song sets the tone for what's to come.  Listening to ""Hey Cruel World"" or ""Great Big White World"" tells you exactly what you're going to expect from the rest of the CD.  In this regard, ""Killing Strangers"" is the perfect opener for the world of bluesy pain we're in for.Immediately following, Manson slams us with ""Deep Six,"" a track I loved on first listen and have only grown to love.  The feel is still in the blues mold, but it's a bit more vicious and up tempo.  Manson has grabbed us for his bluesy ride and he's not letting go.  Manson's fascination with Greek mythology and turns of phrase show up here, with his chanted lines of ""Wanna know what Zeus said to Narcissus? / You better watch yourself,"" which, for those who don't know, is how Narcissus died (watching himself) but also is a common threat.  Typical turn of a phrase for our lyricist.  Great song.  Followed up by another fantastic song, the first single ""Third Day of a Seven Day Binge,"" another song that carries the blues motif.Other great songs follow.  I absolutely love ""The Mephistopheles of Los Angeles"" for the blues funk it carries.  The mournful wailing in ""Warship My Wreck.""  I think one of my favorite songs from the back half is definitely ""Slave Only Dreams to be King,"" which starts with a quote from ""As a Man Thinketh"" by James Allen.  For me, the only weak track here is ""Birds of Hell Awaiting,"" which for some reason just doesn't do it for me.  But, as a whole, the songs here feature Manson at his most restrained and powerful.  Working with Tyler Bates, whose known for his work as a composer (Guardians of the Galaxy, Slither, 300, etc.), Manson has created his most cinematic album, with its highs and lows, but always with a pulsing beat.I know at least some of Manson's diehard fans haven't cared for his last few albums.  It's typical in a career that lasts as long as Manson's has; the artist must change, but the people who supported him in the beginning just want another Mechanical Animals.  I get that.  But, I'll be honest, this album is probably my favorite of Manson's.  The parts of Manson's last few albums that I really loved were when he started singing the blues.  Some of The High End of Low is my favorite he's ever created. Manson knows how to sing the blues.  So, an album that is so strongly influenced by blues is perfect for me.  And, The Pale Emperor has an energy I've found lacking in his last few albums.  Is it the second coming of Mechanical Animals?  No, probably not. But, then again, I don't know if I'd want that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IF3V80KMS9HM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEJG1K0#wasThisHelpful","R1IF3V80KMS9HM","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some books are called unfilmable.  I remember reading Horns and thinking how great of a rambling book it was.  Partly an allegory, partly a dissection of Kafka's famous story Metamorphosis, it verged in many different directions, careening from horror to romance to a religious critique.  But considering how over the place the novel was, I couldn't imagine it being turned into an effective film.  As the time passed, Alexandre Aja (High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes) was attached to direct and, shockingly, Daniel Radcliffe was going to play Iggy Perrish.  Still, I worried: how would they make this into a movie?The answer is by mostly changing it and focusing on telling a mostly linear story centered around the murder of Merrin Williams.  And it's mostly effective, probably more so than I could expect or, frankly, hope.  Horns, the film, starts with Ig waking up and dealing with his normal routine.  His life is pretty much in the dumps.  We meet the pissed off townspeople who have already written Ig off as his girlfriend's killer.  We meet his parents and his brother who is a relatively famous musician and who is eye-rollingly introduced with trumpet in hand.  How do we know he's a musician? He walks out to a sad Iggy, playing a mournful tune on his trumpet.  We're then quickly introduced to Lee Tourneau, Ig's friend since childhood.  Unlike the book where Lee works in a congressman's office, here he is a public defender who is defending Ig.  But worry not, for now we are whisked away to the night where, in the novel, ""Ignatius Martin Perrish spent the night drunk and doing terrible things.""  The next morning, he wakes up with knobby pointed protuberances; aka, horns.  Not only does he have horns, but for some reason people around him start telling him their darkest desires and, if Ig touches them, he gets a clearer picture of their thoughts.  And he learns he can push people to do their darkest, most base desires.  And, of course, he decides to use these powers to find out who actually murdered Merrin.Whew! Horns, the film, has a lot of problems.  It (mostly wisely) cuts out a lot of what I thought made the novel unique and focuses on one major aspect of the story: Merrin's murder and Ig's task to find her killer.  It takes a narrative that was structured more like a puzzle that unspooled its secrets, histories and character development in a very non-linear way and makes it into an a more succinct mystery about the horns, Merrin's death and Iggy's quest to discover who actually killed her.  I can't honestly think of a different way a two hour movie could tackle this rambling tale.  Unfortunately, it's also a bit heavy-handed in its message and is too on-the-nose in terms of its religious imagery, specifically the religious-tinged dialogue.  The foreshadowing is too blatant in the dialogue.  And I don't feel like we get the full transition of Ig to The Devil that we do in the novel.  What surprised me most was how much Alexandre Aja pulled his punches with Ig; the director of The Hills Have Eyes, a movie that threw the worst at its protagonists, didn't seem to want to go that far with Ig.  Also, the climax of the film was cheesy and not as effective as the novel.  On the plus side, the movie can be incredibly funny at times.  One aspect the movie completely nailed was how random people would simply start spilling their deepest desires to Iggy.  And Daniel Radcliffe completely sold the amusement and horror of realizing he has this effect on people.So why the four stars?  Because Aja's heart is in the right place and most of the changes help strengthen the movie into a more cohesive tale for film.  Even though it loses a lot of the metaphors and philosophy of the novel, it still feels like a good telling of the story.  Its pacing is equally excellent and kept me enthralled the entire time.  It's also incredibly darkly funny and Aja gets a fantastic, if brief, performance out of Heather Graham.  She steals the movie, for me; something I never would have thought possible with her.  And Aja gets the romance between Ig and Merrin right.  Sometimes in order to translate a book to a film, you have to kill your darlings, as the saying goes.  And I believe Aja has given Joe Hill his due.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZBOK0BTQBOCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4U8NCY#wasThisHelpful","R2ZBOK0BTQBOCV","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My last knife block set did not stand up to the test of time very well.  Even though I spent about as much money on those as this OXO set normally costs, those knives were loose, the knife block's top was falling apart and I was pretty much completely disappointed in them.  On the other hand, this set is pretty great for the money.  If you are a professional chef, you will probably have a much different opinion on this set, but then again, you probably have individual knives you've purchased for a couple hundred dollars a pop.  For the average person, needing a good set for their kitchen, this is darn good.Included with the set is an 8"" Chef's knife, a 6.5"" Santoku knife, a 5"" serrated utility knife, a 3.5"" paring knife, an 8"" bread knife and four steak knives. I actually really like the steak knives; they're reminiscent of the kind you'd see at a steak house.  The other knives are also of good quality and mine came pretty sharp.When the package arrived, I was actually pretty surprised at how thin it was.  Turns out, the knife block is very thin, with the knives turned sideways.  I thought I wouldn't be happy with how miniscule it would look, but it turns out the space-saving aspect of it is nice.  And the color of the block can't be fully appreciated in the picture here.  It's a very nice cherry.  Much nicer than I expected.  Overall, this is a great knife block set for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNCX1DEDX7EDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVPFXWI#wasThisHelpful","RNCX1DEDX7EDQ","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been trying to figure out exactly what to say about You by Zoran Drvenkar.  I've written this paragraph a couple times.  The truth is, I don't know what to say, exactly.  At its core, You is a typical thriller involving three different groups of individuals who inadvertently end up crashing into each other.  It's about revenge, lies, death and drugs.  It's about a Mafioso-type family.  It's about a serial killer.  It's about a group of young women who end up getting caught up in something way above their understanding.  It's about unreliable narrators.  It's about fate, in some ways.  Above all, it's one of the most enthralling novels I've read in sometime.But You makes you work for it.  For a lot of readers, You is not an easy read. Going into this novel, you have to realize a few things.  It's written in the second person perspective, putting you directly in the shoes of multiple characters, as if you are that character and Zoran is writing about you.  It's a translated novel from German to English.  And it's told non-linearly, with events spiraling back around from a different perspective.  I bet--and judging from some of the reviews here, it seems to be true--some people won't be able to get through the first few pages.  But there are novels that require a bit more investment from their readers.  A lot of times that investment is paid in great dividends.  You is one of those novels.On the surface, You is a crime novel about three different groups of people.  But it begins by putting you directly in the shoes of an individual named The Traveler.  The Traveler is a sociopathic murderer, patient and methodical.  In the opening section, Zoran puts you directly in his shoes as he murders a bunch of people stuck in a snowy traffic jam.  These particular chapters are uneasy to read because it places you in the character's head; as if you were the one performing the murders.  Next, we're introduced to a group of Berlin criminals led by a man named Ragnar.  Ragnar's brother has been found dead and his piles of pure heroin are missing.  He wants to find who did it and do unspeakable things to them.  Up next, we have a group of teenage girls, who are incredibly loyal to each other.  One of their friends has been out of contact for a while and they are worried about her.  These three disparate groups eventually converge on each other in surprising and violent ways.In the Authors Thank You page, Zoran thanks George R.R. Martin for his writing, particularly in the way it taught Zoran.  Even though You is not a fantasy novel and in many ways feels completely divergent to A Song of Ice and Fire, the first thing I thought of when I started reading You was Martin.  The chapters are titled after the point of view of the character and the story is told from their (your?) perspective.  You is told out of order, with scenes and sequences crisscrossing over each other, showcasing events from different perspectives.  It's never boring and each time it does it, it provides smaller twists to the story.  It's quite an intriguing way of putting you in the action and Zoran masterfully unravels the story slowly.  It's a slowburn build to the climax, but it's never boring.  It's also subtle in spots, presenting scenes and then allowing you to, at times, piece together the timeline.  It doesn't hold your hand.  Some people will be turned off by this, particularly with the slow burn aspect of the storytelling.  But it's a very rich story and the way its told helps add pathos and dimensions to the character.  It's been a very long time since I've seen someone attempt a second person narrative, but Zoran does a fantastic job of putting you in the character's shoes--sometimes, uncomfortably so--and allowing you to get wrapped up in the story.  Special mention must absolutely be given to Shaun Whiteside, the translator.  In many ways, the translator is the most important person in presenting the story.  And You is never choppy.  It flows elegantly and if I didn't know better, I would never expected it to be a translated work.  That's the best kudos I can give to Whiteside.I think this novel will be divisive, particularly among people who go into the book thinking it's simply a fast-paced, beach-reading thriller; like a James Patterson or a Dean Koontz, maybe.  You is thrilling, but it simmers along the surface.  I was leery selecting it, more leery when I got it but was absolutely blown away.  It grabbed me from the first page and didn't let go.  It's probably one of the best books I've read this year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IUDA2XUC63D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030795806X#wasThisHelpful","R3IUDA2XUC63D4","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wasteland 2 isn't the most forgiving game, when you're being introduced to it.  I spent a good 2 and a half hours or so, with my premade party of people, going through the game, passing by a bunch of opportunities, running low on ammo and basically getting my ass kicked before I decided to restart from scratch.  It's a game where you won't know the importance of specific skills and attributes until you've dug into the game a bit.  It doesn't hold your hand, during character creation.  Which can be problematic when you're expected to carry these individuals along a 70 hour+ game.  After spending about 3 hours in the game, I had a good feel for what I should and shouldn't do when creating my characters. So, I deleted my game and started from scratch in order to make a more well-rounded group.For example, early on, I had problems with ammo because two of my people were using the same type weapon and ammo was scarce.  I was reduced to wielding makeshift machetes, which I wasn't trained in, futilely against the most ridiculously hard mutated bunnies.  I'm not kidding.  The bunnies in this game are no joke.  They will maul you.  Beware the bunnies.  Restarting gave me a better chance by spreading out the types of weapons my four-person team had.  The first few hours with the game also gave me and understanding of the skills, how they fit in with each other and the best way to maximize my exploration.  My problem is that if there is a locked area/chest, I have to see what's in it, even if it ends up being a box of junk.  So on my second start, I had to really think about the skills and how to spread them out so that I could open that random safe we passed or disarm that alarm on a fence before disarming the bomb that was attached to it...before finally unlocking it.  The game is unforgiving.  And if you don't have an understanding of what to do, particularly in the early game, you will run into the same frustrations I had.Compounding this is the fact that some of the skills seem split just for the sake of being split.  Is fixing a toaster really that much different from fixing mechanical devices?  Do we really need two different skills?  Likewise, if you're trained in bladed weapons do you really need to have a second skill for blunt weapons?  Isn't the death-dealing mechanism really the same, whether you're slashing someone or bashing them?Once you get past these little details and unforgiving speed bumps, you can really appreciate the love and care that went into building Wasteland 2.  The game is full of world-building flavor.  Click on most things and you'll get a witty anecdote or informational snippet.  Honey Badgers don't care.  Chests might be a treasure trove from before the crap hit the fan.  Bodies have been hacked to pieces.  Doors...well, the game will tell you there are like any of the other hundred doors you've walked through.  The descriptions are oftentimes funny or caustically snide.  Characters are full of dialogue, both of the exposition and of the world-building variety.  The world feels huge.  Your skills oftentimes combine in glorious ways as you make your way around the zones.  Exploration-happy people, of which I consider myself, will find a lot to discover.Combat, where you'll be spending a lot of your time, feels like a mix of the new XCOM and old school turn-based strategy games.  You can go into an overwatch-like stance (called Ambush here) to attack enemies when they come close.  Guns have different firing modes.  Guns also open different playing styles.  It feels a little slower than the new XCOM.  And it lacks some of the inventive skills (like being able to jump to higher vantage points) of XCOM but it also maintains that nostalgic feeling of ye olden strategy games.  This is the most nostalgic aspect of the game. I was hoping for a bit more interactivity and modern flair, like XCOM.  It feels very static at times.The story is pretty typical.  You play four new recruits to the Desert Rangers.  Ace, one of the experienced rangers, was found dead and General Vargas sends you on a task to find out who killed Ace, why they did it and then continue his mission.  Of course, the story builds from there and takes you to a myriad of locations.  Along the way, you'll have to make decisions that will affect your missions.  One of the first things you'll do is have to choose whether to save the Agricultural Center from a mutated plant attack or Highpool which is under siege by raiders.  You can't save both.  You'll have to choose.  These types of decisions carry forward as you progress.  There are times, too, where you can really feel like you're in the movie Fargo. At one point, I was in a town and, as I mentioned above, there was a locked area.  I had to get into it, obviously.  Little did I know that doing so would turn the entire town against me (even though they hadn't caught me in the act).  So before you know it, I'm slaughtering everyone and it just spirals out of control.  I truly felt like those bungling criminals in Fargo.Wasteland 2 is another in a line of nostalgic-fueled Kickstarted projects, like the upcoming Pillars of Eternity or Torment.  They take established products and either build on them or heavily reference them to the point of ""spiritual successor.""  Wasteland 2 is an exercise in nostalgia, there's no way around it.  And some of its gameplay is stuck in the past.  To some, that is perfect.  To others, it might be annoying.  But what Wasteland does, it does perfectly.  It encapsulates this style of game and can be so addictive, if you let it.  I highly recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R96B8FL1D2DFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLW3VDM#wasThisHelpful","R96B8FL1D2DFK","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first Bose speaker/headset and they surprised with how awesome they are.  They pair quickly and easily with my iPhone, my iPad and they worked wonderfully.  The sound quality is crystal clear, with booming lows and perfect highs.  With 15 hours of play time, they last for a good amount of time before requiring a charge.  That's better than a lot of wireless headsets I use on my PC.The biggest caveat I have to give before I go into my review breakdown is that they work perfectly until you try to do things that they aren't truly made for.  I was hoping I would be able to pair these headsets with my PC to use when I game and for talking to friends through Ventrilo/Mumble/etc.  They paired easily and quickly with my Bluetooth adapter.  The sound quality was pretty damn impressive while I played games.  I'm used to using 7.1 virtual surround sound wireless headsets, so my expectation of sound is pretty high.  While obviously not as ""immersive"" as the 7.1 virtual headsets, the Bose pumped out fantastic sound that accentuated the highs but also had fantastic depth for the lows.  The problem with using them for the PC came when I tried to talk to people.  Because the headsets are meant for mobile pairing, there's no software/driver support that I could find.  The mic would not work.  I spent a good hour trying different things to try and get it to work and it lasted for about 5 minutes before not working.  This was incredibly frustrating for me, but again I can't put fault on the device.  It's made to work with mobile Bluetooth pairing and, for that, it works exceptionally well.When I review headsets, I look at a few different areas: 1) Comfort 2) durability 3) sound quality and 4) Mic quality.ComfortThis headset is incredibly comfortable.  I have a bigger head and a lot of times I go through a period where the headsets feel like a vice grip until they loosen up and get used to my head.  I didn't really have that problem with these.  They are lightweight in design and the ear pads are comfortable.  They aren't noise-canceling and they don't engulf the ear.  They lay against them, but I didn't find my ears being pressed back too hard.  A lot of times these types of headphones will smash my ear to my head and grow uncomfortable.  I didn't have that problem with these.DurabilityConsidering how lightweight and bendable these headsets are, they feel surprisingly durable.  The speakers fold in and the bands fold up, so you have a smaller storage requirement.  They come with a small container and at first I didn't think they would fit in there.  But they fold up and easily fit in the small bag.Sound QualityThis is the big one and they sound fantastic.  Like I mentioned above, the range is great, the lows are booming but not overbearing and the highs sound fantastic.  From watching movies to playing games to listening to music, they sound fantastic.Mic QualityConsidering this doesn't have a boom mic and the mic is positioned on the outside of one of the speakers, I was worried the sound quality wouldn't be very good.  Aside from the problem I mentioned above where I couldn't get it to work with my PC, the mic works very well.  It doesn't work as well as a boom mic would; however, for the miscellaneous call that comes through while you're listening to music, it works fine.Overall, this is a great headset.  The Bose-quality sound is definitely evident and it's both comfortable and durable.  I was really hoping it'd be an end-all headset I could use while gaming/talking on my PC and out and about.  But for those looking for a good mobile headset, I don't think you can do much better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MCSUPU2L73D1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M58CMYC#wasThisHelpful","R2MCSUPU2L73D1","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something about underwater laboratory/society stories that just speaks to me.  Whether it's the alien-influenced Sphere or the giant shark/animals of The Trench, cinematic masterpieces like The Abyss or critically acclaimed video games like Bioshock, I am a glutton for these stories.  It doesn't even matter how bad they are (i.e., The Trench, Leviathan, Deep Star Six).  There's something mysterious and, yes, foreboding about deep sea.  It's such a perfect location for horror because while it's terrestrial, but it's as closed off, uninviting and dangerous as space exploration.  It's also completely alien and unexplored.  Enter The Deep, an upcoming novel by Nick Cutter.  Cutter has a bit of an edge over other new horror authors because his last book received a seal of approval from Stephen King.  King really enjoyed The Troop (a novel I have since added to my Kindle to read) and while Uncle Stevie and I sometimes don't see eye to eye with his suggestions, you can't simply ignore the master of modern horror's recommendations.The Deep begins with some world-building.  Earth has been pretty decimated by an unknown disease called the 'Gets (shortened from Forgets, I assume).  What started as something similar to Alzheimer's has turned into a terrifying disease that causes people to forget everything.  It might start as forgetting an important date like an anniversary but, by the bitter end, the poor victim completely forgets how to breathe. The heart forgets how to pump and the person will eventually die.  No one knows how to combat it.  No one is completely sure how it spreads.  There's no cure.  Enter into this picture, two brothers.  One, a brilliant and coldly calculating and compassionless scientist named Clayton.  The other is Luke, a veterinarian whose son vanished one night and completely destroyed his family and his life.  Clayton has been doing top secret work in an underwater lab, deep in the Mariana Trench.  But, as things happen in these types of novels, communication gets shut down and no one knows exactly what's going on under the sea.  To make matters worse, one of the scientists has surfaced, dead, with recent scars covering most of his body.  And there's a message, seemingly from Clayton, asking for his brother to ""come home.""  And so Luke ventures deep into The Trieste, the super expensive undersea laboratory that...might become his tomb! Dun dun dun.I'm pretty partial to these types of stories.  But truthfully, there's more terrible ones than good ones.  The Deep could have very easily been dumped into the first category.  I mean, it pretty much screams B-quality horror when you look at it.  The chapters are only a couple pages long and usually end with a minor cliffhanger to keep you reading.  The prose is simple and unwieldy (the more to get you reading, my dear) and it's filled with stock characters.  There's Alice (who goes by Al, natch), the military badass.  Luke is the compassion-filled brother who can never live up to his brilliant brother.  The brother, Clayton, is your typical compassionless scientist.  You know the kind in these books.  He names the animals he tests on, but refers to them as ""it"" and ""subjects.""  All he cares about is the puzzle and being the one to solve it.  Then there's the mysterious substance that's at the center of the mystery.  Termed Ambrosia, this substance seems like it could be a cure-all for everything, including the 'Gets.What elevates this novel past a lesser horror novel is that Nick Cutter has a command of the plot.  It moves quickly, yes.  But Cutter knows how to build suspense.  The way he describes the claustrophobia and intense darkness of undersea can transport you there.  There are moments of complete terror in this book, particularly towards the end when it veers into Clive Barker territory, that had me wide-eyed and page-turning.  It doesn't matter that the story is implausible.  If an author can teleport you to that place and make you forget, even for a little bit, that the premise is ridiculous, you know you are in good hands.  I could not put The Deep down.  I received it on a Friday and it was done by the end of the weekend.  The final few pages made me feel as if we're not done with the world Cutter created.  In some ways, this book feels like the first part of a series.  I think this is an author that we'll be seeing a lot of down the road.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to read The Troop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DUDPJAHMGYWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476717737#wasThisHelpful","R2DUDPJAHMGYWB","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using a Camelbak Groove for the longest time to get my water needs.  I think the Camelbak Groove is the best water bottle I've ever used, partially because of the filter but also because of the leak-proof nature of it.  This Contigo Purity Glass Water Bottle is just that: a glass water bottle.  Some people will appreciate that over plastic.  Others will find it a bit cumbersome because it's shatterproof glass (which is heavy), it's covered in rugged silicone (which is bulky) and when you put water in, it's obviously heavier.  To me, this isn't a carry everywhere type of water bottle.  It's more of a stationary bottle (like if you were doing yoga or something).  That said, it's a very attractive and modern-looking bottle.  I've gotten compliments on it.  And as a water-delivery-device, it works about as well as you'd expect it to...So not as good as my Camelbak, but still, for someone looking for a glass water bottle, I can't complain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JB76D1H8B2S4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LWVIO6I#wasThisHelpful","R2JB76D1H8B2S4","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess I have to put out the disclaimer of buyer-beware.  Reviews seem to be all over the map on this one.  I can only write my own personal experiences with it.  When I was offered to test this out, I almost passed on it.  I like to stick with whatever company my product belongs to (in this case Apple) instead of going for an ""off-brand.""  Even though Belkin is a known company and I've purchased things developed by them, I still tend to be leery.  But I ran into a problem.  A common problem, it seems.  I have an iPhone 5 and the new iPad, and I've been relying on one charging cord for about three months because the cord that came with my iPhone 5 eventually stopped working.  It started fraying around the area where the cord meets the lightning connector.  At first, it was pinched and I had to move the cord around just right to continue charging.  Then it just started falling apart.  With the new iPhone just around the corner (hopefully) I didn't want to drop a huge amount of money on a new charging cable since I'd be presumably getting one when I upgrade.So I took the chance on this one.  A lot of the reviews are negative, suggesting some of the same problems I noted above.  Well, those are problems I had with the Apple-created charging cable.  So, you win or you lose.  For what it's worth, I don't have any of those non-compatibility errors and it charged my iPad really nicely.  Also, the cord seems a bit thicker than the Apple one, so I hope that means I won't run into any of the stripping problems that caused it to fail last time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H3P6E416VU2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LETJFNE#wasThisHelpful","R2H3P6E416VU2M","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This scale is fantastic for a variety of reasons.  It's priced competitively, but it also offers a multitude of options and functions that I'm not used to in a scale.  For the longest time I've used the EatSmart Precision Digital Bathroom Scale and have liked that one, for its no-frills use and modern style sensibilities.  So there's the standard things you'd expect; the scale is very accurate, within .2 lbs.  If you're looking for a scale to be more accurate than that you....might have a problem.  It will work up to 350 lbs, which is less than my previous scale but a non-issue for me.The scale also measures BMI, which is something I have started looking at once I joined a kickboxing fitness gym here.  The BMI calculator on the scale is more of a wag, honestly.  It's not as accurate as the machines devoted to BMI tracking; nor was it as accurate as the BMI scale at my gym.  But it will give you a ball park figure.  One of the nice features is that it has the ability to set 8 different profiles, so it will track 8 individual weights and progress.  You tell it your height, age, activity level and how much weight you want to lose and it will track it for you.  It'll also give you a calorie range you need to eat to maintain your current weight.There's a lot of information right within your grasp and presented easily and helpfully.

"Sometimes the stars align and you receive the perfect product at the perfect time.  About four years ago, when I moved into my new place, I purchased the Margaritaville DM1000 to celebrate with friends.  That was a fantastic purchase that made the most consistent and tasty margaritas this side of going to a professional place.  I have since gotten a lot of use out of that one.  So when I was given the opportunity to test out the new DM3500, I immediately jumped on it.  This was a case of perfect timing because a friend was having her annual end-of-summer party and, while I was afraid the machine would come after it, the DM3500 was delivered the day before.  Serendipity.  Small story aside, needless to say the new Margaritaville machine got put through its paces all day/night Saturday.  With so many working parts here, I was a little leery of diving right in but I have to say that the DM3500 is the best Margaritaville machine I've ever used...and my friends at the party want one, too.It's very large and intimidating, but setup is a breeze.  The basic function of the machine remains the same as previous models.  The ice container on the top perfectly shaves (or crushes...but more on that later) the ice, while the blender mixes up the ingredients and combines the two.  This model differs from the other models in a couple areas.  The first is that it has four settings: daiquiri, margarita, pia colada and smoothie.  The guide explains what should go into each setting.  Because the margarita setting is supposed to be more liquid products (i.e., not fruit) we stuck with the daiquiri setting for making our margaritas which expressly said it included fruit.  We ended up ""testing"" the daiquiri setting and the pia colada setting most of the day.  There was a difference in the ice levels and the ice consistency between the two settings.  The daiquiri setting is most reminiscent of the Margaritaville machines I've used in the past, with a nice shaved ice and has the consistency of slushies.  The pia colada setting, though, actually crushed the ice it seemed and it wasn't as smooth.  But it worked for what most people know of pia coladas.  It also changes how much ice is in it.  The guides come with sample recipes, too, and we basically followed them for perfect-tasting drinks.The second change is that this machine does the best job actually mixing the ice and ingredients together.  My previous model sometimes required me stirring the drink together because sometimes the ice on the top didn't get mixed in perfectly.  The DM3500 does it in sections.  It blends, shaves the ice, blends some more, shaves more ice, blends some more.  The setting determines how much ice gets pumped into it (with the pia coladas using pretty much the entire ice reserve for a full container) and each time it was perfectly mixed.  The third big change is that this model has a spout that guests simply place their glass against and the machine whirls to life, blending/mixing up the drinking and pushing it up the pipe (that also mixes it as it goes) and through the spout. One guest said, ""well I guess I can't sneak a drink with this machine..."".My friend was right.  If there's one complaint about this blender, it's that it isn't quiet.  It's very loud.  That said, the blender is about as loud as you would expect a blender to be and the ice shaver is tossing ice cubes around so it's not exactly a subtle device.  It's about as loud as previous Margaritaville machines I've used.  But that's about the only negative thing I can say about this device.  The pitcher holds 60 ounces, so it holds a lot more than my previous model which means there's less time spent preparing drinks and more time actually enjoying them.  It blends the drinks more perfectly than any other machine I've used and is the most automated of the devices I've seen.  When I saw the price tag, I blanched; but for the individual who constantly entertains and wants a nice machine, this is, hands-down, the best margarita-maker I have ever used.My recipe for the strawberry margarita:7 oz tequila4 oz triple sec1 container (about 12.5 oz) frozen strawberries with sauce (aka sweetened)Few scoops of frozen limeade (~1/4 of the frozen tube, give or take based on personal taste)Use this with the full pitcher setting and you got yourself a party.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36AREWFWLDZPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUGHE4S#wasThisHelpful","R36AREWFWLDZPU","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Assassin's Creed is one of those series that is constantly disappointing me.  I start playing them, get enthralled in the historical context and parkouring around all over the place.  Then, I invariably get bored.  The systems in place never seemed to hold my attention.  The most I've played an Assassin's Creed game was probably the second one, but even that game I never finished.  Never even came close.  Because boredom.  With my new Xbox One, with its kind of depressing slate of exclusive games, I wanted to make sure that I had a game that I knew wasn't a rushed launch title.  So I sighed and picked up Black Flag, expecting to play it a little bit and then go back to playing XCOM on my PC.  I was shocked to find that I didn't hate Black Flag.Actually, I absolutely love it.The biggest problems with these franchises (see: Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, Elder Scrolls) is that each game is released as iterations, in that the core game is remarkably similar to the first game, but each time they iterate it, refine it.  They change the story but you are doing pretty much the same thing you've done in Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty.  The story and settings might be different.  They might have given you a dog (or a Dragon Shout).  But you're still playing the same game.  In that regard, Black Flag follows suit.  You're still assassinating Templars.  You're still free-running across buildings.  You're still performing absolutely annoying eavesdropping missions or sometimes frustrating sneaking missions.  You're still caught up in some metaphysical story.  You're still being interrupted with annoying modern day Abstergo interludes.  But this iteration has a boat, something somewhat introduced in AC3, and it makes you a pirate.  And that has changed absolutely everything, for me, at least..  There's just more to this iteration that makes me want to play than any time before.Examples. Naval fortresses.  These are heavily fortified areas that turn into a mini-boss battle of sorts, between your ship, the Jackdaw, and the fortress's armaments.  Once you've destroyed the armaments, it immediately segues into sieging the fortress on foot.  It culminates in an assassination and the keep becomes yours and sheds light on the map of the area surrounding it.  These, so far, have been eminently thrilling for me.Sea battles.  The first time I fought a ship in a stormy sea, with rogue waves crashing into us, high seas causing eye-sight issues and complications for firing cannons, and water spouts spawning around us, I was entranced.  The epic scale, the graphics, everything was just so exciting.  And then when the ship was dead in the water and I could board it, swinging from my ship to the burning wreckage of my foe, before jamming my sword into an unaware British soldier was everything I imagined as a kid, growing up on pirate films.  It was exciting.  It was thrilling.  It was different.Hunting/fishing.  Yes, hunting is back.  Yes, it's still kind of annoying.  But it's tied to your growth (health upgrades, pistol upgrades, storage upgrades, etc.) and presented a lot easier.  Each island or area has a certain type of animal, marked on the map.  And it doesn't take a lot of skins to create new items.  But the game also introduced fishing and these little moments can be thrilling.  When you go harpooning, you're in a small boat and it's just you and a very large fish/whale.  There's a good variety between the whales (humpback, killer, even the mythical white whale) and sharks (Bull Sharks, Hammerheads and, of course, a Great White), and they add little wrinkles to the combat, depending on the animal.Later on, as these games do with breadcrumbs, Black Flag introduced the diving bell.  This device allows you to investigate shipwrecks on the bottom of the ocean.  These are both thrilling and terror-inducing, reducing you to a weaponless man in an often shark-infested area.  The first time a shark lunged at me from behind, spawning a QTE minigame, I almost leaped out of my chair.  It was so intense.  I had to yell ""Xbox record that"" to share the moment.  These shipwrecks are all different, with their own sets of obstacles and threats.  Some include sharks and rely on racing from wreckage to areas with heavy seaweed to hide in.  Some involve underwater cave systems, requiring you to be quick before you run out of air.  All of them are thrilling and add just a bit more to the game.The rest of the game is pretty much the same Assassin's Creed game you've been playing since the beginning, just refined and iterated.  You can upgrade your ship, the Jackdaw, by adding different cannons, increasing the durability, etc.  You can also purchase items to customize the appearance of the ship.  And of course, there's a home base that you can start sinking your money into, to upgrade it.  I just feel more attached to this part than I have in previous games, mostly because of the pirate motif.I don't really have much else to say on other aspects of the game.  I don't really care about the stories in these games; they are more of a means to an end, for me.  The graphics are awesome, but that's to be expected.  I don't know how this version compares to the PS4 (other than the PS4 version is rendered in native 1080p) or the previous generation, but I honestly don't care because it looks beautiful, particularly the open sea.  It is engulfing in its majesty and I haven't seen water effects look this realistic (though the boat sometimes seems to be floating through it, when you're in travel mode).  I will say that the on-land portion is mostly just okay, for me, but for fans of previous Assassin's Creed games, you'll probably find the same stuff to love.  What makes this game and what I wanted to focus on was how much different it feels because of the pirate theme.  Black Flag is the most fun when I'm on the open sea, destroying ships, fighting epic battles, tackling legendary ships and exploring the massive world.  I really hope that they will stick with this motif a little bit because this is the first time I've truly enjoyed an Assassin's Creed game and will be the first Assassin's Creed game I've completed.  Very much recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L9ZGGNQI84PV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX8VYM0#wasThisHelpful","R1L9ZGGNQI84PV","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the years, I have gone through so many routers through upgrades, review offers and replacements that I've tried most of the major brands like D-Link, Linksys/Cisco and Netgear.  In fact, in the last year I've tried the newer options provided by all three major brands and I was surprised the most with the Linksys EA4500, which offered blistering speeds with nary a connection issue.  But, over the years, I have been the biggest fan of D-Link for reliability, ease-of-use and speed.  When I was offered this new router, which looks very cool (and reminds me of the newly redesigned Mac Pro from Apple) I quickly jumped at the opportunity because historically D-Link has been the best brand of routers for me and was always super reliable.I was prepared to write a simple review, espousing how this router that has something called ""StreamBoost"" technology that supposed rack and stacks the devices currently using your router and pushes more bandwidth and speed to the ones that it and you deem more important.  In theory, this is awesome.  But It didn't work for me and in fact, having it on caused my streaming videos--which I have never had a problem with since the very early 2000s--to pause.  Not once or twice.  But it had to buffer every 30 seconds or so.Turns out this was the least of my problems.  My Playstation 3 just would not work with it.  It attached to it and it streamed to my PS3 enough so that it recognized it was online.  But when it tested connections, it would only tell me it failed.  Watching a video on Amazon or Hulu Plus downgraded the picture to the quality I remember when Netflix first dipped into online streaming...AND it buffered every 20-30 seconds.  It was bad.  Impossible to watch.  I also noticed that when I tried to do two devices at once (streaming on my Roku box and miscellaneous web surfing on my iPhone), my phone would not pull data from the router.  I ended up downgrading my security connection to WEP and it helped a bit on my Roku but my PS3 just wouldn't connect at all.Setup was surprisingly easy and I'm sure even those not tech-savvy could get through it with little to know problems.  My PC, which is connected through Ethernet, ran blisteringly fast for my service (SpeakEasy clocked it at just under 50 MB/sec), but everything else was slow as hell.  My iPhone, when it could connect, was speed testing at less than 1 MB/sec.  This device, which is marketed as a Gaming Router that is supposed to ""traffic shape"" your connection to give you the fastest speeds where needed did none of this.  It's really unfortunate because I have been a D-Link fan for years.  I ultimately plugged back in my Linksys EA4500.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SRPEH695NR4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDK1QUC#wasThisHelpful","R2SRPEH695NR4H","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stealth games are kind of like puzzles.  The developers give you all sorts of tools and places you in areas where your main goal is usually to not be seen.  You have to use whatever tools you have available to you, as well as skill and, let's be honest, sometimes luck to maneuver your way to your objective.  When games get it right, the player feels empowered.  When games get it wrong...well, you get games like Splinter Cell: Conviction, a game I tried to play and like but ultimately never finished.  So, I approached Blacklist with some hesitation.  For me the sweet spot of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, a game I gave 5 stars to here on Amazon.Blacklist looks to invoke the earlier games, including Chaos Theory, while at the same time making the game less punishing as the earlier games were.  In essence, it's a combination of what made the earlier games so revelatory and the parts that didn't stink in Conviction.  Missions score you based on three play styles: Ghost for non-lethal stealth, Panther for lethal stealth and Assault for throwing caution to the wind.  Instead of earlier games that blatantly punished you for not being 100% stealthy or for games like Conviction where it was all out warfare, it felt, this game tries to please everyone at once and offer more options for how to tackle missions.  And unlike most games that try to be everything to everyone (*cough* Resident Evil 6), it doesn't fail.  It actually is fun.This must be the era of changing well-known and liked leads.  We have Kojima telling fans that David Hayter is no more and we have Ubisoft replacing Michael Ironside with Eric Johnson for the voice of Fisher.  The story, meanwhile, is serviceable but I'm having a hard time remembering much about it.  The gameplay is what drew me in and is what kept me playing.  Once you're done with the single player, there's the extensive multiplayer.  Finally a return of Spies Vs. Mercs, which was my favorite from the earlier games.  Here, refined and expanded; it's the reason I will keep coming back to the game.Overall, fans of the previous entries will find lots to love here; and people who, like me, were turned off by Conviction will have a reason to come back.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKCZX9A9U8MOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086V5V9A#wasThisHelpful","RKCZX9A9U8MOO","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always enjoyed using Sony receivers.  My very first foray into receiver land was with a Sony 5.1 receiver back in the early 2000s, when I didn't know what an optical cable was or that I was supposed to use that for getting surround sound.  Back then, I just knew it said 5.1 and continued to use the red/white/yellow cables (not even knowing the name, RCA).  Since then, technology changed and my knowledge of technology changed.  With the introduction of HDMI, my old receiver was no longer useful.  And with the change, tons of new names and formats (TrueHD, LPCM, dts-HD, etc. all came to the forefront, confusing everyone.  At that time, I went with an Onkyo 5.1 system that had 3D passthrough, supported the new sound codecs and I have enjoyed it immensely, even when some of its terminology required tons of googling to understand the ambiguous sound settings.I've been looking at upgrading to a 7 speaker system for awhile, simply out of curiosity.  So when offered a chance to review the Sony DN840, I had to jump on the chance of going not only forward in speaker and options, but also to see how Sony has faired in the receiver department since my first purchase in 2000.My Onkyo was a pretty no-frills device (at the time it was around the $250-300 ballpark) and so didn't have some of the newer features like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and completely forget AirPlay.  I mostly wanted it because it had good reviews, HDMI ports and had 3D passthrough so that it was ""future proof"" with 3D.  Now of course the new fangled word is 4K, in terms of video clarity.Which brings me to the Sony DN840.  This receiver has a lot of the frills I was missing.  I enjoy that it has Wi-Fi built in and can utilize AirPlay from my computer or my iPhone, for streaming music.  It's a nice feature.  I know it's asking for too much, but if it had the video feature for AirPlay, that would have been amazing.  As it is, being able to stream Spotify to this receiver is great for parties.  It has 4K pass-through which probably means nothing to most people.  It's a good feature to look for in a receiver, though, if you're looking to buy one receiver and (probably...hopefully) not have to worry about future content.  It's good for right now, with the 3D pass-through, and when 4K TVs drop from their absurd prices and become as plentiful as 1080p TVs are now, it'll be a good feature to have.  6 HDMI inputs is great, since the number of devices requiring them have gone up (PS3, Xbox, Wii U, DVR took up all of my inputs on my Onkyo receiver).Now how about the sound quality?  I'm really impressed with this receiver.  I had to go out and purchase two new speakers to get the most of it and plan on eventually replacing all of my cheap speakers I got when I purchased my first Sony Receiver packaged system.  But even with my cheap speakers, I can already tell a difference.  The 7 speaker system does do a better job of completely surrounding you in the movie/game you're playing.  It's important to note that you won't get the full 7 channel experience with a lot of online content.  Most (if not all) online video services like Amazon and Netflix only recently moved towards 5.1 surround sound.  So the biggest reason for a 7 surround sound system is for watching movies on Blu Ray, where they are specifically engineered for that type of sound.  Oh, if you're confused why it's 7.2 vice 7.1, that .2 just means you can plug in a second sub woofer.  My one subwoofer is quite enough bass, but if you were creating a home theatre setup, I could see how using another sub woofer might be worth it.Oh, and if you are upgrading from an older model like I did with my Onkyo, be prepared to purchase Banana Plugs.  I had no idea these existed when I upgraded to my Onkyo and was in for a surprise when I opened the box (I didn't look closely enough at the speaker connections).  So I would recommend picking some up.  I have had good luck with the Sewell Direct SW-29863-12 Deadbolt Banana Plugs, 12-Pair and would recommend them.  They were easy to use and worked perfectly.Overall, I came away impressed with the Sony system.  It has a ton of frills and is, as of right now, pretty future proof with the 3D and 4K pass-through.  It outputs 150 watts, which is a decent output and the sound quality is just as good as the other hallowed sound receivers I've experienced.  For the money, I'd say it's a great value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S1GOTRRVF0DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CAAQHBE#wasThisHelpful","R1S1GOTRRVF0DB","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those devices that you look at, think, ""well duh"" and then buy one.  The idea of having a system of inter-connecting crock pots for a brunch or a party is pretty novel.  I never really thought about it, using individual crockpots to heat/keep food farm during parties.  The problem with that is when you have huge crock pots for something really small (i.e., dip) and that's all you have.This connectable ""Entertaining System"" actually came at a great time for me to try, since I was throwing a end of summer bash.  It worked perfectly.  As other reviews have noted, the cooker does get a bit hot.  Unlike some reviewers, mine wasn't a danger issue, but it did get pretty warm.  If it is a concern, obviously a potholder pad should be used and is just good safety, anyway.  The system is built so that you can (of course) but more crock pots to connect into them, creating a sort of buffet line.What I love about the system is the idea of using one plug for a series of crock pots.  Before this, all of my plugins would be used for crockpots and they'd be all over the place.  What I also like is the size.  These are one quart a piece (for a total of two quarts), which is a perfect size for dips, over the 3-5 quart crock pots I currently own.  The ability to mix and match this system is also perfect, for those who host on a recurring basis.Which brings me to my final point.  The system is, in my opinion, expensive.  For this total of 2 quarts you're paying as much, or even more, than you would buying a decent 5 quart crock pot.  You're paying for the convenience (and color options).  I would pretty much only recommend this system for those who cater or throw parties/brunches on a recurring basis.  Otherwise, I have a feeling this expensive unit will collect dust next to your Margaritaville Drink Mixer machine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XNIR5Q9OCPKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CEILYHO#wasThisHelpful","R2XNIR5Q9OCPKW","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blackfish mostly follows the story of Tilikum, an orca captured in the 80s when he was a mere pup, and his rise to fame and infamy within Sealand of the Pacific and, eventually, SeaWorld.  Known to be involved in the deaths of three trainers, Tilikum's story is tragic both for the whale and also for the trainers, some of whom did not truly know the dangers of working with him.  Thrown into this mix are some anecdotal stories about other killer whales, the number of ""accidents"" involving killer whales and trainers and, for some random reason, a whale's sexual organ on display.  I know Blackfish has received a lot of positive press and reviews, but honestly it left me feeling pretty nonchalant.  Not about the travesty that happens to these whales or the tragedy befalling the trainers.  That obviously hit home.  But the documentary seemed all over the place and wasn't really put together very well to make a cohesive whole.  Random parts of the film seem pulled directly from YouTube, and just when it seems like it's making a point, it veers off into randomness; for example, for no real reason we go from the tragedies happening to seeing a pod of whales in the ocean attacking a sea lion.  I didn't really see how this added much to the main thrust of the story, other than to pad the already slim running time.  Additionally, while they tried to make a point of showing how the aggressive Tilikum is used to breed for most of the whales in captivity, I don't see why they had to focus on his, er, erupting member.  I now know that it looks like a tentacle.  So, you know.  I learned something.My biggest problem with the documentary is that I left not really knowing more than when I went in (erupting member, aside).  The other problem is that it feels cloyingly attached to appeal to our emotions.  How anyone could watch the footage of a whale calling out to her young that's been ripped from her and not feel pathos is beyond me.  And that's exactly what the documentarians are counting on.  It sometimes feels manipulative.  But I say this not as someone who's on the side of SeaWorld, but as someone who definitely agrees that these beautiful creatures should be able to roam free and not be forced to do ridiculous tricks.  I just don't like to feel like I'm being manipulated.At one point, the documentary tells the viewer that SeaWorld was asked repeatedly for interviews for Blackfish, but they were (here's a shocker) turned down.  Obviously, SeaWorld knows that the documentary is about lambasting them, so why would they submit to it?  Yet, it's played off as if the directors are trying to be fair and balanced; Fox News follows a similar tactic.  Look, Blackfish is a one-sided documentary, telling its viewers things they probably already know: animals in captivity = bad; animals in captivity + interacting with humans = worse.  Worse for the humans interacting with an animal that can't really be domesticated and worse for the animals who have been robbed their freedom.  The best thing the documentary does is show real human emotion for these majestic creatures, often showing how social and family-focused they are.  It's just so jittery in its narrative focus, bouncing all over the place, that in the end it doesn't really make a concrete point, other than one that we can probably reach on our own.  I enjoyed it and I think it's worth watching, but I don't think it's constructed as well as it could have been.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R181CFCQAJCOD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DL47ORO#wasThisHelpful","R181CFCQAJCOD4","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love my Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  In the past, I've used one of their cheaper ones and recently I upgraded to the HX6972.  It's probably one of the best toothbrushes I've owned, so when given the option to try the Intercare brushes, I had to jump on it.  My biggest complaint about these brush heads is the fact that they are smaller than the ones that come with the toothbrush or other replacement heads I've seen.  They are contoured, supposedly to get between the teeth and do a better job of cleaning.  I've been using them for over a month and I have noticed that they've improved my gum health more and it does feel like the plaque between my teeth is significantly less than with a standard brush.  I probably won't know the extent until I go in for my next dental visit, but I really like these replacement heads.  The only complaint I can levy against them is that they were smaller than I was expecting.  Overall, very good for interdental cleaning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JBGCXV93K4GI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUG26ZE#wasThisHelpful","R3JBGCXV93K4GI","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember picking up David Gordon's The Serialist on a lark.  That novel gripped me from the first page until the last.  So I was curious to see how his follow-up novel would fare and I'm happy to say that it's just as good, but not as humorous or meta, as The Serialist.  Much like the character in The Serialist, Sam Kornberg is a failed novelist whose marriage to Lala is failing.  Lala walks out on him and he tries to win her back by finding a job.  He ends up taking a job as an assistant detective to a Solar Lonsky, a morbidly obese man who wants Sam to follow The Mystery Girl.  Of course, Sam discovers on his path through LA that showcases geekery of assorted nature, doppelgangers and awesome characters that you don't normally see in a mainstream novel, that the case isn't what it's cracked up to be.David Gordon proved in The Serialist that he knows the detective novel inside and out and was able to both take jabs while simultaneously mimicking the same structure.  The Mystery Girl isn't as meta as The Serialist and I didn't find it as funny.  That said, Gordon's ruminations on life and the way he turns a phrase had me bending pages of the novel to go back to later.  The Mystery Girl is dark, darkly comedic and full-on noir, oftentimes at the same time.  Fans of The Serialist will find lots to love here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPGEU6NZML9ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544028589#wasThisHelpful","RPGEU6NZML9ZT","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In some ways, the concept behind The Shining Girls is reminiscent of Looper, in that killing people across time is a great way of not getting caught.  It posits this house, this kind of supernatural house that allows a decidedly creepy man named Harper Curtis to travel across time.  A Depression-era drift, Curtis must travel time and kill these ""Shining Girls,"" girls who have something that makes them special.  One of his victims is Kirby Mazrachi who ends up surviving and makes it her life's mission to catch the killer.It'd be hard to not mention The Time Traveler's Wife, either, because of the way The Shining Girls is written.  It's written out of order, flipping between time periods so that the reader fills in the pieces.  I had a hard time getting into The Shining Girls but once it started and got into its rhythm I found it difficult to put down.

"Is there a show on television as depressing and nasty as The Killing?  I'd be hard-pressed to find one.  If I were to boil down the first two seasons of The Killing into one unifying theme, it's how shoddy police work can destroy everyone it touches.  Whether that's the family of the slain girl, Rosie Larson, the black teacher who gets kicked to a bloody pulp because of racism and racial profiling, the idealistic politician who gets paralyzed...and that's all within the first season.  By the end of Season Two, how many more lives will be destroyed by our intrepid heroes?I'm being a bit glib, but that's mostly because there's nothing glib or even humorous about this next season.  The Killing is dark, dreary, dismal and depressing.  I love alliteration.  You might need to double up on Zoloft by the time you're done with it, especially if you binge on the episodes.  I know that when I finished the stomach-churning final episode, I immediately had to dive back into the cartoon-hilarity of Weeds to cleanse my palate.But I'm getting a bit ahead of myself.  Fans were outraged when Rosie Larson's killer was falsely identified last season, leaving another full season of twists and turns to discover just who killed this poor young girl.  When the second season starts, politician Darren Richmond is heading into surgery because of the gunshot from last season's finale, Sarah Linden is on her way (finally) to move to California (spoilers: that doesn't work out), Holder is dealing with the fallout of the Richmond arrest and the Larson family is pretty much falling deeper into depression the likes of which they'll probably never be able to fully escape.  Linden discovers that the photo of Richmond pinpointing him near the scene of the crime was faked.  But faked by whom?  Obviously, this pulls her back into the quagmire of the Rosie Larson case.The truth is, Season Two starts off quickly and spirals into conspiracy theories and worries of mental illness.  The beginning episodes have an intensity befitting the best paranoid thriller.  Linden doesn't trust anyone and starts to believe that everyone around her, including her partner, is in on some grand plot.  Unfortunately for her, as we begin to learn of her past, everyone thinks she's just crazy.  The first half of this season is excellent and the pacing is a bit quicker and more intense that anything the first season had to offer.  It's also a lot more focused, tying up the stories a lot better than the way the first season simply discarded plot threads after utilizing them as red herrings.  It's only the last half of the season where I started to feel like the show was dragging out the ultimate epiphany.Once the truth of Rosie Larson's murder is in the open, I felt pretty ambivalent.  It wasn't until the last half of the last episode where I felt gut punched by some realizations about the characters that I left with a bad taste in my mouth.  The Killing can be a nasty, nasty show, filled with broken characters and broken dreams.  And no one gets a happy ending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9PXUWHU9I4C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QRF1PO#wasThisHelpful","R9PXUWHU9I4C1","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a fan of Logitech keyboards for years.  They seem to offer the most features for the buck and, even though I've seen tons of reviews slamming their build quality, I've never had any issues with any of them.  I've pretty much used all of the recent models, to include the original G19, the mechanical G710+ and the more sparse G510s.  This particular keyboard is a refresh of the G19 model from 2009 and honestly it's one of the weaker refreshes I've seen from Logitech.  On the surface, the only noticeable difference is the color, which is now a metallic blue as opposed to being pure black.  Apparently, the LCD screen is of better quality and doesn't break.  I didn't realize this was a problem on the G19 since mine is still working today (I got it when it first came out in 2009).Who really needs a $200 keyboard? I mean, seriously, unless it offers something truly magnificent, games have been gaming for years with crappy come-with-the-PC keyboards for years. So what exactly is Logitech bringing to the table with their premium priced keyboard?The G19s is nicely laid out, with all of the obvious/normal keys a regular-sized keyboard should have. Of course, it comes with all the little fangled things you'd expect, like back-lit keys. You can change the colors to your liking. The keys all have a nice, springy feel to them. There's also a switch that turns the keyboard to ""game mode"" so that you don't accidently press a button that throws you out of the game. The biggest features, though, are the ones that will mostly benefit MMO-players. For starters, you have twelve ""G"" keys, fully mappable keys that, with the push of a button, can change to another completely different set of twelve keys. There's three ""M"" settings, meaning that those twelve keys technically can have 36 different customizable uses. Another nicety is that you can assign those buttons to specific games (the keyboard software comes loaded with quite a huge variety of games, both new and old) so that when a game loads, it instinctively loads the button combination for that particular game.The software is the same that comes with the Logitech G13 Advanced Gameboard. The software, as I've mentioned in my review of the G13, can be both terrific and terrible. It will automatically scan your computer and load up games that it finds and has a loadout for. In my experience, however, it doesn't always work as intended. I'd say that it only located about a fourth of the games that were actually on my computer and completely ignored any of my Steam games. If it doesn't locate your games, it adds a few steps to getting them set up and it took me awhile to figure out exactly what I could and couldn't do with the software. What's nice, though, is that if you have both the G19 and G13 plugged in, the software automatically detects them and shares a single loadout.The G19s comes with a full color LCD screen that has a variety of apps. So you can watch your PC's performance, queue up the media display to see what songs you're listening to, have a clock so you can keep track of the time, etc. It also has a movie viewer, which you can load up anything on your hard drive and watch...on a very, very tiny screen. I guess for someone who wants to watch a program while waiting for a raid to get going, this is very useful, but the small screen (for me at least) isn't conducive to movie/TV-watching.  This screen was lacking useful apps back in 2009 and I don't really see much difference in this new model.  The most useful aspect of it is for MMOs, where stats (e.g., health etc in Guild Wars 2) can be displayed.  What I usually rely on, though, is the Ventrilo app that shows who's speaking and has some useful Ventrilo information so you don't have to Alt-Tab out of the game.Honestly, I don't really see much differentiating this from the cheaper, original model.  The color is different and apparently the LCD works better.  But those looking to upgrade or those looking at spending the money, just know that while I still love this keyboard and haven't had any problems with it, the original model is still cheaper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QRRMAXKD1J1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCEK2M4#wasThisHelpful","R1QRRMAXKD1J1I","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's impossible to discuss A Haunted House without acknowledging the Scary Movie franchise because not only did Marlon Wayans co-create Scary Movie, but the latest in that franchise just came out recently and parodies some of the same films.  Before Scary Movie was neutered and smashed into the ground into some ridiculous teen parody film, it actually was pretty entertaining.  The first film, in particular, was actually a decent parody and pretty strictly followed the original Scream's story with dialogue taken directly from the script and, most of the time, warped into comedic sensibilities.  While it catered to the lowest common denominator and was filled to the brim with juvenile humor, it also showcased a team that had comedic timing and knew the rules of the genre it was aping (slasher).  It also wasn't just unfunny vignettes with no real over-arching plot tying it together.So now we have A Haunted House, with Marlon Wayans back in the writing and starring role.  And while it's a step up from what's become of the Scary Movie franchise, it still not as good as the movie that started it all.  A lot of the jokes feel ""been there, done that...only better before.""  The only reason the movie succeeds at all is based on the comedic timing and chemistry between Marlon Wayans and Essence Atkins.  When A Haunted House begins, Malcolm Johnson (Wayans) is expecting his girlfriend Kisha (Atkins) to move in and he, as is required of a found footage film, wants to film everything.  The opening is actually quite smile-inducing because Wayans plays on the found footage genre and throws in a couple funny homages (e.g., quick-panning to the house keeper to startle the viewers, girl arriving and accidentally killing the dog, etc.).  The dialogue is quick, often-times funny, if not laugh-out-loud, and surprisingly subtle.  When a knife is found on the floor and Kisha goes crazy, saying that the house is haunted, I couldn't help but smile because of how quickly they were willing to jump to the paranormal.  The first half is funny and follows Paranormal Activity pretty well.Then things start to go downhill, as they introduce the go-to-actors to play their stereotypical parts.  Here we have Nick Swardson playing Chip the Psychic, bringing up gay jokes and making Malcolm uncomfortable.  Racism gets addressed as David Koechner shows up, playing the role he always does as the racist Security Man.  Here, the humor relies on very similar (if not the same) jokes Marlon Wayans has mined in the first two Scary Movies (there's even a ghostly sex session...scratch that, two ghostly sex sessions...that is nowhere near as chuckle-inducing as it was with Tori Spelling).  As the movie continued, it felt like it was dragging much longer than the short 86ish minute running time.The only thing that kept me going was the comedic timing of Essence Atkins specifically and the chemistry between her and Wayans.  They manage to elevate, however small, the score.  I was kind of hoping a return to the original Scary Movie and, to some degree, I got just that.  Just not in a good way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCGVVP3LY50SJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2YV9SO#wasThisHelpful","RCGVVP3LY50SJ","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since I got into gaming, I have been a headset junkie. When you spent most of your PC gaming time playing co-operative games that require VOIP, it just seemed to work better for me than to rely on speakers and a standalone mic. As such, I've gone through more headsets than I could probably describe. Some have been awesome, others not so much. Since I've used and reviews plenty headsets in my time, I've kind of come up with a guideline for reviewing. When I use a headset, I grade it by four things: comfort, sound quality, mic quality and durability. I'm not really used to using headsets with my consoles (except for the mic/headset for my Xbox 360 when playing multiplayer games).  I didn't know how I would like using a console headset when I have 5.1 surround in my room already.  But let's get into the specifics.In terms of comfort, this was easily the most comfortable headset I've used in awhile. I have a large head and a lot of times headsets can give me a headache when first using them because they scrunch my skull.  That's not the case with this headset.  It fits comfortably and will be even more comfortable as time goes by.The sound quality is fantastic. The psuedo surround sound sounds good, though it can't compete to my receiver.  But it does a great job of balancing talking with game sounds, so that I'm never constantly changing settings (of which there are 8 presets).  It's very nice and sounds great.Durability is another area that's important, especially when you're spending over $200 on a headset. The XP400 is very durable. I like the way the mic works and bends.  It's also detachable.Mic quality is also very important to me because I use it to communicate constantly with my friends who are spread out across the nation. Mic quality is also something very hard to review. No one complains when I talk and it pairs well with my cellphone and no one complains with that sound either.Pairing the headset with everything worked really well.  It has about 15 hours of battery life.  If you're looking to spend in the neighborhood of $200, then this is a great choice in headset.  But I would recommend the XP510 if you're looking to spend this kind of money.

"I fell in love with the Dyson vaccuum back in 2006, when I purchased my first one.  It, to this day, works just as great as it did the day I brought it up.  I was curious how this LG Kompressor vacuum would stand up to my Dyson, since it's a competitively priced alternative.Right away one of the features I appreciated was the button to switch the vaccuum from carpet to hard floors.  My older Dyson does not have this ability and was pretty useless in my kitchen/bathroom/litterbox area.  It works great on hard floors (I have linoleum).  When I used it on my carpets, I quickly fell in love, as well.  It works just as well, if not better than my Dyson.  The carpet looks immaculate and you can tell it's been vacuumed.  It has a smaller dirt container than my Dyson and at first I thought this would be a huge complaint for me, but honestly it's better for two reasons: 1) it is easier to clean and 2) it has a little wand that compresses the dirt.  This makes it less dirty/messy when I have to clean it and it also compresses the dirt so honestly it holds about as much as the bigger Dyson.The biggest thing I was looking forward to was trying the vacuum on pet hair.  I have a maine coon cat and another cat which is like a furball bomb.  She goes ""POOF!"" and her short hair goes everywhere.  I swear, she shreds more than my maine coon cat.  So I have tons of hair on one hand and very thick heavy fur on the other.  This machine vacuumed it up and left my floor looking great.  The wand attachment works great and I appreciate the length and ease of use.  It does a great job on my couches, sucking up cat fur.I have two complaints.  The first is that it makes a clicking sound when I lean the vacuum back and I don't know how to fix it.  It sounds like plastic rubbing against plastic.  The other is a lack of places on the vacuum to store the wand attachments...there's like none.  And coming from my Dyson, where everything had a place and it was easy to keep everything together, this one has no visible place to store things.Overall, it's a great alternative to Dyson and does a fantastic job both in cleaning up cat fur and also working on hard floors.  Very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R327BDPMD41GX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RQP4Z6#wasThisHelpful","R327BDPMD41GX7","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a maine coon cat.  She has incredibly thick, thick hair.  And lots of it.  Consequently, she has hair in bad places that can cause a mess when she needs to take care of her business.  I decided something needed to be done but I don't want to bring my cat to be groomed constantly.  I bought the Oster A5 pet clipper which worked pretty well.  My poor cat had a few very tight knots near her skin and it had a tough, tough time getting rid of those.  So when I was offered the A6 to review, I jumped at the chance.  Overall, the A6 works great.  It's surprisingly quieter than my A5, which is a plus with a skittish cat.  It doesn't get as hot as the A5, even though it seems to be more powerful.  It's also slimmer and definitely more usable than the A5.  The biggest issue is that my roommate took the blade attachment off because he thought it was a replaceable blade and now I can't figure out how to get it back on.  Just don't do that.  Otherwise, it's a fantastic, thinner, more powerful grooming tool and one that I can readily recommend for thick cat fur.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V7BN51PO9ZGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADWJSVC#wasThisHelpful","R1V7BN51PO9ZGT","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a D-Link fan ever since I had to upgrade from my old, old (remember the blue wireless with bunny ears?) Linskys router and never looked back.  I've recently used the D-Links most expensive, ""gaming-centric"" model which has been working well until recently.  First I started noticing that my cell phones kept saying they were attached but were still not receiving data.  Then other portable devices started having issues.  When offered this Linksys router, I jumped at the chance because of the problems I'd been having with the D-Link one (that I spent about $150 on, for comparison).  I have to say that this router is the easiest to use/set-up router and also the fastest.Right now, there are three people in my house who are constant users of streaming options.  At any one time, I probably have two Roku boxes and a wireless TV streaming at the same time.  As well as cell phones/tablets.  So there's a lot of streaming going on.  Whereas my D-Link router seemed to be having issues with all of them going at once, this new router has kept up and there's never been a dip in quality from the HD programming.  It simply handles it.Speaking of simply handling it, while I'm not tech-newbie, I appreciate devices that easily set up and don't require a lot of tinkering.  The N900 definitely goes this route with a CD starter that actually is useful.  It's simple plug and play when you insert the disk, which sets up the name, password and immediately creates a security level (which you can tinker with later) and you're up and running.  It literally took less than five minutes and all of the devices immediately synched up with the new router, as if it had never changed.  For individuals who want to tinker more with the settings, it still offers up the usual tech options but this router seems made to make you not have to/want to do it.  I honestly didn't have to do any tinkering for mine.It also has an app you can download to your phone, which is handy in some ways.  I haven't dug around too much into it, but one neat thing is that you can see what devices are connected to your router and it might come as a surprise to realize just how much your house is connected.  I looked at it and went ""no way is there twelve devices connected to my router!"" but yeah, there was.  Anyway, my little detour aside, this router is sleek and sexy-looking and operates just as reliably and easily as I hoped.  Linksys has surprised me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM4RPNYAOMQPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IL7AKM#wasThisHelpful","RM4RPNYAOMQPL","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This floor lamp is very, very nice, especially given the price.  It stands just under 6' tall, was incredibly easy to set up and offers both a nice room-enhancing light and a smaller reading light.  The rotary switch offers options for both or only one of the lights on.  The only complaints I can levy at this is that my other lamps have two rotary switches, one for each lamp, and that the larger light (100 watt) would be a tri-setting lamp to get different lighting options or that it was a higher/brighter wattage.

"You wake up in a small room, with a young woman sitting in the corner.  You don't know where you are or how you got here.  The woman calls herself Phi and seems to know you.  But she either can't--or won't--tell you how.  Once you figure out how to exit the room, you meet seven other individuals, most of whom seem to have a connection to at least one other person in the room.  None of them know why they are there, where they are or what lies in store.  Before you can really gather your bearings, a rabbit puppet of sorts appears on a screen in the warehouse room you are standing in and, much like the Saw movies, the rabbit wants to play a game.  And, also much like Saw, it doesn't seem like the game is stacked in your favor.Welcome to the rabbit hole that is Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward, a visual novel of a game that combines the novel and puzzle/logic puzzles.  A sequel to 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors, it builds on the universe created in the original game and fans of that will run into some surprising revelations.  However, if you're like me, then this is your first introduction to the games and let me tell you, you're in for a doozy.  The game is split between copious amounts of reading that's voice acted (unlike 999) and puzzle solving, where you are in a room and you have to figure out a way to escape it, usually by solving logic problems and puzzle solving.  Once in a while, you have to participate in yet a different type of game called The Ambidex Room.  At this point you (and your partner, if you are paired that way) must decide whether to ally or betray a person in a different Ambidex Room.  It's the standard prisoner dilemma: if you both ally, you gain two points; if one side betrays and the other allies, the betrayer gets three points and the ally-er loses two points; if both sides betray, nothing happens.  The goal is to gain nine points.  If you hit 0 points, you get ""penalized,"" which isn't pleasant.So what do you do?  Trust that the person(s) in the next room are going to ally with you (the most logical choice since you both gain two points)?  Or do you fear that, regardless of what they say, they will choose betray?  The exit only opens once...do you really believe the other person has your interest at heart?It's this question that's at the heart of Virtue's Last Reward.  Surrounding that central theme is a myriad of questions involving science, human nature and other spoilerific questions that open up about as many questions.  To say that Virtue's Last Reward is surprisingly heady for a video game is an understatement.  Plot twists abound that make you question what's happening.  Each time you make a decision on whether to ally or betray and at other times in the story, you split off into a different story strand that will lead you to a different ending.  Ultimately there's 24 different endings; however, unlike most games you will probably see every single one.  A new feature in this game is the ability to swap between the different timelines at will and the way the game is structured, in order to solve the mysteries and understand everything that's happening, you will see every possible ending.  It's spectacular, especially the way this game mechanic ties into the story.As the game gets rolling, I found myself unable to quit playing.  I'm not usually a fan of portable game machines unless I'm out and about.  Chances are, if I'm home and playing games it'd be on my console or PC.  Zero Escape has changed this.  I have spent more time than I can count, perched on my couch or bed, playing this silly game.  It's a clich, but I truly do lose track of time when I'm in this world.  It is so involving and the puzzles are so tied into the story that I don't realize I've been playing for an hour or two.  To get through the game, you will probably spend upwards of 30 hours.  And that's ""X""ing through the dialogue and not listening to the voice actors talk the entire time.  A nice addition, given the fact that you will see story portions again in order to choose a different path, you can hit ""skip"" and it will fast=-forward through the scenes you've seen before and stop when new dialogue is introduced.  It's an awesome addition and makes replaying areas drag less.Ultimately, Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward is easily one of my favorite games this year.  It's intelligent, the translation is top-notch and the English voice acting is pretty decent (purists can select the original Japanese track--a nice surprise).  The story kept me enthralled and the logic puzzles--while sometimes forcing me to resort to walkthroughs--never feel obtrusive.  If you own a PS Vita or a 3DS, this is truly a must own game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EA85BRF4LY2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FMSDU0#wasThisHelpful","R2EA85BRF4LY2T","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Detention is what happens when a 90s-obsessed music video director gets high and gorges on Scream 4, Donnie Darko and Kevin Smith movies.  It begins with a high school girl lying in bed and breaking the fourth wall, espousing on her rules of existing as a high school hottie, with her rules being written on the screen a la Zombieland.  She is quickly (and thankfully) eviscerated by a surprising original and creepy-looking killer, modeled off of a fictitious horror show (a la Scream/Stab) called Cinderhella and its sequel.  The movie proper begins, this time with our lower-class, French-fry -in-bed-eating loser protagonist who also breaks the fourth wall (this happens a lot).  As Detention then introduces our unlikely protagonists who talk as if they wanted to be in a Kevin Smith film and dissect the horror movie they are in, all the while getting confused whether the murderer is replicating Cinderhella or Scream.  I think that's when they introduce the time-traveling stuffed bear.  I don't know.  I was on Ambien the first time I watched it.Why is it called Detention?  Well, about an hour into the film (approximately 30 minutes from the end), they end up in (Breakfast Club alert!) Saturday Detention during their prom because the principal (Dane Cook) believes that since they were near one of the people who was killed (who apparently has fly blood (The Fly) and lived for the first 13ish years of his life with his hand in a TV...I can't make this stuff up) one of them is obviously the killer so let's all get together for Detention instead of going to prom.  From there, time travel, body-swapping, end-of-the-world (Donnie Darko) shenanigans all come to play that I forgot I was watching a movie supposedly about a slasher-killer.Honestly, I don't really know what to say about Detention.  I did laugh periodically throughout and I appreciated some of what director Joseph Kahn was aiming for.  He takes shots at music video directors thinking they can be feature film directors (i.e., him) and the movie Torque (also by him) and continues the trend set up in Scream 4 in dissecting not only modern day horror but also the Twitter/Facebook/YouTube nature of pop culture today.  At one point, the Detentionees find footage of upcoming Cinderhella 3 and, much like the much superior opening to Scream 4, it is a movie inside a movie inside a movie, all wrapped around being in Saturday detention.  But when something takes a kitchen sink approach to filmmaking, it can either be absolutely enthralling and entertaining (see: American Horror Story) or needlessly exhausting (see: Detention).  I think it was around the moment of the mother/daughter body/time-swapping that my eyes glazed over.  Or it could have been the Ambien.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3US31VF7GV936/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081FSMNI#wasThisHelpful","R3US31VF7GV936","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I approached Angelmaker with some reluctance.  When offered to review it, I almost passed.  I read Nick Harkaway's debut novel, The Gone-Away World...well, okay, I read about half of it.  That was a book that plodded along, contained some of the most verbose passages I've read this side of Victor Hugo and was too tangential in its story-telling to really keep me involved.  I eventually caved and chose Angelmaker because of the synopsis (which was exactly why I chose his debut).Basically, Angelmaker is about an antique clock fixer named Joe Spork.  His father was an infamous criminal nicknamed ""Tommy Gun,"" but Joe turned his back on the mobster family history to live a quiet life.  One day, he activates an unusual mechanism for his client, Edie Banister, a retired international secret agent.  Long story short, the mechanism is an old doomsday machine that Joe has trigged and now is being chased by the British government and a dictator who also happens to be Banister's arch-nemesis.  Mix in a side story romance and other crazy shenanigans and you have Angelmaker.First a couple pluses: I actually finished this one.  And I found it to be pretty darn entertaining.  Much like Gone-Away World, Harkaway can writes scenarios that are both witfully entertaining and exciting.  But he can also get so bogged down in his own inventiveness and literary-mindedness that he rambles.  His story, again like his debut, flits around between time periods and characters that don't seem even remotely connected, before tying it all together in the end.  Inventive and fun, but needlessly padded.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28T40H9ZGS21T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307595951#wasThisHelpful","R28T40H9ZGS21T","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not exactly sure what to say about these dishes.  They came expertly wrapped for shipment and when I took them out, I was a bit amazed at the beauty of them.  They have a very modern and minimalistic design; I love the gentle curves of the plates and the way the bowls look.  The mugs' handles are very unique, too.

"I had a previous Norelco Bodygroom razor that I absolutely loved for the most delicate areas.  So when I was offered a chance to review this one, I decided to give it a shot.  Depending on what you're using this for, you'll have better luck.  I don't think the razor is the best for certain parts of the body.  Using the attachments to cut specific lengths for trimming work, but sometimes I found it pulling instead of trimming.  When you take the trimmer parts off to use on...golf balls, for example, it tended to nick the oh-so-please-be-gentle parts.  It does come with an extender that you can use to shave your back with, which is nice.That said, I ended up going back to my previous model because, when it comes to golf balls, you want to have the closest, smoothest and, most importantly, least painful experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WSLDX6VUMTNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VB50LU#wasThisHelpful","R2WSLDX6VUMTNR","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love this device.  If you own an i-product and want full sounding speakers (and don't mind spending a bit for it), then definitely check this product out.  Setup is pretty easy, though kind of annoying in a needless way.  You have to download an app from the iOS store, plug your device into the machine (where it will also charge your device) and setup the wireless functions that way.  Once you're done with this step, you can delete the app since any Apple product on your network will work with the device.  Streaming to the UE Air Speaker is easy.  All you have to do is click the AirPlay button on your device and it streams to the speakers wonderfully.  It works with pretty much any audio app on the device.  Mainly, I use Spotify and have an instant playlist and music selection pumping out of the speakers.  Obviously, if you don't have an Apple device then look somewhere else.Now, I wasn't honestly expecting much from a sound perspective, even though the price is premium, but I was blown away.  Bass, in particular, sounds rich without vibrations in the speakers.  This thing pumps out awesome sound.  House-filling sound, actually.  I was very surprised.The nice thing about the UE Air Speaker is the minimalistic nature of it.  It basically has a power button and a volume control button.  With your iPhone/iPod, you don't really need anything else.  The charger base pops in/out to add to the minimalistic design.  The biggest problem, though, is that with the new Lightning connector, your new fangled iProduct might not work with it.  I was lucky to have this before I upgraded to an iPhone 5 but obviously now it won't plug into the base.  I don't have the new connector so I can't say how that works converting the Lightning connector to the old format.That's probably the biggest problem with this product, which is of no fault to Logitech.  Otherwise, it is absolutely fantastic and rich sounding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS7STIGBXI5XI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JW6WQU#wasThisHelpful","RS7STIGBXI5XI","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Songbooks are usually a flip of the coin in terms of how good they are and what you are looking for.  Sometimes, you'll get books that incorporate the singing melody in the piano part, while also trying as best as possible to keep the background music going, to create a solo piano piece.  Others are simply the piano part, complete with spaces and other instrumental breaks for the other band members.  Others still try to make a complete piece that, while not including the vocal melody in the piano part, you can play from beginning to end.  This piano songbook tries to do the latter and, for the most part, it's one of the best piano books I've played for rock music.Honestly, Muse is probably one of the best bands to pick for a pianist, simply because most of the bombastic music incorporates pianos to some degree.  This songbook collects some of the better songs from a piano-playing perspective from every album up to Resistance.  There are some amazing songs here and most of them are incredibly fun to play.  This songbook incorporates the background music and leaves the vocal melody to the vocal line.  So if you're looking for a piano book that incorporates the vocal melody in with the piano part, look elsewhere.  The music is an accompaniment piece.  While this is sometimes a negative for me, since I just want to jam out to some songs as a complete piece, for the most part the background music here is so fascinating and fun to play that it doesn't matter.  Some songs contained here are absolutely fantastic to play on the piano.  The entire Exogenesis: Symphony is included and is quite simply the reason to buy the book.  It is written to the score, note-for-note keyboard transcriptions mixed with other instruments to be a complete symphonic piece you can play on the piano.  It also includes the vocal line, too.  But even without the vocal part being included in the piano melody, it still sounds and plays fantastic.  Ditto ""United States of Eurasia (+ Collateral Damage).""  While you'll never play the vocal part, the background piano melody is fun and gets pretty complicated, with lots of arpeggios and octaves, with some odd and sometimes tricky rhythms for the bass notes.  It's a great song that builds wonderfully to the end (i.e. Eura-SIA! SIA! SIA!) and sounds fantastic.  And then, of course, the segue into ""+ Collateral Damage,"" which is a condensed version of Chopin's Nocturne in E Flat Major and is a beautiful coda to a loud/bombastic song.  This is the song I'm currently learning and it's provided me hours of entertainment as I work through it.Other songs don't fare as well.  I was excited to have ""Apocalypse Please"" because of its bombastic opening.  But the piano part is literally that same bombastic chord structure for about half of the song.  Fun to play and bang out on the piano, but not when you're playing it, without change, for the first two/three pages.  It's a song that's better suited to have the piano as an accompaniment part, as opposed to a solo to play.  I'm sure a band that wanted to play the song would get more use out of this particular arrangement than the solo pianist.  This also goes for other songs, like ""Feeling Good.""  Fantastic song and if you plan on using the book as an accompaniment piece for a singer, it's great.  But as a piano solo it's not so fun simply because it repeats the same chord progression and notes for most of the song.  Again, note-for-not transcriptions and is exactly as Matt Bellamy plays it.Overall, The Muse Songbook does a great job of picking songs that sound great and feature the piano.  Everything from ""Butterflies & Hurricanes"" to the Exogenesis: Symphony is showcased.  It's not about their most popular songs or singles or anything (notice the lack of ""Supermassive Black Hole,"" ""Time is Running Out,"" ""Knights of Cydonia,"" etc.), it's about songs that feature piano and could be turned into a complete song.  It's a fantastic songbook that truly features the awesome piano parts that go into creating a Muse song and really helps showcase just how rhythmic and complicated their music is.  I would definitely recommend this for any Muse pianist aficionado.  Just know that you aren't getting a book of piano solos, per se, and that the book is written note-for-note for a lot of it.  As such, it's definitely intermediate or higher.One of the best piano songbooks I've purchased, hands down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N917EAMBOLL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0739082795#wasThisHelpful","R2N917EAMBOLL9","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When a book is compared to the hilarious and now classic Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, you expect a lot.  And when I first began reading Year Zero, I thought, finally, a book would live up to its jacket comparisons.  Nick Carter (no relation to the Backstreet Boy) is a low-level entertainment lawyer who receives an unexpected visitation from two aliens, one dressed as a nun, the other as a mullah who think he is THE Nick Carter.  Apparently, everyone outside of Earth makes absolutely abysmal music.  And ever since ""Year Zero,"" (i.e. 1977) when they discovered our music, they have been hopelessly (and erotically) addicted to the dulcet sounds.  Unfortunately for the rest of the cosmos, a little thing called musical piracy results in potentially bankrupting the entire universe.  The two aliens--Frampton and Carly, obvs--are hoping that the ""famous"" Nick Carter will be their one and only hope to clean up the mess because the rest of the cosmos has an easy solution to their problems: Destroy Earth.Year Zero was written by Rob Reid, an entrepeneur some music enthusiasts might know: the company he founded launched Rhapsody.  So his understanding of the music industry and the sometimes (oftentimes) silly laws and regulations surrounding copywrite law is top notch.  And when he stays in this territory, he's absolutely hilarious in skewering music execs and everyone in between.  In some ways, the book reminds me of Ready Player One in the way it namedrops musicians, bands and other musical tropes.  Unlike Ready Player One, once it strays from its known genre, it starts to fall apart.  Once cosmic reality TV shows and other obstacles are thrown in the way of our intrepid heroes, Year Zero starts to lose its pacing and focus.  And what started out as a strong and hilariously vicious satire of the music industry turns into a morass of pop culture that doesn't really find its footing.Ultimately, I didn't really enjoy the book.  But the humor in the beginning and its brilliant thumbing of the music industry provided enough smiles and laughter that I had to bump it up a bit in the score.  Entertaining but ultimately not very fulfilling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33KJXSRKQORGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345534417#wasThisHelpful","R33KJXSRKQORGK","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Additionally, plugging it directly into my Roku player, I was able to easily access the videos from there and watch them.

"Reviewing diet/fitness aids like Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite is very difficult.  As you no doubt see from the reviews already here, some people love it, some hate it and some are ambivalent about it.  The truth is that, until you actually try a product, you won't know how your body will react to it, whether it will work or whether side effects will be present.  Each person reviewing this item has had a pretty different experience.  I will give you what I've experienced so far.I'm not usually into the pill scene for dieting.  I've lost 50 lbs on my own, but have recently started hitting constant plateaus.  So when offered the chance to review this product, I decided to take the plunge.  I started it four days ago.  The instructions say to start with one pill, then on day two take two, then days three and beyond to take two pills twice a day.  I didn't do that. I started with one pill and I think that I will continue with that for the foreseeable future.  When I first took the pill, I stopped drinking coffee.  I had a ton of energy and felt vaguely warm all day.  I purposefully started the pill the day I had a doctor's appointment so I could check my blood pressure while on it, since I have bad blood pressure, take pills for it and am worried about how any medication will affect it.  My blood pressure was a little higher than it normally is, but it was still in the good realm so I felt pretty good.I noticed that I had more energy and was more focused than I have been, which is good.  A lot of people have commented about stomach issues.  I will say that while I don't feel nauseous, it has given me some issues that I'm going to watch and if they continue stop with the pill.  It's also supposed to be an appetite suppressant, but that hasn't  done anything for me.  I'm still hungry at normal times.  I will say, though, that I seem to get full quicker and am given a feeling of when to stop which is something that hasn't ever happened to me before.  The proof, though, is in the pudding, they say.  And I will say that over the last four days, I have lost about four pounds.  This has helped me break a plateau I've been plagued with for a while.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17QYV5XPOGHHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007LAHS2K#wasThisHelpful","R17QYV5XPOGHHB","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ali and Ramazan is based on a true story of two orphan lovers, living on the streets.  One was a hustler, the other sniffed glue.  The story hit author Perihan Magden and stayed with her for many years.  Eventually, she sat down to write their very slim story, based solely on a couple newspaper articles.  What struck her was how careless and forgetful the article was of these two individuals.  I have a lot of respect for the author, a journalist and activist and I have a feeling her works read brilliantly in her native Turkish language; however, as much as I wanted to get swept up in Ali and Ramazan's tragic story, it failed to engage with me on any emotional level.Maybe it was a detachment to the cruelty and terribleness of their situation, but Magden piles on tragedy and pain by the truckload to the point that their story becomes so weighted down by tragedy that it verges on the cartoonish.  The beginning of the story, in which Ali and Ramazan meet at an orphanage and slowly and tentatively fall into love with each other is very touching and portends a good coming of age story, albeit a tragic one.  Once they get to the streets, though, and both fall into self-destructive patterns (i.e., hustling and glue-sniffing), I started to not believe their love for one another.  As translated by Ruth Whitehouse, the characters seem broadly written and don't contain as much character as I expected.  I never felt motivation in either of the character's struggles and conquests.  It just read like a downward spiral of stock characters.  I'm not sure whether it's something that was lost in translation or not, but it did not connect with me in a meaningful way.I wanted nothing more than to be swept up in this tragic story, but it just did not engage me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSBYEWJYK59RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611091411#wasThisHelpful","RSBYEWJYK59RJ","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every once in awhile, artists/novelists/etc try to stretch themselves and try something different.  Christopher Moore has been slowly moving in this direction, first with his last book Fool and its comical take on King Lear and now with Sacre Bleu.  Sacre Bleu (or Sacred Blue) dives into the art world, spinning a tale that begins with the murder of Van Gogh and jumps from there to discuss his contemporaries, artists all.  One thread that holds it all together is a little man, the Colorman, who seems obsessed with the color blue and a female muse, of sorts, who inspires painters to paint.What follows is a murder mystery, of sorts, where Van Gogh's friends Lucien Lessard and bon vivant Henri Toulouse-Lautrec start to track what exactly happened.  Along the way, they learn about the mysterious Colorman and his female friend.  Christopher Moore is a good comedic writer and while I can appreciate the history context and the way he incorporated real life artists and gave them a spark of life, I did not find this novel as exciting or interesting as his earlier work.  Maybe if I were more involved in the art world, I could appreciate the story a bit more...but to be blunt, I just did not care.I mostly continued reading because Christopher Moore can turn a phrase and writes dialogue very well, even though it sometimes felt anachronistic in this novel.  Not one of his better novels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DR1TX5H9S4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061779741#wasThisHelpful","R2DR1TX5H9S4A","A268EEWUXYCA8Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A268EEWUXYCA8Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer: I love Guillermo del Toro. As such, I'm probably the target audience for this series of books.

Meanwhile, a war erupts between Old and New World vampires, with humans stuck in the middle.  The Strain spent a lot of time world building, particularly with the virus strain.

Developed by one of my favorite game devlepers, Michel Ancel (Rayman, Beyond Good and Evil), it was a bunch of minigames centered around some diabolical yet adorable rabbit-looking creatures.

Alive & Kicking has 34 Quick Play games, 3 party games and some additional features.  The games are meant to be played mostly with 1-4 players, though the party games can have up to 16.The games run the gamut of smacking rabbids, avoiding projectiles or other obstacles, stomp on Rabbids, and basically just act silly.

I get that larger-chested women need to have them ""strapped in"" pretty well, but as a person with a perfectly nice but not enormous chest, I prefer to avoid that. I love the Beyond Yoga Lift and Support bras. They're cut in a way that's flattering but still very appropriate for athletic pursuits. Built-in padding is minimal, but sufficient to hide any pointy-ness. Although I usually prefer to wear them under a workout top, this is still a tasteful choice if you decide to go without a top over it. If you're really busty, you might have issues, though - especially if your activities include any kind of inverting.I will say that the color was a bit darker than in the picture. I like it either way, but if you're really particular about color, just be aware of that. I've attached a picture in hopes of showing it a little more accurately. It's also a lot softer than the other sports bras I own. If you're ever purchased Beyond Yoga pants,shorts, or capris, you'll notice quickly that this sports bra is made of the same kind of fabric.As far as sizing is concerned, I typically wear between a small and medium in tops and sports bras. Although I've found most Beyond Yoga things run a bit small, I found a size small to be perfect for me in the sports bras. I suspect that's because this is one thing where you actually want it to be fairly snug. In this case,the snugness makes it ideal for low to moderate impact activities. I'd recommend something a bit more intense if you're going to be running or jogging stairs.Overall, I'm very pleased, and I'll be buying more in other colors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WZIZTNWY0LZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMFDRK4#wasThisHelpful","R2WZIZTNWY0LZ6","A2SKSS5GW8NGY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SKSS5GW8NGY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my experience, Beyond Yoga bottoms seem to run about half a size smaller than brands like Athleta, Victoria's Secret, and Zella. These shorts were no exception,. Like some other people have mentioned, they do have a tendency to roll up if your hips are curvy. If you're more apple or banana than hourglass, you might not have that problem.Although I like these shorts, I tend to prefer them over a pair of contrasting color leggings. They're really short, and if you have much in the way of a butt (muscle or fat, either one), they get even shorter. They'd be great pole dancing shorts, if you're into pole fitness - lots of exposed skin for pole contact.I managed to get my pair on sale, and while I like them, I don't think I'd pay full price for them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UZUR13XMPDBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CP6AXD6#wasThisHelpful","R3UZUR13XMPDBZ","A2SKSS5GW8NGY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SKSS5GW8NGY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used headbands made of wider, stretchy fabric to hold my hair back when washing my face, and I've never had any problems with them slipping off my head. However, these just wouldn't stay put at all. Maybe my head is a weird shape - I'm perfectly willing to admit that's a possibility. I doubt it's a matter of hair type, since I have super thick hair. Unfortunately, these headbands are completely useless for me.On the bright side, they're very pretty and colorful. I would imagine that for some people, the rubber-y grip on the inside of the bands is plenty to keep them on their heads. No amount of adjusting would do it for me, though. If you've had no trouble with similar headbands in the past, you'll probably love these.

"For years, I've purchased the little jars of Wilton food coloring you find at big box general stores and craft stores. For years, I've found myself ever-so-slightly irritated at the process of getting out bit of food coloring on a toothpick or butter knife, then mixing it in, then realizing I didn't get enough, cleaning off my utensil and doing it again and again until the right color is reached. With this food coloring, that problem is no longer an issue. I love having food coloring in a squirt bottle instead of a jar. It may not be as easy to get the very last bit out of the bottle, but for convenience, it can't be beaten. You can also minimize that problem by storing the jars upside down in the original box.In terms of color, I couldn't be happier. It didn't take nearly as much coloring as I expected to achieve really vibrant, bright colors. I will say that if you're looking for primary colors, you might not be totally happy with the blue. It's definitely more of a sky blue than a regular blue. The rest of the colors are exactly what you'd probably expect, though. I've included a picture of some cookies with the blue (and red and green) so you can get an idea of what you're getting.Since I often bake at my parents' home, I'll be buying a second set of these for their house before the fall and winter baking season is upon us. I'm very glad to have found this food coloring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R81WAOHXJIAXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026N2Y3U#wasThisHelpful","R81WAOHXJIAXV","A2SKSS5GW8NGY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SKSS5GW8NGY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book a couple years ago, and it was a quick, happy little read. I didn't expect to be wildly impressed by the movie, but it turned out to be one of those rare cases where the movie is actually better than the book. Why? The book is short, and it doesn't go the best job of really capturing the experiences Hector has on the road. It doesn't capture the utterly boring, unsatisfying existence Hector was plodding through before his trip. It describes those things, just not as well as the film version.In the movie, you get wonderful acting, beautiful scenery, and widely varied pace from place to place. When Hector goes off on a patient in the beginning, you FEEL his frustration with the life he's leading. When he's living the high life in China, you really get a taste of the excitement and anticipation he would surely be feeling. When he finally lets loose and dances with his friends in Africa, you smile because you know he's a changed man.I'm not saying the book was bad at all, but this is one of those rare cases where the story is better told in film format, and all the right things came together to make it a good one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3THM77TI58K7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SAUBP92#wasThisHelpful","R3THM77TI58K7M","A2SKSS5GW8NGY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SKSS5GW8NGY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Skippy Natural is my favorite peanut butter. I like that it doesn't have high fructose corn syrup like most mainstream peanut butters, but it DOES have sugar to make it sweet. I don't eat a lot of added sugar products, and nobody's going to convince me that a little in my peanut butter is such a terrible thing. Although the package says no-stir, there's a good chance you might have to stir once or twice if your jar was sitting for quite a while. Personally, I keep a few jars in my cabinet at all times and store them upside down. It seems to fix the oil at the top problem by the time I get around to using it. Stirring does fix the problem, but you have to stir really well and all the way down to the bottom if you don't want the top half to be much runnier than the bottom half.The only thing I don't like about this version of Skippy Natural is that it comes in a 40 ounce container. I needed some ASAP and this is what Amazon had in stock at the time, though, so I bought it. I don't like the way the knife handle gets all peanut butter-y when you get to the bottom of the jar. Otherwise, I'm very happy with this, and I'll continue to buy Skippy Natural. The only thing that would make me happier is if they got rid of the palm oil.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q71NPXC57S33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZWI61U#wasThisHelpful","R3Q71NPXC57S33","A2SKSS5GW8NGY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SKSS5GW8NGY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever seen a cute baking project on Pinterest and failed miserably in your recreation? Do you wish you could create cute, edible snacks for the people in your life? If so, this might be exactly what you're looking for.Although I love a good baking project, I don't always have countless hours to spend on them. Making multi-layered cakes with 5 different colors or frosting or fondant can be really time-consuming. Working with candy, on the other hand, is much faster. There's also a much greater margin for error, since most of the important pieces are pre-made.The one caution with this book is that you can't just open it up and expect to be able to make everything with a quick trip to the store. Most things are pretty easy to find, but there are some candies you might need to hunt for (or order online in advance). Some recipes do include a little bit of advance baking or prep work. Don't wait until the last minute, or you'll be very limited in which items you can make.

"I really didn't want to buy these traps. Unfortunately, after spending weeks attempting to catch and release all the moths in my apartment (and throwing out tons of bad food), I had to either get traps or settle for living with moths in my home. I have pet birds, and I suspect the moths came in with dove seed or spray millet.The hard thing about having birds and moths is that you can't use just any pest control method. Birds have extremely delicate respiratory systems and you can kill them or cause severe lung damage if you're not careful. Sprays are completely out of the question unless you relocate the birds for a week or more to let the place air out (and then wipe everything down for residue). These traps were labeled as bird safe and several other bird people mentioned that they worked well in their homes, so I bought them.I do want to note that I didn't put the traps NEAR the birds, though. They were all at least a room away, and I made sure the birds were closely monitored any time they were out of the cage. I have no idea whether the trap would be dangerous if they chewed on it (as parrots so often do with many things).I still feel bad about killing all those moths, but I have to admit the traps worked extremely well. I kept them out for about a month to get all the living moths plus any eggs that might hatch, and it wiped out the problem completely. Since then, I've developed a habit of freezing bird seed when I get it, then keeping it in an airtight container. The problem hasn't returned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27FDY3KBOMJ7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051OJS1W#wasThisHelpful","R27FDY3KBOMJ7X","A2SKSS5GW8NGY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SKSS5GW8NGY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My sun conure and green cheek conure hate when I travel because it means they'll be staying in an unfamiliar place in smaller than usual cages. I make sure they have all their favorite toys and treats, but it's the Cozy Corner that makes it all work. Without their Cozy Corners, they're miserable and they don't sleep well. Once I put those in the cages, though, they simply cuddle up to the Cozy Corner and it calms them down instantly.I keep several sets of extra Cozy Corners around, both at home and when they're staying with my family or friends. Not only do I make sure they always have one in whatever cage they're using, but I also check them regularly for snags or holes.

"I've always been a little mystified by the whole ""diamonds and gemstones"" thing. I don't own any diamonds, and I really can't get excited about them. As a result, I decided to take some classes through GIA and figure out what all the fuss is about. I still don't care about wearing diamonds, but I've learned a lot and I now have a better appreciation of the artistry (not to mention, the investment potential once you look past retail jewelry).Renee Newman's diamond handbook is the best diamond reference book I've found. It has great color images, along with a ton of detailed, relatively current information. This goes way beyond the basic ""4 C's"" talk you'll get from most sources, and it will leave you feeling very confident when it comes to buying, selling, and discussing diamonds. It won't take the place of a good lab class where you learn to view them up close, but it's a fantastic supplement to any diamond course, and I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in diamonds - whether you work in a jewelry store, sell them wholesale, or just enjoy trolling estate sales and junk shops for bargains.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19CNSTZ7WITWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0929975391#wasThisHelpful","R19CNSTZ7WITWI","A2SKSS5GW8NGY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SKSS5GW8NGY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of both bossa nova and Kenny G for as long as I can remember, so hearing about this album made me very happy. Kenny G's older recordings of Desafinado and The Girl from Ipanema have enjoyed prominent spots on my ""Not That Kind of Brazilian"" Spotify playlist for quite a while now, so I was anxious for this to finally be released.Brazilian Nights has all the sex appeal of traditional bossa nova without the ""I could get stabbed in a Rio de Janeiro alley"" edge. What do I mean by that? In short, it's a masterful take on the genre, but with the more smooth and refined sound you expect from Kenny G. Listen to some of the famous Stan Getz, Paul Desmond, or Cannonball Adderley recordings that inspired this album and you'll hear it. Where the others (especially Getz) have a breathier, almost rougher sound, Kenny G has a very distinctive and smooth tone. I love that it wasn't sacrificed for the sake of sounding like every other bossa nova recording.There's a lot of emotion in the songs on Brazilian Nights, and it doesn't leave you with exactly the same feelings you might get listening to the older recordings that made some of these songs famous. It's a surprisingly fresh take on the genre, while still being a great tribute. It might be my imagination, but when I listen to this album I hear notes of wistfulness and melancholy but also passion, hope, and even safety - the kind you'd feel in a perfect moment with a special significant other. As always with Kenny G albums, this would be another great playlist for ""indoor activities"".Piano accompaniment factors in heavily on quite a few of the songs, and it's especially good on bossa nova classic Corvocado and the originals April Rain and Brazilian Nights.I'm sure the stuffy jazz snobs will be out in full force to try to convince everyone that Brazilian Nights is objectively bad and that the jazz greats who inspired it are rolling over in their early graves. They don't sound like much fun to be around, though, and they certainly don't change the fact that I loved this album. If you like bossa nova and you don't hate Kenny G on principle, there's a good chance you'll love it, too.As a side note, the album also comes with some live tracks of classic Kenny G songs, which are fantastic. It's still nothing like actually seeing them performed live, but they're a nice alternative to the studio recordings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WR24SJP4A9G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PGOGFJ0#wasThisHelpful","R2WR24SJP4A9G3","A2SKSS5GW8NGY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SKSS5GW8NGY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Confession time: I've seen Kenny G in concert 5 times now. I travel a lot and go to a lot of concerts, and Kenny G is one of my favorites to see in person. Some musicians just don't have the skills or personality to make their live show an improvement over the CD/mp3, but Kenny G absolutely does.On top of that, he plays with a band full of incredible musicians. In all seriousness, I would probably pay to see several of the other guys doing solo shows if I heard they were playing somewhere convenient. That's how good they are.Unfortunately,I can't head to a concert every time I want to get my Kenny G fix. I rack up enough frequent flier miles as it is. I wouldn't say this recording would ever take the place of the live shows, but it's still very good. It's also considerably cheaper than a live show, so that's a plus. The show featured here is a few years old now, and it does't include some of the really good newer material. Heart & Soul, for example, came out a couple years after this was recorded, and it's one of my favorites to see live. His new bossa nova album Brazilian Nights is coming out in a few days, so you won't find that on this 2008 DVD, either.Still, all the classics are here, along with a bit of the Rhythm and Romance album. I would recommend this for any Kenny G fan, but especially for those who haven't had the pleasure of attending a live show. The CDs and mp3s are wonderful, but the live shows are really special, and this gives you a taste of that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22DD17S9AW1DO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QYRO0U#wasThisHelpful","R22DD17S9AW1DO","A2SKSS5GW8NGY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SKSS5GW8NGY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this thing as sort of a joke, but for it's intended purpose, it's really not bad!  And I've found myself using this more and more.  The joke was using a camera phone for a studio shoot.  But the darn thing works so well for light cameras I've kept it around.Now I did try a weight test and it does hold a full frame SLR with a  50mm lens.  But that was assuming everything was stationary and being rather ginger with the handling.  Lets face it, that's not the intended purpose of this ball head nor what it should be used for.  Argue with me if you like, but it's your money on the line when this thing fails and your expen$ive camera and lens drops like a rock.If you plan to use a phone or a point and shoot for videography this will (in conjunction with a decent tripod) give you a lot of options.  I mounted mine to a Manfrotto 055XPROB which required a 3/8"" to 1/4"" thread adaptor.  And surprisingly enough, they make a good combo.  Maybe a little mismatched visually but honestly quite versatile.  For a camera of a pound or less it yields a pretty positive lock.  And it's even notched so the ball can lay down 90 degrees to the horizon.  There's no way to accurately adjust where the notch will be when tightened but mine consistently faces the rear leg of my tripod.Really for something that works this well, it's quite inexpensive and worth owning.  Assuming you still shoot with light cameras.  Once again, DSLR users, seriously don't bother.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FS5C529RU7RT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000L47AHG#wasThisHelpful","R3FS5C529RU7RT","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This really does seem to the best set of aluminum tripod legs for under $200.  I looked at a lot of different options and just kept coming back.  Sure there are better tripods out there, but prepare to take out a small loan to get one.I needed something to satisfy both my ""standard"" tripod needs as well as my desire to get down low, really low.  First I'm 6'1"" and the XPROB suits me perfectly.  It's even tall enough for users up to 6'4"".  And I'm sure users who need something shorter will feel right at home as well.  But I wanted something to let me get as low to the ground as possible.  The XPROB gets me there.  There are tons of video reviews out there but I'll summarize.  The legs once opened can be released to one of four positions.  (Notice I said ""released"" as opposed to ""locked"".  The 055XPROB does not lock the legs at any angle.  It's locks just keep them from spreading past a certain angle.)  The last position is nearly horizontal.  The center column can be easily manipulated to change from a vertical column to a horizontal ""arm.""  This gets the mount about 4"" off the ground at the center line.  That's pretty darn low!As for the rest, the three telescopic leg sections are nice and solid once locked.  The column is the same.  The legs as they are opened have a degree of resistance which is nice.  Important to keep them from closing on you should you need to move the whole rig in a pinch.  In fact I must say everything about the XPROB just feels quality to me.  It's a hefty unit but that just speaks to me of build quality.  I realize there are many who dislike the weight of this tripod for travel of hiking.  And I agree that this could be concern if that's your intended usage.  But I don't plan to cross the Alps with mine.The column is tapped with a 3/8"" standard thread mount.  The ball head argument is far more heated in my opinion than the legs.  I went ahead and shelled out the bucks for a Really Right Stuff head but that's another topic all together.  No matter what your choice of head, the 055XPROB is going to be an excellent foundation to build on.  As I said above, there are better options available but they can cost 3-5 times as much and beyond.  The final push that convinced me to buy was how many of these I kept seeing and the testimonials from the professionals using them.  Honestly, it seems Manfrotto really has cornered at least this portion of the market.  So if the weight of an aluminum tripod doesn't bother you and you need something versatile...look no further.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWZUEZOB1GL4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UMX7FI#wasThisHelpful","RWZUEZOB1GL4C","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Moving into a new home?  Doing some electrical work?  Got high-end electronics?  Well you might want to check those outlets for proper polarity.You don't need to be an electrician to use one of these testers.  But you do need to understand a few things to know what your reading.  A three prong outlet found in every home in America ""should"" fed by three wires; a HOT wire, a Neutral wire, and (safety) Ground wire.  Even an experienced contractor can make mistakes and this can lead to problems if these are mixed.  The most serious of these is a potential fire.A little background:  Back when the first homes were being wired with electricity, about the only load in the house was lighting.  And light bulbs are dumb.  They don't care about polarity.  Many outlets were wired forwards and backwards and really nothing was seen as wrong about that.  However these days we have ""always on"" equipment with ""soft"" power buttons like most of the equipment in our home entertainment centers.  The switching circuitry DOES care about proper polarity.  I'm not saying it won't work if improperly wired, but damage can result.  Add to that, that reversing the wiring of a ground and another conductor can cause an overload do to heat that you many never notice since your TV and other devices seem to work fine.So basically, it's always a good idea to check an unknown outlet with one of these receptacle testers.  They will tell you if the line has just about any combo of reversed wiring through the usage of three led lights.  The ""key"" on the face of the unit will tell you how to interpret your results.  In general, two orange lights is what you're after.  Be aware however, there are at least two instances where this tester does not work.  First is in ""two wire"" systems.  Older homes may have outlets fed by only a HOT and a NEU and lacking a ground.  I've seen many of these that have been improperly ""updated"" with three prong outlets.  Plugging this into one of these will yield and ""open ground"" result.  However without a ground connection, the tester has no reference to test the polarity between hot and neutral.  In other words, in this (somewhat common) scenario, this tester cannot tell you the polarity of these types of outlets.  This would also be the case if you were to use one of these testers to test a two prong outlet in conjunction with a ground plug adaptor (two prong to three prong adaptor.)  Another problem is in installations with breaker boxes with isolated neutral and ground busses.  This tester cannot differentiate if the wiring of the ground and neutral has been reversed.  And potentially the ground conductor in the breaker box could be carrying the return current instead of the neutral conductor.  In most homes this won't be a concern as they only have one breaker panel and they are required by code to bond the neutral and ground buss bars together.  One more thing concerning NEU - ground reversal, again since it has no way to test this, it will not alert you if the neutral and ground wires on the outlet has been reversed.  Which leads me to this final point.  This is simply a ""warning tool"" or a ""quick reference"" device.  If you check an outlet and get anything short of ""correct"" on the indicator, you should delve into the issue further.  This can't always tell you the cause of your incorrect reading.  Only a voltmeter and proper training will.  If you lack either one of these, consult and electrician.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R304TZCZ6C1MOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GYBFA4#wasThisHelpful","R304TZCZ6C1MOG","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you need to adapt a locking 120V 30A receptacle to a accommodate a 15 or 20 piece of equipment with a standard wall plug, this one really is about the best out there.  Now I'll admit there are cheaper alternatives, but when dealing with electrical equipment, I want something that's been genuinely UL listed.  Marinco is a trusted brand in my opinion.  This is part of their new EEL series.  Unlike some of their other EEL connectors, there is no special locking weather seal so this really is just a branding thing.  But the connections are tight and the build quality is solid.  Bottom line, if you want something you can trust to be left unattended without worry of failure under normal usage, this is the adaptor for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H7F8HL23G7YX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009IJLKBW#wasThisHelpful","R2H7F8HL23G7YX","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There really is no reason in my opinion to own anything else.  I realize you can nickel and dime yourself to death but something things really are worth the extra expen$e.  The 026 truly is the best as far as I'm concerned.I'm fairly new to photography and as I got ready to take the step into the larger world of off camera flash photography I took the time to properly research my equipment options.  Honestly this really is a no brainer.  The 5/8's inserts at either end yield nearly universal compatibility with mounting options which already get's the 026 to te head of the pack.  Obviously this is designed to be mounted atop a light stand but the included female adaptor lets the 026 to thread onto a 1/4"" or 3/8"" male threaded mount.  Not all alternatives include these adaptors.All locks are easy to manipulate and the whole rig is a solid bridge once tightened down.  The best of these is the main pivot lock.  Its the largest of the locks.  And once tightened down the handle can be ""unlocked"" and pointed to a more convenient angle then reengaged.  The rest of the tensioners are well designed and well placed.  The one thing I would change to improve this design is the ""top lock"" that normally holds your hot shoe mount.  A knob would've been preferable to the clamp style tensioner.  The rest is pretty standard throughout the industry.The bottom line is the Manfrotto 026 umbrella adaptor can be had for $30-35.  That's not going to break the bank if you compare it to the cost of a decent flash.  In fact at what a decent light costs, I really wouldn't trust anything else.  One more thing.  If you intend to mount a speedlight to this thing, do yourself a favor.  Buy a Stroboframe shoe mount adaptor.  These are the best.  The yield a positive lock on the hoe shoe foot.  And they also feature a cutaway that gives plenty of clearance for the contacts on the bottom of your flash (i.e. - keeping these from shorting to one another.)  There is one little caveat, the stroboframe has a small screw on the bottom that causes clearance issues.  The brass thread adaptor has to be set about 3/16"" high in the holder to get proper clearance and a solid lock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J27FS0S1NZIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ENW61I#wasThisHelpful","R2J27FS0S1NZIJ","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 381 is one of those tools that fits the description ""if this doesn't have it, you don't need it."" In terms of what features you'd expect to find on a clamp meter, the 381 leaves little to be desired. The 381 is capable of voltage measurements to 1000V AC and DC with a 1000V CAT III and 600V CAT IV safety ratings. What's all this mean? CAT ratings are specific to a certain section of an electrical system. Meters rated to CAT 3 can work on most switch gear / breaker panels and systems down stream of them (outlets, appliances, hardwired equipment, ect..) CAT 4 is the highest level and adds service drops from the electric utility as well as underground installations. The accompanying voltage is the maximum safe working voltage on these parts of the system. I do not have the information on what the maximum transient voltage / surge voltage this meter is designed to handle happens to be.The 381 can measure voltage to 1KV on AC and DC systems, and of course has resistance measurements and includes a continuity buzzer. Now this does lack the diagnostic features of an electronics meter but that's to be expected. This is an industrial amp meter. The jaw clamp will take AC and DC current measurements to 999.9A in 0.1A increments. The iFlex clamp will take AC measurements to 2500A in whole numbers but will not take DC current measurements. Unlike other external clamps this uses a proprietary 3 pin connection to connect to the iFlex thus yielding accurate and appropriately quantified measurements. Now bear in mind clamp designs due to their nature of measuring magnetic fields inherently have a margin of error and this one if memory serves is between 2% and 5% depending on the range and frequency of power. Cabling should placed in the center of the jaws or the flex clamp to obtain best accuracy. Of course the meter can be ""hung"" on the cabling if accuracy is less of a concern and/or additional safety measures are needed. For those who have never used a clamp meter, measurements are taken by clamping onto an individual conductor in a circuit. The equipment ground conductor, the neutral conductor, and any additional hot conductors need be outside the jaws as these conductors will cancel out the readings taken. In other words placing a cord inside the jaws will yield a amperage reading of 0. The conductors need to be separated to obtain measurements. Hence the industrial nature of this meter and most clamp on meters.Note: I strongly discourage the homeowner tendency to split open an extension cord to obtain these measurements from a load with a traditional plug. For these types of measurements there are commercial plug-in adaptors available like the Amprobe ELS2A or the Extech 480172. In commercial / professional settings, typical measurements are taken off the loose conductors in j-boxes and the like. Again this is something I recommend extreme caution in practice and advise the inexperienced to avoid trying. Electricity is dangerous even if you know what you're doing and is deadly if you don't.Onto the real review...What I love - I mentioned above this clamp meter will take amperage measurements (in the clamp jaws) of both AC and DC systems. For my usage, the DC side can be quite indispensable and not all clamp meters work on DC installations. But then not all users need DC current measurement capability either. Next the 381 features a low pass filter to eliminate errors in voltage measurements due to harmonics in an AC system. Where this becomes apparent is when working on large non-linear loads such as VFDs or even large AC to DC converters. Unlike other meters such as the 87V, this feature is not switchable and instead is always enabled. However in electrical work this shouldn't pose a problem. It could limit the 381's usability in electronics diagnostics but again this is not an electronics meter. The next excellent feature is the ""inrush"" [current] measurement which I love. With this measurement the meter is placed on a hot conductor in the circuit. A load is then switched on and the 381 measures the peak amperage for the first few dozen cycles (for about 100ms I believe.) This gives a reading of the ""inrush"" or ""startup"" current which can be many times higher than the running current. This is one of features that sets the Fluke 370/380 series of clamp meters above the competition. The iFlex is of course another of these ""cut above"" features. The jaw clamp has an internal opening of .... The iFlex is much larger with a diameter of.... The iFlex can also be squeezed into compartments where traditional jaws may not fit or routed through and around other conductors if need be. There may be a penalty in accuracy but that's a small trade off for obtaining a measurement that otherwise couldn't be obtained. I love that the iFlex has its own setting on the main dial and that thanks to its 3 pin connector, gives a readout in amps and without any need for ""multiples of this or that mathematics."" On this meter, with the external probe, an amp is an amp and it's as simple as that. The last trick the 381 has up its sleeve is the remote display. The user can unlock the display and carry it to a better position up to 30 ft (or so the literature says.) I've had mine to about 20' with no issues. This meter uses some form of GSM wireless communication when undocked from the main body. When docked with the main body the display appears to use an IR window to receive signals I'm not sure if there is two-way communication or not. The display has three buttons on it including ""hold"", ""min/max"", and the backlight. Min/Max info could be handled onboard I suppose. But if I had to guess I'd say communication is bi-directional. I remember reading that ""other displays can be synchronized"" to the body but that only one display can be synced at a time. The question I have, to which I don't yet have an answer is whether two or more 381s can be used in wireless mode at the same time. I'm not sure if there would be interference or cross talk but it's not really something I need, just more of a curiosity. The other controls on the main body are the ""zero"" and ""inrush"" buttons as well as the mode selector dial. Back to the remote display, in addition to its wireless communication Fluke decided to give us one more handy feature. The back of the display has a magnet so this can be placed where its most easily viewed or to let the technician use the probes or to control the load being tested. Lastly I applaud Fluke for giving the consumer two things that should be standard equipment with all of their meters but aren't. The first is a soft side case for the meter and accessories. The second is a set of their genuine silicone rubber test leads. They include a pair of TL175 which have a twist lock safety shroud for the probe tips. Twist the end of the lead and the shroud extends or retracts. This is a safety feature for working on CATIII and CATIV installations. But for me the real safety feature is the silicone rubber leads themselves. In other meters I've purchased from Fluke, I've received their TL75s which are garbage in my opinion. Safety-wise they carry excellent ratings but the cheap plastic jackets over the wire, kink and get tangled. This can quickly become a safety concern if you have to fight a kink causing you to lose concentration on what you're working on. Flukes silicone rubber leads like the TL71, TL175, and the models in the TL220 series have no memory and even after months wrapped with a twist tie fall straight and free when unwound. Thumbs up Fluke!What I like -I like this meter's resolution. It yields a 0.1V to 600V resolution which is much better than other clamp meters that are only accurate to the volt then 600V to 1000V in wholes numbers. I won't go into accuracy & counts vs. resolution but can say that resolution does play a part in the inherent accuracy of a meter. That extra 1/10 scale means a lot to someone like me who is interested in obtaining the most accurate reading possible. Next I like the backlight. This isn't something found always on a clamp meter and its indispensable in my opinion. In my experience, electrical problems always seem to hide in poorly lit areas. The ""zero"" key is important as it lets the user zero a measurement even if the line has a small amount of current on it. It can also be used to zero prior to a reading to see change in current as opposed to total current flowing on a line. I like the ""feel"" of the 381. The dial is a tad stiff but is well placed and could be used one handed. The thumb ""trigger"" on the jaw clamp is well placed and easy to operate. The display is pretty large for this class of meter and is easy enough to read. The probe inserts are on the bottom which means the meter (with the iFlex attached) can fit into narrow spaces and is a bit less bulky. This is a bit of a trade off though as probes with 90 banana plugs (90% of probes out there) feel a bit awkward on the bottom of this meter.Room for improvement -There really isn't much not to like here but I'll list a few negative impressions in the spirit of being objective. First is the inherent flaw nearly all amp clamps suffer. The case. Unlike a traditional multimeter these almost never have a protective rubber boot/holster. Which means when gravity pulls your meter back to Earth (and usually, to concrete) the chance of damage to the casing and the internals is much greater. The 381 has an Achilles heel here as well. That lovely remote display will almost certainly go flying after impact and in the case of a face first impact will hit first as it sticks out about "" from the main body. There's always a downside to a cool feature, and this is the 381's. Next is the lack of a Low-Z (aka a low impedance) voltage measurement. Being an industrial meter I feel this would've been a great feature to include for eliminating ghost voltages. You can buy an adaptor (Fluke's SV225) but I feel this is something that should come with this class of instrument to begin with. Finally is the ""hold"" feature. Fluke has their patented ""touch hold"" which operates by waiting for the probes to touch a circuit and records that (much the same as inrush feature works on this meter.) However Fluke gave us instead a ""display hold"" which once pressed the reading on the screen is frozen. Honestly I've seldom found display hold to be of much use. But in fairness touch hold may have been too complex to implement given it would have to talk two ways in real time with the remote display.In the box you get:-Fluke 381 meter w/ remote display-Fluke iFlex external flex clamp-A pair of TL175 silicone leads-A pair of AC175 over the probe alligator clips-A Fluke soft case for the meter and accessoriesFinal thoughts... The 381 is Fluke's current top of the line industrial clamp meter and reflects that with its ballpark $400-425 price tag. For those seriously looking at this meter I doubt I've told you anything you didn't already know. But for those just beginning their search for a clamp meter, this is a good example of what a top of the line model looks like. Is it over kill for a home owner meter? Probably. But it does have a set of unique features that make it attractive to professionals and hobbyists alike. All I can say is my need for an accurate AC and DC clamp meter lead me to this unit. The other features, especially the remote display I have found handy but weren't integral to my application either. Truthfully like all professional meters, it really is for you to decide whether it's worth it to you or not. Personally I would buy again, as I really like the 381. However I wouldn't rule out purchasing the 376 either. The 376 spec wise is nearly identical to the 381 except it lacks the remote display. All other features including AC/DC functionality, inrush current measurements, and iFlex attachments are still intact. And this meter clocks in around $80-100 cheaper. All in all I'm quite satisfied with the 381 and it's filled the hole in my instrumentation that only a clamp meter can satisfy. As such I give a glowing endorsement to any perspective users who have need of this feature set, find the functionality appealing, and aren't turned off by its price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L11UC38WQUHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BF5ZEQ#wasThisHelpful","R2L11UC38WQUHW","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are a total of five inputs to allow for direct connections to A/V components if you wish.  Honestly the only complaint I have is the fact that using a digital input (Optical TOSLINK) from the TV causes the sound bar to go silent and start flashing sometimes if the channel is changed or the sound goes silent for a couple of seconds.  This doesn't happen on analog inputs so I'm a little baffled.  And I don't mind using analog connections though I'm sure some users may care.

"This is a great invention for those of using long heavy cable runs that require heavy gauge less flexible cables to maintain electrical integrity or for people who are trying to fit HDMI equipment in closed in spaces.  Either way this should be the solution for you.  The thing about digital signals is there's no ""color loss"" or ""grainy ness"" it's a digital signal and as such brightness, color space, even the audio is quantified as a coded algorithm.  So either the signal is readable or not.  So there will be no interference caused by this gadget.  Buy it with confidence.  It is a captured articulation.  That means it doesn't rotate 360 degrees on either axis but it's close,  It should allow you to position the device properly while routing the cable where its most natural.

"If a ""Goodnight's"" sleep is what your after then take a hard look at this.  I can tell you this traditional Japanese futon was exactly what I was looking for.  At just about 4"" thick but while still having a firm padding this provides an excellent comfortable night's sleep.  I'm using mine on a twin sized camper bunk.  However this should be comfortable enough to sleep the traditional way which is to place it on the floor.  I would say however, Shiki Futons are meant to be used in conjunction with Tatami mats so sleeping on carpet or some other kind of padding would be recommended.  This futon doesn't conform the way a memory foam mattress will, but the firmness doesn't inherently create uncomfortable pressure points either.  As a whole I'm very impressed and would buy again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUKKNR85BJ3F8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001P51D0A#wasThisHelpful","RUKKNR85BJ3F8","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great.  They fit into standard 14"" x 14"" RV vents and serve the same purpose as a draft guard on your door.  They have a soft cotton cover that covers the foam core.  The top side also features a heat reflective panel for use in reflecting sunlight in summer.  They're sized perfectly and fit my Forrest river's four ports just fine.  Now there always has to be a caveat...  There are two with these.  First if you have a shallow port they may stick out from the ceiling a bit.  Second, I have Ventline vents with knobs...these don't obstruct the plug going in.  However, other vent manufacturers use cranks which protrude down more than the knobs.  For a best fit, these cranks should be removed.  Other than that, these plugs do a great job of keeping the cold out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20R4B0Z58NH5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0024E6QX0#wasThisHelpful","R20R4B0Z58NH5Y","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great tabletop/countertop mounting bracket for small and medium (up to 32"") LCD TVs.  This bracket is a solid platform that gives plenty of confidence for putting a flat panel TV in your RV or travel trailer.  The mounting holes allow for several VESA patterns from 75mm x 75mm up to 200mm x 200mm and just about everything in between.  The vertical arm is a two piece unit that can be raised and lowered to accommodate fitting larger and smaller sets while fitting under overhead obstructions.  The maximum this bracket will likely fit is a 32"" flat screen since the height of the TV will become a clearance issue from the TV centerline to the top of the triangular foot of the TV1-003H's base.  Simply put, the bottom of the TV will brush the base if it's too big for the bracket.The plate may be too big for smaller sets as depending on where they place the connections, ports for coax and HDMI may be obstructed by the mounting plate.  Unfortunately there is really nothing that can be done about this.  So measure your set from the center line of the VESA holes (dead center of the rear of the set) and make sure you have at least 8-1/2"" x 8-1/2"" of open area that cords don't access.The only other thing that users may not like is the small foot print of the bracket.  This has two downsides.  First is that if you intend to leave this installed while moving the coach the road vibration could cause stress on the countertop and pull loose over time.  OR cause flexing in the TV and transfer vibration into the TV causing damage.  The solution to this is to do as I have done and trill though the countertop and feed machine screws with washers attached on the bottom and use wing nuts on top to make this removable.  When it comes time to strike camp, remove the wing nuts and remove the TV and bracket as one piece, placing it somewhere safe for travel.  This brings me to the second downside.  There are four holes, the two in the front are easy enough to access, but the two in back may be a little more challenging.  That said, I'm only using two and it feels solid.Bottom line, what makes this a worth while investment over the stock base plate of an LCD if you just intend to move the TV when traveling?  First (at least for my setup using a 32"" Vizio) the bracket sits about an inch lower than the stock plate which makes it fit in the trailer's ""Desk"" cubby and fills the hole nicely.  Second it IS bolted to the desktop which is nice when the trailer rocks as people are moving OR considering that an un-level trailer may add to the risk of the TV toppling.  This is a great solution by the MOR/ryde corp that lets us RV'ers further spoil ourselves by taking the latest and greatest in entertainment with us on our vacations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JDYMVEDDLVNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HRUTS2#wasThisHelpful","R3JDYMVEDDLVNI","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The twist locking connector has become the industry standard over the last few years.  And for good reason.  The old style (through hole-pull out cord) had some real disadvantages.  Namely that there was big friggin' hole in the side of your camper.  Water, insects, small animals all had a way in.  Not a problem twist lockers.  But the problem that has been introduced is the idea that you have a fairly heavy cord pulling on it's own wiring and torqueing the coupler on the side of your camper...Enter the ParkPower Right Angle...  This is one of those ""DUH"" innovations that just makes you wonder why no one thought of it sooner.  With the cord's weight pulling straight down as opposed to jutting out and torqueing the plug the life of the cord should be much longer.  The cord itself is a genuine Marinco branded product with a 30A Hubble locking connector and threaded lock ring.  It's a weather proof 10ga cord and is designed as a drop in replacement for travel trailers and 5th wheel campers with 30A locking inlets.I do have one complaint.  My connection is a bit loose.  It's doesn't wiggle but at the same time it's not as firm to turn as the original was and as my 30A-15A pigtail is.  If the cord were bumped and turned AND the lock ring were improperly connected to the TT it could become disconnected.  However as long as the lock ring is installed this shouldn't happen.  And it's not going to come undone when it's in the vertical position, only when it's rotated about 30 degrees.  It does ship with a second lock ring for mating with the new style of Marinco inlets.  The locking ring has a notch which fits into a track and turns about an 1/8 of a turn making this a true twist on twist off setup.  I haven't changed the locking rings on mine yet though I do intend to.  I will update then.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R334RWGBXUA0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002QAC66I#wasThisHelpful","R334RWGBXUA0M","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Werner is one of the few names I'll trust my life to enough to step 20' off the ground on their products.  This is their rendition of the popular gorilla ladders.  I've had mine for about a year now and overall I'm very pleased with my purchase.  They say you can't buy one tool for every job...  This ladder proves and disproves that concept.One ladder to do it all.  Buy one ladder and you've got a Super Duty double step ladder safe enough for two grown men to stand on.  You've got a 26' extension ladder.  And lastly you have the flexibility of a stair ladder.  For the price there's no excuse for every American home owner not to have one in their garage.  But as I eluded to above, there are down sides.  Three that I've found anyway.  First) The weight...  When you standing on it, it's a brick house...solid as a rock...  When you're carrying it around, it's brick house...heavy as a boulder...  At nearly 70lbs this is not a typical aluminum step ladder.  Unfold it and use it as an extension that weight is compounded by the additional length.  It is a real chore to extend it and retract it.  Easiest way is to unfold it, extend what will be the top side, stand it vertical where you plan to work, and extend the bottom.  This is still not an easy feat and you need to be extra careful of your fingers.  With this much weight, it you let go it could chop them clean off.  Safest way is to fully extend it on the ground and walk the ladder up but this will require two people.  Second Issue) The J-hooks.  I had to send my first one back because one was damaged in shipping.  These are the Achilles heal of the MT series.  Be cautious not to hit them against anything as I fear the plastic housing that encases them will break.  Finally) returning to extension mode, since this is not a rigid beam construction setup found on modern extension ladders, there is a noticeable flex in the middle.  It's unnerving at first but I found after a time I got used to it.  Still the first time you pass that middle locking pivot, you say a little prayer that the guy on the line that day at Werner had his coffee that morning.Aside from the downsides listed above, there is nothing else not to like about this ladder.  The 26' version yields an excellent working height range as an A-frame.  And as an extension (while not the first ladder I would grab if given the choice) it has enough reach to get a grown man to the gutter level of just about any two story built on level ground.  As I said about, this is a must for all homeowners.  One final word of caution, this is an aluminum ladder and as such it will conduct electricity very well!  Don't perform electrical work from this ladder and stay clear of the power lines!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VRKSYP9LNQEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000VYDI4#wasThisHelpful","R3VRKSYP9LNQEW","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The new Marinco EEL series is amazing.  I love the new locking design!  This is even quicker and easier than their twist lock plug and lock ring.  The EEL uses the same Hubble 30A twist lock receptacle but with a ""squeeze and turn"" lock ring that thus far seems to be quite weather proof.  Then there is a ""safety lock"" that keeps the squeeze locking wings from being opened.  The power ""on"" indicator light is a nice feature to let you know the pigtail is receiving power.  The ""flash light"" in the center of the Hubble receptacle is a big gimmicky but doesn't bother me otherwise.This particular device is a 12"" pigtail.  It's designed to be used in conjunction with a heavy duty outdoor extension cord to feed a 30A powered RV or boat with AC power from a household outlet.  This will let you run the camper's onboard battery charger, refrigerator, and other low wattage items while stored or in preparation for a trip.  The male plug is a 15A standard plug which is VERY TIGHT and is meant to be.  They don't want this falling out while plugged in.  Plugging this into an extension cord requires backing off the tensioning screw on the top of the male plug.  Firmly insert the plug into the female end of the extension cord.  Tighten the tensioning screw (but not the point where it begins to push the cord apart or starts to thread into extension cord.So why buy this?  It isn't that much cheaper than the real 30A locking cords...  Three reasons...  1) Unfortunately society has degraded to the extent that we have to worry about scrappers taking our cords to sell to recycling centers for pennies on the dollar.  Even if you loose this and your cord.  You still have you main cord for trips so your next vacation isn't ruined.  2) The ends of a 30A cord with a 30-15A adaptor tend to be large and bulky and often are too big to fit into outdoor weather proof outlet housings.  Lastly) given that this is a pigtail, you can tailor the length of 15A extension cord to your needs.  15' or 100' are equally doable.  Just make sure to use a heavy gauge cord (especially for long runs.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18VKF6CRGWJNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009IJJLZO#wasThisHelpful","R18VKF6CRGWJNV","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let's face it $10 is cheap for a bike light.  And I wasn't expecting miracles...  But this thing actually turned out to be a honest contender.  Construction feels ""okay""  so far everything is tight, but we'll see how that holds up over time.  The beam can be adjusted from an all but useless square dot to a pretty bright white flood.  There are 3 mode settings which was a surprise to me, (bright, dim, and strobe.)  Dim gives enough light to navigate a path after dark at about 10mph, bright acts light a ""high beam"" if you twist the holder up just a bit, and gives me confidence to about 15mph.  That said this is still kicking out light more as a spot light than a ""wash"".  With it tipped just below parallel to the ground it gives the rider about 8 feet of light with at 10 feet out.  And illuminates the path with decreasing intensity for about 50 feet.  The strobe is good enough I'd trust it in traffic.  So far the only thing I wasn't impressed with was the mount.  The thumb screw wasn't long enough to reach and tighten around my bars.  Instead I used a machine screw to get it.  But this leaves you without a way to tighten it on the road unless you carry a tool kit.

"This is by far the best bike pump I've ever owned.  The ability to pump both traditional Schrader valves and Presta valves from one unit is worth its weight in gold.

And whether it is or isn't, it doesn't automatically show a reading once connected to a tire.  I've pumped up my road tires for the last month and no two times have they ever felt the same on the road.  Pumped to 80psi up front and 85psi in back...

"This is a simple voltage averaging meter.  Perfect for sticking in a small kit or in a vehicle.  I carry mine in a messenger bag and use for AV diagnotics in PA equipment.  This simple meter in class III 300V & Class II 600V rated for AC and DC installations.  It's not suitable for large DB boards and heavy switch gear but for end user equipment or automotive daignostics this is a great tool to have on hand.  It's capable of AC and DC voltage measurement to 600V.  It has a bar graph on the bottom of the screen which is a rarity on cheaper meters and a terrific diagnostic tool.  In addition this meter has a continuity tester, a resistance measurement feild, and a 3V diode check.  It's a 4000 count auto ranging meter with selectable manual range override.Included in the kit is a detailed user manual and a nice folding ""wallet case"".  The one complaint I have is the perminantly affixed test leads.  These are small and flexible and well suited for general use applications.  But they also the Achilles heal of the meter as when (not if) they become damaged, they cannot be replaced.  That said, if you catch this on sale, it's cheap enough to replace assuming you get a few good years of service out of it.  Amprobe is a division of Fluke.  I've found most of their products to be quality built and this model is no exception.  Granted it has some limitations, but I'm reminded of the saying, the perfect tool is the one you have on hand when you need it.Update: 7-11-2015Note: The DM78C is the credit card size meter.  The DM73C is the pen model.  I have the 78C so my review pertains to that model.  After two years it's still going.  Though admittedly it sees light usage.  However I have noticed two issues.  The auto ranging tends to dance around with no source connected to the leads.  This doesn't seem to effect the measurement accuracy greatly but it is noticeable.  The other concern is the probes are aging ahead of the meter as I feared they would.  They never were as ridgid as a traditional DMM probe but now they'rd showing noticeable flex when pressure is applied accross the probe broadside near the finger stop.  With this I no longer believe my meter to be safe for potentially hazardous voltages (inclunding 120V testing.). Other than that it still functions which still makes it a practical meter for on the go electrical/electronic diagonotics or as a meter in an automotive tool kit.  I've docked it one star for the poor lead quality since they are board soldered and would require a fair bit of work to replace.  However don't let that dissuade you from purchasing if this is truely to be portable ""tool kit"" type meter for you.  Once I disassembled the meter I was all at once very impressed. I was struck at just how well put together the case was.  There are nearly full thickness blast shields on all sides of the case and even on the battery compartment door.  The planning and engineering that went in to these shields shows how well designed it really is in terms of safety.  I see now why it was able to be rated a CAT III device.  Should Amprobe ever update this meter I would like to see female banana jacks added on the bottom or sides.  Even if that adds a couple of mm of thickness to the casing.  Or a pair of silicone pigtails with female jacks so that traditional DMM leads could be used.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WVM3GCKB6VCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0024V97V6#wasThisHelpful","R1WVM3GCKB6VCL","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently converted my Fuji Nevada 1.0 mountain bike to a road bike.  After 13 miles, my hind end was feeling every inch.  This seat was just the answer.  I'm 230lbs and hoping biking brings that down a bit.  This seat is a winner in most every respect.  It's size is about 3-4"" wider than ""traditional stock saddles"" which is a BIG differnce when your riding long distances.  There is also a stiff pair of rubber bound springs on the rear underside of the seat to obsorb some of the road vibration and bumps that the high pressure road tires do nothing insulate you from.  Then there is the gel padding in the seat itself.  Together these culminate in a much more enjoyble long distance riding experience.  Mounting can be done two ways.  It can mount to a standard ""el cheapo"" seat post.  If your old seat has the parallel bar style mount, the adaptor can be removed and the seat mounted directly to the clamp.  Once mounted, you may need to drop the seat hight slightly as this seat is almost certainly thicker than your stock saddle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7WLPFFPOWQ26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AOA66Y#wasThisHelpful","R7WLPFFPOWQ26","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've got 26 miles on it and so far, I'm pleased.  I'm running this 700x32mm variant at the 80 psi max.  It runs well on paved paths.  At this point the tread that trims the center line is showing a little wear but that's to be expected.  As I'm running this as a front tire for my bike, I've got to say I love the way it handles corners.  It gives excellent confidence and sticks really well.  The center slick I'm sure is giving me the best I can hope for using a mountain bike as crusier in terms of speed.  Honeslty, there's nothing about it I feel that needs to be said against this tire.  Some will complain that its a wire bead, but that's not a concern for me.  All in all if you're looking for a capable preformer on paved roads this is worth serious consideration.UPDATE 9-26-2013:  An injury and a bit of laziness kept me off the roads as much as I would've preferred.  However with about 130 miles on them I've got to say, so far so good.  The tread is definitely showing defined wear.  But it's even and not effecting the handling at all.  This tire still corners very well and handles medium to high riding speeds with comfort and ease.  I really don't have any thing bad to report.  I'll continue to update as they age.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1THVJKH05FCOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O0ELJM#wasThisHelpful","R1THVJKH05FCOR","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So I have a 33' Keystone that tips the scales at 6800lbs empty.  Tongue weight was 780 dry.  So the 2000lb tongue jack sounds like it's more than enough.  However anyone who's ever used a weight distributing hitch eventaully puts 2 and 2 together and figures out that lifting up the back end of a full size pickup is A LOT of weight.  And then you remember that you never camp without gear and the pickup bed almost always has wood so that 2k lb rating all of a sudden seems just plain wimpy.  My tongue at last check was a hair heavy of 950 and the gear in the bed more than covers the slack.  After 4 seasons of abuse, the 2k lb'er finally cranked its last inch.  I knew that I wasn't going to be any nicer to my next one so I decided to search for something with some genuine capacity.  If your in the same boat as me then you've found your jack...Lift is the same as my stock model (if not, perhaps an inch shorter.)  The triple bolt pattern used has been around for at least 40 years so this should be a universal replacement for any 2-1/4"" tongue jack.  The crank speed is a little slower but A LOT smoother and easier compaired to my original.  What this means in real world terms is that it actaully takes less time to lift the tongue since your not wearing yourself out.  The jack retracts nice and high for travel, clearance even with a jack foot shouldn'd be a problem.  It doesn't come with a foot, but they're availible for around $10 here on amazon.  All-in-all, price vs. performance, this one is a home run!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MJAORFYBFZEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VAYK0W#wasThisHelpful","R2MJAORFYBFZEH","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice battery box for outdoor (tongue mounting) on travel trailers and RVs.  Its a perfect fit for common 24 series batteries (usually around 75ah).  I like it better than the one that shipped with my trailer since the vents on the cap are rain resistant.  My other had open air (mesh vents) that allowed water to pour into the box.  I ended up drilling drain holes in the four corners.  Honestly though, that should be standard practice for any box.  The lid has the typical bulges on one side to allow battery cables to come through without obstructing the lid.  It's held in place with an included nylon strap.  Not much more that I can say about a simple plastic box.Note: I bought on of these units for a hobby project I was working on.

"Even though the title said Amico, I recieved a SIBA brand.  I've not researched if they own SIBA or that was just what the seller sent.  In any case SIBA was what my Ideal 61-481 DMM had before, so I'm pleased to put one back in.  This is a 6.3mm x 32mm which is a style used by many mid-range multimeters.  It's a genuine HRC (High Rupture Capacity) ceramic fuse that unlike its cheaper glass brethren is less likely to shrapnel if it's hit with an extreme high energy jolt.  Now this is not exactly what came out of my meter, my Ideal shipped with a 1A fast blow for the mA range.  However I could only find this 500mA.  If you decide to go this route, understand that it is also a fast blow so even a short spike over 500mA will toast it.  Most of my mA readings are under a 100mA so that's fine with me.  Another thing to pay attention to is voltage ratings.  Barrel fuses can be rated from 60V on up.  Double check and make sure your buying one rated for 1000V.  Bottom line is, this fuse will serve my purposes without comprimising safety.Update: I beleive this is also the fuse that the Fluke 17B uses for its mA/uA over current protection.  In any case I've been using my Ideal's mA range with its fresh new fuse.  And at times I pushed the envelope.  The current spike over 500mA for a few fractions of a second at a couple of differnt points through the test and survived.  I must say that ""forgiveness"" is most welcome and I continue to sing praises about this replacement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A0BKPK1GIYV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087ZRS2S#wasThisHelpful","R1A0BKPK1GIYV9","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great little leads.  They are not some ebay crap made in someone garage.  They have full length, molded and sheilded banana plugs with solid (YES!  SOLID!) pins.  The other end is what I would consider a medium sized aligator clip.  It's roughly the same size as the slip-over-the-probe style aligator clips for DMMs.  The clips themselves ar simply the crimp on style found at most hardware stores but they feel solid.  The jacks are stamped with CE ratings and 10A current handing capability as well as CATIII 1000V.  The wire isulation itself is marked 2000V 18AWG standed.  I would've prefered 16ga but for this length 18 should be able to withstand what I'll run.  The wires themselves are pretty flexible.  The length has it's pros and cons.  9"" is about right for using as an Amp lead between a power source and load.  However its a bit short for parallel runs for voltage readings.

"Cagalli brings the fight to the enemy and is ready to stand with you.  She's about a 1:7 scale by looking at her.  She's PVC and painted on all exposed surfaces.  This figure is from the ""Desert Tiger"" arc in season one of Gundam Seed.  The detail isn't too bad, but the skin pigment is a little off.  She's what I would call sunburn red.  A little too much attention to detail IMHO.  But I'm sure this is a manufacturing variation.  Still though, it's not awful.  R.A.H.D.X. manufactures some decent ""Teir 2"" figures that are still good pieces.  In any case, for any GS fan, ""battle field Cagalli"" is a must have.  One further point, although this is a seller's market since this figure is out of production, be weary of sellers that will ask $200-300 for this piece.  She's a decent display figure at $40-60, she's a definete pass up from there...A word on my figurine reviews.  This is not a toy, nor is it intended for children.  I rate figuines as having no eductational value, since to be frank, they don't.  Durability dispite being a PVC figure is moderate.  If she's is constantly handled, she will break.

She's smaller, probably a 1:8 scale or so.  The make is TOMY so it's not a ""top shelf"" manufacturer...but beggers can't be choosy.  She's painted on all exposed surfaces.  The base isn't bad but she's definiely about a $20 figure for quality.  The price here on Amazon was a bit steeper than that but again, can't be picky.  Her colors aren't bad and although the detail isn't flawless, it's not bad either.  All in all, I'm pleased.A words about my reviews...  Depite what Amazon lists them as, Anime figurines ane not toys.  Not by their content, nor by their intended usage.  This figurine is not for children.  I rate figrines as having no educational value, since honestly, they don't.  I rate them as having moderate durability.

"This is used to convert you 50A RV electric serivce to a weatherproof detachable cord setup that serves a couple of useful purposes.  First:  You don't have a hatch and weak point of entry to let critters into your rig and give them access to the last place you want them (your power system)!  Second:  You don't have a big heavy cord that is tangled and a mess coming through a 8x8 hole.  Third:  Scrappers won't have an easy time stealing your VERY expensive power RV cable for $10 worth of copper.  Last:  You have access to a variety of adaptors that are equaly weatherproof and allow you to connect your rig to anything from a 15A home recepticle, to 30A RV connections, or even to a locking plug on a generator.What you will need...  An existing 50A service and exisiting 6/3 w/ Ground RV cord.  A length of 6/3 w/ ground copper wire (to connect from the recepticle on the wall of the rig to the RV breaker box and converter.)  A hole saw (sizing may vary from my installation since I bought a slighlty different model.)  And ideally a way to plug an replace (cover) the existing hatch.  As seen in the photo, it comes with the wall recepticle.  And a water tight female locking plug end to plug into that.  I don't particularly care for the rosette that comes with it as it's a little small.  Larger would better.  With all that goes into it, this is one install you might want to leave to your RV professional.

"I love the Speedbor Max.  If you've only ever used traditional spade bits and hole saws, then you've been living in the past.  The 21st century brings us the amaziningly quick tri-blade speedbor max.  I used these on a recent rewiring project and electrical system upgrade.  I needed to drill LOTS of holes in REAL 2"" hardwood joists.  These paired with my 18V Dewalt cordless drill made that a very quick undertaking.  They have a pilot thread that makes centering the hold easy.  And once they start boring, they bore through with speed!  Pardon the shameless pun.  Even though they cut quickly and the cuts are a little rough, they aren't nearly as rough as you would expect for the quickness.  And there's no blowout on the otherside.  Bottom line, these work!  The set comes in a nice softside zippered case that keeps them from getting lost.  I've used my 7/8"" the most and after a years worth of abuse, it's still going strong.  If there is any down side to these, it would be the length.  The overall length, plus the length of my drill makes getting them between 16"" centered studs and joists challenging.  You have to start the cut at a slight angle.  But you cant straighten it out once you hit the middle of the material.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BT3KXRSQ5HV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZZ9PMM#wasThisHelpful","R3BT3KXRSQ5HV1","A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GT2EWQSO45ZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's VERY heavy for a pillow between 8-10 pounds for a king size.  I've been using it for a few months and still getting used to it.  It's difficult to move with my arthritic hands and a bad right shoulder.  I may have to go back to my down pillows.  This pillow IS comfortable, just hard to move around.  It helps with a bad back and sore neck.  I don't think it is shredded, I believe it is two layers of folded foam.It takes two days for the bad smell to go away.  I put it in the sun on the deck for a day and then in the dryer with dryer sheets for a couple of hours, then back to deck for the remainder of the day.

"These are a great pair of headphones which were provided to me for my review.I like that the plug is angled for a very good fit and hold in the connector.  The sound quality is good.  The ear buds come with three sizes, S, M, & L to assure a good fit.  I was impressed with the sound, the ear bud fit, the angled plug and the fabric covered wire which makes for less tangle as you wrap it up to fit into it's own handy fabric bag.  Of course, some folks might be annoyed with the noise when the cable rubs against the fabric.  I think these are made for Apple products as the little push button used to skip songs, etc. on the cable doesn't work on other MP3 Players.I wasn't wild about the ""bling"" but for free I can't be unhappy about it.  Overall, I can gladly give these earphones a B+ and 4.5 stars.

"I have oily skin so I don't use most skin products claiming eternal youth and the removal of any sign of aging.  Nearing 70 years (bite your tongue) of age very soon, I took a chance on this Alina Skin Care Enhance Vitamin C Serum and I am glad I did.  I have tried a couple of others that did well enough but this particular one is the one for me.  It encourages the use before moisturizer.  This IS my moisturizer.  The pump applicator gives just enough for one use on face, neck AND the backs of my hands.  And to top it off, the fragrance is divine.  I love the hint of the citrus.  It's very refreshing.  If I should use my Bare Minerals or Bare Escentuals Liquid make up, my face is not left with that dreaded cakey look on my Fairly Medium and Bare Satin 06.I have begun to notice tiny lines or crinkles on my eyelids and this was the real reason for using this scrumptious serum which was provided to me free of charge for my honest opinion.

"I think these are the EXACT knives that I needed.  I only needed one steak knife to complete my set of six in the Henckels knife block.  I suspect that the missing knife went out with a pizza box as I have searched high and low for it.  Finally, my husband tiring of hearing me complain and watching me tear the house up looking for it, found these wonderful Henckels Eversharp Pro Steak Knives right here on Amazon and suggested that I order them.  I did and I am delighted with his suggestion and no hesitation on my part.  Of course, I cut the end of one finger getting them open from a blister pack with a special blister pack opener but still managing to cut myself as they were delivered at Noonish today.  The box is all bloody as I taped it back up to throw out in tomorrow's trash pick up.  I am absolutely thrilled with these new knives.  I've placed four new ones in the wooden knife block and the remaining older ones in the plastic form fit holder for the knives and will keep them somewhere for the future.

"Very ok salad spinner for now. more pros and some consPros:- it works and get you vegetables dry completely with no issues. Vegetables I tried so far, lettuce, mushrooms, herbs, small , peewee small potatoes.- very easy. although more parts than usual salad spinner but fit easy with no problems. has outer bowl, green basket that spin, outside lid. inside lid that fit basket and screw on outside lid.- spin ok not the fasted spinning i ever see but do the work perfectly dry vegetables after some seconds.- Disassembled and washed easily. for me the size was ok. bigger is bitter. you still can dry small amount in this big one.- there is stopping button you need to press to make stop before you open lid.Cons:- I have another spinner that wash and spin and the look the same. So I attempted to add water to bowl so I wash the vegetables. The spinning is slow with water and I start feeling the grip of outside lid to inside lid start becoming loose so I stopped. I Feel the mechanic to spin is not that strong and you may damage it after awhile.-I have to keep hold on spinner during spinning action.

"I love drinking Matcha green tea because it has high amount of antioxidants. It also taste good specially the good quality one. I don't consider myself an expert in matcha green tea but I tried a lot of brands so far. You need to know its not always easy to find the best Matcha and comparing brands side by side will give you better idea. some tips you need to know 1- the origin, grades and which part of plants matcha comes from, color, taste and finally how to prepare each grade matcha.There Isnt any formal or universal grading system for matcha but will list the most common two grades I found.- Ceremonial grade: Made from shade-grown green tea leaves harvested and then stone-ground to a very fine powder. Good for drinking straight and taste really good.- Ingredient/ culinary/ kitchen grade matcha which is best when used in recipes for matcha lattes, smoothies, shakes, ice cream, baking, etc. the taste is more strong and maybe bitter to maintain its aroma and flavor when mixed with other ingredients. You can also consume as a brewed drink with more bitterness than the ceremonial grade matcha if you are ok with that.now for this brand ""Enzo MATCHA Green Tea Powder"" . Here what I found:- The color of this Matcha green tea is brighter green compared to other culinary grades I have tried. It is actually the best green color among  three culinary grades I tried so far.- The taste is still bitter  but less compare to others. I tried drinking straight and the taste is bitter and that normal for this grade! I prefer the Ceremonial grade for cup of matcha.- Powder: fine green powder.- I tried it for  smoothies, and baking and the results are greatthis one stays on the top of my culinary grade brands and really recommend itI received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

"Pros- Great packaging with nice looking carrying case perfect for gifting to anyone. I give it to wife with her long thick hair and she loves it.- Good material and lock actually bigger than what shows in picture- Very easy use curling iron. It has secure clip hold and locks your hair in place while curling- Nice grip with long 360 swivel cord.Cons:- Although its simple but at first you will spend more time figuring out the good way to use it.

"I stopped using my cheap electric blade grinder after trying burr manual grinderpros:- Easy grinding process with good control of size: I was able to get fine for espresso and coarse for french-pressed. I have tried making turkish coffee the grains were little bit larger than usual turkish coffee (still fine). For me was ok because I normally use filter with turkish coffee.- relatively long handle make it easy to grind. You need more strength when needing small size grains or using hard beans! keep that in your mind! For others can't have strength to do such work they can double grind by doing it twice. First grind large grains and then fine with less force.- Stainless steel body and look good in the kitchen.- Easy to disassemble/ assamble for cleaning.Cons:- After cleaning with water you need to make sure it drays first. Removing water from inside and between parts is not easy.I now use this manual burr grinder because its more convenient to transport and can be used anywhere.

"I usually stay away from reviewing debated topics that involved some since to it lol.the since behind Air ionizer is like that: Instead of filtering the air like using regular filter, ionizer devices emit ions, which are essentially just molecules that have a positive or negative charge. The idea is that ionized particles of various allergens and odorous materials will either stick to surfaces or each other, at which point they wont be floating air anymore.I still can't prove all that claims as a regular customer. For me I have allergy and seasonal asthma and I need every help to reduce getting sick. This device works when plug it in my car. no noise and no weird actions. I have baby too sometime ride with me and reducing this particles will help. to be quit honest its hard to notice any changes because as I mentioned above this work mini particles and ions field. I still need to clean my car from inside everyone and then. these particle s that stick to car surfaces need to be clean out or it will rebuild and re-grow again. So i'm giving the device 5 stars because its keep working with no issues. I receive it for free for evaluation purpose. and will update my review if something need to be corrected.

"I have using this for a month now and every time I use it get in love more and more. There are some reasons that why I use french press over my drip machine:In french press the coffee seeps and water does not run through it quickly. When you brew coffee using drip machine with paper filter all oils and sediment that occur naturally in coffee beans is filtered out. In french press, the only thing you don''t drink is the ground coffee- everything else is included in your cup and it allows you to fully appreciate all that coffee has to offer. One other reason, proper water temperature (196-200) for the duration. when using french press you can control your water temperature and time of brewing, by controlling I mean manually doing that and you have the full control which is totally different in case of drip machine (well most of them).Now for the product itself: as I said I use this for month now almost every morning and some nights when I feel I need good coffee during my homework or finishing paper work,Pros:- Good quality well made and sturdy stainless steel french press. very shiny and will not be afraid of breaking anything since its make fully stainless steel.- Nice and fine stainless steel filter, that works very well with my coarse grind coffee beans.- Sturdy one piece unit with very well fit and secure top led.- The plunger with led and filter fit tight and secured inside coffee press. and when you press there is no ground coffee leak from in between.- I feel very safe putting it dish washer with no problems.I'm still doing a lot of practice to reach the best brewing coffee and here what I reach so far: The king of coffee, coffee roast and coffee grind all mater in making any coffee.- I buy whole coffee beans that already roasted ( I use to roast my beans, I stop now it needs a lot of time and outdoor space because of smoke). I grid my coffee manually the amount I need before I brew my coffee so I get the most fresh and oil from my coffee.- There are many recommendation for the coffee water ratio but I really can't give you one here. I always change my ratio from time to time according to may thing (coffee kind, roast and my mode too).- Your grind should be coarse. There is way to know if your grind too fine or too coarse is when you press the filter down. If the grounds are too fine, you'll have a hard time pressing it down. If you can push the filter down with absolutely no resistance, then the grounds are too coarse.- I heat water while I'm grinding coffee, I add coffee to beaker then add some water to just cover the coffee and then stir. I wait one minute then add the whole water to the top (assuming i'm doing coffee for 4 people). Then cover it secured and wait from 4 to 5 min. and press the plunger.

"If you like to watch coming of age movies, this one will not let you down.  Lou Pucci, young actor in the leading role also earned recognition for his acting in the Sundance Festival.  But this movie is full of big name actors and they all deliver a fabulous piece of work.  This of: Tilda Swinton, Vincent D' Onforio, Keanu Reeves and Vince Vaughn.It is not easy to be a teenager, no matter where you live, who you are, who your family is and what your real or perceived talents are.  So the main character is in search of his own self.  He is cute but insecure, smart but not truly realizing his potential, partly due to distractions all normal teenagers face: girls, craving for acceptance, pressure of choosing the next step after college - which school to go to, whether to stay close to home or move away...  To make things worse, to deal with all social pressures around him and reduce anxiety, the young main is - guess what - sucking his thumb - to enormous annoyance of his jock father.It is cute to see all twists and turns this young man is trying n order to be ""normal"".  He joins school's debate club, he starts having sex with a girl he genuinely cares for, but for her he is just a sex toy, he even tries drugs, both legal and illegal (retalin and marijuana).  This is a kind of dark comedy/coming of age movie that at the end will leave you smiling form all possibilities that a young person has ahead of them.  Somehow, long after movie I kept thinking that a young person like that will have a very few missed opportunities in his life.  He is so hungry for life that he simply will not settle for mediocre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R58WUDOUMLO0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C20VVE#wasThisHelpful","R58WUDOUMLO0A","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During my recently vacation to new Mexico, I decided to pick up several movies from my local library and take them on my vacation.  ""Tetro"" was one of them.  Sure enough there were two main factors for choosing this movie: it features Vincent Gallo one of the best character actors and the fact that this film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola.  Film is shot completely in black and white with flashbacks in color.  I liked that movie had  international actors and the fact that Claus Maria Brendauer was in it was a subtle clue that this will be a story about a villain who is greater than life.Benny is a young 18-year old man working on a cruise ship.  His ship stops in Buenos Aires for repairs and Benny uses the opportunity to trace down his brother Angelo who left family long time ago and severed all relationship with them.  Angelo now goes by new name ""Tetro"", which later in a movie we learn is a shorten version of his last name.  Tetro is 20 years older then Benny but it is obvious that benny craves his older brother's acceptance and love.  Benny is not ready to let go of their family relationships even though Tetro assures him he ""divorced"" his blood family long time ago,Boys father is famous, successful conductor who is ruthless.  When Tetro announces that he wished to study philosophy instead of pre-med so he can be a writer one day, it is his father who tells him that to be a writer and live solely from writing, one must be a genius and in their family there already was one genius and it sure was not Tetro.  It is so obvious that Tetro's father is megalomaniac with sense of entitlement if for no other reason then for the fact that he is successful, rich and powerful.  Everyone else in the family is doomed to live in his shadow, Tetro is no exception.As movie goes on, the family story unfolds with all tragedies that make this film a masterpiece.  The end is explosive and it is a way for Tetro and Benny to mend the incredible losses they had to endure in their lives until that moment.  It is a story of redemption for Tetro who can finally forgive himself from walking away from the woman he loved and put aside the irreversible emotional pain caused to him by his father and other family members.This is a unique look of what type of hurt a dysfunctional person can impose on their own family.  The damage is enormous and it affects all.  This is a kind of tragedy one is used to reading only in classics.  And it is marvelous to watch.  This film will keep you engaged form start to finish.  It is one of the best films made by F.F. Coppola.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3YPHAEIPE1D7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035L1PHI#wasThisHelpful","R3YPHAEIPE1D7","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every now and then I summon the courage to put my hands on book of poetry.  Yes, I am a snob and I like classics and poets from long ago who are no longer amongst the living.  In the recent years, I dares read poems from Eastern European writers.  When I saw this new collection of poems by Linda Gregerson, I had to acquire it and read her comprehensive collection of poems from nearly 30 years.  There are some new works and of course works that have secured Ms. Gregerson well deserved place amongst well established fine artists of American poetry.Ms. Gregerson dedicated this book to her sister which was a touching tribute.  I love this collection that is collection of contemporary work that is not shy to use various references to mythology and mythological figures.  At the same time, these poems do not shy away from the modern life and way of living with computers, internet and URLs...  This is one of the most unconventional book of poems in my collection and it gives me lots of pleasure to keep it close by and just randomly choose to re-read a poem of two daily.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12OQ5TZ85DO5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544301676#wasThisHelpful","R12OQ5TZ85DO5W","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Truman Capote is a literary giant.  Best known for his book ""In Cold Blood"" he is also an author of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"".  There are numerous stories he wrote in fashion magazine.  But what is really interesting about this writer who came from humble beginnings in Alabama and had Harper Lee for the best friend when he lived there, is that he somehow found hos way into New York's high society.  He was friends with socialites such as: Barbara (Babe) Pauley, Pamela Churchill Hayward, Harriman, Slim Hayward who later married an impoverished British lord and was a template for Lauren Becall's image when she was at the height of her career.Truman had unlimited access to these ladies.  Their husbands and lovers never saw him as a threat, after all, Truman was openly homosexual.  Ladies found him entertaining and he found them to be unlimited resource of inspiration.  Babe Pauley in particular was his muse.  She was icon od elegance and high society sophistication.  Babe was beautiful and refined. Her first marriage was with Mr. Mortimer, a Standard Oil heir; but when Babe's mother found out that all his wealth was tied into trust fund he had no access to, marriage was short lived.  Soon afterwards, Babe married wealthy William Pauley, man of humble Jewish roots from Chicago, who needed to have a partners that will open the door to him to New York High Society contacts.  Babe had all he needed: contacts, beauty, refinement, taste.  Her job was to expand on his social contacts that were limited at times simply because of the fact that he was a Jew.One important thing Truman overlooked is that this class of people cherishes discretion above all.  They do not air their dirty laundry in public and when one day they find out that their lives are exposed in Truman's short story published in one of the New York magazines, he finds himself cut off without any warning from them all.  Truman committed social suicide without even realizing it at first.. He becomes a bitter man drowning in alcohol, drugs and serious of unsuitable affairs after his long term lover Jack moves on away from life he finds unacceptable to his own sensibilities.  Truman's life of excess is a road to his demise.  He suddenly finds himself lonely, unable to function, cut off from high society.  People avoid him discreetly at first and later on he is publicly cutoff for betraying people who took of him during his less fortunate times when he was just a young writer with no name and reaches.This is a lovely book about what life was like during 50s and 60s in NYC high society.  It is a story of a writer who lost his touch with reality that led to his own demise and eventually death.  A man unable to sustain his relationship with his lover Jack until he finally pushes Jack away, a man who chooses vulgar jokes as a guest on Johnny Carson's show that diminish his belonging into ladies' clique; his petty jealousy towards talented writers such as Gore Vidal, Norman Mailer and even his childhood friend Harper Lee.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ9POLNC38ZDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345528697#wasThisHelpful","RJ9POLNC38ZDW","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these heavy duty gloves in order to use them on the clients who are receiving esthetics body treatments such as body scrub, body wrap, waxing and other services.  I like the fact that gloves are thicker and have texture.  For me personally, thicker glove helps establish more ""distance/space"" in professional relationship between service provider and a client.  More texture on the glove only can enhance the experience of the treatment.  I am not using these gloves during facial treatment.  During facial I need to ""feel"" the facial skin in order to determine elasticity or level or pressure during facial massage.  Also, (blackhead) extractions are easier to do with gloves that have thin consistency.These gloves come in tan color, which is another plus.  I love the fact that color is not too fancy.  It gives is professional look while on hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P9U4IY468BQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058I2VE2#wasThisHelpful","R2P9U4IY468BQQ","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently I read several books on the topic of being able to establish communication channel with the loved ones who have passed onto the Other Side.  It is not uncommon for many people who go through loss to experience intense and sometimes overwhelming grief once they loose a person they love.  It is a kind of loss that is irreversible and it is usually intensified by feelings of grief, regret, abandonment to name just a few emotions.  Author Laura Lynne Jackson discovered early in her life that she has ability to sense when people are about to cross to the other side.  Later on, she realized she had a way to sense presence of the people form the other side and also establish connection with them and carry on messages they wanted to pass on to the family members that missed them.Personally I always felt I could feel subtle messages from the people I have on the Other side.  I wish that book explains on how ordinary people can create or advance the skill to connect with the souls on the other side and receive messages directly.Luckily, Ms. Jackson has degree in English language from Oxford so I can say that her book is wonderfully written.  It is really a story of a woman who came to grips about he unusual abilities early in her life.  I could understand her fear of not being understood or considered ""not normal"" simply for the fact of her unusual abilities that so many skeptics would dismiss right away.  But what I found really endearing is that towards the end of the book, Ms. Jackson mentions how all three of her children have unusual psychic abilities.  Each of them has different abilities and each is accepted and nurtured by their parents.This book is an easy and fun read.  I wish there is a reference in the book on how to get in touch with Ms. Jackson for people who are interested in contacting their beloved ones on the Other Side.  I decided to give this book to one of my yoga students who recently lost her sister to cancer.  I think that reading this book will give her some peace in knowing that our loved ones on the other side are always by us and that in some way, they never really left us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZY65XR1YZG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812998383#wasThisHelpful","RHZY65XR1YZG8","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used another product from this same brand and loved it.  So I can say that brand has consistency.  My tanning lotion came with complimentary mitt which made application very easy.  There are so many advantages about this product: it has a pleasant scent, it absorbs quickly, it does not stain and is not streaky and it lasts for almost a week.Personally I am not big on tanning, but there are times when I teach yoga workshops when I like to add a little color to my arms and chest so I do not look too pale.  Color looks natural, so no need to worry about looking ""orange"".This product is a good quick fix to getting some color in your skin and it is healthier than going to the tanning bad (do not go to the tanning bad if you can help it, you are begging to get cancer).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3T5FNKZZ406/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EHOLAQ#wasThisHelpful","R3E3T5FNKZZ406","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Esthetically, this watch looks very nice.  I have seen many ceramic style watches and this one matches all the others I saw to day.  The difference is that this is a digital watch and has many, many, many features.  As a matter of fact it has so many features that you really have to read the instruction manual on how to setup time, alarm, times, alarm tone, etc.That brings me to what disadvantages of the product are:#1) The instruction manual is too tiny and it is hard to read.  One almost needs magnifying glass to be able to read it.#2) The instructions and pictures are not in logical order.#3) Eventually I got so frustrated with setting up the time alone that I let it for family member to take care of because I lost all patience.#4)  Then I remembered that ""fall back"" time zone adjustment will happen any time soon so I gave up trying to set it up completely before I have to do it all over again in the next couple of weeks.#5) One has to keep little flimsy instruction manual hidden in a safe place, because once this manual is lost, good luck with resetting the watch.  If one has plenty of time on their hands, they can play with it for hours until all features are setup properly.And I am just too impatient to go through all of that.  I almost wish I can find a teenager to give this watch to as a present.  I am sure it would make them happy.

"I came across this book during my recent trip to one of the favorite store in Chicago's Greektown called ""Athenian Candle"" that sells candles, incense and oils to their clients.  Author Ted Andrews is well knows for his book ""Animals Speak"" and since I have always been curious about past lives (regression) I picked up this tiny book for the quick read on the train.Book explains basic principle of karma, past lives, reincarnation, free will.  Each chapter also explains various techniques every person can do (on their own) to facilitate subconscious knowledge about their past life regression.  Various techniques are explained: dowsing, use of pendulum, hypnosis, etc.  I like that author is explain use of incense, herbs, candles, colors, etc. to facilitate easier access tour subconscious minds.  I also like his idea that by learning about our past lives, we can more easily access information on what are the things we are supposed to work out in this lifetime so we can more easily move to the next level.  It is almost like taking an educated guess on how to live our present lives by making corrections form our past mistakes.Author passed away in 2009, but the selection of his books on the various topics on metaphysis is amazing.

I have used essential oils that are 1/2 and 1/3 size of this one and fragrance would stay on my skin for an entire day.This purchase was a nice experiment, but for $25 I would rather purchase a designer perfume on sale or in a small size that this product.

"I am yoga practitioner and yoga teacher.  Recently I came across this book at my yoga studio.  I decided to read it, since I noticed that author mentions how practicing yoga helped him cure his colitis and ADD.  I really enjoyed book from the start.  Author has sense of humor and he is not afraid to make fun of himself and sometime incredulous situations he found himself in.  He explains how he got hooked on yoga during his college years and how eventually teaching yoga and providing holistic healing became his calling in spite of the fact that he earned business degree from Georgetown University.  I happen to know another overeducated yogi, Ms. Amy Beth Treciokas who is my yoga teacher who studies Ashtanga Yoga under Pathabi Jois.  Ms. Treciokas has degree from University of Chicago and instead of pursuing career in medicine, she choose to open her yoga studio in Chicago's Gold Coast - called Yoga Now.In that respect, I understand how some people, like Brian Leaf, simply find happiness, fulfillment and joy in being of service to others, while using yoga to help them maintain healthy and happy personal and professional life.This book is a light read, but very funny.  It gives an insight to why some people choose to live life that does not always has guarantee to comfort and financial stability and yet, they feel full of life and energy to wake up in the morning every day and carry on with their lives. It takes years and decades to come to terms with such life and it is not always easy.  Every yoga teacher knows that it is not always possible making a living by teaching yoga.  But most people I know use yoga as a way to add value to their life.  Without it, even in their corporate jobs and family life, they are unable to find a full peace.  The fulfillment comes form practice, medication and willingness to carve out a little time for oneself during the day and just focus to one's inner Divine Power.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWORHL4H2FSKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160868136X#wasThisHelpful","RWORHL4H2FSKV","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this wall clock.  It is much larger than I expected, but I like it very much.  I intend to use it in my yoga studio.  But this clock is perfect for use at home too, especially in the kitchen or in the exercise room if you have one.  Numbers on the clock are quite large but it is nice that clock is silent.  hence the use in the yoga studio.  It will not disturb the class with the noise, especially during meditation and shavasana (final relaxation) pose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMQQFX0I8HZA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSYXGVM#wasThisHelpful","RMQQFX0I8HZA5","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are beautiful body pads that one can use on both face and body.  It is perfect for oily and combination oily skin (on the face) because pads are soaked with salicylic acid that prevents acne and helps control oil production.  I must say that this product is useful for both men and women.  I do have another secret on how to use this product on the body.  It is perfect after bikini / brazilian waxing (shaving).  After waxing, it helps going over the skin with this pad because it will help prevent creation of the ingrown hairs.  I know some friends who have been using Image cleansing pads that are soaked with the same ingredients as these.  This product is much more affordable and it gives the same results.Someone was asking what is the percentage of salicylic acid in the product.

"I really like the color of this bra.  It is almost golden color.  Straps are removable so one can wear the bra with summer strapless dresses or blouses.  Bra has satin like feel and look and it provides great coverage.  Personally I do not like bras with underwire and this one has one.  This size is a little too big for me and I am not sure I will be wearing it.  For personal reasons I prefer wire-free undergarments because they feel more comfortable on my skin and body.

"This is lovely work of fiction describing the unusual relationship between famous painter Camille Pissaro's parents.  Camille's mother Rachel Pomie Petit Pizzaro was born and raised on a small island of St. Thomas to Jewish parents.  She was devoted to her father Moses and had turbulent relationship with her mother.  Rachel was a free spirit and she felt confined in her role of a woman.  Encouraged by her father to read, she often imagined herself to live in Paris, France.  Being of Jewish faith, and obedient to her father's wishes, at very early age Rachel was married to her father's business partner Isaac Petit, who was a widower, almost 20 years older than Rachel and who already had 8 children with his first wife, three of whom survived and became Rachel's responsibility to take care of once they were married.  Their marriage was a business arrangement that was supposed to improve failings of two businesses and make a single strong business venture.As fate will have it, Rachel' s beloved housekeeper she was very close to died and not long after Rachel was married; Rachel's father passed away soon after and before Rachel turned 30, she had 3 children with her husband and the fourth one on the way when her husband suddenly died at the age of 50 leaving behind Rachel alone with 7 children and a failing business.  As it turns out, her husband was inept businessman and his family who lived in France, decided to send over Isaac's nephew Abraham Gabriel Francois Pizzaro to help Rachel in reviving the business.  So the real story starts here; Rachel is a widow with 7 children and 8 years senior to Francois.  According to Jewish tradition, she and Francois are related through marriage and the intimate relationship between the two is forbidden.  In spite of it all, the two fall in love madly with each other and end up having 4 children together, one of them  (the third one) was Abraham Jacobo Camille Pizzaro who grew up to become one of the best known painters in the age of French Impressionism..  Camille had difficult relationship with his mother, perhaps because the two were very much alike.  Both rebellious, emotional, craving for love and beauty of life.  Camille is not interested in pursuing family tradition of being a shopkeeper and his lack of interest in school forces his parents to send him to Paris at the age of 12 where he stays until he is 17 years old.  It is in Paris that Camille develops his talent for drawing and painting that sets him on the path to become one of the founders of the French Impressionist movement.Camille comes back to St. Thomas, but before long leaves island again to live and create art in Venezuela; He eventually moves to Paris.  While his relationship with his father is tender, Camille and his mother are at odds.  He is her favorite son and yet she is unable to talk him out of living his life as an artist.  Throughout his life, his mother supports Camille and his family financially and he never manages to completely break away form her and her demands.  As much as Rachel carved her own path in her own life despite other people objections, she was unable to do the same for her favorite son.  In her desire to ensure only the best for him, she is opinionated and sharp tongued that puts the two o them against each other for the rest of their lives.Ms. Hoffman is a prolific writer who received many literary recognitions over the years.  This book is beautifully written and all characters were compelling although most of them are fictional (with exception f Camille's immediate family members and her mother's personal history).  For anyone who loves art, impressionism and wants to learn more about what mind of a true artist is probably like, this is delightful book to read.  I love the fact that both Camille and his mother Rachel shared one thing in common: they believed in power of love.  Neither one of them was wiling to give up their true love of life because of other people's opinions.  It was not an easy thing to stand up to establishment, tradition, social rules of the time and of course family.  But they both did.  They each gave it all to the persons who they loved deeply and neither one of them had regrets.  Not that is what I call true love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R132TL8A3QUYM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451693591#wasThisHelpful","R132TL8A3QUYM9","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I teach and practice yoga.  So almost daily I walk barefoot in the yoga studio.  I do have regular bi-weekly pedicures and I can say I am fortunate enough that my feet look decent.  However, I walk a lot.  I commute to and from work by train and sometimes I get blisters or skin hardens.  I use foot creams and lotions every night, but I also like to scrub my feet vigorously for the purposes of exfoliation and better blood circulation.  I used pumice stone in a shower in the past until one day, at TJ Maxx I came across this buffer/brush that has 4 different sides to it for every possible treatment of feet one can possibly need.  My brush is just like the one in the picture - pink.  Regardless of what some of the other reviewers have to say about the color, I must say that color was the last reason I bought this tool.  I use it on my feet and I can see the results.  It rubs and it polishes and it can also help cleansing the nails.  There is a warning on the product that people with diabetes and poor blood circulation or inflamed skin should not be using this tool.Not so long ago I also purchased cuticle nipper made by Clean logic which incidentally also came in pink color. Nipper replaced the previous one I had that was no longer sharp or effective.  There is one important thing to mention about CleanLogic line of products.  Isaac Shapiro, founder of the company created a brand of beauty products that also uses Braille alphabet on its packaging.  It is fantastic to learn that there is a company that creates products for beauty and health that also helps blind people or people with severe vision loss to live fulfilling and independent lives.  When you purchase any of the CleanLogic products, portion of the sale goes towards the Inspiration Foundation, non profit organization created in honor of Mr. Shapiro's mother that supports vision impaired individuals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC81BYHZAPOBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HS4D96#wasThisHelpful","RC81BYHZAPOBI","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came across this book while shopping for candles and incense at the small shop in Chicago's Greektown.  For very long time, I had a feeling that my vital energy is being drained.  Every time I replenish it, it would deplete just as fast.  When I saw the book in the store, I decided to pick it up.  If there were people r forces who were causing me to suffer, perhaps this book could help me eliminate their presence or influence in my life.  I must say, the book turned out to be a real revelation.  It is a tiny little book, only 88 pages long, but I kept reading and re-reading every chapter.  After every chapter there is a part of the book where one can make notes.  I have learned about evil eye, psychic attacks and other maladies that people of low character or with malicious thoughts can project.  But thanks to the author, I also found out the best ways to protect myself from such influences.  I learned about healing properties of essential oils, herbs, healing baths, spiritual cleansing techniques that include use of incense and specially prepared baths.  I also learned how to cleanse my home from negative energies.  For anyone who believes that there is another plane of existence besides our physical realm, this is a must have book and manual they must have.  I am using this book as a reference manual and it is becoming my way of life.  It is a way that keeps me spiritually strong, mentally alert and aware.  I wish I knew about this book and the author sooner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RRVK8QRP0QBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1578635209#wasThisHelpful","R2RRVK8QRP0QBY","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the look and feel of this weekly planner. Of course the most unusual part of it is that it is July1015-July 2016 calendar which makes it somewhat untraditional.  Colors are very pleasing.  Cover is tannish/gray with orange spiral bound.  These colors complement each other very well and make this planner an elegant look.I teach yoga and I am taking advanced yoga teacher training.  This planner allows me to stay on op of my daily activities related to everything yoga.  Weekly layout is just what I need.  I do not need more or less space than it is provided, because my days with yoga events are not booked solid.  There are only a couple of events during the day, and yet I like to be reminded of them - an old fashioned way.  I do not like electronic calendars.  Also in my classes mobile phones are turned off, so it is convenient to have a real planner available to remind me of my responsibilities.  Planner is also lightweight so it does not take lots of space or weight, which is a plus especially for women who tend to carry too much stuff in their purses and carry on bags.

"I purchased this product because it is medical grade toner for oily and acne prone skin.  It has only 2% salycilic acid, but it feels much stronger.  I use this toner in the morning and at night after cleansing the skin.  It definitely controls oil production and keep skin blemish free.  I used to be devoted to Obagi products, but ever since I finished my esthetics licensure, I am finding myself drawn to try other medical grade products.  One of the biggest competitors in medical grade products with this line is Neocutis and IS Clinical.  I Love Neocutis skin care and IS sunscreen products.  Obagi has unfortunate fallen down the list.  Still good products, but when it comes to the price, I am convinced that there are others that are price competitive and superior in quality.  I will still buy Obagi if I find a good deal, but unfortunately it is no longer my first choice.  I would still recommend products from this line to anyone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XWQ6F04HS1GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CJJ5XG#wasThisHelpful","R1XWQ6F04HS1GW","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ms. Polly Samson, author of the book is well known author in her native England.  She is a recipient of many prizes for her work.  This is her first book published in US and I will be the first to admit that the reason I picked up the book is because of its title.  It is a story about love between Julia and Julian.  Julian is a young man, student of literature when one day he meets Julia who is training her hawk in the fields  and falls madly in love with her.  Julia is eight years his senior, without any education (except for her high school) and she has been married for almost 12 years to a man who is as abusive as he is a looser.  Her husband met her when he was young, runaway from not so happy family.  Julia's father was an alcoholic and her mother is controlling and outright mean, opinionated and crude.  Julian is raised as an only son of a widow from nice to do middle class.  His mother was generously taken care of by her intimate friend who marries her once Julian is away form college.Love between Julia and Julian is overpowering for them both.  Of course, there are always others looking to destroy such enviable devotion of two people towards each other.  Both Julian and Julia make sacrifices.  She divorces her abusive husband and Julian gives up his promising career graduate school and in academia and so he can raise family with Julia.  After many long years of trying, they manage to have a girl Mira Eliana than deepens their connection even more.  But when Mira gets sick, their love is put to test and  their 7 year old relationship spirals destruction that cannot be undone.I had a little bit of difficulty reading the book because it jumps (unexpectedly) from past to present.  But the story had me hooked from start to finish.  I just did not expect the story to have such explosive ending.  Unexpected twists and turns and unhappy ending to all participants involved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2227L4MFA10AK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632860678#wasThisHelpful","R2227L4MFA10AK","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ahava product lines have been around a while.  Sometimes I forget that although they are widely accessible (one can find it in any retail store: from grocery stores to CVS & Walgreens) that are still a high quality products.  What makes this product unique is that if you look at the ingredients list, this product is not made out of any water, the main ingredient of the product is dead see water and other waters from nature (all from Israel).  There is also some witch hazel in this product (good antiseptic) and allantoin (moisturizer).  What really took my breath away is how beautiful fresh scent this product has.  It is very thick in texture, so you will not need to use too much on it on your hands.  Product absorbs well on the skin and stays on for a long time.  I have been using this product on my hands, but I also apply it at night on my feet before going to bed.  Extra moisture is really keeping my heels soft s and nice looking for the summer season when I wear sandals.

"I have been Natori customer for a while, although I must admit that all of my purchases for this brand were limited to their intimates products.  Their clothing line is fine quality and I was intrigued to try their body lotion.  I must say that lotion comes in elegantly designed bottle and it is easy to use (no extra squeezing of the bottle needed, also lotion is the right texture too - not too watery or too reach).  However, I find scent to bee too flowery and sweet.  It is OK for young women, but more mature customers may find it a little too girlish.  I use it only on the weekends when it is time to go to bed or after I take shower after my workout and do not plan to go out in public.

"I used to get Frommers' travel guides before all of my trips and read and research places and things I could see.  One day, I got work assignment in Hong Kong, China and in my local library I found lovely books on China from Lonely Planet.  From that point on, Lonely Planet travel books are always my first choice for getting ready for my trips - domestic or international.  Recently, I picked up the book on France that covers the most exciting parts of the country any visitor with plenty of time should visit and enjoy at the slow pace.  Surely, I could not miss the latest edition of travel book on Paris - the City of Love.  There is absolutely everything great about this book:  it provides just right amount of information so the book is not too thin or too thick to carry on your trip.  It is well written and photos are so beautiful.  I normally do not care about taking pictures when I am on vacation.  I love to experience the trip, people, food, my travel companion(s) and taking pictures I find to be a distraction.  So even if you do take pictures, there are some in this book that are so beautiful you will not want to get rid of the book.  Looking at the pictures will bring all the memories from the trip.With this book one can visit all the amazing places in Paris without having to join hordes of people that are part of the tourist groups.  You will be on your own and you will love it.  Even better, all information about the museums, city, restaurants are authentic so there will be no need to rely on someone else's opinion about things and places.  You will be free to draw your own conclusions and even more amazing, you will find it you agree with the travel writer of this wonderful guide most of the time.

"The reason I picked this book is because I was curious to read a book on how an underdog gets to find a job and success on Wall Street.  So many times in professional careers we find out it is not what we know but who we know that propels one's career.  Mr. DeSenna Trennet is gracious to acknowledge in his book all the people who helped him along the way with his career.  His grandfather was Italian immigrant and parents lived modest lives in Long Island.  Once he realized that he does not have what it takes (money and connections) to land a career in diplomacy, he applies his abilities working in financial markets on Wall Street.There are moments that I found book very amuzing.  For example, Mr. DeSenna's observation that ivy league schools are nothing better that expensive job recruiting places (he got his undergraduate degree at Georgetown).  It is also funny when his colleagues on 10th anniversary from their business school start sending snotty updates about how ""successful"" they are.  His reply to them all probably did not win him any new friends, but the gist of it is so amuzing it is worth referencing it during social events and gatherings with friends.However, there are parts of the book the I found somewhat biased and disturbing.  For example, he references people who gave him job opportunities in the past only by their names and he references Donald Trump as ""Mr. Trump"".  Personally, I do not find Donald Trump to be any more remarkable than many of the people he mentions in the book.  The only thing Donald Trump has going for him is his celebrity status, which almost puts his in the same category as Kardashians. Mr. DeSenna also references some of the pitfalls of the industry - beautiful women.  Most of them use their appeal to gather insider information.  Some have even landed in jail for doing so.  But his ""friend and colleague"" Maria Bartiromo is excluded from the pack even though (as far as I remember) she was accused of getting too cozy with one of the CEOs from the major financial corporation.  I guess Ms. ""Money Honey"" is staying away from marketing her sex appeal (not!).Towards the end of the book I found many of his comments disturbing starting with comparison of how unfair Social Security is.  He mentions a woman who supposedly contributed only $27 in her lifetime to Social Security fund, got to live to be 100 and over the years she collected $27,000 in Social Security. For someone who is so proud of his Italian heritage and European roots, it is surprising that he finds no need to show at least some respect towards elderly poor who have no other means to make money, but depend on society to help them out.  I was so shocked with his comments that I almost felt grateful there is no legal euthanasia allowed in the state of NY.  This guy would probably put this woman to death in order to  save money in social security fund.  I guess no human being contributes to society at all to be taken care of in some form or another once they get old and especially if (God forbid) they end up having no family since they got to live to be 100.The other thing that was disturbing is his proposal to charge immigrants $50,000-$100,000 for the privilege to become US citizens.  I just want to know how is he planning to collect that money from some  uneducated fruit picker from Mexico who makes less than a minimum wage and has family to support with that money.And lastly, there is his disregard for nature and sacredness of earth.  His proposal to solve national debt is to have places like Grand Canyon sold to corporations like (Disney or Great America) that could generate revenue by creating amuzement park?!  Come on, Mr. DeSenna what is next - let's chip the stone from Grand Canyon and start selling it to masses so they can build fabulous kitchen counters in their precious homes!!!The book started great and it ended poorly.  It is still a read one should take on because there are so many things one can challenge in this book coming from an Ivy League educated financial wizard I do not even know where to begin from...","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O2YWQ995IGJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250068274#wasThisHelpful","R1O2YWQ995IGJR","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been feeding my kitty this food for the last couple of weeks.  Normally I give him Science Diet and this brand was a little bit of diversion.  I decided to see if he has special affection for the cat food that is gluten free.  Description of this food states that it is good for cat's immune and digestive system and it also helps support kitty's skin and coat.  In addition to chicken, this cat food is loaded with antioxidants.  Here is a short list of ingredients:Chicken, Chicken Meal, Chickpeas, Peas, Lentils, Chicken Liver, Chicken Hearts, Flaxseed, Pea Fiber, Tapioca Flour, Tomato Pomace, Chicken Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols), Natural Flavor, Beets, Coconut Oil, Cranberries, Choline Chloride, Turmeric, Calcium Carbonate, Chia Seeds, Vitamin E Supplement, Taurine, Zinc Proteinate, Spinach, Mixed Tocopherols added to preserve freshness, Broccoli, Ginger, Pumpkin, Parsley, Apples, Blueberries, Kale, Purple Carrots, Niacin, Iron Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Thiamine Mononitrate, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Riboflavin, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Manganese Proteinate, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Inulin, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite, Folic Acid, Dried Lactobacillus plantarum Fermentation Product, Dried Enterococcus faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus casei Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus Fermentation Product, Dried Enterococcus thermophilus Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus bulgaricus Fermentation Product, Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract, Spearmint Extract (this is a naturally preserved product).It just seems that my kitty cat's selection of acceptable food just got bigger!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PR7XV2QSBUUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZ03HJC#wasThisHelpful","R3PR7XV2QSBUUD","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK - accidents happen.  I exercise often and that adds significant load for wash every week.  One time, I forgot to take out wet clothes from the washer and hand dry 9it (which I do with my exercise clothes).  Try not to do that to yourself, because you will discover that clothes do not smell good if left in the washer overnight. After all - what is the point of washing exercise clothes if afterwards they are still not going to smell fresh?  So to rescue my really nice (and pricey) yoga gear, I washed clothes again and added this deodorant for clothes.  I love the scent and I can say that after the wash unpleasant stale scent disappears and thankfully I got my clothes back.I am hoping not to have similar ""accidents"" in the future and if I do, this is a go to rescue solution.  On a good days I plan to use this product on bedding sheets so they will always smell fresh when bed is made.  There is nothing better then going to bed and inhaling sublime scent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V89RYGE7HBMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMWO66#wasThisHelpful","R3V89RYGE7HBMK","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried this product because it is marketed as ""water sleeping mask"" and it contains trademarked ""Sleepscent"" that is good for all skin types.  This product is actually made in Korea.  It is a gel mask that contains essential oils of orange flower, rose and sandalwood.  These three oils are what makes ""sleepscent"" and their gentle scent helps getting to sleep.  However, for anyone familiar with aromatherapy it is worth mentioning that sandalwood is not always the best choice for the essential oil for anyone who is suffering from depression.  Product contains apricot extract - which I love because it is deeply hydrating and it also has chesnut extract that helps skin retexturizing.So the water part of the label comes from the fact that this is a gel mask and not heavy; ingredients are very hydrating.  But I could not understand why this is called mask.  My routine typically includes, cleansing skin and applying toner.  At night I apply serum that also has high concentration of vitamin C (antioxidant).  The last step is to apply this gel mask.  Upon applying it on the skin it gives nice cooling effect to the skin: sensitive skin, will love relief, and oily/combination skin will like the fact that mask is not heavy and cooling effect tightens the pores.  Additionally, mask is absorbed very quickly and does not leave any residue.  The only difference that makes this mask and not a night cream is the fact that it is recommended for use 1-2 times a week.  But in my opinion this is a nice hydrating gel that can be applied overnight, not a mask.But the results are good and product is not too expensive.  Other than preservatives (which are chemicals and part of most skin care products), this product for the most part contains healthy ingredients.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRHKS16EL8L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KPYWM8#wasThisHelpful","RRHKS16EL8L8","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To me personally good mattress is a must in any bedroom.  Recently I purchased mattress topper that added even more comfort to my bed.  As you can imagine, my first concern was how to protect the new topper and ensure its longevity.  I also have a pet, kitty cat Jake, so I thought that this zippered mattress protector can preserve integrity of the mattress from cat hair and dandruff - even thought I am not allergic to it.  My mattress encasement came in queen size (60"" x 80"") and it is white color.  Cover of the package that it came in states that encasement servers mattress and bedbug barrier, allergen protection and waterproof protection and it helps with bedbugs (they cannot bite through the fabric), prevents staining and contamination of the mattress from liquids, prevents dust mites from accumulating in the mattress, protects from pollen and pet dander.Once I opened the package, I really did not like the feel of the encasement.  This encasement is made of 100% polyester and film that is 100% polyethylene.  So basically, it is almost as if you are placing plastic over your mattress.  In my opinion, plastic will choke any lady bugs, but then again, how is mattress fabric going to ""breathe""?In short, this encasement will help the cleanliness of the mattress.  It will be difficult to put on considering how heavy mattresses can be, so I do not see it being washed on a weekly basis.  It is perfect solution to use in places like nursing homes, senior citizen housing centers and hospitals. I just do not see it being used in my household.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKEQ6FNHQ29IP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CN0BJKU#wasThisHelpful","RKEQ6FNHQ29IP","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some time ago I read Ms. Tiffany Reisz's book from her Original Sinners series.  From the White Years series I read ""The King"" and ""Virgin"" is the second book I read.  For readers familiar with both series, it will be helpful to let them know that main characters Soren, Eleanor, Kingsley and Juliette continue to share their (alternative) lifestyle together. This book is dedicated to recalling the events form the year when Eleanor left Soren.  It also introduces a new character Kyrie, young girl barely 20 years old who chooses to become a nun.I am already familiar with the characters of the novel and their traits.  But as someone who has already read about them, it was easy for me to make a quick switch between Nora, Eleanor and Elle, Ms. Schreiber or Mrs. Sutherland.  They are really all the same person, but for any reader who has not read any of the previous work by Ms. Reisz, that may be too confusing. That is the reason I gave book 4 starts.I did like the fact that this book finally tackles the mystery of what happened between Soren and Eleanor to make her leave him.  All readers knew about the event from the previous book is that it was the hardest year for everyone who was a part of the tale about these characters.  The secret and mystery is finally out and some twists and turns on what happened and how it happened make readers stick with the story form start to finish.  Compared to some of her earlier books, some of the (erotic) scenes from the book are not as strong as they were in her first books.  Or it could be that I find nothing shocking in actions that characters make in and out of their bedrooms.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCAJKCLIGGKQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317978#wasThisHelpful","RCAJKCLIGGKQB","AJRFZ0VZ0LD26","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Silicone rings are my answer to a problem that I've had for years, my traditional metal wedding band would constantly get scratched from the daily grind of my job and trips to the gym. I have a few different silicone rings and but I really like this one, its simple but classic. The red stripe gives you some style and looks particularly good with sportier attire. I would like to point out the color is dark gray and not black. I didn't read the description and was a bit surprised. I know a few Buckeye fans who would go crazy for one of these. This ring protects my precious metal ring from getting damaged at work and the gym. The silicon stretches a little bit so the ring is extremely comfortable and feels a lot safer.

"I have fine, shoulder-length color-treated hair. I've tried several thermal protectors before and they either made my hair greasy or didn't seem any better than not using anything at all.

I was really excited to try this since I use an HSI hair straightener and it gets really hot!. After switching to this product from the Garnier one I was using my hair is much more manageable and shiny without feeling heavy or greasy. I'm also seeing much fewer split ends so it seems to be doing its job of protecting my hair.  I like the smell, its very clean and pretty. I will continue to use this product as long as it doesn't build up as some products can but I feel like its working very well for me so far.

"I'm very happy with my new nursing cover. I have used a nursing cover before but lately I had been trying to nurse only at home since it was such a hassle to keep myself covered with a wiggly 9 month old. The awesome cover has several features that have made breastfeeding outside my home or in front of guest so comfortable I won't leave home without this. There is a stiff wire that forms a 90 degree angle just between the neck strap which allows you to have a clear field of vision while nursing. My son can be seen peaking up through the little opening in my photos. This cover is also wonderfully oversized and comes with an adjustable strap around the neck and around the back. My old cover was always getting pulled off by my son but this Nursing Cover has a toggle and string in the back to keep the cover in place (Genius!). The neck strap is nice and wide too so its super comfortable even if your child insist on pulling on it while nursing. I also like that this cover came with a matching carry case and there is even a little pocket sewn onto the cover if you had a pacifier or something small it would hold it perfectly until you were done feeding. Also the print online does not do this lovely and relatively gender neutral pattern justice. Its a warm / muted dusty rose that look sophisticated enough to look like a mommy item and not a pinky, pinky baby girl item, like I said I use mine with my son. Overall its a wonderful product that I'll be recommending to all my mommy friends. I actually already bought more to give as gifts. I also really liked the included 4 pack of nursing pads.

Running shorts rarely have pockets big enough for anything more than a singe key so I was in the market for a running belt that would fit my needs. I love the look of this low profile running belt. Its sporty with quality materials and smart features like a headphone holder and sweat blocking fabric. It has a much sportier design than some of the other belts I've seen and it has an attractive thin profile that still allows me to fit all my junk inside it without it bouncing or bothering me in any way. The belt easily adjust and I've been wearing it everyday since it arrived and it super comfortable.

The little cart is not the sturdiest but its held up to the abuse my toddler has thrown its way so Im happy with it. It was pretty easy to put together and it has lots of cute details.

"I've been very happy with my purchase of this argan oil. You get a lot for your money, this is a bigbottle with an easy to use pump dispenser. It has 4oz of 100% pure argan oil. I have dry skin and I use this argan oil every night mixed in with a little Cetephil and I've noticed that my hands are softer and smoother than ever since I started using it. I don't nearly as many dry patches any more, and my moderate eczema always seems to leave me with a ton of dry patches in the summer, so I'm pretty impressed. The oil has a light nutty smell which goes away quickly. I often like to apply it to my skin after exiting the shower and it absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling I have also used this oil in my hair and experienced great results.

"I'm an avid runner and there is nothing that feels better after a run than one of these roller sticks. You can easily roll this on the underside of your calf and it helps to loosen tense muscle and the lactic acid that builds up from running.

I've tried a couple of different types of rollers but I like the roller stick particularly because it is very comfortable to use where as some of the other ones kind of hurt. I also love the valuable bonuses that come with this roller stick the exercise bands are very nice.

The frame is comfortable and doesnt feel flimsy like some other brands I've tried.The sound: The sound is well balanced. I hate when earbuds are just way too strong with the base and its drowns out other parts of the music. I find these are much more balanced than others for the same price on amazon which I appreciate. The sound is very detailed and sounded great paired with all the classical, pop, and classic rock I listened to with these.I did go on a run with these and they stayed put really well.Pros- Durable Construction-Built in microphone- Good Balanced Sound Quality- Included Carry Case- Comfortable over ear rotating pads- Cool ColorOverall, I think for the price you can't go wrong.

"My family and I travel often and pick pockets / credit card skimmers are always a concern of ours. We have started using these RFID protected money pouches for all our travels after a nightmare vacation last year when someone suddenly began making purchases with my husbands credit card information while we were on vacation. The police told us his wallet must have been skimmed by someone on the busy street who captured the info from his cards magnetic strip all while it was still tucked away in his wallet.Since then we like to be prepared and always use a pouch like this RFID protected Money pouch for peace of mind. This is one of the better quality RFID cases I've ever handled and I've seen several different models of these type of neck pouches. Its really comfortable to carry around your neck, you can easily adjust how high or low it hangs and I really like the clear window for your ID. It has the perfect pockets for all your travel stuff: passport, mp3 player, credit cards, boarding pass, etc. The fact that its RFID protected gives me some peace of mind that my credit cards will be uncompromised when I need them most. Also, wearing a wallet around my neck is incredibly practical, everything is right at your fingertips, no struggling to dig through a packed bag or losing anything. It has quality construction and nice zippers, I could see it lasting me for years to come. I was provided a complimentary product in exchange for my honest unbiased review and I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHRZYWZ9QJFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013YBAU10#wasThisHelpful","RWHRZYWZ9QJFF","A334AODWALOHFV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A334AODWALOHFV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These reusable food pouches are great and having 5 on hand means I always have one ready to go. My son is one year old and he just loves feeding himself the baby food in the pouches but those darn things can get expensive. I've been making my own baby food and pouring it into these pouches and its super cheap and easy. I like the gender neutral clean design of these. I can easily see myself using these well into grade school and filling them with apple sauce since those pouches are also way overpriced for what they are. I think these are easy to clean also but you need to do it right after using if you let the food dry in there it needs a soak before you can really clean it well. The lids are also compatible with the store bought pouch lids if you loose one.

"I've made a few purchases of these Baltic Amber necklaces because their products are very high quality and these make great gifts for new moms. This necklace is just beautiful in person. I've seen a few different varieties of these baby amber necklaces and this is particularly attractive. The beads have a pretty warm glow in the light and I was very impressed with the apparent quality. I put this necklace on my son it feels very sturdy and the clasp screws in so you don't have to worry about it breaking apart or pinching your child. Each amber bead is separated by a knot so even if the necklace did somehow pull apart the tiny beads would not all become instant choking bait. I also really like that this amber necklace is guaranteed to be authentic and comes with a nice carry bag. My son had been a chronic drooler and was suffering from some pretty bad teething pains, but he seems to have really let up on that since he has been wearing the necklace. Weather you believe these help teething or not, I think the cost is small to ensure you've taken every possible step to make your child more comfortable during a tough time. I definitely would give this brand my business if you do decide to get one because the quality of this necklace is some of the best I've seen. This bean shaped necklace in particular is really cool.

"I got for my grandmother who struggles with IBS and she is often so embraced by her condition that she regularly refuses to go shopping for fear of using public restrooms. We had a good laugh about this novel little product but then we actually had to try it and see if it worked. The spray actually has a bit of a body spray scent when you spray it and according to the instructions you just spray it before you do your business and it creates a barrier over the water that prevents smells from rising up after your done. I tried it and the only detectable scent in the room was the spray smell, which is pretty pleasant. My grandmother says she uses this all the time and plans to buy more if it ever runs out.

"This is a lovely book that chronicles the journey from Massachusetts to Colorado that inspired Katherine Lee Bates to write her poem, that became the famous patriotic song ""America The Beautiful.""  It opens with her childhood and how she loved to write in her red leather diary.  Since money was tight she stayed home to help out, but she was older she was able to get a loan from her brother and go to Wellesley College.  She taught English literature and when she first reviewed her poems after her memorable trip out West, she thought they weren't good and tossed them aside.  Later on, however, she decided to submit her ""America, The Beautiful"" poem to ""The Congregationalist.""  The editor liked the poem and published it in their fourth of July issue.  As it turns out, the rest of the country agreed with the editor and it soon became a song.  A much loved one, at that. The book is very nicely written and has many illustrations that fill the pages, throughout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE9XCHUQ0YPOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525456538#wasThisHelpful","RE9XCHUQ0YPOY","A91BK8S5QH98K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A91BK8S5QH98K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Long Ago In The Old South . . ."" when a fairy tale opens with a line like that, you know it is worth the read.  And this story is very much worth the read.  It is a fascinating retelling of a traditional Old Southern folk tale that has elements of Cinderella and King Lear in it.  The illustrations and the whole setting just evoke the Old South and the Southern mysticism and gothic heritage.  As the story goes, we have a sweet Candace who loves her father dearly.  Unfortunately, she has two sisters who don't.  Nonetheless, they trick their father into thinking that Candace doesn't love him as much as they do, thereby banishing Candace from the beautiful eight columned home.  In the woods, she encounters a green-eyed witch woman who hands her a gown made of boss.  However, by the starlight it turns into a beautiful gossamer gown.  Mistaking her for a peasant girl, she is taken in as a cleaning girl in a fine home that she comes across.  They have a ball . . . and you can imagine the rest.  I found this book to be utterly fascinating and I recommend it highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3XP40XU2076W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0395547938#wasThisHelpful","R3XP40XU2076W","A91BK8S5QH98K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A91BK8S5QH98K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an engrossing novel about Lydia, the purveyor of purple, who is one of Paul's first converts to Christianity in Europe.  The author has done a credible job of coming up with a believable plot about her life as a businesswoman during Roman times.  And she does a very nice job of exploring her conversion to Christianity.  She explains how Lydia and her friend, Fulvia, were tired of the orgies that some of the pagans passed off as a religion.  And how they learned for something true.  She makes Lydia a little bit more hesitant in her decision-making than I would have liked, but the story is a fascinating one, nonetheless.

The hippo, named Owen, was rescued after the tsunami through the bravery and collaboration of a lot of volunteers.

"Alas!  It has been such a long time since I've had a book that was as good a read as this one.  This is the first installment in the Penny Parker Mystery series, a young girl's detective series written my Mildred Wirt Benson, under her own name.  She was the famous ""Carolyn Keene"" for the original Nancy Drew mystery stories that have appealed to generations of young readers.  According to Mildred, she thought Penny Parker was more Nancy Drew than Nancy Drew.  Being a huge fan of Nancy Drew, I don't quite think so.  But, I thoroughly enjoyed venturing into this new detective series.  It features an actress who comes into town who is traumatized by the recurring appearances of a Witch Doll that continually brings her bad luck.  There is also a scandal involving a fortune teller and a poor girl who is trying to run her doll shop.  Riverview is the Penny Parker equivalent of Nancy Drew's Riverheights and the the broken down blue ""leaping lema"" is the Penny Parker equivalent of Nancy Drew's blue roadster.  These are more classic elements of the Nancy Drew detective stories are present throughout this mystery series and in short plain language, this book is so much fun to read!  Penny has a fun repartee with her newspaper owner, Dad.  And I just found myself being so happy reading this book.  Now, I'm on to the next one in the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W71TPJ8ZZZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434430111#wasThisHelpful","R3W71TPJ8ZZZI","A91BK8S5QH98K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A91BK8S5QH98K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed this collection of some of the early literary forays into what would become the Classic Mystery/Detective story.  There is a sample that Louisa May Alcott wrote under her pseudonym called ""A Double Tragedy:  An Actor's Story"" that I really enjoyed, since I'm such a fan of hers.  I also enjoyed the one by Anna Katherine Green, which was similar.  And I really enjoyed the fluid writing style of Edgar Allen Poe, although, I found his hard to follow at times.

"This is a nice story about a lady having to make ends meet on her own, after an unfortunate experience with a ""gentleman"" of fraudulent intentions.  She turns to writing and becomes acquainted with the dashing young naval captain who is determined to make his way as a gentleman of means, in order to win the love of his life back.  Lest I give away too much of the plot, suffice it to say, we are treated to a charming look at life in England during the Regency era.  And we are filled with warmth over the redeeming outcome of the novel.  At times, I thought the novel was a bit depressing.  As I felt a little depressed while reading it, which is curious given the chapter featuring Jane Austen's quote of ""Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery.""  But, I also felt joy when the protagonist, Mariah Aubrey, is reunited with her horse and she realizes her affection for a certain dashing young naval captain.

"I'm quickly becoming a fan of the Ageless La Cure line of Beauty/Cleansing Products.  Their Phyto 5 formula seems to work really well on my ultra-sensitive skin.

I've been using the Phyto Peel for a while now and I like it so much, I save it for special occasions that I need to look especially nice for.  With this serum and moisturizing cream set, my skin gets an especially noticeably elegant and refined beauty to it.  That is one thing that really impresses me about this cream and serum, the fact that they give me a refined look.  I love that!  The tubes are small looking, but since only the tiniest bit is needed for each application, they are lasting a long while.

"I have to say, I actually like the accompaniment and notation for this classic piece from ""The Student Prince.""  I was disappointed, however, in that it is written in a much lower key than the key Mario Lanza sings it in in the movie.  Mario Lanza sings it in Bflat and has a glorious ending with it.  So, as a Soprano who can easily sing all the high notes, I was wanting it to be in the same key as in the movie.  However, if you find a pianist who can transpose on the spot (unlike me--I admit it), this sheet music will still work.

"This is the first book that I have read in this mystery series and I found it to be quite charming.  Our young detective is a likable girl by the name of Maisie.

They are escorted by Alice's snobbish Governess and are soon left to their own devices when all of the hired help resigns due to ghosts and other strange sounds occurring in the lodge.  Determined to figure out the cause behind all of the unusual activities, Maisie and Alice soon uncover rational explanations for all of the events.  My only complaint about this story, s that I was so engrossed in the mystery, that I felt the book ended too soon!  However, it is a nice length for the younger set.

"I very much enjoyed reading this book.  It is both deep and simple at the same time.  The deep meaningful aspects of the story come from the struggles of the main characters to overcome their false beliefs about the past and embrace the ""Love and Grace"" of the future.  The light aspect comes from the fact, that the main mystery of the book is predictable.  However, it is still a very nice story.  We have the young Lady of Buckleigh Manor, Julia, feeling stifled by her dreary village.  Her Mother/Aunt is very severe and won't let the village celebrate May Day and strictly prohibits dancing of any sort.  Into this depressed village comes a family of dancing and fencing masters who unknowingly pose a threat to the ""way things are."" One of the main attractions of this novel was the emphasis placed on dancing and the civilities.  Each chapter opens with an historical quote regarding dancing and the art of dance.

"This is an excellent historical fiction novel set during the early American Revolutionary War.  It focuses on a young girl named Jasmine and her stormy relationship with her tutor, whom she mistakenly believes is a Tory.  We learn and experience the ups and downs of the British occupation of Trenton during this time.  And we learn, via her Mother, about the dangers of writing pro-Patriot articles.

I did not get that feeling at all as I endeavored multiple times to become involved in the plot and characters of this novel.  Quite the opposite, I felt like the characters were overly stereotypical of the romance novel genre with the antagonism to cover attraction motif being overly done.  And I also felt like the mindset was decidedly modern, somehow.  It could be I simply was not in the frame of mind for this novel, but I just have to say, it failed to capture my interest.

"I enjoyed reading this book.  It was a nice light and easy read, but not without substance to it.  It opens in Bath, England at a ball wherein the young Catherine is presented to a charming young gentleman from America.  Being quite used to the flirtations of wannabe suitors, she dismisses him rather quickly.  However, she is drawn to him as the evening progresses.  Due to a decline in her father's fortunes, she soon ends up in Pennsylvania working as a seamstress/dress designer in a sewing house.  This was an aspect of the book that I thought was well done, as it shows how the indentures and the placements of the girls worked in a sewing house of that era.  Coincidentally, the same gentleman whom Catherine met back in England, comes to the sewing house with his Mother and sister and thinks he recognizes her, but isn't sure.  Since Catherine has had to assume an alternate name, to protect herself and her father, this leads to some complications.  I especially enjoyed the page of the book where Mrs. Clarkson doesn't just yield to the demands for clemency on the part of the jealous sewing girl.  I thought that had a good balance of Christianity, but also, reality.

The picture on the back of the book in the about the author section is a nice and clear one.  And from start to finish, it is just a precious memento to make, create, and have!  I do recommend making sure you write out clearly what you wish to be included in the dedication and the title page, as I wrote mine in cursive (I'm a cursive writer) and they misspelled what I had written out.

By happenstance, a tenth of that amount was written on the actual order delivered to the town officials and the town was spared.  The story is told in the first person from the point of view of Amelia, a young girl whose father is the treasurer of the town.

The story opens with her telling him a story that ends up getting the press smashed, after all, tensions are high during this period of U.S. history.  This makes Amelia determined to stay uninvolved from the war, although, she admires her brother's sweetheart for having the gumption to dress up like a boy and go off and fight in the war as a soldier.  With great historical detail and fascinating writing, the author takes us through the entire history of the war and we become personally involved with Amelia's inner struggle of when to get involved in the activities taking place all around her.  I literally gasped at the ending.  And I'm sure all the reader's will, as well.  Having read other books by Ann Rinaldi, I do notice some of her trademarks in the novel.  Mainly, that the characters are all very strong and have resentments that seem rather severe, at times.  However, this didn't detract from the book.  And I found it to be a compelling read, all around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35P6MLT46EQ2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0590117459#wasThisHelpful","R35P6MLT46EQ2I","A91BK8S5QH98K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A91BK8S5QH98K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first section of this book is especially fascinating.  With the basic premise of this book being that beginning in the fourth grade, people go into a creative slump.  This is corroborated by NASA administered ""creative genius"" tests that show that 98% of five year-olds are creative geniuses, but the same kids by the time they are thirteen, only test at a 2% creative genius rate.  Apparently, our society and culture really emphasizes convergent thinking (i.e. the status quo) while creative geniuses manifest divergent thinking (more along the lines of ""What if . . .?"")  And this convergent thinking lifestyle contributes to a general malaise and dissatisfaction in the working world and in life in general.  The author writes from a very interesting Christian perspective and he emphasizes that since as human beings we are created in God's image, we have the need to create within us.  And when we create, we become closer to God.  (Provided that we don't fall into the trap of over-inflating our own egos in the process.)  The author even does a fascinating study showing how Jesus faced temptations along His path to creativity (after all, Jesus did create a whole new way of thinking and being that transformed the world).  And in sum, this book really provides encouragement and insight for all of us to get in touch with our inner creative selves.  I really delighted in the first section of this book, especially so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23RRN1JUAF8WY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426786417#wasThisHelpful","R23RRN1JUAF8WY","A91BK8S5QH98K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A91BK8S5QH98K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the account of the accomplishments of his Presidency written by Felipe Calderon Hinojosa, President of Mexico from 2006 through 2012.  The first thirty pages, especially, are fascinating.  As he explains the fallacies of the term ""drug war"" and how during his Presidency the focus was on fighting the huge escalation of crime that surged in Mexico beginning in 2003.  As in 2004, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban expired in the U.S. with the result being that there was a mass influx of U.S. purchsed assault weapons into Mexico by the criminal element.  This, of course, led to the drug cartels being able to take over entire communities in Mexico and begin the regulatory capture stage of crime, wherein they start actually gaining control over the governing bodies of the city/state/country.  He also explains how the Drug-Trafficking in Mexico shifted from being transportation focused (i.e. getting the drugs to the U.S. for sale) to one of drug marketing as well (i.e. selling the drugs in Mexico for internal use).  This led to a lot of territorial fights among the different drug factions, which made for a huge threat to the national public safety.  He expresses a lot of pride in his country and it is fascinating to see the map of the world showing Mexico as being right in the middle, a position which he emphasizes can really be to Mexico's benefit.  His public works accomplishments are very impressive, including a tunnel under Mexico City for the water, which is bigger than the tunnel connecting England and France over in Europe.  He also established programs for the elderly (aged 70 and up), women, and youth.  And he expressed a strong interest in preserving the biodiversity of Mexico.  He is a very statistical, scientific, and factual minded person, which is reflected in his writing.  With the end result being that one develops a big respect for both his accomplishments and his intelectualism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHT9IH5WIN9RN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNQWZD4#wasThisHelpful","RHT9IH5WIN9RN","A91BK8S5QH98K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A91BK8S5QH98K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My wife, the queen of green, said to order this since the box claims that it is organic and, therefore, better for you. Job done!She tried it first and made yummy noises. Crunchy, fresh tasting And loaded with fruit and nuts. All good. I tried it over plain yogurt and I had to agree with her assessment. Having said that, the fruit bits are a little too chewey for me and the sugar level is higher than my regular granola. I try to limit the grams of sugar in my diet so this probably won't be my go to granola. Also, the box claims that you can fold the top closed, but the inner bag doesn't reseal so freshness isn't really protected by folding the cardboard flaps.Final thoughts: Good taste. Organic.

It's tiny in size but huge in sound - especially in the bass. How that do it is a surprise to me given the fact that it could fit in a car's cup holder and serve as a Bluetooth dece for your Smart Phone (yes, there is a speaker and a microphone built in)The bamboo trim is supposed to make it ""green"" but unless you really look, it's not why I like the product (although I always try to be ""green"").The instructions page is in a lot of languages and extremely difficult to read because of the tiny type (and I have excellent close up vision). However, the pictures across the top of the page (while also very small) are easy to follow so I deduct nothing for what seems to be an an area of this product that could be improved.Overall - this is an amazing little speaker.

The nine dollar price seemed affordable and worth using as an ingratiating prop when I went to the dealer. Upon ripping open the shipping pouch, I found a flimsy, plastic pen, only a little better than a hotel pen. The Subaru logo is painted on and I suspect will rub off or chip off.....what a disappointment. Being a pen geek, I unscrewed the pen to examine the refill. Unlike a quality, easily replaceable refill which you'd get from Cross, Sheaffer or Parker, the Subaru contained a cheap, low quality refill...sad.

"The Kenwood kettle is an easy to use kitchen appliance. It has a large capacity and heats water quickly and at several different temperatures depending on the use. A check with a thermometer confirmed that the kettle heats to the chosen temperature. It sits on a compact base and the capacity levels are easy to read. Although hard water produces scale on the bottom, the appliance has a washable screen at the spout to keep scale out of your cup. The handle stays cool, but the lid gets hot and releases steam. This device has a tone to indicate that the water has reached the selected temperature. When it works, the tone is so quiet that it's easy to miss. On our model, the tone has been inconsistent. Sometimes it chimes and sometimes it doesn't.  You really have to be on top of it so it doesn't boil dry.  A negative observation is that the kettle is lined with plastic. Recent health information indicates the risks of eating or drinking food or a beverage that has been heated in plastic. Further investigation is needed to find out whether Kenwood has considered this. However there is no discernible taste to the water and the water isn't in the kettle very long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H2LDQZBI47OA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJLD7MK#wasThisHelpful","R2H2LDQZBI47OA","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Funny, but during the day, for some strange reason, a faint whiff of the smell returns - I really like that (magic?)The product does a fantastic job on my thin hair, rinses off and the conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable.There is a lot of product in the bottle too but it squirts out heavily - you really only need a little dab because of the great lather.

"I used to be a computer geek. I started business in the IBM mainframe days but quickly saw that the ""small box"" AKA PC / Mac technology was teh future (by the way, that was 1984!). I built my first PC from components bought at a computer show in the late 1980s and have not looked back. Currently, I have a wireless network in my house with two laptops and two desktops (Windows and Mac) all going along with smart phones and a tablet. My wife uses her Windows laptop in the kitchen to do our banking and e-mail and has complained a lot about slow or no response from the wireless router located on teh second floor in the furthest room in the house. When I saw this product on Vine and saw that it uses the house wiring to build a LAN (local area network) I ordered it. The description says that it is ""plug and play"" - an often misused term in the tech world - and for once, the units really were. I think I should have timed the installation process but using a SWAG (you can look it up), I say it took 15 minutes to unpack the two units, plug them in, run up and down the stairs a couple of times and reconfigure the network settings on my wife's laptop. Bingo!When I asked my wife - a demanding but honest and fair critic - to tell me if she saw a difference in response time she said, and I quote, ""Wow!"" I was surprised that she was that happy but there you have it. However the technology uses the house's wiring, it is faster and more reliable than my wireless network.I have to say that if you have a slow wireless network, give this product a try.

"No, this wasn't a MAC product. My wife is a Windows user and we got this application for her laptop. We loaded it (easy) and started to edit some simple family clips from Easter. Her laptop is not a very powerful Windows 7 computer but it does have extra memory. I have to to say, it was slow to load and slow to pull in media files. Probably a combination of the laptop and the software. Getting the clips into a timeline was easy (I'm one of those users who judges software on how far into the use I can go without cracking the manual / looking for YOUTUBE videos) that was good. We then started to shorten the clips and add transitions. It was relatively easy too and that's a plus.I then did the same thing with my MAC with iMovie and it was easier and much faster - and I'm not much of a videographer. However, if you don't have a MAC, this relatively inexpensive product could work for you.I then asked my godson, a professional film maker, to repeat the exercise we just did and it was a revelation. His prior experience with Final Cut Pro X (a package that is much more expensive) allowed him to make the same small movie of holiday clips faster and with better transitions. This tells me that some of the clunky / slow / confusing things I experienced were due to my lack of skill with video editing. He gave the package a rating of OK which I translated to three stars.If I had a a faster Windows PC / Laptop, I think my experience would have been more positive. I guess, if you are a Windows are user and you shoot video, you would quickly get up to speed on how to make small movies. Considering the price of the package, it seems like a bargain. But don't expect pro level editing and production features at this price point.Recommended for Windows users with simple needs and a fast computer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9J1A7VSAENSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0I6J9E#wasThisHelpful","R9J1A7VSAENSN","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in the 1970s, I began to show my cars at Concours d'Elegance events. We didn't know much about the chemistry of the whole process back then, we used what we had. For example, there was a really popular car wash that came in the form of a powder. It was a strong detergent so that it could remove grime, road debris and things like pine tree sap. It worked well but after washing, you had little or no wax protection left. Naturally, we tried everything - dish detergent, baby shampoo, even Woolite - the results were the same - clean car, some residue and, alas, no wax.Today, we have products from the magicians in automotive chemistry labs all across the world. One of the best best magicians must work for Griot's because their car products are some of the finest made. I have used their waxes, cleaners and polishes for years and recommend them to others. Good stuff.When this came up on Vine, I was anxious to try this car wash to see if it was as effective as the German-made Sonax wash I have been using. Happy to report, it's just as effective - foamy enough to float off the dust my old Porsche accumulated after spending the winter in the garage. Left no residue. Didn't remove the wax either. And, because of the large size, it's less expensive. I call that a win/win/win.Have a car you care about? Wash it yourself? (Sorry California, maybe that's taboo these drought afflicted days) Give this product a try. A little goes a long way so it will probably last for a few years.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39RWRRG1KI5YT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PA2LMVY#wasThisHelpful","R39RWRRG1KI5YT","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was a time in my computer life when my PC had a 30 meg not gig) hard drive. Actually, it started as a dual floppy computer but I upgraded it when I had a few bucks. That was then, this is now. Even entry PC and Mac computers come with storage in Terabytes and with video, music and photo files growing with each new device on the market, this additional space is needed.Also, carrying around data from work to the home PC or transferring files from a laptop to a desktop is a regular part of our technical life. Having a thumb drive that holds only a couple of gigabytes means that you run the risk of filling it up and having to get a second drive or working quickly to delete files to fit that new large file. Not fun.In my case, these days I do photo presentations for car clubs and carry my laptop with me for these events. Being a bit of a worrier, I always backup the presentations to an external hard drive and carry that along in case of a disk failure. That way, I can transfer the data to a loaner PC or Macbook should the unthinkable happen. Of course, mechanical external hard drives have moving parts and are subject to damage from magnetic fields. Having a ""solid state"" divide with enough storage was my dream. After seeing a 32 gig on the Vine shopping list, my dreams became reality.Now I have a large capacity ""drive"" that fits in my pocket and isn't subject to magnetic erasure. It worked immediately (no more than 3 seconds to get recognized) in my iMac (OS X 10.8.5) and I was able to save files to it without re-formatting.Not much more to say about a thumb drive - small, fast, large capacity and priced right.Recommended if you ned to carry large files around.One caveat - computer viruses and malware travel well on all read / write devices - a concern for every corporate IT support professional. I recommend every IT organization have a protocol that requires people bringing work files in from home on this type of divide run virus protection software against it using a stand-alone non-networked computer to ensure that nothing bad enters the LAN / WAN connected servers and PCs. That's supposedly how Iran's centrifuges got damaged!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUGQACS2HK91H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSTX636#wasThisHelpful","RUGQACS2HK91H","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In college, I didn't have money for speakers. I had a cheap amp. a very cheap turntable (it was, after all the 1960s) but no speakers. My friend's father owned a stereo store and he found a used pair of cheap head phones that he let me have for $2. The nicest thing I can say is that they worked and I could isolate myself and study organic chemistry without distractions. As bad as they were, they turned me into a headphone junkie and over the years, as my income increased, I bought better sets and enjoyed them all. However, when the Sony Walkman and other portable devices became popular, having true headphones on made you look a little dorkie (no comments) because the portable devices came with small foam-wrapped pads and, in the latest iterations, in the ear canal model. In a word, I hated them. Low fidelity. Slip-out-of-the-ear plastic buds. Just annoying.And then this pair arrived and all of that has changed. The sound quality is the very best of any headphones I have owned in (gulp) 40 years). They are also the most expensive but definitely worth it if you like great sound. Even playing from a iPhone or an iPod, the highs were crisp and, a real surprise, the bass was really good. Really, really good! One thing I can add, for songs recorded in the 1960s (like Peter Paul and Mary stuff), you can really hear the tape hiss!The verdict - Comfortable. High Tech look. Wonderful, realistic bass. Highly recommended for you headphone geeks out there.Wish I had these in 1968 when I had great hearing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22JTJ47P20SON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOM7P2C#wasThisHelpful","R22JTJ47P20SON","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had the same capo since high school! How long ago was that, I hear you ask? Let's just say, mind your own business. My old capo requires two hands to install and has a very strong spring to hold the strings to the frets. When I saw this new design, I couldn't see how the gentle spring could keep the strings from buzzing. Yes, it was simple to install or slide with one hand, but I was worried that it would just be too weak. Boy was I wrong! The capo worked perfectly. It installed and re positioned simply - yes, one handed. Didn't produce string buzz and looked cool doing it. It also has a small, easily lose-able, tension adjusting tool if your guitar needs more pressure on the strings.Cool looking. Simple to use. Effective. Love it!Recommended...

"Reveal is a nice fragrance. It's musky with a hint of fruit, not heavy or overpowering. Sprayed on in the morning, it was still detectable hours later and was true to its original application, no degradation. Some perfumes have very distinctive notes and become signature scents. While Reveal is very pleasant, it didn't trigger immediate recognition each time I tried it during the review period. As a side note. I did a little research. Reveal is sold by a number of vendors but it's only available on line.

"Here's another example of a great Bissell product. Just as the cleaner arrived for review, the dog graciously threw up on the carpet late at night and in the dark. That gave the stain time to dry and settle in. The SpotClean was easy to assemble and can be set up for a small or large cleaning task. Within minutes the job was done, the stain was gone and the carpet was only slightly damp. The machine was easy to clean and the hose, cord and cleaning ends wrap and nest compactly so it can be stored in a closet or cabinet. I was very satisfied with the result. So why four stars instead of five? Well the hose and cleaning tools are very lightweight; that might make the machine easy to carry and move around, but it also makes it feel flimsy. While I was cleaning the stain, I noticed a few other places on the rug that needed attention. This meant bending over or kneeling for each spot that needed to be cleaned. Easy enough if you're nimble and flexible, but I am neither. This machine would be perfect for someone who doesn't have a lot of carpet or messy kids and pets. We are looking forward to trying it in our cars which have accumulated many stains from this slushy winter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BDN5TWCVNNFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SBA5N26#wasThisHelpful","R3BDN5TWCVNNFY","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I stink at cooking rice. Or at least I did. I recall hearing an NPR commentator who was stationed in Japan complaining that he forgot to take his rice cooker home with him when he was re-located to the USA (I think it was called a Dinky Gamma). I looked for one but never found it. When this came up on Vine, I asked my wife if she thought we could use it. She thought about my cooking skills and then gave me the thumbs up.My wife took the time to read the instruction booklet and then gave me the Reader's Digest version so I could use it. For the first time, I didn't burn or undercook the rice - cool! Then, after cooking, it held the rice at serving temperature. This is so automatic that it makes me look like I know what I'm doing in the kitchen.Then, the next morning, my wife surprised me with a bowl of perfectly cooked oatmeal (not the instant kind...) with raisins and cinnamon. I looked around the kitchen for the pot that I had to clean and, to my surprise, she said she made it in the Rice Cooker! Her recipe - 3/4 cup oatmeal. 1 1/2 cups of water. A handful of raisins and a dash of spice... Stir gently with the enclosed plastic spoon to mix everything and then press a couple of buttons. Then sit down with the NY Times Crossword until you hear a beep. Simple, easy-peasy. I can't wait to try cooking artichokes (steaming actually) in it.The lift out no-stick inner pot cleans in seconds on a stream of hot water, soap and a few swipes. The lid has a cool water condensation catcher that keeps drips from spilling out onto the counter (you do have to eventually empty it). The only caution is that there is a steam escape port on the top. If you get close to it while its cooking, you will get a nasty burn (ask me how I know).Simple to use. Easy to clean. Cooks rice and oatmeal perfectly.

The inexpensive bits that came with the drill chipped and stopped working well after about 15 minutes of use. Strangely enough, these Irwin bits appeared on vine and we pounced. When they arrived, we swapped out the junk we were using and finished the project with the Irwin bits. In the end, I examined the most-used bit and it looked like new.

"I was skeptical when I first saw the iPhone 6 because of its tablet-like size. The reason is because I keep my phone in my pocket and, of late, my blue jeans have gotten smaller! (Or the wearer is getting bigger?) Stuffing a $300 phone in such a tight spot made me worried that I might bend the thin thing first time I sat down. My goal, I wanted a robust case to increase torsional rigidity and, reading the specs, this looked like it could do the job.When I opened the package, I realized that I was right. This is a solidly built product. With an iPhone 6 enclosed inside, it's very unlikely that it will bend in normal use. Plus, the added benefit of double the battery life is really useful. However, this all comes at a cost. The already bulky phone is now even thicker, heavier and longer. Keeping it in my blue jeans front pocket makes a very visible lump in the fabric. Fortunately it's winter and I always have a jacket pocket to hold my phone. When the weather gets warmer, I may have to dump the case or only use it when I know I need the benefit of added battery life. My wife says I should use a ""man bag "" but that's not gonna happen!So, I found this product to be exactly what the manufacturer claims. Good phone protection. Excellent battery life. Quality construction. NOTE: you can't use your original iPhone charger to charge the case's battery. They provide a cable that has to be used instead.

"If you test your blood regularly, you have a simple and quick process that you follow. If it takes more than a minute for most folks, I would be surprised. Using this product adds a level of complexity and time that I found bothersome. First, before you start, you have to load an app - a one time process. Next, you have to scan the test strip cap to embed the code into the software - also supposed to be a one shot task, Then you have to plug the reader into your smart phone (no app for iPad - at least, none I could find). Then insert the test strip. Prick your skin and then, whew, you are ready to test.In my testing, I had to rescan the cap each time I tested. May have been pilot error, but it was the only way to go forward. It happened EVERY time ... Also, I had to remove my iPhone case to get the little pod thing to be recognized by my phone. That resulted in a broken piece of plastic on my case. Annoying, for sure. Finally, the readings never matched the traditional meters I have in the closet. And I tested with several traditional meters. Worse, this device always read higher from the same drop of blood. Hmmmm.Having said all of that, this device has potential. The supplies are very affordable - less than the brand I have been using. The ability to track your numbers in a cloud data base is also very 21st century.

Snow, salt, slush, terrible traffic and potholes all make enjoying their special qualities, let's just say, difficult. However, I make up for this by having a cool Porsche design item in my pocket, on my wrist or in my briefcase.

My wife thinks the pen is a little too heavy but not so to my mitts. The clip that holds it to my pocket is nicely polished, offsetting the matte finish of the rest of the pen. It extends the point with a quick twist but here is the reason for only 4 stars. If you are a little too twisty, you can rotate the top beyond the stopping point. Upon inspection, I saw that the ""guts"" inside are, ugh, cheap looking plastic, not high tech metal like the exterior.

"I started gaming back in the Wolfenstein days. I spent an entire snowy Christmas Day once, unable to drive because of the dangerous road conditions, escaping from the Nazi stronghold. Even before that, I played Adventure on the company's mainframe. Xyzzy - remember? Anyway, these days, my gamer chops need a little help. Enter Turtle Beach Ear Force.First things first. Fantastic packaging! You open the box and the gear is laid out like a work of art. Next, the look and feel is top quality. Even the cables are covered in a woven fabric instead of slippery, squeaky plastic. I like that. They are a little heavy at first and the tight construction makes them stiff and hard to adjust for maximum comfort. However, after wearing them for a while, they got more comfortable and didn't feel as heavy.And then there Is the sound. Separation across the ear pieces was excellent. This improves the gaming experience, giving more of an impression of character movement tied to sounds. Cool!I also use my iPhone as a music player so, instead of those fall-out-of-my-ears buds, I plugged these in and discovered amazing bass. Seriously, if you listen to music on the iPad / iPhone / iPod ear buds, you are missing out on the strong bass that your MP3 device can deliver.These are good for gaming, built like they will last for years, comfortable enough after a while, and a step up in the overall gaming experience. The real value for me, however, is the improvement in sound on my MP3 players.

"With the scary and sad Ebola stories in the news, there have been many reports of airport security agents and medical personnel using ""no touch"" electronic thermometers. When this item came up for review on Vine, I pounced, anxious to see how well it worked. The main reason is I use a remote reading infrared thermometer to diagnose heat related issues for my cars and tried using it to take my temperature. Alas, it wasn't designed for taking human skin temperatures. Plus, I hate sticking a conventional glass thermometer under my tongue - always nervous that it could break and put mercury in my mouth. We also have a digital under the tongue unit, but we never seem to have the plastic covers when we need them.After testing, we found that this product does exactly what it says it does. It reads quickly and easily without having to actually touch the skin. Pretty cool. (No pun intended.)However, I suggest that you test its temp readings against the readings of a traditional thermometer to set a baseline. My personal skin readings were consistently 1/2 degree lower than 98.6. Not sure why. My wife's temperature was consistently ""normal"" so it seems that my body temp is a little lower than normal.Great for kids. Fast reading.

"This is not a vacuum designed for a regular home. First, it is worn on the back (think SCUBA gear or Ghostbusters proton colliders). This helps when vacuuming around a restaurant's tables and chairs or an office's desk and other furniture. Having a canister vacuum run into (and get stuck on) a table leg or office cabinet can affect productivity and efficiency. Carrying the vacuum on your back also prevents the inevitable damage to the furniture or the vacuum with each collision. Cool.Next, the electrical cord is about 45 feet long (~15 meters) and is made from heavy duty yellow wire. During my tests, it never kinked or got knotted. It extended the range of my cleaning job - minimizing the need to re-plug the cord as I moved around the rooms. I liked that.The hose and metal extension pipes feel like they are made from leftover pieces of the Keystone pipeline - sturdy, with a precision fit.The kit comes with several attachments - wide hardwood floor brush attachment, brushless wide rug attachment, narrow rug or runner attachment, narrow brush hard surface attachment and a thin crevice tool. Each goes on and off the pipe end easily.The vacuum is easy to heft onto your back and for me and the women who used it, the weight wasn't a problem. Not too heavy to lift up and carry around for (in our test) an hour. The on / off switch is conveniently placed at the user's elbow so there is no need to search for it when you need it.I thought that having the vacuum right behind my head would kill my ears, but the unit runs very quietly and I never thought noise was a problem.Like a lot of vacuums, the many attachments have no place to live. You need a bag or box to store them or they run the risk of getting lost or broken. Speaking of tools, the rug attachments (wide and narrow) do not have a way to ""beat"" the carpet (like the rotating brush of a canister vac or upright). I vacuumed a large expanse of medium pile carpet with the ProTeam and then re-vacuumed the same area with a bagless upright with a rotating brush. The upright pulled more ""stuff"" out of the carpet that this unit missed. Disappointing.Overall, the plusses - long cord, convenient backpack design and long reach tools - overcome the one issue - not the best tool for deep cleaning pile carpeting. Typically, offices and restaurants have hardwood / tile floors or very low pile carpet so this may not be an issue for any facility with those floor surfaces.I give one star for the unique backpack design. I add another star for the quiet motor. One more star for the ease of use with the long electrical cord. Finally, one star for the long reach of the hose and extension pipes. I could give 1/2 star (if we had them) for the way the vacuum cleans hard surfaces and low pile carpets.

Getting the interior finishes ""right"" requires both the knowledge of what ""right"" looks like as well as knowing how to get that look. This required the right technique and the right materials.For years, the most common interior spray used by people showing their cars was ArmorAll. Their marketing program being the biggest reason why. This product - so popular that it was available just about everywhere - if improperly applied left the surfaces in the interior (dash, vinyl seats, door panels) a too shiny and very slippery. Heaven forbid you ever got it on the floor mats, brake pedal or steering wheel - that could be a recipe for an accident. Times changed and car show judges began to penalize us for showing our interior panels with too much of an ArmorAll, too shiny look. (Of course, you could really buff up the surface with a dry cloth and get the finish less shiny, but it took a lot of work.)Several products from Lexol, Griot's Grarge and Sonax (among others) became the cleaner / treatment of choice for for the truly serious. I had been using P21S interior cleaner for vinyl and rubber (but it's become hard to find) and old reliable Lexol for leather surfaces (great stuff). I am always looking for products that first, do no harm and second, leave a matte ""original"" looking finish. When this product from Chemical Guys came up on Vine, I decided to give its try since I had a lot of experience evaluating these products on my own vehicles. Here is what I found:First, the feeder tube for the sprayer that came with the liquid was about and inch and a half too long to fit in the bottle. I though that I was doing something wrong, but no matter how I tried, it would not go in until I got a scissor and trimmed it to size. Not the best way to start.Next, the smell. They boast (some might say warn) that their product has a pineapple scent. Call me crazy, but pineapple? Why not pine or apple? To be fair, my wife loved it. Me, not so much. You have to be the judge. I found it too strong and just a little odd.The product's ability to clean was actually quite good. It removed some scuff mark dirt in my aging BMW and Audi. Both have a light colored interior so the quick improvement was very noticeable. I did these tests in a relatively dimly lit garage but in the morning, in the daylight, the matte finish left by the spray was pleasant and the pineapple smell was almost completely gone.There is no way to tell if the claimed UV protection was there. That would take testing methods beyond the scope of an Amazon review. But the surface was smooth, non-greasy and looking like a Concours d'Elegance judge would like - again, all good things.Overall, this product seems to be a quality car care tool. Except for the smell that I find unnecessary, bordering on the annoying, and the too-long sprayer feeder tube, I think this is a good addition to my car care tool kit and I'll use it again.A note on the smell so you don't think I'm being too fussy. Concours d'Elegance judges are a strict lot. They have years of experience and knowledge in their chosen area of expertise. If he or she stuck his or her nose into the interior of a classic car and smelled an odd scent like pineapple, it might signal that the owner is trying to mask something - mold, mildew, animal urine or, the worst, mothballs. At the highest level of the hobby, something like a strong, unusual odor could be the difference between a win and a loss. Food for thoughtThree stars for the way it cleans and leaves the surfaces. Two stars missing for the scent issue and the mis-matched sprayer kit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18WFZC7PTWUL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LPEZ6Q#wasThisHelpful","R18WFZC7PTWUL9","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pen had a simple, clean design. It looks and feels high tech without gaudy attachments. It sends the same vibe as the cars it shares its namesake with. Clean, simple and well made - it's all good.The solid metal barrel adds heft but because of the aluminum construction, it's not too heavy. The machined in finger grooves fit your fingers so that writing is more comfortable, despite the all metal construction. The point extends with a simple twist and has a precision feel. Speaking of points, the refill is a standard, easy to find Parker style so replacements will be easy to buy.The only gripe is that the top half can be twisted beyond the stopping point. Kind of surprising for a precision and expensive writing instrument. The inside ""guts"" are plastic - also a surprise considering the maker and price.Like Porsches and nice pens?

"Contrary to popular belief, a sharp knife is safer than a dull knife. That's because when the edge is keen, the user has to exert less pressure to make the cut. Pressing too hard can cause slips and injury. That's why you should always have a good knife sharpener in the kitchen. Also, if you never let your knives get really dull then simple ""touching up"" of the blade's edge will be quick and simple.I first saw this product at a knife show in NYC and watched as a salesman demonstrated how simple it was to restore the sharpness of a pretty dull knife. I know that the knife was dull because it came out of my pocket! When the sharpening job was done - about 2 minutes at the hands of an experienced hand - my trusty knife could slice through newsprint with ease, leaving a smooth, non-jagged cut. I was sold and have been using the tool for years with a lot of success.The design is simple. The sharpening ""sticks"" sit at the perfect angle so all you have to do is keep the knife straight as you run the edge down the point of the rods. For really dull edges, there is a medium (dark brown) grit rod. This puts a decent but rough edge on your knife. Next, you swap out the rods for the smooth (white) rods and repeat the process. This makes the edge more razor like and long lasting. Unless your knife is damaged or has been really abused, this process  should bring back the sharpness you need to do any kitchen chore.I carry my sharpening kit to our local soup kitchen where we volunteer to make and serve food to homeless and low income visitors. The kitchen is used by many different hands with varying skills with knives. I watch as experienced cooks hack away with the knives on surfaces that dull the edges quickly. I have recently taken a knife skills class at a local culinary school and see a lot more ""don'ts"" in the kitchen than ""dos"" - which (I think) explains the poor condition of the knives in the soup kitchen's drawers. I stayed late one session after lunch and sharpened all of the knives. I then wrote a note and placed it in the knife drawer warning that I had sharpened everything. The manager told me later that everyone remarked at how well the knives worked after I gave them the Spyderco sharpener treatment. Now, I bring my kit in every month and touchup the most commonly used knives. It makes me the local hero (blush).Recommended for its ease of use and effectiveness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R336QLNTTLTUVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HSQHKK#wasThisHelpful","R336QLNTTLTUVS","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Porsche Design products have a certain look and feel that's very German, very high tech. Plus, they are made to a very high standard for build quality and look and feel. This little pen has a grippy rubber barrel that helps prevent it from slipping while I write. The tips have a brushed metal finish so they resist scratches while the pen rattles around in my pocket.The small size means it's best for jotting quick notes or signing for things in stores and restaurants. I like to place it in the small ""watch"" pocket in my jeans and use it instead of the pen handed along with credit card receipts - they have been through too many dirty hands to make me happy. Also, the small refill doesn't have a large ink capacity so using it to take long notes during interviews runs the risk of using up all of the ink.Finally, the best for last - the ""shake"" feature. With a flick of my wrist, the point goes in and out reliably. Another cool idea from the engineers at Porsche Design.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2STV24M30ZL1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OIFJEG#wasThisHelpful","R2STV24M30ZL1D","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I collect high quality writing instruments - AKA ""pens"". Also, I am a fan of the Porsche marque so having a Porsche Design pen in my pocket makes me smile. I have several of their pens and really enjoy using them to sign credit card receipts, jot quick notes, scribble in my notebook when conducting an interview for a magazine article. This is especially cool when I'm interviewing a Porsche owner.The pen has a high quality feel with a firm click. Especially interesting is the way the clip recedes into the barrel when the point is extended. Speaking of the point, it uses a standard Parker-style refill so getting replacements is a snap. Also, finding the color and size point that works best for you (i.e., fine, medium, gel, regular, blue ink, black ink) easy.The black finish gives the pen a nice high-tech look. However, it's a little too smooth and slips a bit in my hands. Also, the barrel is, as the name implies, really thin. That may or may not be to your taste. I think it's a little thin for my XL sized mitts which is why I gave only 4 stars. However, if you like thin writing instruments, you may give it a 5th star.Recommended - especially if you're a car guy or gal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13W4BEFO2AV7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q0KTHC6#wasThisHelpful","R13W4BEFO2AV7W","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the old days, a printer was just a printer (and a cigar was just a cigar) I go back to the LaserJet Series 1 days when a print spit out hundreds of pages in black and white from it's huge capacity paper trays. Today, everyone wants / needs color and ink jet printers are a more cost effective way to get that requirement met.To that end, as part of the Vine Program, I have reviewed several ""all in one"" printers with their Fax, Copy, Scan and Print text and photos ability. They have been quite acceptable for my small, home office. However, on occasion I have to print a large volume of copy and the smaller paper trays of these ""all in one"" machines make me run back and forth to refill them. With others in the office using the printers, having one machine with dual trays that give 500 sheet capacity is really helpful. Plus, I can use one for letter head and one with plain paper or high quality bond - whatever is needed. I like that. Throw in that the printer is fast and that the type is crisp, I am pretty sure that it will become my go-to for just about everything non-photographic.This printer does all of the cool printing tricks too - printing from smart phones, lap tops and tablets. It touches most of the bases. (Although, I am still trying to find out if it has the ability to print an e-mail and its attachments from a smart phone. An HP printer I recently tested had that available through an App - I'll have to keep reading and will update this review if it does.)This is the first Vine (meaning free) Canon printer I have tested but not the first Canon printer I own. I have a Pro-10 for quality, large format printing and an ancient Canon i960 photo printer that I've pretty much worn out over the many years it has been in service. So, I can honestly say, I know, like and respect Canon printer quality. This one does nothing to change that.Some things the potential buyer will find interesting (I hope). First - it's a big hunk of printer. It uses up a large chunk of my cramped office space geography. How big and heavy? When it prints, it shakes the table - nothing bad really but something to note.Loading ink cartridges is simple - there is a small ramp to assist with the loading and as you inset the tanks, it send a confirmation message on the small LCD screen that the job was done right and moves the holder over one slot. I think that's smart and well executed too. Speaking of ink cartridges - they only supply setup-sized tanks so if you order this printer for volume printing, order spare (at least black ones) or you may run out quicker than you expect. That, by the way, is not a Canon-only policy. All of the ink jet printers I have tested come with minimal ink tanks. It kind of explains how they can sell these complex, technical wonders for such a low price. (OK, off my soap box)Paper trays have to be extended to allow the owner to add letter sized paper - a little tricky if you, like me, don't like to read instructions but you'll figure it out.It is a WiFi capable printer but here is the only caveat I would offer. The LCD screen is tiny and there is no simple way to enter your wireless router's WEP key (assuming you use that security method). So to enter a WEP key, you must hard wire the printer using a USB cable to connect to you computer and, with the CD provided (or software downloaded from Canon's web site), enter the WEP key so that the printer talks to your network. Alas, this assumes you have a USB cable and can physically put the two devices close together. I had a little bit of a struggle doing that. Of course, if you use the higher level router security method, then connecting by pressing the WiFi button on the printer and the routers talk-to-me button will make the connection for you. That means if you use a WEP key for your network, then you have to have a cable handy or your printer will not work wirelessly - that can be frustrating.I used to be a computer geek so setting this up was a minor obstacle. A little time consuming but not difficult. However, if you are not really computer savvy, you may have to get assistance.Summary - big, fast, large capacity and makes sharp, clear, color copy. Not really designed for photos (although it can do that) but very good for just about everything else. A little fussy to install on the network as described above.Recommended for volume printing users - if we had the ability to issue 1/2 stars - it would be a 4 1/2 star review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VHM1ZH4AUW2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNVDPVO#wasThisHelpful","R3VHM1ZH4AUW2F","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The whole GoPro video thing is hot right now. Years ago, if track junkies like me wanted to video ourselves on the racetrack you had to pay a lot of money for pro gear or cobble together a college textbook-sized video tape camera onto a bracket inside your car. Yes, people did it but the first problem was vibration. The bumping on the track made watching these early videos a challenge. That all changed with digital video and miniaturization of the equipment. Several cameras with image stabilization hit the market and vastly improved action video but GoPro, with its sealed camera case, very good image quality and relatively low cost has captured the sports, personal action video market. It's become the gold standard.Enter cell phone cameras and smart phones. With their WiFi and network connectivity to social media, the handheld ""selfie"" was born. However, high-angle selfies were restricted to the length of the shooter's arm. Plus, if you wanted really quality video (for TV, public web sites, wedding video assignments, school projects, etc.,) you really had to use a better camera than your cell phone (although, that will certainly change as time goes on). So, bring on the GoPro! And, that's where the extension pole accessory came into being.With that as prologue, the GoPro camera system has a unique attachment method - not the usual tripod screw - so this pole has the right setup to allow the shooter to attach his or her camera and make videos or single shot images at nearly four feet over their head. Pretty cool. The swivel connection also gives the shooter the ability to change the shooting angle and there is a viewer clip-on attachment so you can watch what you re doing too.The pole extends easily with a twist on each section and the very comfortable rubber handle lets the shooter keep a firm grip on the very valuable GoPro camera. Plus, in extremes of heat and cold (it's cold now where I live so I can confirm the benefit) the handle is comfortable. Add in the adjustable wrist strap and you're good to go.The bottom line - if you have a GoPro, and shoot selfies or are looking to make high-angle shots, you will enjoy using this GoPro-only accessory. The only reason for 4 and not 5 stars - it's pricy. That's it.Recommended - if you have a GoPro.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17IQWB9JJKWKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OOPD44Q#wasThisHelpful","R17IQWB9JJKWKD","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a Canon shooter since the EOS film days. They were and still are fast auto focusing systems for sports. I have also grown up in the digital world using Canon gear. I began with a 40D, progressed up through two 50Ds and, most recently, a 7D. They all performed well for magazine work and fine art printing. I was pretty satisfied with my kit but then I read the specs on the new mark II and that all changed.  A Modestly higher pixel count on the sensor wasn't the draw. The faster frame rate, in camera HDR, faster auto focus and better high ISO performance did it for me.I tested the camera at the big NYC camera show last fall and decided that this was the real deal. I purchased mine with the grip and it feels as professional as any camera I gave used in 40 years of shooting.Auto focus performance is fast and very accurate. Better, even than the 7D I traded in. That really surprised me since my ""keeper"" rate with the 7D body was over 90%. Also, everyone I know with a 7D shot -2/3 stop in bright sun because the camera blew out highlights. My camera was serviced annually by Canon under the CPS program so I know it was performing as designed. This camera doesn't seem to have that issue, delivering spot on exposures in bright light.I don't know why they went with compact flash and SD cards for storage but I like having 2 cards and can live with the SD decision.The thing I really like is the way the camera feels. The rubber skin is grippy and gives me confidence during fast shooting situations. It's a tiny bit lighter than the old model but it feels more rugged. Time will tell.And then, there is the burst mode! 10 frames per second brings new meaning to spray and pray!  And, the predictive AF can keep up. A definite plus for sports shooters.I'm not much of a video guy but the really cool camcorder like auto focusing works very well. A reason enough for a video klutz like me to love the camera.Finally, in camera HDR - simple and effective - will make me money! I have to shoot in terrible Iighting conditions (garages, car museums, etc.) and this feature will save time and help make more sales!Canon quality, great image performance and a near bargain price.

"The gold standard for action cameras these days in the GoPro line. While I was waiting for this camera to be delivered, I went to the huge camera show in NYC and sought out the Sony exhibit to get the low down on the AZ1VR/W. The vendor had a large screen TV with three windows. The first was a video shot with GoPro. The second was the identical video shot with the previous Sony camera and the third was a video shot with this, their latest camera. The differences were remarkable. The image stabilization, was much better on the new Sony than the other two. Also, the dynamic range on the new Sony camera and the overall sharpness / Image Quality (IQ) was clearly superior. Needless to say, I was excited to get my hands on the camera. The only thing to note is that the camera has a very wide angle lens. Anything close to the lens will get that fisheye distortion that on first look is cool but over time, can get boring. Again, you have to be close to the lens to see that level of distortion. You have been warned!First, the camera is small - really small. That makes placement in a car or on a bike or skateboard, etc., easy. Next, the splash-proof case is a great idea but when you add in the included waterproof case that allows real in the pool / lake / ocean use even better.The coolest feature is the wrist-watch-like video screen that gives you complete control over start, start and configuration. It can be worn in the wrist or on a tripod handle. However you do it, seeing what you're shooting helps ensure that your placement is going to deliver the scenes you want.Battery life is good but I recommend you buy spare batteries if you plan to use this camera for extended shooting. Also, you'll want a couple of spare micro-SD cards to ensure that you have enough storage to capture what you want to shoot.So, what's not to like? Essentially, the only problem I had was getting the camera to sync with the wrist monitor. And, I'm not the only person to note that. One of the other reviewers has written instructions on how to sync the two and I recommend you find it if you buy this product. It will save you a lot of frustration.Two stars for image quality. Two stars for ease of use (size, attachment methods, waterproof design) and one star for the external monitor / camera controller.Recommended if you need an action camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HS4CRB9W6RYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2KD9KI#wasThisHelpful","R3HS4CRB9W6RYT","A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was given a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.Glassford Girl: Part 3 takes us back to the adventures of time-jumper Emily Heart, a young girl that has been through a tumultuous existence, mainly due to her somewhat uncontrollable abilities to travel through time - a process that leaves her both physically and mentally exhausted. Shes been doing it since 1985 - 2 years or 30 years, depending how you look at it.What impressed me the most in this book is Falconers ability to tap into my imagination with words that seem to accurately describe a situation. For example, in the beginning of this Part 3 book, we see Emily coming back from a jump and ending up underwater - a scenario which the author describes step-by-step, including her respiratory system coming alive, lungs expanding, mouth engulfing water instead of air Even in challenging situations like when Emily was about to go head to head with Big Mike, Falconer managed to not only describe what was happening on the outside but also what Emily was feeling on the inside. And as a young woman, Emily was subject to a wide range of emotions that was perfectly captured, even her internal turmoils regarding following her own rules, especially Rule #7.Of course we see the return of our favorites, Derek Morgan, Jim Miller and even Junie, all of them with a part to play in Emilys life, mostly in a positive way. There was also Detective Alison, who was getting dangerously close to the truth. And we cant forget about the Orange ManOverall an amazing installment, leaving us with a spectacular twist at the end and FULL or burning questions just waiting to be answered in Part 4!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12C1OE4T664UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UP1476W#wasThisHelpful","R12C1OE4T664UR","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.Not one to usually judge a book by its cover but Part 2 of the Time Jumper series (at the time of my reading) shows a VERY similar cover to Part 1, except for minor changes in the background and Emily Heart facing the other way. Might be confusing to some readers.On to the book itself; I am glad that the lack of variety of the cover art did NOT take away from the uniqueness of the second story, which was an excellent sequel to the first. Chapter 1 dives right into the action with our heroine Emily and the gallant Derek both handcuffed and taken in police custody. We see straight away that the attraction between these two were present and more prevalent than ever. We also see the ever-so-present pain and struggle that Emily faces, knowing that she can never settle down and lead a normal life with someone she loves, not even with some of her best friends. The biggest price of being a time jumper: 2 years to her is equal to decades to a normal person.This sequel is up to par - if not even better - with its action sequences with the first. The story progresses but also takes in a new direction with the appearance of a new character chasing after Emily, giving a different kind of sci-fi twist to the plot. The jumps still take a toll on Emilys mind and body, causing her physical pain in addition to the mental and emotional aspects.Jim continues to be an asset, Derek appears in a bigger role and Junie gets reunited with Emily - the positive aspects of the story definitely outweighs the negative, more depressing parts.

"I was given a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.Rogue, Book 2 of The Omega Group Series, deals with the concept of an Avengers-type of policing body.The story really began over a millennium and a half before the present day setting, with Ahiga and the rest of the Havasupai tribe and their conflict with the rival Yavapai tribe. From this setting I enjoyed the representation of the tribes and how they were described: brave, proud and willing to go to great lengths to protect their own. As a fan of ancient cultures in general, this was a big plus for me - and by the authors rendition of events relating to these tribes, I can see that the topic was well-researched and studied.Carter Mockta, present day blood member (but estranged) of the Havasupai tribe, and his purpose with the Omega Group along with Han and Jackie were soon introduced in the following chapters. Enroute to the Grand Canyon to investigate strange anomalies, we get a glimpse of a super soldier testing program that was being conducted there. However, before they could even get to their destination, we already see some major action in the book. I found this to be consistent throughout the chapters, never lacking in action or excitement. Definitely a great way to keep the story at a good pace.Carter is made out to be a spectacular character, relatable yet a true superhero.

"I was given a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.Dacolias Dreamer of Dreams contains 4 short stories, each with a unique adventure. Unification is the first story and the longest one. It begins with a nice narration as to how Rymalone Weston Augustine found himself in a seemingly endless vortex. A good, old-fashioned good vs evil story. Traveling at the Speed of Love details the story of Joe Robeson and Ed Bloom, two astronauts on a mission to Mars, and their wives Felicia and Melanie watching them from the Control Center. Beautiful love story. The Expanding Earth centers on The Cromwell family and the curious case of why the trips they take seems to be taking longer and longer. Interestingly, the outcome was unique and deals with humans ability to be self-sufficient. The last story in this collection is called The Vision and relays the story of Bennys encounter with a mysterious angel and ends in what could very well be the future state of our planet.Dacolias definitely have a way with words, immensely appealing to the imagination and effectively tugging at the reader with his characters dilemmas, situations and complex emotions. It is a given that when you read one of his books - may it be novels or story collections - you expect to be taken along for an emotional rollercoaster ride. I always admire his vocabulary and the combination of words and phrases he uses to convey the lessons in his tales or even just to describe the back story or situation. The characters, although fictional, seem to accurately capture the essence of being human, hence readers can easily relate to at least one of the protagonists in this book. My personal favorite in this collection is the story Traveling at the Speed of Love as I am curious about the Mars One project and so I found it appealing :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28NLCAKHN0S05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942721013#wasThisHelpful","R28NLCAKHN0S05","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.In The Fountain of Youth, Gilbert and Mannys adventure with Margaret was very cute and inspiring. It was heartwarming to read about the old folks at the retirement home who took a hold of their lives, in their own terms. Just because youre in there doesnt mean your life is over! In Reunion, Corinne was feeling the pressures of acting life and returned to her old neighborhood, seeking advice from her mentors. Marie and Tyler had a few things to say to help Corinne deal with her issues; advice that were well thought of and sounded realistic. I enjoyed their interaction, it showed that you can be family even if you are not blood related. Oblivion was of a unique experiment-type plot. It relates the story of the young and ambitious Stuart, who devised an experiment to live in isolation by the Salton Sea for a year. Interesting outcome. Footprints in the Grass relates the story of an unlikely friendship, between Lester Federman (aka Mr. Fanatic, obsessed with his prized lawn) and Hilary, a little girl, so innocent and full of life. They each taught the other valuable lessons in life; a very heartwarming story. And finally, The Island of Him shows an intense story of how a life can seemingly be pointless when suffering from a disease.Dacolias has a very consistent way with words, almost like a magical touch, telling the stories as if a narrator was reading them. This narrative style, along with his way with descriptions greatly contribute towards making the plots interesting. I believe these tales contained in Sculptor of Stories are some of his best work yet. The introduction to the stories were pretty substantial, giving the reader a complete look at the background before the action began. The endings felt complete and provides sufficient closure to the stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGMH5E2M7ZV8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989564657#wasThisHelpful","RGMH5E2M7ZV8X","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.For someone who was supposed to be the center of the attention, the star of the media, the biggest celebrity of her day, Jono was not a happy person. Her boyfriend Troy, a wannabe in the Hollywood insider circle is a controlling, demanding person who bathed himself in the limelight under which Jono is constantly a part of. A leech. Maxwell, her manager, on the other hand is someone who genuinely cares for Jono and her well-being. Understandably, he hates Troys guts but he is supportive of Jono and her decisions. He takes care of her and stood by her side through the good times and the bad. He is smart and knows the industry very well - a great companion to Jono.During a traumatic event that could very well have ended Jonos life, she unknowingly crossed paths with a beautiful hero name MikeI think Mikes personal story was touching, a sad past that understandably impacted his current views and way of life. I liked how his relationship with Jono progressed, degressed and then redeveloped. I especially liked the descriptions of the settings; for example, the house in Hawaii where the party in the beginning was thrown appeared vividly before my eyes, simply from Jones description of it. The characters were written well; realistic, relatable, some of whom I HATED and others who I couldnt help but love.I have read Jones other novels (Long Trip Home and Rose) and even though the stories were all different and dealt with diverse situations, the ability to tell the story with flow and ease were present in all 3 books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34AR062C6FP75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0986255211#wasThisHelpful","R34AR062C6FP75","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.Weve all been there at some point, where were not really completely unfortunate but cant help but feel that something was missing And then we get thrown to experience the greatest adventure of our lives!Long Trip Home is a unique story, different from any that I have read before. We get a glimpse in the beginning of Troys life - one that was pretty much ordinary: a loving husband to a wife (April) and dedicated father to two children (Maggie and Justin), son-in-law to his boss Frank. However, all of these were catapulted out of proportion one day, in the middle of a country steeped in conflict, while stranded, waiting for their flight - when Isabelle walked into his life. On a side note - as a frequent flyer, I feel Troys pain when it takes you 36+ hours on the way home from distant lands. Anyway back to Izy - someone who is in a completely different path yet captivating and stubborn, knows-what-she-wants type of woman! A forbidden friendship - one that had to be kept a secret, essentially leading Troy to live a somewhat double lifeI love Dutch Jones style of writing; it kept me engaged as I read the novel in between chores and pretty much whatever free time I could get. The characters were appealing and likeable, no matter how different they are from each other. The pace moved fast enough for me, where you are thrown right into the middle of conflict and action.Enjoyed it very much!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKASOYHCJVDC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0986255203#wasThisHelpful","RKASOYHCJVDC8","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Review I was given a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.The story started off in beautiful Greece, with Polybios Nicomidis nervously reporting to his first day on the job, at a place that was both menacing and exciting at the same time. We get a glimpse of the people working in the Ebola Division as well the ones working with Poly in the Rabies Division - the Communicable Diseases Investigators. Interesting characters; weird but interesting.We see glimpses foreshadowed by Neighbours Reports, adding to the suspense of the story. Who is this girl? What experiments??Then we read about Emma.Shes a girl with a passion for - biology. Making her parents proud at first. Observing things under a microscope, even her own blood, leading to a an obsession - and a tragic situation.Their paths crossed when Poly and co-worker Zoe were sent to Emmas town Kilkis, off Thessaloniki, to investigate a rabies incident...I can say that I enjoyed the story very well. It is of a unique structure, the pace was just right and the suspense was spectacular. It was easy to imagine this story as a movie, with the authors style changing, alternating the chapters with narration, interviews from various neighbors, teachers and family members, even video transcript style. The plot was superb; even though there are hundreds of this type of stories in movies and books, this one had a particularly unique characteristic. The characters were realistic actually, easy to remember, possessing quirks that you see in everyday people in everyday life.A short read but a great one!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35RPMBQV9HDJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WC7HO7Q#wasThisHelpful","R35RPMBQV9HDJY","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.A gripping beginning, even for those readers who may not have read the previous Athina books. Estes accurately spells it out for you: this young woman in the introduction is not your typical young lady in the castle tower at all - she was in fact, a modern man, a construction worker named Jim Sanders, native of New York CIty.And Jim, now Athina, is in deep trouble. Accused of treason - a crime that carries a death sentence, but as shown in the last book, reduced to life imprisonment in her case. Jim needs to ensure his survival and in order to get this done, he needs to find out the truth behind it all: did the real Athina really plot against the King?I cant help but laugh when Athina gets uncomfortable whenever men like Lord Handel Blue get all up and personal in her private space. But wait! He proposes a way out of the tower imprisonment if Athina were to conceive his child! This situation just led to trouble, specifically to a more physical fight, the outcome not being good for both Lord Handel and Athina.Anyway Estes takes us through Athinas trial - actually it wasnt much of a trial at all! Unbeknownst to her until the trial, there had already been an agreement regarding her guilt and it wasnt a trial but rather a proceeding where she was expected to publicly admit her guilt. But since she said no as any innocent person would, the prosecutor was forced to relay the whole story of the charges against her before the court, including their evidenceA messy ending, with painful deaths and destruction, feelings of extreme sorrow with bouts of happiness. So much love - so much tragedy - and its not over yet ;) Genuinely looking forward to what is next in store for Athina, as herself and Wendall face some extraordinary new challenges.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KWPC8D66KY2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVMQ3G6#wasThisHelpful","R3KWPC8D66KY2M","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.There is always something uniquely magical about Dacolias stories.In the first few chapters of What We All Have, we get a glimpse of the suffering that a young man named Tony is going through: the pains, the aches, his healths decline. Since the onslaught of his condition, he had felt that this new unwanted companion (his disease) has rapidly influenced his belief that he is truly apart from the world and that the world wants no part of him. He shows anger and frustration at those who seemingly have it all but yet let everything go to waste - maybe even at his old self, back when he was happy and illness-free. This hate brought about a feeling of depression that pushes him further into seclusion from the rest of humanity.It is a very sad and miserable life. I can understand the power of Dacolias descriptions of what this man is going through - anyone who has been around someone with deteriorating health can unfortunately understand this scenario all too well.We also meet Lake, a once-privileged member of the elite society, complete with her fancy cars and multiple luxury dwellings, along with an aloof attitude towards those who were not of the same social standing. Until the passing of her grandmother, who saw it fit to leave her fortune to charity - and nothing to Lake. To add insult to injury so to speak - a month later, she got sick as well, sending her social status and wealthy friends out the window and she became one of the unprivileged ones that she once despised.Tony and Lake crossed paths, a brief yet strange first encounter but one that neither of them could forget. So began a new bond between them, one that was tied together with misfortune. It was interesting to see how it panned out, because they each already face multiple challenges plus you add love on top and it becomes a challenge in itself. I overall enjoyed the story, it was an interesting take but one that carries a slew of lessons for the reader.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39XOZMRVF1ZQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIDOWOY#wasThisHelpful","R39XOZMRVF1ZQ7","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found ""Heads Off"" to be a witty and interesting police procedural crime novel. The protagonist Lisa is very relatable; little characteristics such as her constant struggle to lose weight and to succeed in a predominantly ""man's"" profession makes her appealing to most female readers. The way her thoughts are portrayed regarding the different men in her life was very well done and really shows the audience what she thinks through the author's use of witty descriptions.Aside from the story being a solid mystery, I also enjoyed the pictures in between the chapters as they helped with my imagination.

"Ordered this case the same day I pre-ordered my Galaxy Note 4 and it arrived the same day! Perfect fit, feels sturdy and very solid. I like how it fits my new baby, it doesn't make it look bulky like other armour cases. It was very easy to install, both the rubber and plastic components work together to keep my phone in place.The sound doesn't get affected by the case as was my experience with my old Note 3 and it's case.

"Having previously read a few of Ray Dacolias books (including Guardians at the Gate and most recently, The Tragedy of Woman,) I knew to expect a thrilling and complex plot along with a gradual slowly-but-surely form of character development. This book is a good break for the usual full-length novel as it is a collections of several yarns; a big plus for me as I am a big fan of short stories.I definitely enjoyed The Lauren Tree, an interesting take on the subject of lying and lies in general. Out of the three Animal Stories I enjoyed the very last one the most, mainly due to Lindsays actions regarding the protection against the mistreatment of animals but also because of how her husband Seth and herself lived among the wild animals later on. I definitely loved the twist in that story and how it ended!Although Fat City, Steel Maiden, The Epiphany of Pain and The Vanishing Point are all decent honourable mentions, out of all of the stories though I feel that Ten Chances was the one that spoke to me the most because it deals with a topic that affects a lot of people, both young and old. The story outlines Ikes ten chances, and it vividly describes an unfortunate pattern that emerges when people are given too many chances until there was none left to give, leaving behind a trail of destruction and more than one broken soul.In its entirety, this anthology is a great reflection of Dacolias talents and storytelling abilities. If you are new to his work this is the perfect place to start as you can see the depth that he is capable of and the potential of his other works!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CF3NNCROZ3A5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988817799#wasThisHelpful","R3CF3NNCROZ3A5","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This season where Christmas falls right after Halloween and Thanksgiving is definitely the perfect time to take a look at this book.We can see how Rocko the bat, a Halloween decoration that is annually placed in a prime position that made observing Gray and Kates family as well as the other events during Halloween very easy. He observed the kids get dressed up and leave for trick or treating. He could see the kids at the door in their costumes such as dressing up as ghosts, skeletons or like himself - a bat. It was obvious that he enjoyed it when the kids are happy (like when they get candy). This year though, Rocko got to see what happens during the year because they had forgotten to put him away!I found the book very much ideal for kids. Aside from the consistent and clever illustrations, the storyline itself is easy to follow, even for little ones. They can follow along with Rocko and learn about the Holidays and would definitely put them in a Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas kind of moods. It is relatable for kids to read about Rockos observations with regards to the routines the family go through, like thanking Someone before Thanksgiving dinner as well as the putting up of trees and other Christmas decorations. The Christmas story itself was also very well worded, in language that little kids will understand and learn from.Through Rocko, children will have a better idea about the Holidays, especially about Christmas as well as the power of prayer!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21JMG5H2XJ5XM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615939953#wasThisHelpful","R21JMG5H2XJ5XM","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I used to feed my family take-out when I come home from work - but now I have access to tasty recipes that I can put in the slow cooker before I leave!But the reason that I appreciate this book so much is because one of the kids is in the autism spectrum and we had been advised by therapists to try converting into a gluten-free diet for her, which had been previously difficult to do without sacrificing flavour and budget.

"Foreshadowed by the title, there was a sympathetic tone set for Oscine throughout the story, as life dealt her with one bad card after another, but yet she was portrayed as a positive, compassionate individual. Beginning with a horrible childhood, she was faced with challenges that no person should have to go through, but unfortunately it does happen. Its a story that was sad to read because the main characters spirit gets attacked as she continues her journey in search of both love and happiness.As she grew up, her interactions with persons of the opposite sex, coupled by her desire for finding the man that would rescue her proved to be a toxic mixture that would lead her to early marriage including the shock of her new duties and responsibilities as a new mother. There is a part of the book that described exactly how Heath felt about his wife; when he saw that she is 100% faithful to him and that she will never leave him because of the baby then he stopped complimenting her, stopped giving her gifts and started to become suspicious of her. That is unfortunately too familiar as we hear about those situations in real life quite often.Throughout the novel we see Oscines innermost thoughts of both hoping for better circumstances and life but also the amount of torment she feels inside. Even when her own boys abuse her at their fathers cynical command, she still thought the better of them all. I couldnt help but feel a whole of anger for all the suffering that Oscine endured and even though I felt pity for her, I wish she would just get up and leave her situation and never come back! And the tortured love between her and Abraham turned to be yet another good thing that turned incredibly tragic.Eli on the other - a completely different story! We see his past before he became Abrahams best friend. I am glad the author ended with him though because if the story just stopped with Book 1 then the reader would be left off on an extremely sad tone.Overall a long read, a complex plot but overall an enjoyable, complicated novel!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18XKBPSQCL0F6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989564622#wasThisHelpful","R18XKBPSQCL0F6","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"SATED is the last book of the romantic, coming of age story that started with Wantin and followed by Unrequited. In this series we follow Talia Jacobs as she journeys from childhood into womanhood, including all the challenges and heartaches she experienced and up to now as she finally finds herself ready to accept the love that she has been looking for - to a man that she has a history with since they were children and to whom she is drawn to like a moth to a flame.Aside from her primary love story centred around Bodhi, we hear of another example of triumphant love - through the story of sweet old Mabel (and her now deceased husband of 42 years, Walter), whom Talia met at a random coffee shop. Her love story seem to have a positive effect on Talia and the feelings of love for Bodhi that shes been experiencing.I found this book in line with the other two with regards to sensuality, being full of emotion, astounding when it came to the portrayal of each of the characters thoughts and feelings, easy to relate to as it covered not only familiar human interactions but also places that are familiar to world travellers or even avid book readers. The little touch of supernatural towards the end seemed fitting and somewhat expected. The ending itself was a satisfying conclusion and I believe that it gave the readers exactly what they are looking for in terms with the closure of Talias journey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSH7QV81I3AAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MLKVK4C#wasThisHelpful","RSH7QV81I3AAJ","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I originally posted my verified purchase review of this book on Amazon.ca, but since it doesn't show up here, I decided to post it here as well.The story starts in the late 1600s and it was easy to be fond of Alpheus, and to feel bad for him from the beginning when he is plagued with problems including being robbed by the nomads. Eventually he was buried deep - until 1996!This book has a nice mixture of different genres - humour, action, mystery, suspense.

"It is inspiring how the author gave the reason behind how he came to start off with nothing: Hurricane Katrina. Like many affected by that tragedy, he had lost everything. But that didnt stop his drive for success, as this book shows.It provides a clear guideline  call it a blueprint if you will  about how to start with absolutely nothing and end up in the top. Along with basic principles and lessons, it shows you how to utilize the untapped portion of your mind. The detailed views of what to do if you find yourself in a having nothing situation applies to pretty much any field.As you read through the pages, you can see the point that the author is trying to make: if you have goals and desires, you should not have to worry about money to achieve simply by showcasing the well know principle of paying it forward.The best part about is it the concept that makes the point to make sure that the information is almost completely free, in order to benefit everyone who wishes to be successful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2COATZBZTBT9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HME6BFK#wasThisHelpful","R2COATZBZTBT9C","A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PMRR8EU7JT9Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reading many positive reviews about Total Car Diagnostics and their products, I though I'd give TOAD a try. Expecting to get the same old under-promised, over-hyped experience, as is true with many of these OBD diagnostic scantools I got from eBay. Not so with these guys. Turned out to be a stellar exceptional product that worked on our 2001 Holden, 2004 Ford & 2008 BMW X5. Instantly showed their condition and faults. Saved us at least $2000 in repairs. My initial support ticket took 2 days to get answered. Next one took under 24 hours. So be prepared to wait. I'm sure they're dealing with many support requests.Install: Quick, smooth and easy, thanks to provided step-by-step instructions on their site.Software friendliness: Overwhelming at first. 1 hour of playing with it, got it! Be prepared for initial learning curve.Cost: 10/10.

I found Chapter 4 How Do You Overcome Shyness very useful. I never looked at it that way before  that shyness is only a negative thought about myself that I can replace with a positive thought.The book has a personal touch to it, because the author cites his own experiences.

This isnt like those other billionaire books  in fact the author even makes fun of them! Introducing a heroine who is shrewd, resourceful but with a heart.There were a few twists and turns in the saga that caught me by surprise, including one in particular that I have never seen before in a book of this kind.  You will also read about a certain low point in the heroines life, and up until then you will really notice the dark direction that the story was taken. But after that, everything changes  when she begins to find herself and eventually, the man of her dreams.The ending turned out to be romantic, which I certainly didnt expect.

"These trainers are an alternative to conventional orthodontics for cases of mild to moderate malocclusion, sometimes even cases of severe malocclusion can be corrected, such as expansion of the upper dental arch, maxillary protrusion, and jaw deep overbite. You can find amazing before/after photos by searching on alignment trainer Dessa Dental. They have been used successfully in Europe and elsewhere for more than a decade, but so far have not been approved by the American Association of Orthodontists. In my opinion the reason is obvious: the profits coming from conventional orthodontics and the frequent trips to the dentist's office, compared to an inexpensive device that is at least as effective and can be applied at home with far fewer trips to the office and little danger of side effects, such as carries. American orthodontists and dentists cannot now dispense these devices to patients, but they do use them for their own family members. In fact, it's a bit of a wild west out there because these devices are not regulated in the US or Asia, so you will see knock-offs and proprietary elaborations at much higher costs.First off, the blue size is meant for children whose adult teeth are in or coming in, ages about 8 to 16. There is a smaller size for younger children that is applied for the correction of myofunctional habits and tooth eruption guidance, and a larger more rigid size for adults. That's it, and there are no custom fittings such as with Invisalign or even bite guards.The device is intended to be inserted at night or during the day when convenient. It works by guiding the force of the tongue and the lips, each of which can and does exert more than ten times the force needed to move children's teeth. It discourages, but does not prevent, mouth breathing, which is a cause of malocclusion because then the tongue does not press properly against the upper teeth. Like conventional orthodontic devices, it is uncomfortable and requires some getting used to, but that's usually not a deal killer, and note that it is not a choking hazard. Results will require many months of use, just like conventional orthodontics, depending on how far teeth have to be moved, but results will be evident at three to six months. Children can continue to use the device even after their teeth are aligned, until they have outgrown the blue size. A dentist can evaluate progress at regular exam/cleaning visits, but few dentists are familiar with alignment trainers, so expect some skepticism.The alignment trainer should be cleaned just like a night guard. Some kids will need help with that, but otherwise these devices appear to be totally safe. BTW, I'm just a parent, with no connection to any manufacturer or distributor, but with a cool dentist whom I trust.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SPS6EBNQGG4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2875DO#wasThisHelpful","R3SPS6EBNQGG4P","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My high hopes were for naught. The book is poorly organized: the Level 1 questions are so basic that, if you need help with them, you need a basic math education, not a narrowly focused prep guide. The Level 5 questions are more advanced than are likely to appear on an ACT, and are a waste of time to study and learn. Plus, some of the questions are misleading, and some of the answers are wrong.For example: Problem 115 asks what the is the sum of the *three* distinct regions of the plane that can be divided up using three lines. The explanation shows three drawings which result in 4, 6, and 7 regions (so the ""correct"" sum is 17), but the question is misstated. But there are, in fact, 4 different ways of dividing up the plane with three lines (not shown: all lines passing through one point), so the answer explanation is screwy.Another example: Question 118 expects you to know that an angle inscribed in a circle is half the degree measure of the arc it intercepts; but that's far more difficult than anything on the ACT.The author suggests you memorize the quadratic formula. Good advice, but when it is required on the ACT it is given in the question.Another bad example: A question asks for the solution when x=5 of (x^2 - 5)/(x -3) times the number of horizontal and/or vertical intercepts of that function. In the answer, the author says that the function has a vertical intercept on x=3 and no horizontal intercept. Who would know that? The correct solution is to know that hyperbolas are the only conics with asymptotes and they always have two asymptotes and 0, 1, or 2 can be vertical or horizontal. The answer choices are 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, so the only answer possible is 10.The only good information is on using a calculator to plug and test answers, but the author suggests a TI-85, which is way overkill for the ACT and a distraction for most students. A more basic Casio fx-260, well understood, would be a far better choice.The best ACT math book is Ultimate Guide to ACT Math by Corn, but if you are going to get only one general guide, the math section of the essential ACT Prep Black Book by Barrett is far better than this ""Red Book."" You also will need the real ""red book,"" Peterson's The Real ACT Prep Guide.

It works. The clamp parts seem like ordinary steel, with a black oxide finish and a little oil.

Several minutes with a bench grinder fixed that. The ground surfaces are not precision and are non-load bearing, so hand grinding is appropriate.

"Head and shoulders above the competition - in terms of design and functionality.First, it will cut flush to the blade teeth. Surprisingly, not all hacksaws will, and if you need that capability and don't have it, you'll curse your saw. Secondly, the main grip is rubber-covered and fits large hands, or hands wearing gloves, quite nicely. The small, end grip is also quite easy to grasp and is also rubberized. Together, they let you tackle tough jobs with both hands; a steel bar, for example. The tension adjustment mechanism works with fingertip ease, but can put a lot of tension on the blade; it is nicely protected by a plastic cover to prevent snagging on your clothes or nearby wires.I was initially dubious about the utility of the additional functions, but very soon after I got the saw, I realized that a job I was working on would be a lot easier using one of them. Soon another application came up, and I had the blade I needed right in the saw, so I guess I shouldn't be so skeptical. I even reversed the blade once so the saw cut toward itself, and the whole business was east to manage.The only possible complaint might be that the thing is somewhat heavy. To me, that's an advantage, because it seems not to skitter around when starting tough cuts. With a double handed grip, this saw gets right to business.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15NC2IUUBY1P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051QIIDO#wasThisHelpful","R15NC2IUUBY1P4","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I got was a flex putty knife with a hardwood handle. I expected mediocre quality, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was exactly what the job required, tapered thickness blade and all. A multi-purpose tool indeed. You can find similar putty knives with plastic handles and a metal endcap, but for most every job, I prefer the feel of wood. And you can always find things cheaper than Prime items, which seem to have the shipping cost buried in the price. Up to you to decide what a trip to the store is worth to you.Actually, this putty knife changed my whole view of Tekton tools. I always thought of them as just-get-by quality. But I thought about all the various Tekton tools I have accumulated over the years, and now I'd say they are a great value. I'd still use Snap-On in a production environment (if I weren't covering the cost), but Tekton is fine around the home shop, and I can't remember ever breaking one or having it fail to do its job.BTW, the most commonly used tool is fingernails.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AGM7G7M7EHEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NY6RXC#wasThisHelpful","R1AGM7G7M7EHEM","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Layout Essentials: 100 Design Principals for Using Grids doesn't actually deliver design principals, they're just platitudes. Here are some examples: Avoid crowding, Avoid overcrowding, Design with ample margins, Pack it in. What the book does deliver is a well-chosen selection of excellent page layouts, most based on applications of grid principals, though a few make you scratch your head. (There is an illustrated compendium of grid layout terms on the first pages.) The author even applies the same principal to the layout and comments of the pages that illustrate the particular principal chosen, so the book design itself is excellent and quite clever.What the author does not deliver is solutions to today's designers' main challenge: keeping a consistent look and grid design over printed pages, computer screens, and personal device displays. The book is focused almost entirely on printed pages or posters.Nevertheless, the examples shown are brilliant and inspirational and the author's comments well-taken.

"I have no idea why Anova dropped their price to $200, but my advice is to get one before they come to their senses. This is a great immersion heater, and it is exceptionally well designed. It inspired me to write a short review.It isn't obvious from the photos, but the display isn't Photoshopped, it's actually a color, back-lit, graphical, LCD touch screen. There's a startup screen where you can set C or F display and select the timer mode (yes, it has a timer): to either beep or shut down when the time runs down to zero. The timer can be set for up to 99 hours, but if no time is set the unit will run until the water evaporates below the two low-water sensors. In use, the display shows set temp, measured temp, and time remaining on the timer, with a Stop option. Temp can be set to 0.1 degree and Anova claims 0.01 degree stability, but that would be hard to measure. You can touch the display while it's running to show several simplified screens with heater and pump icons.The heater is a full 1000 W (limited by household current supply), and the unit has a burly but intelligently short removable/replaceable IEC line cord. The stainless steel cover over the heater, sensors, and pump easily twists off for ready access to the insides for cleaning; that's very handy when one of your pouches leaks and everything gets covered with duck fat or one of your onsen tamago cracks and you have egg white pumped throughout your circulator. In the long run you can also easily clean off mineral deposits. You can scrub off the inside parts with a soapy vegetable brush and put the cover and pump cover in the dish washer. The pump cover screws onto the main cover and you can unscrew it a bit to trim the direction of the outflow if you need to, although the bayonet attachment of the main cover by itself allows four different flow directions. The pump flow is robust, rated at 12 liters per minute. Although the tank capacity is rated at 6 gallons, I'd guess that to run that big a tank at a high temperature you'd want an insulated tank (this is pretty easy to set up: just use two nesting plastic tubs and a lid). The clamp wants a tank at least 7 inches deep, but the unit stands stably on its base without the clamp and doesn't use its bottom for water intake like other units, so there's a lot of flexibility in setting it up in tanks as shallow as 3 inches.A few fine points and then I'll look at the competition. There is a physical mains power switch, but it's out of sight, positioned like a trigger behind and below the display head. The instruction booklet talks about sending the unit in for repair, so it looks like repair rather than replacement is possible. And the startup screen also allows entering a calibration mode, though it isn't advised. I checked my unit with a precision lab thermometer readable to 0.1 degree C, and it was spot on as far as I could tell. The unit also seems to have a thermostatically controlled fan in the control head that operates independently of the pump motor--a nice touch.Now about the competition: The least expensive Polyscience Sous Vide Professional immersion heaters are rated for household use. The Discovery model costs $300 and has a 750 W heater. The Creative unit costs $400 but has a 1100 W heater and a timer, although there are but two numerical displays so one flashes between set temp and time. Both units have a pump capacity of 6 liters per minute and 0.07 degree stability. Amazon reviewers report that these Chinese-made units cannot be repaired. The Anova unit actually compares favorably to the Polyscience Chef model, which costs $800 but like the others requires screwdriver disassembly for good access to the inner parts for cleaning.I'm an electronics engineer and product designer, and I was really impressed with the design of the Anova immersion circulator. Even the packaging was well-designed, so the out-of-box experience was excellent. I have only a small quibble: the setup screen could easily provide a few more options, such as beeps when the unit reaches its set temp and an option for the timer to start counting down after the unit reaches its set temp, and the timer options don't need to be mutually exclusive. Seems like it could be done with a simple firmware change since everything else is there. Nevertheless: 5 solid stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXXS9FGZOB0GL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GT753W8#wasThisHelpful","RXXS9FGZOB0GL","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is always amusing when creationists turn to science to justify belief; inevitably they are untrained in the areas they call upon and they readily resort to quote mining  and selective misunderstanding. This book is a fine example of that tendency. Philosophers will find the philosophical component as risible as I find the Discovery Institute science, but I'll leave that to them and comment on what is presented as science, which is so notably lame.The underlying premise is ""Science can't explain the Cambrian explosion to my satisfaction (even though I'm not a biologist), so it can only have been due to supernatural Intelligent Design."" Any scientist knows that Darwin's lack of certainty is simply the way science works. Only religion is free of doubt.But let's have a look at what science knows about the Cambrian explosion. First, was it really an ""explosion?"" It got that name back in the day because the fossils of first animals were initially discovered in a relatively narrow range of geological time. Since then, many more fossils have been discovered of earlier hard-bodied animals and even of soft-bodied animals--but the name has stuck. Meyer thinks this all happened too fast, but that's because he doesn't understand molecular phylogenetics. Meyer can't account for what he thinks is the too-rapid evolution of hard-bodied morphology except by invoking divine intervention. He seems ignorant of the way evolution works: it builds new traits and new phyla, not de novo, but from mutations in or doubling of genetic building blocks that already exist. By the time of the Cambrian, hard-bodied animals had existed for tens of millions of years (in the Ediacaran). And the basic genes employed in Cambrian animals had existed for more tens of millions prior. In fact, some of these genes are well-conserved and are still with us today.By the Cambrian, not only did hard-bodied animals exist, but macrophagy had long evolved. Deuterosomes and proteasomes had split, and not just Echinodermata but also protochordata were well established (and again, the genetic building blocks for these characteristics preceded them by tens of millions of years). Bilateralians had appeared. Parasitism had long before pushed sexual reproduction into multicellular animals. Scientists are increasingly able to pin down the timing of this diversification due to advances in genome sequencing and understanding of the molecular clock. Fossils are not required. So, sure, in the first third of the Cambrian the number of phyla went up somewhat and the number of classes about doubled over twenty million years, but that shouldn't cause scientists (or creationists) to go nuts. Compare it to the mammalian ""explosion"" that followed the KT extinction, keeping in mind that invertebrates reproduce, and therefore evolve, an order of magnitude faster than mammals. But that radiation wasn't called an explosion, so Meyer doesn't find it mysteriously inexplicable.Also consider the other factors at play in the early Cambrian, including abiotic factors. The Earth was emerging from a period called ""Slushball Earth,"" which meant that water retained in snow and ice was released, the regolith was eroded, and sea levels rose to cover coastal areas. That increased the amount of phosphorous and calcium (by a factor of three) in seawater, making it available for biomineralization and for the first time the evolution of hard tissue predators and prey and the rapid evolution of their arms race and participation in complex food webs in new marine ecosystems.Oceans rising onto eroded regolith (mud) meant a substantial increase in littoral habitat and the appearance of burrowing and other benthic animals to take advantage of it, further adding to biodiversity and increasing animal morphological diversity.So the potential causes of the rapid diversification of animal types in the early Cambrian are many, and doubtless they interacted. But just because real scientists have yet to agree upon the proportional contribution of each of the many possible influences, or their relative timing, does not mean anyone should throw up their hands and conclude that a single cause must therefor be responsible: an intelligent designer. Meyer seems happily oblivious to all this real science stuff so he can only drag out the old god-of-the-gaps argument and dress it up a bit, perfectly illustrating the Dunning-Kruger effect. This book makes no contribution to our scientific understanding of evolutionary processes in the early Cambrian period. For that you'll need actual science.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VPH27HTIW9P2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062071475#wasThisHelpful","R3VPH27HTIW9P2","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The product that I received failed. It may have worked at first, though the plug was sloppy and unreliable, but apparently it soon failed to charge the battery while reporting that it was charged. I took the camera back to COSTCO and they exchanged it. But it was the dead battery at fault, not the camera. Later, the charger gave off that old familiar smell of hot electronics and it melted the side of its plastic case. The charger was dead.I'm an electronics engineer, so naturally I took the charger apart to see what had gone wrong. I found what you'd expect for inexpensive consumer electronics: nothing fancy, but nothing terribly slipshod either. A voltage regulator chip had failed and overheated, maybe because its heat sink wasn't large enough? Maybe I just got a lemon. The charger has a CE mark but no UL, and the printed voltage specification doesn't make sense, so I don't think an engineer was involved in drawing up the label.I asked Amazon for a refund before I realized that the charger was weeks out of warranty. The seller contacted me and offered a refund or exchange. I picked refund and they complied without asking me to return the charger. That was more than fair; I would have sent it back so they could have a look.I'm not sure I can recommend the charger, based on my experience, but I can definitely recommend the seller. I replaced it with another brand because I didn't want to be without a charger while the replacement was being processed, but otherwise I'd probably buy it again. The price is good and the vendor inspires confidence.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZN4XYSUW7RL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2AVE12#wasThisHelpful","RZN4XYSUW7RL8","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted to like this book, because I believe in rigorous mathematics. Unfortunately, it's pretty uninviting.I have no doubt that it thoroughly and rigorously covers its topic (plane geometry), but, sadly, it's too rigorous for modern high school students. And it's pretty dry. The few pages on trig are far too few and too terse; there's no picture of sin/cos waves that will certainly lie in the future for students who tackle science or engineering. I'll refer to it while I teach, but I'm afraid that it would turn off most students. If this were the textbook, students would be dropping like flies.Seriously, the depth of this book is excessive for what a contemporary high school student needs to learn about plane geometry or about constructing clever proofs. It might be fine for a future math major, but it might also discourage potential future math majors.I didn't find any answers to the exercises, which not only requires that a teacher work them out (and many aren't trivial, to say the least), but it doesn't show what elegant methods the author might have had in mind when he posed the problems. Often the solution (particularly of proofs) is as educational as the lead-up text. And worked examples are the best way to teach, IMHO. There are too few in Kiselev.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F0X2SLM0KYFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0977985202#wasThisHelpful","R3F0X2SLM0KYFI","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And they are bite-proof and don't require poking something in an ear.I started using them to end all discussions with our pediatrician, who always hems and hasw when you tell her what thermometer you used.

"This thing fits my Sero 7 Pro perfectly. The cutouts for the rear camera, speakers, front camera and light sensor, the buttons, and the sockets all align very well. It's the best Sero 7 case I have seen, and I've seen several.The case is made from dark brown leatherette with nicely finished edges and flawless white saddle stitching. It has a nice manly look, or it could go with a Coach purse. My daughter wanted a pale blue case, so she looked elsewhere. Inside there are slots for two microSD cards, three credit cards, and some notes or receipts. There's a wide elastic strap to keep things attached to your left hand with the case opened, and a small strap on the back for a pen. There are magnetic closures and, in addition, another elastic strap for positive closure. There is provision to stand the tablet at an angle in landscape mode.All in all, a fine case with great features at a great price.The seller has been contacting buyers in case they accidentally shipped a case for the Sero 7 LT, which says good things about their service.

"This fan has a lot of cool features and they all seem to work well -- plus, it's only a few dollars more than ""reversible"" fans that must be physically reversed (lame!). The remote is powerful enough to reach at least 40 feet or bounce off a wall. But here is one of the caveats: the buttons are all the same shape, so you'll be a bit challenged to use the remote in the dark, even with the obvious LEDs on the fan unit's face.Don't fret about reviews that say it's hard to mount. The clips that hold the side slats will snap into place when you drop it down into whatever slot it will rest. No big deal; at worst you can have someone else pull a book out from under the unit as you spread the sides and let drop into place. There are two expander plates for wider windows and plenty of foam provided to fill gaps; I didn't need any.I got mine in 2013 so maybe the location of the thermostat issue has been resolved; I just set mine low and ignore it, changing the direction of flow to get the effect I want. It seems the thermostat shows the temp of the air passing through the unit, slightly favoring outside temp. Mine never sees direct sun. You can work out in your head what temp you'd want to set if the air is moving in or out (or both).The fans move air well; I seldom use any but the lowest speed. And they are fairly quiet, too. But there's the caveat: the blade guards are far apart, so flies and mosquitoes might be able to enter your room, though my flies haven't figured that out yet. And the fan doesn't easily disassemble for cleaning. We'll see how that goes, but it's no worse than a box floor fan except that half of the blade guards are outside the room. An update months later: no flies or mosquitoes have come in; maybe the ones in my neighborhood are fan-challenged. Let's hope.After using it for months, I've raised my rating by one star, because it works so well in my application and it has cut down on my use of the small window AC that it sits on top of.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBBEC8BVAFNY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000065DKJ#wasThisHelpful","RBBEC8BVAFNY2","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I posted this about the Transcend 32 GB SDHC card that was getting trashed in reviews by Canon owners. It also applies to the Sony card (read down), and readers may find it helpful in evaluating SD cards in general.The 1-star threads on the Transcend are like watching a committee of blind men describing an elephant. Unsurprisingly, no one has the complete picture, but a lot of Canon owners think these cards are bogus. SD card technology is very complex, the Class system is often misunderstood, and there is a long history of compromised cards appearing on eBay -- or even from reputable dealers who have been hoodwinked. Kingston cards are most often faked (or taken from the midnight production run); that's because Kingston has about a third of the flash card market and doesn't forge their own chips, but any manufacturer can be spoofed. It doesn't pay to buy cheap cards on eBay or less reputable sources.An SD card contains a controller chip and flash memory chips, even the microSD versions. Realize that SD means Secure Digital, and that security comes from crypto managed by the controller (MMC cards didn't have that bloat, but Hollywood DRM requirements made sure they faded). The controller can be pretty powerful: the Samsung SD controller is a 32-bit ARM TDMI chip with 128 k of code space -- that's cell phone power. It handles I/O and fading (when the card slowly wears out its NAND sites after about 100,000 hits so writing is randomly distributed and kept track of), the factory self-test, and a host of other functions, but it can also be programmed to report a false storage capacity. Sometimes the firmware on the controller or its crypto or something else on certain cards leads to problems with certain hardware, as it has, for example, with the Samsung Galaxy III and maybe the Canon cameras. Usually the card is found to confirm to SDcard dot Org specifications and the hardware is to blame, but you never know.To test the actual capacity of your card, use H2testw, which is free. It writes the full amount of data to the card and then reads it back (this nukes whatever was on the card). This can take more than an hour with a 32 GB card but it tells you if the card indeed holds 32 GB or if it has problems. H2testw also gives you read and write speed numbers, but it's unclear whether the numbers are for random read/write, or sequential read/write or a mix. Sequential write is what photographers and videographers most care about.Sometimes a Class 6 card might appear to test faster than a Class 10 card, when using computer read/write tests or even in a camera that wasn't designed with higher capacity cards in mind. That's because such cards use smaller block sizes (there's no cache on an SD card). Explaining the significance of this is getting too far into the weeds for an Amazon review, and modern devices and their firmware should not have that limitation.To test random and sequential read/write speed, use CrystalDiskMark, also free. Run the full suite; it won't take long. CrystalDiskMark requires that the card be formatted, and the most reliable way to do that is to use the free tool from sdcard dot org. A 32 GB card will may report 39.9 GB before formatting and 29.8 GB after; don't worry, you haven't been ripped off.Unfortunately, there's no easy way to read the manufacturer's ID off the SD card, even in Linux, to determine who actually made the card, because you have to have the card connected directly to a motherboard; an SD-to-USB adapter won't work because it doesn't pass through disk data, and that's what's in nearly all computers. But what do you care, so long as the card's as big and fast as claimed?Now, what about the Transcend 32 GB SDHC C10 card?

The other speeds aren't too shabby, either. There's no way that this card is too slow for a contemporary camera, still or video, that is functioning and designed properly.Also on Amazon for a very attractive price is a Sony 32 MB SD card. Here are the full CrystalDiskMark test results for it:Sony 32 GB SDHS USH-ISequential Read : 19.998 MB/sSequential Write : 14.115 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 19.772 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 13.173 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.682 MB/s [ 899.0 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 2.302 MB/s [ 561.9 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 4.517 MB/s [ 1102.8 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 2.323 MB/s [ 567.0 IOPS]So the Sony is slightly faster, 40% over spec, on its sequential write. H2testw also reported full capacity and no errors for this card, so they are both top notch (The Sony doesn't come with a little case and the case for the Transcend case is about twice as big as it needs to be and so won't fit in the little pockets in a modern camera bag. Big deals.)Just for reference, here are the results for a contemporary USB thumb drive:SanDisk Ultra 32 GB USB thumb driveSequential Read : 22.508 MB/sSequential Write : 7.985 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 22.365 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 1.767 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.719 MB/s [ 908.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 0.520 MB/s [ 126.9 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 3.871 MB/s [ 945.0 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 0.482 MB/s [ 117.7 IOPS]As you can see, this USB drive is faster than the SD cards for reading, such as for playing music, running software, or looking up data, which shows that it is nicely optimized for its intended functions.As an aside, anyone who thinks they have lost data on an SD card can recover pictures using the free tool at z-a-recovery or recover everything(!) with the free PhotoRec tools.So, if people want to whine about these SD cards in their particular cameras, they should run these simple, free tests and reach their own conclusions about whether the cards are ""too slow."" The cards test above spec objectively. And they both work flawlessly on my still (not Canon) and video cameras.

H2testw also reported full capacity and no errors for this card, so they are both top notch (The Sony doesn't come with a little case and the case for the Transcend case is about twice as big as it needs to be and so won't fit in the little pockets in a modern camera bag. Big deals.)Just for reference, here are the results for a contemporary USB thumb drive:SanDisk Ultra 32 GB USB thumb drive  Sequential Read :  22.508 MB/s  Sequential Write :  7.985 MB/s  Random Read 512KB :  22.365 MB/s  Random Write 512KB :  1.767 MB/s  Random Read 4KB (QD=1) :  3.719 MB/s [  908.1 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  0.520 MB/s [  126.9 IOPS]  Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  3.871 MB/s [  945.0 IOPS]  Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  0.482 MB/s [  117.7 IOPS]As you can see, this USB drive is faster than the SD cards for reading, such as playing music, running software, or looking up data, which shows that it is nicely optimized for its intended functions.As an aside, anyone who thinks they have lost data on an SD card can recover pictures using the free tool at z-a-recovery or recover everything(!) with the free PhotoRec tools.So, if people want to whine about these SD cards in their particular cameras, they should run these simple, free tests and reach their own conclusions about whether the cards are ""too slow."" The cards test above spec objectively. And they both work flawlessly on my still (not Canon) and video cameras. I think they have gotten a bad rap here from people who don't have the full picture, so to speak.I'll also post this as a review, and on the Sony 32 GB page, too. I hope you found it informative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BXZLCNCD41YW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VNKNF0#wasThisHelpful","R2BXZLCNCD41YW","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally wrote this review on the Barrons SAT Vocabulary Flash Cards, but it's really a review that I hope anyone looking to build their vocabulary might find useful, so I thought I'd copy it here. It covers the American Heritage books and other resources...The Barrons flash cards fall far from what they could, or should, be. The good part is that they are flash cards. I prefer cards to books because they are easy to carry, easy to select the words you have mastered and set those aside to work on the others, and easy to randomize. The size is right and the paper weight is adequate to hold up until the cards have been learned.But the main content is poor. The selection of words seems weak, but I can't be sure. You may discard a hundred right away, but then you'll still have 400. The syllabications and pronunciations are often non-standard. For example, Barrons breaks ""articulate"" as ahr TI kye let (The I should be marked short and the e's should be the upside-down e schwa symbol that indicates a minimally stressed vowel; capitalization indicates the stressed syllable.). The American Heritage Dictionary, which I consider to be the best, treats ""articulate"" as ar*tic'*u*late, ar-tik'-ye-lit, where the i's are marked short and the e is the schwa. This poor treatment goes on and on so much that it becomes annoying and unhelpful. So does the frequent use of the schwa; you end up mumbling the words instead of pronouncing them articulately. Barrons seems to use the pronunciation style and symbols of American Heritage Dictionary (called AHD), but not quite.The definitions are where Barrons really falls short. The definitions are often too terse, sometimes just synonyms and not always good ones; different meanings are separated by semicolons, but sometimes different uses of words, as, say, noun and adjective, are not mentioned at all. Sometimes not all of a word's several meanings are given. The definitions are the sort that a high school student might memorize without really understanding how the word is best used, because they fail to convey nuance that true understanding of the word requires. The example sentences often seem as though inelegantly written by a high school student -- the word just stuck in some sentence with no enrichment of its meaning or usage. And the synonyms are weak. In one case I noticed, ""rant"" is given as a synonym of ""tirade,"" but ""tirade"" is not given as a synonym of ""rant"" but ""storm"" is.My recommendations for really learning new words include the ""100 Words Every High School Graduate Should Know,"" and ""100 More ..."" By American Heritage Dictionary. The words are well-chosen and include a few technical or scientific words. They give syllabications that seem more standard, followed by the AHD pronunciation guide, so you can really see how to pronounce the words correctly and overcome schwa uncertainty. Following that is a fuller description of the words' usage, such as ""noun,"" or ""transitive verb."" If the plural is tricky, it is listed next. Then an elegant meaning or meanings, which are numbered if they are significantly different. Then the word is used in a sentence, often from a notable person. The etymology is often given, which I find makes words more memorable and their definitions more nuanced, so you can use them with confidence. And for most words, related words are listed along with their part of speech.I also recommend Grammar Girl's ""101 Words Every High School Graduate Needs to Know."" Her definitions are really great; they are high on nuance and often blend in etymology, so you really understand the subtitles of a word's usage. Her word selection comes up with elegant words, but which are a little more down-to-earth. Her example sentences are often lengthy, from notables, and amusing. Fogarty really delivers a rich understanding of what each word means, and her writing, as always, is a pleasure to read. But there is no pronunciation or syllabication guide, and, surprisingly, all the words are capitalized.The problem with these books is they aren't as well-suited to drill as are flash cards, and the words are permanently alphabetized. You could, I suppose, insert a piece of paper at random, and lower it to reveal the word but not its definition; that would sorta make the books into flash cards. For that amount of work you'd come away with a much better understanding of the words you should have mastered before entering college.There are other ways to learn new words on line, for free. FreeRice and SparkNotes prompt SAT words with multiple choice synonyms and vocabulary dot com has many lists, including AHD's high school 100, as does esldesk. Vocabulary dot com will track your progress and learn what words you know and should know. Quizlet has lots of virtual flash cards, though the definitions are unvetted. You can even find AHD's several lists of words on the Houghton Mifflin web site and then look them up in their online dictionary. But nothing beats a fistful of the real thing.

"OK, it's a cheap medicine cabinet. But it's not as bad as the reviews indicate. So long as the assembly was done correctly, it does the job and it looks OK. It goes in a standard=size wall opening, and it really should be installed in a recess. Be gentle when you mount it. It's plastic, but that means it's rustproof and easily cleaned.The reviewer who mentioned that the paint came off the trim should have known that he was looking at a protective plastic film intended to be removed after installation. The mirror frame is chrome-looking stainless steel and its unobtrusive -- no more so than an edge bevel. I buffed the edging with a Scotchbrite pad to make it look like brushed stainless to better match the brushed nickel elsewhere in my bathroom and it looks fine.And by the way, Home Depot has the same medicine cabinet for $25, so go have a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWNTTE3G2J2JQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BPNMM2#wasThisHelpful","RWNTTE3G2J2JQ","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This might be a fine book for a mathematician who likes algebra textbooks, but it will be daunting for students. It is mostly proof-type lessons with few examples and little step-by-step pedagogy. There are few word problems; in fact, there are few problems overall. Pretty dry stuff. If you're looking for challenging algebra with a high standard of instruction, I'd recommend the books from Art of Problem Solving. They have a reasonable number of problems that increase in difficulty. Plus they have free online lessons that match the books' progress.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QP6MJ6SH6LTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0817636773#wasThisHelpful","R3QP6MJ6SH6LTT","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Benzethonium chloride antiseptic in StaphAseptic is the modern, preferred ingredient, the same that is used in operating rooms in preference to povidone iodine. It works on bacteria, viri, and fungi, and it is non-alergenic, compared to drug store antibacterials. StaphAseptic also contains Lidocaine, a pain killer. Unfortunately, it also contains tea tree oil, so it has a pronounced smell. It's claimed to be a gel, but it's more like a salve or grease.The problem with StaphAseptic is that it comes in 2 oz tubes, far too much for a backpacking or biking first aid kit. These single-use, trial packs are a great solution; plenty for field first aid. The problem with them is their high cost, especially after shipping costs, but I just shrugged it off and figured they would be used in emergencies only, and I'll use the tube version for normal use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWGQNKYBNAI4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TBWIJY#wasThisHelpful","RWGQNKYBNAI4O","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm comparing these to the similar Chicago Cutlery scissors that cost about ten bucks. These are better for my large hands, with larger openings, and the handles have grippy co-molded interiors that feel nice. Their hinge has adjustable tension, rather than being fixed. They are made of thicker metal (.115 inch compared to .092), and their toothed grippers are stamped to make them align rather than remain offset as the downmarket CC scissors are. In their favor, the Chicago Cutlery scissors have slight serrations on one blade and a notch that makes cutting things like rose stems much easier; the Faberware scissors have plain blades that are a bit beefier. Both scissors are fine, but overall the Farberware 4-in-1 Ultimate Shears just have a better fit and feel and are worth the higher cost for something I use every day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UM4IHIWY1QAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EJ3W8C#wasThisHelpful","R2UM4IHIWY1QAI","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used to think that Rusczyk's *Algebra* was the best math text I had ever read. That was until *Prealgebra* came out last summer. Wow! It's brilliant!*Algebra* was written just right for a (very sharp) high school mind. *Prealgebra* is perfectly dialed in to the (better be very sharp) middle school mind. The book is very challenging. It teaches with the most scientifically-proven effective technique there is: worked examples. There's almost nothing else. No photos, no cartoons, no distractions of any kind (cognitive load theory explains that these reduce learning). Just very straightforward working through of examples and a few bullet points. There are actually very few problems, and certainly not page after page of work sheets. And the problems themselves (most are word problems) are mind stretching. Then you move on.I doubt if this book could be a text for a middle school class; the teaching would be too challenging (you definitely want to get the Solutions Manual, if only to see how the authors solve the problems). But for a kid who finds math boring, this will present all the challenge and engagement you could ask for. I suspect that it will take more than a school year to go through it, because it is so thorough. I use it with a small group of PG tweens (IQ > 145) and it is perfect for them after finishing Singapore Math 6A/B. They find it challenging and rewarding, insightful, engaging, and doesn't talk down to them. They know it's hard, but it's fun hard, and it's never boring.I should mention: there are free step-by-step videos on the Art of Problem Solving dot com web site where Rusczyk teaches each point. You can go back and replay parts, stop the video, etc. I don't use them, because I find interacting with each of my students personally and addressing their issues individually works better. (My daughter snidely remarked on one: ""He's doing it the hard way."") But I can certainly see how a parent would be happy to turn their math whiz over to the master himself. Find him on YouTube too.This book will build a solid foundation for discrete math and combinatorics, sadly lacking in math education these days. I have but a single criticism: many times a problem could be solved using a pair of simultaneous linear equations but instead a more convoluted method is suggested. I suppose there's a reason for that. I'll have to ask Rusczyk the next time I see him -- after thanking him profusely for this fantastic text.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XOMUYURMW5P7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934124214#wasThisHelpful","R1XOMUYURMW5P7","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This resistor assortment is a great offering -- except for one big thing: they are actually 1% resistors. This means that they are 5-band resistors (color bands, indicating their value). That means that the third band is always black (0) and the fourth band is one color less than you'd expect in the usual third band, and the 5th band (tolerance) is black instead of gold so it isn't readily apparent which end is which, and that means they are MUCH harder to read than customary 4-band resistors. It makes them a real PITA to read, even if you're familiar with the color code. You'll hate 'em. I hate 'em.Joe, if you are listening, here's my suggestion: First, eliminate the useless 0-ohm resistors (jumpers); wire works well enough for that. I suspect you're just padding your offering.Second, supply quality 5% (4-band) resistors, such as R-Ohm. Good production processes mean that quality carbon film 5% resistors actually run about 2% or better. There's no reason to use 1% unless you need tin oxide resistors for low noise in sensitive circuits. And I suspect these ain't tin oxide (but if they are you should say so). If a source of 5% carbon film resistors doesn't actually run 2%, then you should expect other problems as well, such as poor bonding of end caps, poor plating of the steel leads, and poor scoring of the carbon film and thus random hot spot failures.Finally, you can't simply measure resistors with a VOM. You need an instrument, such as a bridge, to test resistors, and you need some statistics to really determine how many resistors you must measure and what the resulting tolerance actually is, based on your measurements. Simply providing 1% resistors is a lame solution to quality control problems and poorly serves your customers.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IETFCX4JJBYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UC4FSS#wasThisHelpful","R2IETFCX4JJBYB","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this drive to replace another that failed. I back up my wife's system using xxclone, a free application that clones an entire disk, warts and all. You can either clone disk A to disk B then run off B while keeping A as a backup, or run off A and keep B as a backup until you clone again. The clone disk is a complete, bootable replacement for the original disk (except that Windows could possibly and unhelpfully complain. In my experience, changing only the disk but not the disk ID, a feature of xxclone, is tolerated by Windows XP Pro.) I would think that Microsoft could now send out an update to XP systems that would allow easy clone backup of XP systems, seeing as how they have since gone through Vista (with great pain) and 7, but they seem to want to perpetuate the pain of backing up an entire hard drive in case it fails totally -- which seems to be the common mode. They want you to re-install every app and every update -- not customer friendly at all.Sure, the disk is old school, and so is my wife's computer, but it functions well enough for email and occasional word processing. Still, there are things on her computer that would be a pain to lose. Solution: clone the disk to another IDE disk using xxclone every few months.Having used Linux/Ubuntu on other systems, I'll never buy another Microsoft or Apple system again; most people would never notice the difference except for the lack of headaches and cost. But for now, it's great to have available a quality hard drive to back up a legacy computer -- at least until the motherboard fails.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ6AXLCD3FZP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VRZ7PA#wasThisHelpful","RQ6AXLCD3FZP6","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This hood fits the 18-200 mm lens better than the Nikon HB-35 original and it might even be a bit sturdier.

"This is a bit strange. The product comes in an envelope with no case, no instructions, no batteries -- nothing but a bubble wrap sleeve.

"This stopwatch probably uses the same microchip that most of the others use, as its functions seem to be identical. In other words, some functions like the alarm are so obscure that they are likely seldom used (I haven't figured out how to shut off the hourly beep that I somehow turned on). But the main functions are what you'd want. The display is large enough to be visible without readers, and the push buttons have a nice, firm, positive feel. Not bad.The case is screwed together and has a serpentine rubber gasket. What about the push buttons, you might ask, wouldn't they leak? They appear to have tiny, little O-rings around them. So the whole thing might actually be water resistant.Improvements?

"You want a high-nitrogen fertilizer to encourage the growth of foliage as plants are developing, and for growing plants that are only foliage such as herbs and leafy vegetables. But when blossoms appear and fruit sets, you want to switch to a low-nitrogen fertilizer to shift growth from leaves to fruit. You should keep on delivering water soluble trace minerals. This fertilizer is what you need in a low-nitrogen fertilizer and it contains trace minerals, too. Just don't over-do it.

"This book comes off as a write up of Google searches. It contains lots of interesting factiods, to be sure, and on the whole is worth the price, but it's neither a chemistry course nor a cooking course nor -- what you'd hope for -- a braiding of the two.It's not a biochem course, not even a lightweight one, as it doesn't build from first principals -- it just throws out whatever chemistry facts happen to pop up, some times at a basic level and sometimes at a very deep level -- too deep, I'd think, for most cooks. Neither is it a cooking/baking course (it mixes both), as again it doesn't build up an understanding from basic principals. So you get a chemistry fact, sometimes paired with a curious fact about cooking or baking. Then off to the next fact. Fortunately, it has a table of contents and a good index, so at least you can find the tidbits you might be looking for. Many times they are interesting, but not always.My degrees are in chemistry and I consider myself reasonable well read when it comes to gastronomy, so I enjoyed the book and read it completely. But I think if I were someone expecting to be lead through an understanding of basic food chemistry and simultaneously basic cooking/baking I would have been confused and disappointed. You'd come away with some facts, but I don't think you'd come away with an understanding of the chemistry of cooking or baking, and I don't think you'd become a better cook (or chemist).","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11BHWQQV3ZP02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1569767068#wasThisHelpful","R11BHWQQV3ZP02","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a fan of Dr. Dawkins, but this book is a sorry mish-mash. It strikes me that he (or more likely someone else) wrote it by covering Post-It notes with his favorite invectives against religion, and then printing out various Google searches, and then pasting it all together and calling it a book. It has no structure, it has no development, it has no plot to be sure. Just a laundry list of silly beliefs and lame counters of weak ""reality."" More like reality TV. He never really explains ""how we know what we know."" It just comes off as ""my claims are better than their claims.""There's no new insight here (no insight at all, actually), just a thinly veiled attack on foolish things that believers believe.

"I've used Dexter knives since I was s short order cook in college, a very long time ago. They are great. They stay sharp, can be dumped in a powerful commercial dish washer, and they are light weight, so they are easy to use for long periods. I can't imagine using a heavy, cast ""chef's"" knife. Plus, in normal use a cook's knife gets sharpened so often that they only last a few months. Knives must be affordable, and this one is. The blade is nice and wide, too, so you can use it as a spatula rather than reaching for another tool. The fact that they are NSF-rated means that they can be sanitized in a dishwasher, whereas those wooden handled ""chef's"" knives have too many places for bacteria to hide, so they aren't NSF approved. The grip is easy to hold with wet or oily hands, and makes it easy to control the knife.Forget the Henkle, etc, skinny, heavy, impressive looking ""chef's"" knives and get the real deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGNWAOBW2VNUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015R9W2O#wasThisHelpful","RGNWAOBW2VNUT","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This unit is well-priced and has a good feature set. It switches easily from F to C, shows High, current Hold, and Lowest temps, has a weak LED back light of the readout, and shuts off automatically after a several seconds.No general purpose IR thermometer will be highly accurate, as they depend on the emissivity of the surface they are measuring. This is easy to see if you take a heat reservoir, such as a bucket of water, and measure a black patch on it vs a white patch, vs the actual temp of the water from a real thermometer. IR thermometers are calibrated to read a ""typical"" surface, whatever that is. Your skin, which is much cooler than your internal temp, would be a silly test, as would be a black body source, which aren't common in the real world. My La Crosse IR-101 is calibrated for a surface emissivity of .95 (a dark, non-reflective surface) and compensates for room temperature. It typically reads a few degrees low compared to a dial-type surface thermometer.

Although it comes calibrated in firmware, should you ever need to recalibrate it, you'll need 1 kg and 2 kg calibration weights (!); don't lose the instruction ""manual.""

"The Reading and Writing Sourcebook series is really excellent. The authors understand how to attract the learning mind. They offer many entry points into the skills of reading and writing, even providing lines alongside the reading text and encouraging students to write notes or draw pictures. Even to write or draw in the text! The colorful illustrations are part of the lessons. In each lesson (of 16, say) there is a well-chosen excerpt to read and think about. There are exercises to get the student ready for the writing challenge, and there's a vocabulary building exercise. Then there's a short writing prompt eventually touching on all types of writing, including poetry.These books would be perfect for home schooling or to put some substance in the lameness that passes for learning to read and write in most schools. Students can work through the lessons on their own; there's no need to teach. These books turned my daughter from a reluctant writer to a confident, expressive writer who looks forward to the next lesson. I have recommended these books to other parents and teachers to universal acclaim. I'm mystified as to why they are not better known or available from Amazon.

"This is a reference book that examines many issues in sports nutrition from technical standpoints. And it covers a lot of ground, including comments on young and older athletes, female athletes, team and endurance athletes, and so on. It isn't a how-to book that offers a few simple instructions, but unlike such books, it steers clear of fads and hocus pocus.But I wonder about how accurate it is. In some areas where I have expertise, it misses the mark. On hydration for endurance athletes it fails to challenge the marketing spewed out by the Gatorade Sports Science Institute. Admittedly, that's a challenge, but the real science needs to be disseminated to a popular audience. And Dr. Benardot is probably writing before the awareness became widespread that fructose is causing our epidemic of metabolic syndrome. If you take fructose out of sports drinks (remember: athletes in training drink A LOT), and recognize that sucrose (table sugar) is metabolically equivalent to high fructose corn syrup, you're not left with a lot of recipe options: just glucose and maltodextrin for carbohydrate. Ultra-endurance athletes have discovered the WHO oral rehydration salts (ORS) packets; they make pretty close to the optimum sports drink -- except that they taste too salty and not sweet enough for most folks or for commercial success. Benardot fails to mention ORS, that it is the closest thing to ideal hydration in terms of sodium, glucose, and osmolarity, or that the many commercial sports drinks fail to deliver what unbiased science has found to be optimal. (ORS is a fraction of the cost of Gatorade, too.)On another point, briefly, Benardot discusses the effects of altitude, but he fails to deliver the punch line: live high, train low. Live high so your body will produce more RBCs and other adaptations to hypoxia. Train low to give your body plenty of oxygen to permit maximal stress to your system before you return to altitude for recovery and rest. Muscle, including heart muscle, grows mainly during recovery, not during exercise.The book also fails to deliver the latest recommendations on vitamin D supplementation. And I found other points on which he could have done a better job.So if the book didn't nail these topics, I suspect there are others. But if you want to do better and dig deeper, you'll probably have to read research papers, and that will cut into your training time :-). Otherwise, this encyclopedic overview of nutrition for athletes is the best technical reference and broad collection of wisdom that I'm aware of.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20IV9TPA71PMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0736059415#wasThisHelpful","R20IV9TPA71PMX","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing works well on flattened carpenters pencils. The blade is curved and sharp; the body has a rotating holder to position flat carpenters pencils. This all works well. It replaces the similar CH Hanson sharpener, which is no longer available. The new Hanson has a straight blade that isn't sharp, so it rips instead of carves, and no positioning provision for flattened pencils, just a round hole.One star off because mine arrived with some small pieces broken (still works), and because it doesn't work on ordinary, round, fat pencils -- the curved blade makes the point too long. Also, the tiny screws that hold the blade weren't tight and they seem prone to stripping.

"I agree with the other positive reviews. This multimeter has a very nice feature set and seemingly good build quality -- certainly for the price. Just for fun, I compared its accuracy against my spendy Fluke ScopeMeter. On DCV they were essentially identical (+/- last digit), except on the Sinometer's handy battery test modes, which slightly load three common battery types to get a meaningful reading; there the Sinometer was about 4% high (?, but insignificant). On Ohms, the two meters were within 1% over various ranges. On ACV, the Sinometer was less than 1% high, compared to the Fluke's true-rms reading. However, I found that the 8221 measured a close-to-correct low voltage VAC reading but was about 5% high on its own mVAC range, for the same signal (? again). Only the included temp probe was a bit disappointing. I compared it to a lab standard mercury thermometer and found that at 37C the Sinometer was showing about 4 degrees low, just barely within its specs; this isn't surprising, as a type-K thermocouple puts out only a few millivolts at that temperature and Class II thermocouples vary several degrees anyhow. Although I bought it as a beater-meter, the Sinometer MS8221 has earned my respect. The only negatives are just-OK leads and no case (so I'm using a Fluke multimeter case, which costs as much as the Sinometer, because the old Fluke cost way too much to get repaired and the Sinometer has better features).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NDGHKMG1AMJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006GD9Z6#wasThisHelpful","R2NDGHKMG1AMJ4","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product (Hedlin in the UK) is a 4% dimethicone (dimeticone) solution. There is considerable misinformation on such products because they work in a novel manner. Lice can hold their breath and hang tightly to hairs when immersed in water or shampoo (called their ""immersion reaction""). As soon as the water is removed, the lice become active again. LiceMD and Hedlin coat the lice with silicone and kill them not by suffocation or dehydration but by causing continuing physiological stress. You can find a scientific article about this in BMC Pharmacology by searching for: ""The mode of action of dimeticone 4% lotion against head lice, Pediculus capitis."" [...]So, NO, LiceMD contains no pesticides. Anyway, lice have become resistant to the usual permethrin/pyrethrum neurotoxic agents in over-the-counter lice shampoos (Nix, Rid, or A-200), and strong malathion shampoo is an Rx.And YES, LiceMD does indeed kill head lice. It also makes it easier to comb out live or dead lice and nits. Nits can also be removed with vinegar and a nit comb. Some schools have a zero nit policy.But NO, LiceMD does not kill lice eggs, only hatched lice, so it must be repeated according to instructions.BTW, head lice can only live a couple of days without feeding, so the best way to rid your house might be to take a vacation. Lice eggs are laid only on hair shafts and can only develop in warmth close to the scalp; they will die in about a week otherwise. Human head lice can't live on pets or anywhere but your scalp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35DCPJTRFLOY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010Y5EV0#wasThisHelpful","R35DCPJTRFLOY1","A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E9ADLJXIG7XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far, I really like it!  It's quite a bit larger than I expected.  I just got it set up a few days ago. Chicken that I am, I asked a friend to help me before I even took it out of the box.  It holds more paper in one filling than any other printer I've owned,  Best part is that I can fast-print multiple 2-sided copies.  It would work very well for anyone with a small office.  It also functions as a fax, but I don't have a land line phone, so I don't use that feature.  My main reason for wanting this particular model is that I make up games and puzzles for kids that I work with, and this works fast and efficiently with color or black only.  I don't have to stand there and keep feeding and/or turning sheets over one at a time and wait for each one to print out before going to the next one.

"As an adjunct, and not a regular classroom teacher, I generally work with each student on a one-to-one basis.  This is helpful for many reasons., but the point here is that I need some of the same information as the regular teachers, which is why I wanted this teacher's version of the book mentioned.  If the classroom teacher's is unclear to the student, I can individualize and find other ways to explain the same material.  It often helps just to hear the same information in a different way.  By using the text, I can find variants for the descriptions, including, when appropriate, examples for illustration. The idea is to help the student stay on the same page as the rest of the class.  For these reasons, I like to have the classroom teacher's version as a base. Without it, my  own explanations might be over- or under-simplified, or even far outside where the student should be.  I  rarely have the opportunity to discuss ideas with the classroom teachers before working with the students.

"I use all kinds of nuts in many different ways in my vegetarian diet.  I use them raw to make nondairy milk or cream, and to make up nutty health bars.  I add them to soups, as well.

"I could not find these locally, but of course, I did find them on amazon.com!  Raw seeds are flexible.  Most of the time, I  just eat them raw, because I'm on a salt-restricted diet.  On the rare occasions I want them roasted, I can do that wihout adding any salt.  When making them up for guests, I can add sea salt before roasting.  That's what I mean by ""flexible"".  Raw seeds can be kept  refrigerated for 1-2 months in a tightly sealed container without loss of flavor, but frozen can be kept for a year.Not only are they flexible, but they are outstandingly good!  I use them a lot in vegetable salads, but sometimes I just eat a handful or two as a light snack. If you want to dry roast your own, here's how I do it: Heat oven to its lowest temperature(160-170 degrees F.  Spread seeds in a single layer on a cookie sheet and roast for 15-20 minutes.  Higher temperature will cause break down of fats, creating free radicals you don't want.

"I've been using #2 pencils for awhile, and it seems I make a lot of trips to the pencil sharpener.  I don't have one on my desk, because it needs to be accessible to many others.  It finally occurred to me that a slightly harder lead would cut down on those trips. Duh!It was a good move.  It's still soft enough to use on all kinds of paper and my time spent sharpening pencils has been cut down considerably.

"I have a couple of these Brother WorkSmart printers in our house. Got tired of the kids printing to MINE, this one was a great option for them.  Compact size, very easy to set up and connect wirelessly from their laptops and ipads.  Print quality and speed are good enough.I don't really have any use for this ability to print from evernote or dropbox or whatever.  That seems a little ""meh"" to me, not really sure why its necessary.  But the overall functionality of the printer is solid so OK.You should know when you buy a printer that the cartridges that come with it are usually on the light side and you'll be buying ink soon.  One thing I like about the Brother printers is that you can definitely find less expensive cartridge options when it is time replace.Brother has a good iphone app available if you want to print from your phone.Lastly, I'll add that I used to use HP printers but the amount of software, etc; that they would require to install on you computer really turned me off. Huge pain everytime I switched computers or had to allow a new computer to print.

I don't think you'd pay that much for a pack of five Lindt chocolate bars.Anyway, this part is just personal taste.  I actually really like the Hershey's Dark Chocolate almond bars a lot.  Just not a huge fan of the milk chocolate.A bigger issue is how they arrived.  I've attached a photo of my five melted chocolate bars and how they looked.  Appetizing right?  I opened the box and wondered why the bars didn't take up the entire box and why they seemed to be in a weird shape.  Apparently UPS delivery in August is just not a good option.  Luckily as you can see this is a Vine review of a free product so no harm no foul.Box would make a nice gift for someone who you KNOW is a fan of these bars I believe.

"Very cool and fun bracelet making kit for girls.  My nine year old daughter had no problems getting started on making bracelets with the kit  The spinning loom was easy for her to use, but also not *so* easy that it would take away the fun.  I really enjoyed watching her solve certain problems of how much string to use, how best to line the strands up, etc; and to see her get better with each attempt.  She made bracelets for all of her sisters and a few friends as well.The loom is well constructed and not a huge piece of equipment that you'll have lying around the house forever.  The kit comes with a ton of string, so your little one will get plenty of repeat use from the kit.We had a small issue with the string sometimes slipping off the back hook when she started spinning.

"Really well written, good story and quite touching.  I find memoirs largely hit or miss and mostly avoid them, but this one caught my attention and I'm glad I gave it a shot.  Gus Lee provides a really unique book and his writing is top notch.  Funny, thoughtful and just a lot of fun to read.  If you're like me and had experience with USMA, you will definitely appreciate Lee's thoughts on West Point.  Better yet, if you've never been to West Point and know nothing about life there, I think those readers will get a vivid picture of the place and life.Gen. Schwarzkopf was a larger than life figure for those of us who served in the 90s.  Its pretty amazing to get this part of his story from a third party.

"Very impressed with this Sony Handycam.  Its been a good ten years since I last bought a video camera shortly before our youngest child was born.  So seeing how small and light this unit is, not to mention to low price for the quality is pretty amazing.  The unit fits easily in one hand and stores compactly in the (recommended and sold separately) Sony carrying case.Setup and use are a piece of cake and very intuitive.  No issues at all.  The viewfinder is nice and big, flips around to various positions as you need.  I really like that a small USB is attached to the camera and tucks away so you're never left stranded for connectivity.  The zoom function and quality is pretty amazing.  I stood on a beach and zoomed in on a lighthouse across the harbor.  Picture quality from that shot was impressive.One of the features I was most excited about was the bluetooth connectivity with an app on my iphone.  I was hoping to use the camera to videotape kids' soccer games on an extended pole.  That's very difficult once the camera is elevated.  With the app, you can control the camera and actually see the video directly on your phone (or ipad or whatever).  Very very cool.I'm sure other more serious videographers may have more technical comments.  For me personally, I was interested in filming kids, vacations, soccer games and the usual family events.  For a while I thought my iphone was good enough for that use, but there's just no comparing the quality of the video here.  Fortunately the small size and light weight of this unit makes it nearly as convenient as your phone to carry around for those purposes.  If you have similar needs, I would definitely recommend taking a look at this handycam.I hope my review was helpful and please feel free to ask any more detailed questions, I would be happy to respond!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10XRAOBFFSTL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R5LHB0Y#wasThisHelpful","R10XRAOBFFSTL2","ACREHLVRC4H5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACREHLVRC4H5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not entirely surprised but DJ Molles finishes strong in wrapping up this series.  The whole thing was very entertaining and well written in my opinion.  I read a lot of different books and styles of books.  This series was the equivalent to me of watching a really good action flick.  Pass the popcorn!I was a little disappointed in the previous book, probably for leaving so many loose ends.  Fortunately we didn't have to wait long for EXTINCTION and the author wraps everything up in a satisfying way.  I have to say he did a great job of delivering the urgency and insanity of what is going on.  Captain Harden and his friends are racing against time and a horde of millions of infected and the wheels are flying off left and right.  It was really fun and action packed.  I also liked some of the internal struggles of these characters.  Molles puts in a good effort not just delivering on shoot em up action, but in thinking about some of the moral decisions these characters are forced to make, how they deal with them, and in some cases how they look for redemption.  I give the author a lot of credit for not going the paint by numbers route here.  Its not all happy endings and some of the Hollywood movie endings that one might expect never materialize.Book one of this series was a little raw, but like a lot of you I stuck with it and the series got better and better.  I will look forward to seeing what this author comes up with next.But... series ending???  Oh man!  There are still so many things that I want to know how they will turn out!Recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LBU2CSFFRQ2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316261645#wasThisHelpful","R1LBU2CSFFRQ2G","ACREHLVRC4H5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACREHLVRC4H5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoyed Bradstreet Gate.  The description of the book advertises it for fans of Donna Tartt, and I found that recommendation appropriate.  If you enjoyed the Goldfinch or Secret History, I think this one is worth taking a look at.Without re-summarizing the plot, I did want to point out that this isn't really a murder mystery.  I started the book thinking it was, but its not your typical murder mystery thriller.  The murder just provides the setting for more of a character driven story.  I still enjoyed the story, but just wanted to give fair warning if you're a mystery reader and interested in the book for that reason.Give it a shot!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H541CSV0VWR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139318#wasThisHelpful","R3H541CSV0VWR1","ACREHLVRC4H5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACREHLVRC4H5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes the reviews on Amazon really nail the way I feel about a book.  Like others I loved READY PLAYER ONE, and personally I was worried I was being overly critical of ARMADA or just missing the genius or something.  I really didn't expect Cline to write something as wonderful as RPO, but ARMADA just feels not only like a really big miss but like Cline didn't even try.The story was basically the plot of Iron Eagle mashed up with the Last Starfighter and regurgitated.  I was waiting to find out that the paint by numbers SF plot was some clever twist, but it really wasn't.  The lowest point for me was Zack immediately meeting the prototypical SF hacker dream girl in his space briefing and becoming romantically attached within a few minutes.  I nearly quit reading at that point.I kind of think Cline would have been better off avoiding a story like this in his follow up to RPO.  ARMADA feels unfortunately like schtick.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MN8ASFHZ6DWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804137250#wasThisHelpful","R1MN8ASFHZ6DWE","ACREHLVRC4H5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACREHLVRC4H5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like all of these Dove soaps for men.  Great scent and I don't smell like my wife after I use them.  This one is also nice in that you can use it on your face - I'm not usually able to wash my face with regular bars of soap.  Moisturizing and refreshing scent.And Amazon currently has this priced at $9.29.  That's about $1.16 per bar.  Not bad!

"I found Jonathan Weisman's debut novel imperfect, but well worth my time in reading.  For any of its faults, it was still a highly original story in my opinion.  I personally had no knowledge whatsoever of the history of Portugal or its involvement in Africa.  Setting the story and characters in that backdrop was very interesting and unique.I noticed before reading this book that it was being compared to Nick Hornby.  I understand the comparison, but I would say this is more of a ""RIYL"" comparison.  If you enjoyed any of Hornby's books, you might like this one.The back of the novel makes a big point of mentioning the Cocteau Twins and seems to play up the music to drum up interest.  I actually found the musical references weird.  I'm a fan of all the bands who get name dropped in here, but I didn't really understand why they were included or how it really fit into the story at all.  The fact that the narrator started listening to post-punk when he moved to the UK in the late 80s was kind of like.. ok?  I guess that fact alone would have been ok with setting the scene but there are these frequent digressions into mentioning the Cocteau Twins or J&MC or whoever that bugged me.  It felt more like trying to hit a target audience than actually adding to the story.Some of the relationships in the story seem to move too quickly.  Two characters suddenly break up.  Two other characters are suddenly soulmates.  The biggest one is how quickly David is suddenly a confessor to this family and a dear friend to Hans.  Its a good story, but that just seems to happen rather than being advanced through the narrative.Anyway, these were just some small criticisms.  Still one of the better books I've read this summer.  The build up to learn what happend to Hans and Joao is brilliantly executed and surprising.  Will keep you reading through the end.

"Smell is good and not overly strong.  Easy packaging for the kids to use.  You'll appreciate the 2in1 conditioner/shampoo if you're in a rush.  Its not the same as using those separately at all, but for a quick bath or shower night its a plus.  My children at 5,9, and 11 so didn't really have any issues with getting soap in the eyes or anything, probably more of an issue for younger kids.  Overall, not especially great or high quality shampoo, but affordable, everyday stuff for kids.The price on this six pack is currently $25.87.  That's $4.30 a bottle.  I just checked - you can buy this at Target today for $1.70 a bottle on sale from the usual $1.89 price.

"I love these Nike Rabid Sunglasses.  They're similar to the older TARJ model which I used to wear and lastest quite a while.  These are great sunglasses for active people.  The plastic is durable and flexible.  The arms have a good grip which will stay in place if you're running or on the move.  And for $70 or whatever you'll find them for, you won't be worrying about them as much as you might a pair of fancier glasses at twice the price.I'm a soccer coach and these are perfect for my needs.  Can throw them in the coaches' bag when I need them off my head.  They stay perched easily on my head when I need to lift them up to look players in the eyes.  I can leave them on while I'm demonstrating.  And of course, they keep the sun out of my eyes when I'm on the sidelines.I wish some of the sellers would be more clear with the Nike sunglasses and the sizing.  I've mistakenly bought the kids' sizes once or twice.

"Absolutely loved this book.  Hard to write that sentence as this is such a dark and disturbing novel, but I devoured it.This was my first Don Winslow book.  Picked it up because THE CARTEL looked interesting to me, so I thought I would check this one out first.  I'm a huge James Ellroy fan and Winslow's writing really reminded me a lot of what I love about Ellroy.  Not derivative or aping Ellroy by an means, but if you like Ellroy's books I think you'll enjoy this one for sure.I'm a little hesitant to actually recommend this book broadly to friends though.  Its a very gritty, violent and disturbing novel.  There's nothing gratuitous about it.  Winslow writes about how the narcotraficantes behave, how they deal with people and take revenge upon people, and he doesn't pull any punches with any of it.  So, fair warning to any prospective readers.The characters in the book are just outstanding.  Loved the well developed back stories with each of them.  Winslow does such a good job introducing each of the main characters at their younger ages, its really awesome to follow them on their paths to see how they are affected by the events in the story.I'm really looking forward to reading THE CARTEL now.  If anybody would care to comment on my review, I would be very interested to know from other readers if any of Winslow's other books are as good as this one.

"Very happy with this pre-workout mix.  I've been using a pre-workout drink regularly before hitting the gym the past year or two and appreciate the benefits.  I workout early in the morning too, so this is a big help getting an extra kick in the pants.  By the time I've driven over to the gym, I'm ready to go.  For the past year my go-to has been BPI Sports 1.M.R. Vortex Pre-Workout Powder (which I highly recommend as well), but I got a free tub of this and was eager to give it a shot.Fruit punch taste is great and mixes well.No jitters or stomach issues for me at all.  I'm a caffeine junkie though and as I said have been using pre-workout drinks for a while now.  If you're new to these products, I would warn you to expect that jittery feeling at first.  Definitely start with smaller mixes, see what you can handle and allow your body to adjust.  As good as the added energy feels going into your workout, its no fun to try to bench press while you have the shakes!Hard for me to comment on the nitrous/creatine claims.  I don't know.  hah.Bottom line for me personally, this mix delivered a good pre-workout energy shot that I was looking for.

"I've been using Philips over the ear sports headphones for years.  I buy them two or three at a time in case I lose them or they break.  I read a couple of the other reviews and I just haven't had any kind of similar experience with them.  When they've broken for me, its usually been because I've been using them for a while or left them in my pocket or something.  I listen mostly to books but some music as well in the gym and the sound quality has been fine.I really like this Action Fit model because you can swap the ear buds out.  My one complaint with the other model I've used is that my ears would get sore after wearing them too long.  This provides a very snug, comfortable fit that you can choose.  I don't personally like earbuds without the over the ear clip.  These things aren't going anywhere while I'm in the middle of working out.I'm sure there are probably better sounding ear buds if you want to spend $100 for Beats or whatever.  For sports use, I think these sound fine and are a really good option.

"WOW.  Wish I had used one of these when I first bought my iphone 5.  I've had the usual thin plastic stuff for the past two years.  Applied this new tech armor ballistic glass today while I was replacing a broken case.  Amazing!  Love the clear look and feel.  Installation was incredibly easy.  I will definitely buy these again in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ10ZHU77D0PF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BT8L2MW#wasThisHelpful","RQ10ZHU77D0PF","ACREHLVRC4H5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACREHLVRC4H5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very pleased with this purchase.  I've had the original black leather 5s case from Apple since I bought my phone, but it has recently cracked near the headphone jack which lead to some issues with the charger.  I wanted a thin, sturdy case to replace it.  Some protection but no bulky phone.  The Slim Armor case from Spigen seems to be exactly what I was looking for.The case was super easy to put on.  Fits the phone snugly.  Looks great.  If you're a butter fingers, be forewarned this isn't a ""grippy"" kind of case.  That wasn't really a big requirement for me.I applied a new Tech Armor ballistic glass screen protector to the phone before I put this case on.  The case works beautifully with that protector.  No issues at all.If you're looking for a case that retains some of the original beauty of the iPhone, has a slim profile and you don't need it to survive a four story fall, I would not hesitate to recommend this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T5JMQQKR9ULI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DD62R40#wasThisHelpful","R3T5JMQQKR9ULI","ACREHLVRC4H5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACREHLVRC4H5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've gone through numerous ink jet, scanning printers in our house.  This is just an altogether different kind of printer.  If you need something just prints quickly, reliably, easily and isn't going to be complaining about being out of paper or ink anytime soon, this is the business.Set up on the wireless network was a piece of cake.  The biggest plus for me though is the printing speed.  LOVE how quickly this stuff comes out, I'm not standing around in front of my printer anymore waiting for my print job.Its not huge, but be aware that its a bit bigger and heavier than other printers.  Highly recommended for your small business or home office.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q03C2M8Y2WC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S74JAHK#wasThisHelpful","R3Q03C2M8Y2WC6","ACREHLVRC4H5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACREHLVRC4H5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love the Magista Onda Turf.  I have the firm ground and indoor versions of these also and couldn't be happier with them.I normally wear a size 10, but bought 10.5 in this shoe.

"Wow, I could not be more impressed with the Electrolux 2-in-1 hand held. Its very simple set up right out of the box.  Charged it for 24 hours and it was ready to go.  Used as a stick vacuum it is very light and easy to use anywhere you need.  I've been mainly using mine for quick messes (my kids get field turf all over the house frequently changing out of their soccer cleats), but I'm 99% certain you could use this to vacuum an entire floor on one charge.  Its also a great option for stairs which are a hassle to vacuum.I'm really impressed by the power you get using this as a stick vacuum.  Wasn't really sure what to expect of that.  It has good suction and some sort of rollers in the head to easily clean up the carpets.The hand held piece detaches simply from the stick and is perfect for hard to reach messes and your car.  It comes with a small brush attachment to use for hard to reach areas and dusting.These battery powered devices have really come a long way.  I would not hesitate to recommend this particular vacuum at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T1JY7JC78H5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1P3WNE#wasThisHelpful","R3T1JY7JC78H5W","ACREHLVRC4H5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACREHLVRC4H5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hard to find anything to complain about with the Diono Cambria booster car seat.  I've gone through several different similar Graco car seats and thought they were all fine.  I have no problems with those Graco models at all.  This car seat is at least as good as any of those, and honestly probably a step up.  It has a more weighty, substantial feel to it.  Feels a little more padded and comfortable overall and at least from appearance gives the impression that it is providing more protection around your child.Set-up out of the box could not be simpler.  I'll compare again with the Graco models I've used which were fairly simple as well but required a few more steps to assemble.  The Diono Cambria is basically one step to hook the booster to the back.  Easy.  The latch system is equally easy to use.I love the latch system with these car seats.  Having used both with and without, I would highly recommend the added protection is worth whatever the additional $10-$20 cost is.The fold out cup holder and trays are easy to access and my child likes them.  Highly recommended car seat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EY2CCQ8Q1HM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISS2PCW#wasThisHelpful","R2EY2CCQ8Q1HM2","ACREHLVRC4H5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACREHLVRC4H5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works great!  I honestly have no idea if this Monster splitter works any better than the $3 splitters or not.  I needed to split my Verizon FIOS outlet to accommodate the DVR and the wireless router.  It was really important to me that both continue to work perfectly when I moved them to the same outlet, so I picked this splitter.  Very solid and well constructed and I've had no problems with FIOS since I made the change.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343T6EGRBRNTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00108UNEY#wasThisHelpful","R343T6EGRBRNTK","ACREHLVRC4H5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACREHLVRC4H5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm really impressed by this dehumidifier so far.  We've been using it for about three weeks now in our basement which has long been a problem area for us.  The difference in the basement in only a few days is frankly unbelievable.  That damp, musty smell and feel is just completely gone.  If I had known it was going to make such a difference I would have bought this years ago.  Kind of kicking myself now.As others have written, the setup is really simple.  I wish the manual was a little more clear on the buttons/usage.  It could use a little more detail on which settings to use and why.  But otherwise I got it up and running quickly.I haven't messed with the pump or hose options yet.  The bucket fills up for me after about a day and a half most of the time, and I've just emptied it myself hasn't really been a big issue.  Its pretty amazing though to empty the bucket and see the amount of moisture that has been pulled out of the air.  It is a bit noisy too, I guess.  I'll probably experiment some with placement of the unit for that reason.I expect I'll try to hook this up with the hose set up fairly soon.  If that goes well and I don't have any problems with the unit over the summer, I'm sure I'll update my review to five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VXJHF9JDU9TF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JE1KKVK#wasThisHelpful","R3VXJHF9JDU9TF","ACREHLVRC4H5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACREHLVRC4H5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got tired of those cheap made in China boots, that you get at the big box sporting goods stores, wearing out before the first set of laces broke. So I asked my Iron Worker buddy (one of those crazy guys who walks along exposed steel girders 80 floors off the ground), which boots go the distance in his work environment. Without hesitation he said ""Danners', but be sure to get the Made in USA product"", apparently Danner does sell some cheap made in China products, that are no better than the ones I was getting before. He said these boots last for 10 to 15 years, in one of the harshest work environments around.These are not cheap, so go to some trouble measuring your feet, and get the right size ... I typically wear an 11 D, I ordered 11 D, and they fit perfect. I've been wearing a black pair for almost a year now, this my second pair, they fit great, feel great, and are clearly well made.  I've put a lot of miles on my first pair, and if I clean them up, they look like I could have bought them last week, the Vibram soles will probably outlast me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LI7MGZOF7R7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002L4N0K#wasThisHelpful","R1LI7MGZOF7R7M","A3923UGIPX0QQM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3923UGIPX0QQM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Soft and fuzzy inside, thin layer of neoprene outside, lightweight and not a whole lot bigger than the device it's protecting ... unless you're going into a war zone, this is just the right amount of protection. Because it's stretchy, it grips the device inside, holding it in firmly, not so firmly that it's difficult to get out, but firmly enough that you can toss it across the room into your luggage, and expect it to stay put. I had one for my 3rd generation Kindle, for two years, before I gave it to a relative and bought a new Kindle. It's tough, it lasts, and does it's job. I have one for my new Kindle, and one for my tablet which is the same size as the Kindle Fire.I bought this one for a Dell XPS 15z (supposedly the exact same size as a MacBook Pro), and found that the width and thickness are perfect, but the length is just a bit too short.

"It's very difficult to find the original Panasonic batteries anymore, and when you do find them they cost a ridiculous amount of money, so I decided to try these.  Since I actually needed three, this package was a good deal.One battery indicated full charge, right out of the box.  This worried me at first, but it seems to be functioning quite well.

"It took me a while to get around to writing this review, because I use Linux exclusively, and I wanted to make sure I had all the kinks worked out before I talked about it.The first thing I did when I got this XPS 15Z, was to remove the Windows disk that came in it (without ever turning it on) and install a 120GB, high speed, low power, SSD for my Linux installation.  This was not a simple task, since this laptop is so small and thin, doing something as simple as swapping the hard disk, or replacing the battery, requires a somewhat complicated disassembly.  Fortunately, I found a guide on YouTube that pointed out all the pitfalls as you're going in.On the ""small and thin"" note ... it's really quite cool.  Thin, light weight, covered with an aluminum/titanium alloy that looks nice but might scratch, and still large enough to hold a 15"" full 1920x1080 native glass LED screen.  I like the look and feel of the back-lit keypad, but I'm not crazy about the glide-pad, but that's ok, since I use a Bluetooth mouse most of the time anyway.  I've seen many people knocking it because they say it looks like a Mac-book Pro., this may be true, and it does seem to have all the exact same I/O ports in the same locations, including the Mac ""Mini Display Connector"", but I don't care, I like it.This laptop (XPS 15Z), had one little quirk that threw me for a loop because I never had to deal with it before, but once I figured it out, I'm really quite happy with it.  That quirk is the ""Optimus"" system that manages the two different graphics adapters, the low power Intel GPU, and the high power nVidia GPU.  Many Linux users seek out systems with nVidia graphics, because nVidia likes Linux, and in previous systems, I simply set the BIOS to only use the nVidia GPU.  This laptop does not allow that option, forcing you to learn how to manage the Optimus hardware.  In a MS Windows system, virtually all of the applications have a profile file associated with it, and the OS passes part of the profile to Optimus, which determines if the high power nVidia GPU is needed.  In Linux, you have to use an application like ""Bumblebee"" to manage Optimus, and decide for yourself if the application you're using requires the nVidia GPU.  It's really quite simple to create a launcher that starts your favorite apps. with the nVidia GPU enabled, but you have to know that it needs to be done. Also, every high power 3D graphics app. that I've tried so far, will actually run with only the Intel GPU, just very slowly.Under minimal power conditions (display brightness at minimum, keyboard back-light off, WiFi and Bluetooth off, nothing plugged in to the USB ports, Ethernet cable plugged in, Intel GPU only), I get about 6 hrs. 20 mins. on the battery ... not bad.  An interesting side note, simply turning on the nVidia GPU cuts that down to about 40 mins., also the fan gets a little loud when nVidia is running full blast.Addendum:  We have a huge fire burning here in So. Cal., and power lines got knocked down this morning, so we had a lengthy power failure.  I kicked this laptop into low gear, connected it by tethering to my cell phone (which means WiFi), and I got over 7 hours of battery life with the WiFi turned on.  Apparently, WiFi uses less power than wired Ethernet on this machine.I've jumped through all the hoops to get this thing running perfectly under Linux (Fedora 18), so if you're considering this laptop as a Linux machine, and need some help, just ask.By the way, there are a few misprints, even contradictions, in Amazons' product description.  A couple of important notes that helped me decide to buy this machine are:  The nVidia GPU is a ""GeForce GT 540M"", and the native resolution of the glass is a full 1920 x 1080.For the geekier readers, here are a few numbers:glxgears with Intel GPU only:$ glxgearsRunning synchronized to the vertical refresh.

By the good reviews written by customers who expected to get a free bottle on the mail?As I have said before, the best form of CoQ10, the one that is easier to absorb, is the Ubiquinol form and this one is only the Ubiquinone form.

"This is one of t he main reasons that I looked for a Chinese doctor  and luckily found one with 30 years of experience who was a teacher and researcher in China for 20 years and published about six books, prior to moving to the US. I feel so blessed to have found him.Traditional Chinese Medicine is too complex and rich for someone not Chinese to thoroughly learn. While a non-Chinese acupuncturist can do a great job with a client, I am inclined to believe that a TCM doctor HAS TO be Chinese in order to master all the vast array of possibilities concerning both diagnosis and treatment.After I read this book, I understood why my Chinese TCM doctor seemed to look at me much more than he seemed to listen to what I was saying. Of course he looked at my tongue and checked my pulse on both arms, examined my nails and asked a few questions, But what really caught my attention was the way he looked at my face and observed my movements when I stood up and when I got off the table after the acupuncture session.I do not intend to practice face reading, not even on myself.

She told me that when she arrived in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, she was surprised to see that restaurants are not allowed to put salt shakers on the tables. When she asked the waiter the reason, the waiter kindly told her about a recent Law that bans the use of salt shakers on restaurant and schools.  The water also gave my friend a handout explaining the harmful effects of salt on our health, something all waiters are supposed to do to comply with the law. Should the customer want more salt he must ask the waiter. After such a courteous display of concern for public health, my friend refrained from requesting extra salt.By the way, my friend is now using NO salt on a regular basis.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39K4SL0JF14L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049IRCAA#wasThisHelpful","R39K4SL0JF14L","AWBMGLP57SAGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBMGLP57SAGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been juicing for over 8 years practically on a daily basis and this is the worst juicer I have had. This juicer splashes all over. Every time I use it, I have to wipe off juice and even pulp from the countertop. I bought this one a short time ago and have been calling Breville to get it repaired or exchanged. I have waited up to 40 minutes on the phone to no avail. Just music. Their website is malfunctioning. I have attempted to send a note to report the issue but once I am done entering all the info they want (even my age and sex) and I select to send the message, something goes wrong and the page disappears.I am appalled at how this lousy product can get so many 5 star reviews. I would not be complaining this much if, at least, I had been able to contact them.UPDATE: I finally could contact the company. In order for them to help me with my request, I was told I HAVE TO make a VIDEO of how I use the juicer. If I don't make a video of me using the juicer and send it to them, they will not proceed to help me in any way even though I only bought the machine less than 6 months ago.I will NOT make a video, and I will NEVER, EVER buy another Breville product again. My juicer will go in the trash as I don't want to continue using a juicer that covers my countertop with juice and pulp.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YBFMUOG5GI7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003R28HWQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YBFMUOG5GI7A","AWBMGLP57SAGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBMGLP57SAGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Louise Hay, have read two of her books and I have been using her CDs for well over 15 years. While this CD is as valuable as any of her other works, I would have loved it if Louise had paused for 2 or 3 seconds between each thought. Maybe it was the editor's decision, not that of Louise's herself, but I find the lack of pause really annoying. Another thing that I noticed is that she speaks fast, way faster than in any of her other CDs. Even though this is not a meditation CD, it would have been nice to be able to relax while listening to it. But since high speed is contrary to relaxation, there is no way to do so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ATJF0P91P1EX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401903967#wasThisHelpful","R2ATJF0P91P1EX","AWBMGLP57SAGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBMGLP57SAGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How typical of a conventional doctor to come up with a book to treat....what? Symptoms!Do conventional doctors ever care about the CAUSE? Does this doctor know or care about our ""digestive system""? Looks like she does not. This book only attempts to deal with the symptoms, and very little, if nothing, is said about our stomach, the huge job our stomach does every single day of our lives and what we can do to help our stomach get healthier.Treating the reflux is nothing but treating the consequence of an underlying problem. When our stomachs suffer, they react in different ways and we feel different symptoms, reflux being one of them. But, of course, I made the mistake to buy a book by a conventional money hungry doctor. It is my fault. I should have known better.On a side note, there are several contradictions. Some foods or spices that the doctor advices not to use are later included by the chef in the accompanying recipes.Most conventional western doctors only know how to treat symptoms and many of us have got used to thinking about our symptoms and not about the cause for such symptoms. We must also learn to treat our bodies as a whole.Is Acid Reflux a DISEASE? It appears it is nothing but the RESULT of other digestive problems, and in many cases the result of  toxic build-up. In this respect, I suggest reading a book by Cherie Calbom available here on Amazon: ""Juicing, Fasting and Detoxing for Life"".I have also found a short article that may shed some light on the issue. It begins by saying:{quote}You see them all the time: those ads for PrevAcid and similar products.  If you believe the marketing, acid reflux disease is pandemic, and the advent of acid-blocking medications is the salvation from this scourge.The problem is: Acid reflux is not a disease.  That notion was born in a pharmaceutical company's marketing department.  It's a symptom of some other problem.  Take care of that, and the acid reflux will go away.[end of quote]If interested, you may read the article here:http://www.health-essentials.info/anecdoTest/acidReflux.html","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I3DR32NSL07U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982708319#wasThisHelpful","R2I3DR32NSL07U","AWBMGLP57SAGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBMGLP57SAGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of our three dogs (7 1/2 years old) started to limp on a daily basis. Nothing seemed to help her. We tried Glucosamine and  Chondroitin, more Calcium, used a higher dose of multivitamins than what she was regularly having, but she continued to limp. Then I did a search and came across this product which, I also learnt, is commonly used by people with arthritis, ostheoarthritis, musculoskeletal problems and pain. Our dog started to improve only a few hours after we gave her the Yucca. On the second day, the improvement was more visible and on the third day, she was already playing and running. We will continue to give her this product on a regular basis and will also give it to our two other dogs who are about the same age. Next time we will try to get the Yucca in capsule form, which will certainly be much easier to administer. We only paid $12 dollars for the Yucca though now we see other sellers sell it for much more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38R1FLB0TQH6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJQ7VG6#wasThisHelpful","R38R1FLB0TQH6J","AWBMGLP57SAGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBMGLP57SAGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this software because I had to. I am a translator English-French-Spanish and must have all types of software available, otherwise I would have to reject translation jobs sent to me by different types of clients.This Microsoft Word 2013 is the worst software I have used in the last 18 years. The very first thing a translator must do is count the source words in the original document in order to give the client an accurate quote.  I had to go on Google, type ""how do you count words on MS 2013?"" in order learn all the ridiculous, messy steps one has to take to find out the word count.The first document I had to work on was a translation from English into French. Every three or four French words, the software would correct my French spelling into English spelling. It took me a long time to try to stop the software from correcting my spelling, but it still continues to turn every French word into what the software ""thinks"" should be an English word. Something that in previous MS versions, was a simple and easy task has now turned into a mess.Another problem is the time the software takes to save a document. I am currently working on a 48 page translation that contains about 10,500 words and, whenever I save my work, the software takes more than two minutes to save the document.

"Two years ago, I started reading about the Alexander Technique and completed three very good books by Richard Brennan. Three months ago, I decided to find a local Alexander Technique teacher and started taking classes. Along with my AT classes, I have continued to re-read my Alexander Technique books, fascinated by the sometimes elusive Alexander principles. Even though my AT teachers have talked with me about these,  there is obviously not enough time during a one- hour class to go deep into said principles, especially considering that teachers have to dedicate great part of the class to hands-on work. Recently a friend lent me this book. I had barely read a third of the book when I decided that I had to buy it. I feel like this book is talking to me, discussing with me all the AT principles that I often wonder about, those that I have been trying to understand more in depth. This book deals with everything that I had wanted to understand and it seems to have the ability to answer most of the questions that have been lingering in my head.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20XKRXICDB66J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I5E466#wasThisHelpful","R20XKRXICDB66J","AWBMGLP57SAGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBMGLP57SAGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted to get acquainted or learn a little about the Alexander technique. When I ordered this DVD I did not expect I would learn a lot, but I did think I was going to be able to receive some information in a clear, professional and respectful way. None of these things happened. This video is nothing but a tea-time conversation between the instructor and her famous student. A conversation between two people who already know what the technique is about. Apparently, the instructor,(or teacher?) has already taught her student all he needed to know and now, on this DVD, they are graciously going over part of it again, in order to publicize her classes and, possibly, get new students. What I found appalling is the fact that this teacher, in her WITHDRAWN attitude, does not even look at the camera and totally overlooks the fact that there is a human being watching this DVD and expecting to learn a little from her. The instructor has no intention whatsoever to provide the viewer with MINIMUM information, or tips, or advice as to what to do or not to do to improve posture. Not one single tip! Her rant about the technique is arrogant and disrespectful and it looks that she is much more interested in wooing her good-looking student than passing on a little information or help to the poor viewer. This is not a lesson, much less a first lesson, and any serious teacher will easily realize that this lady has no intention whatsoever of teaching anything through this video. This is nothing but a self-serving, arrogant, disrespectful DVD from a lady who considers herself to be above the rest of humanity.

"I had spent two or more weeks feeling very tense, my shoulders going up and almost reaching my ears. I tried Passion Flower, Valerian, GABA, which are products that I successfully use for better sleep. However, these very useful supplements did not do the trick and my tension continued. I was lucky to come across a blog where people were discussing front neck tension and someone (Bless them!) mentioned inositol. I have always been a great vitamin consumer and have taken inositol as part of my multivitamins and/or as part of my complete B vitamin complex. But I did not know that a larger amount of inositol could be so darn good for tension related issues. It has been phenomenal! On the first day I decided to take only 1/2 a teaspoon and I could feel more relaxed in about 4 or 5 hours. The next day, I had two doses: first I had a 1 teaspoon dose and, some hours later, took and extra 1/2 teaspoon. The difference has been HUGE and I felt so much better and felt so relaxed that, on the third day, I did no longer need to take it again. Unbelievable! I will always keep one of these jars at hand. One never knows when tension and nervousness can strike again.**[Needless to say, I am one who will NEVER take any drug prescribed by a traditional doctor, not even aspirin.

"I have another roller made of wood which is all over the place and, thus, not easy to control, so I decided to get this one.

"I started having back problems when I was in my early twenties and I was told I had three (herniated disks??), one in my neck, one in my upper back and one on my lower back. Along the way, I have had lumbago, sciatica, bursitis, neck problems. Posture and avoiding carrying weights is very important, but I only managed to get rid of pain three years ago when I started studying and practicing Qigong. I learned about qi,(vital energy) what it is, how it works and the wonders one can achieve by practicing the wonderful 5000 year old Chinese art named Qigong.So I learned that Qi is the key, proper qi flow is the answer to our problems. When qi does not flow properly we get sick. If we can manage to get our qi flow smoothly, illness **in general** can be prevented and/or reverted. (There is a well known group of ex cancer patients in China who had been told by their western medicine doctors that they had a few months to live. These cancer patients started practicing Qigong in a public place in Beijing and have been doing so for several YEARS and enjoying good health. Food for thought.)There are different ways to get the qi flowing: qigong, tai chi, acupressure, reflexology, etc, etc. All these tend to do the same thing: help get the qi (chi) flow smoothly or, at least, prevent qi stagnation.My interest to learn more about Traditional Chinese Medicine led me not only to practice and study Qigong, but also added Tai chi, acupressure and reflexology to the list. I also have a health path (path covered with rounded stones)and also wear Chinese acupressure sandals.When I saw this mat and pillow I did not hesitate to order it. The principle is simple: walk on it, lay on it, rest your neck on it and the qi will start running along your energy channels (more) smoothly. The qi will slowly start to restore health.Thanks to Qigong and other traditional Chinese medicines I no longer have pain. However, if I am stressed and do not feel like doing any kind of physical exercise, I grab this mat and pillow, lay comfortably either on a bed or the floor, and feel totally relaxed in a matter of minutes.The mat and pillow are well made and appear like they will last. Highly recommendable for anyone with any kind of health problem. (The only thing that does not last is the carrying bag these come in. The plastic zipper fell apart pretty soon.)Those who may be interested in learning about Qigong, there are several excellent books and videos here on Amazon. I would most specially recommend those by Dr Yang Ywing Ming, and also two DVDs by Master Chris Pei (Qigong for beginners and Tai Chi for beginners). The DVD series ""Understanding Qigong"" by Dr Yang Ywing Ming is an excellent source of information for those who are more intellectually oriented and interested in understanding what Qi is, how it works. Lee Holden is another very good Qigong instructor and I would also recommend the DVDs by Garry Garripoli. To those with back pain problems or arthritis problems, I highly recommend two DVDs (and accompanying books) by Dr Yang Ywing Ming: ""Qigong for back pain relief"" and ""Qigong for arthritis relief"". Both DVDs and books are available here on Amazon.Happy Qi, everyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZC2G3DOSUAU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RZJD1S#wasThisHelpful","RZC2G3DOSUAU2","AWBMGLP57SAGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBMGLP57SAGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started practicing Qigong 3 years ago. I have a large collection of books and DVDs on Qigong, most of them by Dr Yang Ywing Ming. When I came on Amazon and came across this DVD, I decided to add it to my collection. I watched it as soon as it arrived, but did not immediately put the movements into practice because I was busy doing my other Qigong movements. One day, however, when I was walking on my treadmill, I started feeling some nasty pain on my right ankle. Every step on the treadmill, my ankle would hurt. I got off the treadmill, looked for the DVD and searched for the movements specifically recommended for the ankles. I did a few repetitions, maybe ten or twelve with each foot, and the next day repeated the same procedure. The next time I got on my treadmill, my ankle was no longer hurting and has never hurt again since that day so I decided to add these qigong movements for arthritis to my daily qigong routine.I have no words to express my admiration and gratitude towards Dr Yang Ywing Ming and this wonderful ancient art named Qigong which, needless to say, I will practice for as long as I live. I highly recommend this DVD as well as all of his other DVDs on Qigong, including the series Understanding Qigong, which those more intellectually oriented will greatly appreciate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWSG6IZTW4OC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000U0G3W4#wasThisHelpful","RWSG6IZTW4OC0","AWBMGLP57SAGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBMGLP57SAGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After having suffered from back problems for over 20 years, I decided to give QiGong a try. I started practicing two years ago with Master Chris Pei's DVD, Eight Pieces of Brocade (available here on Amazon). Then proceeded to buy almost ALL DVDs by Dr Yang. Practicing QiGong and these particular back pain movements is the BEST thing I have EVER done for my physical well being.I have been practicing QiGong for about 2 years, but it took me only one or two weeks to completely get rid of pain I had on my upper left arm. The best part is that I have completely got rid of my lower back pain. I used to get back pain when I had to stand for over 15 or 20 minutes preparing foods in the kitchen. I also had problems with my right ankle, those are also completely gone.Before QiGong, the simple action of leaning slightly over in order to cut veggies or prepare a meal, was enough for me to get lower back pain. I had to sit down for a while in order to be able to be able to continue doing whatever I was doing. Sitting at the computer always gave me neck and lower back pain, but thanks to QIGONG, all those problems belong to the past.If you are a non believer, all I can say is get this DVD (or the one for Arthritis, which is also wonderful), practice these very easy movements for a few weeks and you will start seeing the results. Even if your pain is very bad, you will experience great improvement. All you need to do is practice every day in complete relaxation. Just a few minutes a day doing these extremely easy movements will help you get over your pain, whether caused by rheumatism or by arthritis. You will also become a believer. Do it and enjoy a new life without pain and, what's more, without dangerous pain killers.Thank you Dr Yang for all your wonderful QIGONG DVDs. I have learned a lot from them and I will continue practicing different QiGong movements for as long as I live.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MZ20B2V46215/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RG1HMM#wasThisHelpful","R3MZ20B2V46215","AWBMGLP57SAGK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWBMGLP57SAGK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You can get one of those Advent calendars with the worst-chocolate-ever but there are better ways to help your kids enter into the season of Advent. Arnold Ytreedie has authored a number of children's books, including three other Advent devotionals. With Ishtar's Odyessey he takes families on a journey from Persia to Bethlehem.I9780825443930shtar was a young prince, the son of a wise man. he begins the story as a somewhat sheltered ten-year-old, fearful of life outside the palace walls and he doesn't like his daily lessons. One night, reviewing the constellations he discovers a new star prophesying the birth of a king to the West. Honored for his discovery, Ishtar is compelled to accompany his father and uncles on a six month journey to pay homage to the new king. Along the way he meets new friends: Jotham, Bartholomew and Tabitha (all characters in Ytreeide's other Advent devotionals).Ytreeide weaves his fictionalized tale of the magi's journey into daily readings for Advent. Each entry ends with a scripture and a short reflection on that part of the story. Ytreeide also suggests foods to enjoy on particular days of the week which correlate with the story and Advent customs to enrich and reinforce what children are learning through the story.If your kids like stories, this is an interesting and engaging way to help them enter into Advent more fully.  At the beginning of the story Ishtar is a pagan (named after the Babylonian goddess of love), at the end of the story he worships Jesus, the Son of the one true God. I give this four stars.Notice of material connection: I received this book from Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HF9Z0HUTBZZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825443938#wasThisHelpful","R3HF9Z0HUTBZZS","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Looking for a devotional which is accessible and theologically rich?  One that explores liturgy, Scripture and the Spiritual life? Here is a good choice for Advent and Christmas and one I plan to spend a little bit of time with.time-to-get-ready-an-advent-christmas-reader-to-wake-your-soul-6Mark Villano the Director of Mission and Ministry at Marymount California University. In Time to Get Ready: An Advent, Christmas Reader to Wake Your Soul, he combines scriptural insights, liturgical reflections with pop-culture and true-to-life illustrations.  Villano  guides us as we prepare to enter into the seasons of Advent, Christmas and Epiphany.Villano has spent more than a decade in Catholic Campus ministry. He explores spiritual insights in a culturally relevant manner. However this isnt just  a college devotional.  Villano helps all of us enter into the true meaning of seasonthe coming of a Savior and the rhythm of Gods grace.While Villano is deeply steeped in the Catholic tradition, this is a reader that all Christians can read fruitfully. He doesnt speak of Marian devotion in ways that makes a Protestant like me uncomfortable. Instead he commends Marys response (week four of Advent) in a way that invites us to respond with similar openness to Gods movement in our lives.  Each daily reading explores the Bible, Christian tradition and its meaning for us. On the whole, I found the entries I read orthodox and inspirational [typically I read every word of books I review, but I made an exception and skimmed this one as I plan to use it through out the holiday seasons].I look forward to spending time with this devotional through Advent.

"Every year the holiday season comes earlier. Coffee cups, mall Santas, ornaments, christmas music and grocery-store-eggnog all proclaim the yuletide cheer as the retail industrial complex screams,""Happy Holidays!"" The Christian tradition has its own way of preparing for the holidays: Advent (beginning this year on November 29). More than just a time for marking the shopping days before Christmas, Advent is about preparing your heart to enter fully into the mystery of God's coming to us in the Incarnation of Christ.God With Us: Reader's Edition edited by Greg Pennoyer & Pregory WolfeNow is the time to start thinking about how to wait well. Paraclete Press has several devotional resources designed to help us enter into the seasons of Advent, Christmas and Epiphany. God With Us: Reader's Edition of a paperback version of one of my favorites. Like its companion volume God for Us (which walks through Lent and Easter), it brings together a group of writers from across the Christian tradition (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant--in both Evangelical and Mainline), under the editorial gaze of Greg Pennoyer and Gregory Wolfe (from Image Journal). Eugene Peterson writes the introduction and four authors each write a weeks worth of devotions for each day of Advent. The late Richard John Neuhaus provided the devotions for week one. Poets Scott Cairns and Lucy Shaw write the devotions for weeks two and three, respectively. Memoirist Kathleen Norris's offerings make up week four, leading up to Christmas while  Emilie Griffin reflects on the special days between Christmas and the feast of Epiphany. Punctuating each section is Beth Bevis's brief histories share the historical context of the church's practice of the season and various feast days.If you are familiar with any of these authors, you know how deeply they have reflected on the spiritual life and the wealth of insights they have for waiting and watching well.  This is really a beautiful book and one of my 'holiday favorites.'  I read a library copy several years ago and am happy to delve back into it for this season.

"Gospel Conversations is designed to help biblical counselors care like Christ for those we counsel. Navigating the compass points of the counseling coveration, Robert Kellemen explores how counselors bring healing through sustaining, healing, reconciling and guiding. Kellerman is the executive director of the Biblical Counseling Coalition and CEO of RPM ministries. He sees his role as a counselor as bringing people face to face with the truth of God's word and encounter with Christ. Through this book, he imparts tools that biblical counselors can use to grow in their competencies to comfort the afflicted and challenge the comfortable.Kellerman suggests twenty-one competencies for biblical counseling, Sustaining relational competencies involve the counselor growing in their ability to connect, empathize, listen, comfort, and share scripture emphatically, Healing competencies include growing in our ability to effect relational mind and soul renewal, encourage, compose a 'scriptural treatment plan,'  lead counselees in a Theo-dramatic conversation and in stretching scriptural explorations. Reconciling competencies probe issues theologically, expose heart sins, apply truth relationally, calm the conscience through grace, enlighten and empower.  Guiding competencies involve fanning into flame the gift of God in people, helping them author empowering narratives, constructing insight-based action plans,  and having target focused conversations.Because of the place of the Bible in the healing process, Kellerman's model is different than the contemporary therapeutic model. Kellerman (and other biblical counselors) urge us toward a thoughtful Christian model for soul care which differs from that of secular psychology (p. 98). There may be some antagonism towards psychology here, but the hope is that the Christian alternative is every bit as rigorous and comprehensive in dealing with what ails the human heart. Kellerman focuses on helping people get to the root of their problems (sin and suffering).This is a helpful textbook and handbook for growing as a counselor. I have no antagonism towards psychology, per se, but my competency to counsel is different from that as a therapist. What I want people to do is to see themselves as God sees them, pursue a right relationship with Him and allow the Spirit of God to do the work of sanctification in them as they give their heart and mind to Him. Every Christian model of counseling (including a more psychologically oriented one) wants this. While I personally think other forms of counseling are tremendously helpful in the healing process, this model approximates what I do as a pastor when I meet with those in need. I have a Master's of Divinity (that pastor degree), but the extent of my training in pastoral counseling is this: know when to punt to a more qualified counselor; nevertheless pastors play an important role in the healing process, reminding people of God's presence, his work of salvation through Jesus and His ongoing ministry of reconciliation. Kellerman writes an engaging text for help students learn biblical counseling better and I think it is a great resource for anyone who engages in the ministry of pastoral counseling. I give this four staIrs.Note: I received this book from Cross Focused Reviews (and Zondervan) in exchange for my honest review).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FWZVIKGKJZST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310516153#wasThisHelpful","R1FWZVIKGKJZST","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Penelope Wilcock is the novelist behind the Hawk and Dove novels (haven't read them) She has worked as a Methodist Minister and chaplain and been a tutor and trainer for Methodist preachers. In 52 Original Wisdom Stories, Wilcock takes us on a journey through the Christian year following the stories of Sid and Rosie. Sid and Rosie are an older couple. Sid is a Catholic turned Quaker.  Rosie is a spiritual-but-not-religious soul  who has left regular church attendance behind. Both are thoughtful believers despite their distance from the church. Sid draws on his history with liturgy. Rosie's reflections bring her into contact with the East-- Buddhism, Taoism, etc. They are remarried and have children and grandchildren, though none together.Wilcock begins with Advent and ends with the feast of Christ the King. Each narrative ends with questions for 'sharing and wondering'--discussion or personal reflection--and a prayer. And all the stories are fully-photocopiable, free-of-charge for use in churches and groups. In addition to the broad liturgical rhythms, some of these stories reflect on feast days for particular saints. The breadth of the Christian year allow Wilcock to engage the whole human experience and each story is a revelation about the spiritual life, the human experience, and Sid and Rosie.To be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect. I figured this would offer me some liturgical reflections, a way to beef up my preaching, especially in high seasons like Advent, Lent and Easter. But I got something different. By placing her reflections in the voice of Sid and Rosie, two 'Dones' who had left mainstream religion behind, she offers us an insider-outsider perspective of those who believe but don't readily belong. There is also a quotidian quality as they fit Christianity into daily-life, unadorned by ecclesiastical vestments.But Sid and Rosie aren't theological lightweights. They deeply engage the Christian story and seek to follow Jesus. They reflect on hosipality, love, life,  death, brokenness and more. I liked meeting them in these pages. I give this three-and-a-half stars. My point of critique would be, I wish that Sid and Rosie came to a richer engagement with Church as a body of caring believers. They engage the tradition well, but I think there is something to the experience of the Christian life they are lacking.Note: I recieved this book from Kregel Publications (and Monarch Books) in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31KLSG4F8LS3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857216023#wasThisHelpful","R31KLSG4F8LS3M","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The book is a spiritual autobiography of sorts, but it only reveals the broad contours of Caputo's life, focusing on the development (or deconstruction?) of his thoughts on God, faith and certainty.[caption id="""" align=""alignleft"" width=""300""]<img src=""http://fortresspress.com/sites/default/files/product-main/9781451499155.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""448"" > Hoping Against Hope by John D. ""Jackie"" ""Brother Paul"" Caputo[/caption]Caputo was raised in a devout Catholic family. He spent four years as a De LaSalle monk, before his illustrious career as a philosopher and theologians (thirty-six years as professor of Philosophy at Villanova University and professor of philosophy of religion at Syracuse University for seven years). In<em>Hoping Against Hope</em>he gives voice and personality to these various stages of his intellectual development. As a child Caputo was an altar boy in pre-Vatican II Catholicism who had memorized the Baltimore Catechism. Caputo refers to this younger self as ""<strong>Jackie</strong>."" ""<strong>Brother Paul,</strong>"" is the monk Caputo who grew callouses on his knees in an attempt to learn prayer and had a love for the mystics. The professor, ""<strong>John D.</strong>,"" is the the philosopher who's tongue was loosed by Jacques Derrida (the other Jackie) and the French Postmodernists.Caputo writes:<blockquote>My life as a philosopher gas taken place in the distance between theology and philosophy. Like everyone else, however far forward I thought I moved, I was always circling around my origins. I soon found that the audacity of the philosophers who ""dare to think"" according to the Enlightenment motto, fails them when it comes to theology. There they panic, in fear of contamination. They treat the name of God like a terrible computer virus that will corrupt all their files, or like a real one, like the Ebola virus, where the odds of recovering are against you. So, mostly at the beginning of my professional life, when ""John D."" stepped forth and responded to the title ""professor,"" while telling Jackie to stay at home, I was worried that they would say, ""This is not philosophy, this is just his religion."" But my religion is between me and Brother Paul and Jackie and several others. How can they know anything about that? (104-105).</blockquote>With the Continental Philosophers, Heidigger, Derrida, Lacan, Lyotoard, Levinas, and others, Caputo thoroughly rejects the narrative of the Christian tradition and the official line of the Roman Catholic church. He dismantles dogma, expresses his antagonism toward the afterlife and a God that is either ' the Prime Punisher and the Royal Rewarder (64). He also regards the arguement between atheism and theism to be wrong-headed. With a Zen-Koan-like-air he proclaims, ""God does not exist. God insists"" (114). He gives fresh and unique interpretations of scripture and imagines the textual variants he wishes to one day uncover. Caputo's thoughts run far a field from classic Christian orthodoxy.But his project isn't wholly negative. Caputo upholds active service to the poor and marginalized and the non-religious religion of love. He says his idea of nihilism is stolen from the mystics and he employs insights from Miester Eckhardt and Marguerite Porete (both mystics ran a foul from official church teaching). What Caputo proposes is a religion of the Rose--""The rose is without why; it blossoms because it blossoms; It cares not for itself, asks not if it's seen"" (27). He brings this verse from Angelus Silesius into conversation wiht Lyotard's religion of the smile and posits a nihilism where all of life is received as a gift (with or without a giver), where all of life is received without condition (181).As an intellectual memoir/spiritual autobiography I give this three stars and thought it was an interesting read. I especially loved the 'short nocturnal dialogue' where Caputo imagines a dialogue with himself at his different stages of faith and intellectual development. I appreciate how Caputo's postmodernity leads him to pluralism and relativism without the need to posit an underlying universal faith in God. However, I am unconvinced by Caputo's theological vision and see his radical (or weakness) theology as incompatible with the Christian gospel of grace. I was aware of Caputo before reading this book, so wasn't particularly surprised by what he says here. I have read him before and have seen him lecture. I find him fascinating. I also find it ironic that I received this book from Cross Focused reviews. If Caputo mentions the cross at all (and I don't remember that he does in this book), it is clearly not his focus. Anyway, I received this book in exchange for my honest review.

"Here is a book I've read cover-to-cover but am not done with yet: Your Vocational Credo by Deborah Koehn Loyd. In the past couple of weeks I resigned from a position I held for just short of a year and I am taking the time to reflect on my shape and life purpose as I discern next steps. Loyd's book has been useful as I try to find a new place to serve in my passion. Loyd, is a church planter, pastor, teacher and professor at George Fox  and wrote Vocational Credo to help others distill their calling by composing a 'vocational credo.' A Vocational Credo is a short statement which describes what what we were put on earth to do.Loyd wants to enlarge our idea of vocation from thinking of it as a call to particular location, what we get paid to do, a super spiritual breath of God type experience or a non-specific generic view(39-40). Instead she argues, ""Vocation is speaking or living from the truest form of self. Vocation doesn't merely happen to us from the outside in a blinding light from heaven or an official 'call' from God. That sweet spot of significance suited only to you must be discovered from the inside as well.  A thorough inner exploration is necessary because it will allow you to bring your most energized and creative self into the future. It will ignite passion in your soul that is specific to you. When passion collides with God-given opportunity, you have the elements of vocation and the power to change the world"" (18-19).So Vocational Credo involves inner work, so that we can serve God as our true selves. Loyd shares her own discovery of her calling as she probed the depths of past painful experience, her values, and how her passion, anger, joy revealed the particular way God called her to bring healing in the world. She invites us to take a similar sort of journey by creating a personal 'vocational triangle' reflecting on how our 'first wound' sets the trajectory of our calling, our personal values (which may be revealed to us through a favorite book or quote) and the way our shape allows us to respond to the needs of the world around us. By paying attention we can craft our credo: God created me to _________________ so that __________________.Loyd also offers practical reflections and insights about  'toxic skills' (things we can do well  or need to do but feel drained by), the gift of opportunity in chaos and change, how to discover our personal vocational preferences, and leaving a legacy as part of our calling.This book proves to be a practical tool for leaning into everything God wants to do through you. My undone-ness with it  means it has alerted me to some inner-work I still need to do. For example, Loyd is poetic about the way pain sets the trajectory of  our calling and she shares vulnerably about how her childhood experience of abuse silenced her voice. As she worked through the trauma of those experiences, she saw ways that the things that broke her aroused anger toward injustice and suffering which offered clues to her discovering her true self. I have spent some time in reflecting on how pain has shaped my journey and can point to some hurtful moments, but I don't have a clear sense of how my 'first wound' shapes my life passion and purpose. I agree it does, but I have more work to do.So I've read and commend this book as a tool for self reflection and discernment but I haven't composed my vocational credo (to my satisfaction) yet. I give this four stars.Note: I received this book from InterVarsity Press in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23M3PIMCKCCH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830843191#wasThisHelpful","R23M3PIMCKCCH4","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever sat down for multi-course gourmet meal? Beyond the  typical four-course, western meal (appetizer, salad, main course, dessert), the most courses I've enjoyed in one sitting was eight or nine courses at a Chinese wedding reception.  Each dish was more flavorful than the last. A culinary delight, pure pleasure, a picture of heaven. But our ordinary fare is not like this. We eat fast food we picked up on the go, never sitting down to savor our food or the relationships around the table, monotonous microwaveable meals, junk food with little nutritional substance, and food processed by the industrial food complex. I'm overstating a little. Many of us are better than that. We are foodies who delight in home-grown, slow food, lovingly prepared and brought from the farm to the table. But what are our spiritual diets like? Do we subsist on bland prayers or ' the processed' devotion of others? Our we filling up on junk when we are invited to sit down to gourmet meal?Pray Like A Gourmet by David Brazzeal (Paraclete Press, 2015)David Brazzeal  lives in Paris, serves on the International Mission Board in Brazil, Guadeloupe, Quebec and France, helps lead five innovative churches, writes poetry, composes music, and creates guerrilla labyrinths. In Pray Like A Gourmet: Creative Ways to Feed Your Soul, Brazzeal invites us to the banquet of prayer. He discusses how his own spiritual malnourishment led him to press into God in prayer and experience him in a vibrant way. His goal is to whet our appetites for communion through God by unfolding the many courses available to us as we taste and see the Lord is good. But this is not simply a petition for a deeper and richer prayer life. Brazzeal shares his experience of each course that is lovingly laid out before us,  and he directs us to creative 'recipes' designed to help us to enter more fully into each dimension of prayer. Drawing, writing poetry, singing songs, listening to music, walking through nature, word games,  reading, intercessory prayer plans and legal pads have ingredients which add spice, enrich and expand our enjoyment and experience of God in prayer.What are the courses? Brazzeal starts with the standard recipe for prayer many of us were taught---ACTS: Adoration (Praise), Confession, Thanksgiving, Supplication (Asking).  He adds seven more courses: Observation, Intercession, Meditation, Contemplation, Blessing, Lamenting,  and Joining. Finally he discusses how to bring a more gourmet prayer life to the routines of life and to our shared life with others.We all get bored with the same old fare, eating the same meal everyday. How many days of leftovers can you handle? Brazzeal's book is an invitation to a richer and more varied spiritual diet.  He is a Creative, and sees the intimate link between creativity and spirituality. I absolutely love the 'recipes' and am eager to make more and taste more. There is a nice balance between form and improvisation (he gives you a structure but doesn't expect you to follow it woodenly) Brazzeal also has a rare gift of cutting through the ethereal and offering a practical approach to prayer. For example, his exploration of confession exhorts us to acknowledge sin and screw-ups, but he sets this in the wider category of a 'reality check' and taking an honest assessment of our life and circumstances (see chapter eight). He offers practical suggestions and clarifications on every aspect of prayer listed.I give this book five stars and recommend it to anyone feeling stuck, hungry, or bored in their prayer life.Note: I received this book from the author or publisher through Speakeasy on Tap in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZVHSWF6XB9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612616275#wasThisHelpful","R1NZVHSWF6XB9A","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My introduction to Lauren Winner's writing came more than a decade ago. My wife had read and liked Girl Meets God and loved it. I picked up her other book, Mudhouse Sabbath because I loved the premise. Winner's turn toward God took her through Orthodox Judaism to Christianity (the story recounted in her first memoir). Mudhouse Sabbath was about the nourishing spiritual practices she found in Judaism and missed after her conversion to Christianity. She wrote appreciatively about what she found in Judaism and how these practices continued to nourish her, and weren't incompatible with her new faith.Paraclete Press has just released the study edition of Mudhouse Sabbath. This is not a rewrite. The chapters have the same format as they did when Winner first conceived the book.  In Winner's new introduction she notes a couple of places where she would now write it differently, especially in her failure to explore God's justice and her expectation of encountering Him as we work toward it (viii).  For example, the practice of fasting and Sabbath have implications for justice in the Hebrew scriptures which Winner left unexplored in the earlier edition (ix-x). She also acknowledges her growing cautiousness about borrowing from Judaism as a Christian (urging humility and grace).The difference between this edition and its earlier incarnation (other than the new introduction) is the study notes. Winner's words remain the same but the chapters are peppered with quotations, selections from Jewish authors and Hebrew scripture and discussion questions. While Winner's original was thoughtful and engaged Judaism, it was much more a personal reflection on how she as a Christian convert could still appropriate these practices as part of her own spiritual life. That was the charm of the book. The study edition helps Christian readers engage these concepts and practices more thoughtfully for themselves.Personally I like this edition a lot. It is possible to treat this book like the original, reading the main body of text as an exhortation to beef up your personal spiritual practices. But a study edition invites you into something more demanding and rewarding. The first edition was more privatized. This edition invites engagement. I gave the original four stars once upon a time, this I give five. Christian readers will find a deep well of spiritual practice. Jewish readers may find a book from a Christian borrowing from their traditions off-putting, but will be put at ease by the care and sensitivity with which Winner engages their religious tradition.  If you never read the original, skip it. This is the definitive edition.Note: I received this book from Paraclete Press in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17KZRS4LMWZZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612614531#wasThisHelpful","R17KZRS4LMWZZE","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"International Justice Mission (IJM) is a global organization which protects the poor from violence in the developing world,  particularly in regions where the justice system is broken. While their work is in some sense secular--their primary mission is to challenge systems of injustice, rather than preach the gospel--they come to their work from Christian convictions.God of Justice, a twelve session Bible Study resource explores pertinent passages from scripture which explore God's heart-beat for justice. Abraham George (IJM's director of international church mobilization) and Nikki Toyama-Szeto (IJM's senior director of biblical justice integration and mobilization) have compiled a resource for individual and group study. Each of the twelve sessions explores a passage from the Bible (or passages) of scripture, shares a contemporary story from the fight against injustice, and offers practical exercises designed to help individuals or groups do justly and love mercy.George and Toyama-Szeto explore both Old & New Testament. They describe creation and the dignity of humanity as image-bearers of God (Genesis 1) and God's desire for Shalom (Genesis 2). They also explore how sin corrupted God's shalom and how this had both personal and systemic implications (Gen 3,4, 38). Through the example of Moses in the Exodus we see God's desire to use humans to restore justice and to challenge evil systems (Exodus 3,14,15). Toyam-Setzo and George also explore New Testament passages: how Jesus came to inaugurate new creation, how the Kingdom of God embodies God's shalom, how Christ's cross dealt decisively with the problem of injustice, and how justice relates to the church's mission.Combining thoughtful reflections with probing questions, George and Toyama-Szeto push readers and study participants to engage seriously with the Bible and explore steps that God may be calling them to. While this is an IJM resource, the principles in this book are about justice more than IJM and George and Toyama-Szeto allow for broad exploration of what the fight against injustice will look like for those who engage the Bible and hear the Spirit's call.It is still said sometimes that conservative evangelicals talk about personal salvation through Jesus Christ, whereas liberals champion social justice. The former are armed with their list of favorite Bible verses. So are the latter. Both sides accuse one another of ignoring the heart of Christianity. Years ago I worked for a Christian community development organization where part of my responsibility was to train suburban church groups who came to work in the city about God's heart for the poor (and how to do ministry non-paternalistically)  This would have been a helpful resource for me to draw on. I recommend this study for churches, community development organizations and Christian non-profits. This would be a good volunteer or staff training resource. I give it five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U5FNSIX5EPS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830810285#wasThisHelpful","R3U5FNSIX5EPS3","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The great Russian Novelist, Leo Tolstoy, wrote long complicated novels like War & Peace and Anna Karenina. But Tolstoy was also known for his ideals, and his spirituality, and for preserving and retelling Russian folktales. In a short volume, three of Tolstoy's tales are retold with notes and an introduction by Jon Sweeney (independent scholar, and author of more than twenty books).  Sweeney's prose combines with Anna Mitchell's illustrations to produce Three SImple Men & Other Holy Folktales.The stories that Sweeney retells are some favorites. The title story retells the story of the three hermits, who are visited by priests who judge them simple and shallow in their prayer life and try to instruct them. The priests somce to see that these simple monks are deep in communion with God when they see them walking towards their boat on the waves. Next Sweeney retells the Godson (rechristened The Godson Learns to Fight Evil) and  A Spark Neglected Burns the House ( new title: One Neglected Spark May Burn Down a House).Sweeney's retellings have some creative license. Tolstoy's Three Hermits have no individual characteristics (they are simply, three hermits). Sweeney describes them individually as basket maker, a forager for food, and the thinker (3-4). Conversely The Godson learns to Fight Evil simplifies Tolstoy's account, removing some of its preachiness and its magical elements (57).In One Negelected Spark, Sweeney adds a Tolstoy-esque element, the aging, ailing father streched out on the stove recovering from athsma (59). Despite some poetic license Sweeney is faithful to the plot of Tolstoy's tales.I don't prefer these adaptations to the originals, but I enjoyed them. Moreover, the prose is simple enough that my eight-year-old daughter read them happily. I liked Sweeney's introduction and his brief notes on each story where we reflects on what Tolstoy was trying to do as a storyteller.

"What doesn't kill us makes us stronger or so the saying goes. In fact, non-lethal pain can be debilitating: grief, chronic illness, loss of a job, flesh-eating-bacteria (or whatever). But as emotionally and physically draining hard times can be, they can also be a means for a fresh work of God, shaping you into who he wants you to be. Clayton King, founder and president of Clayton King Ministries and Crossroads Missions & Summer Camps, knows pain . In Stronger he tells the story of losing both of his parents before he turned forty and the trauma and turmoil it put him in.His mother died unexpectedly after being rushed to emergency. She had a secret addiction to prescription drugs. King's father was in the later stages of diabetes, undergoing dialysis three times a week. King was not there when either of his parents past away. He was stuck in Toronto, Canada, unable to get a flight home when his mother died. He left his dad's side to attend an awards ceremony for his kid when his father passed away. King shares about his pain, regret, and feelings of brokenness. His parent's deaths also opens up other wounds (like his grandfather's abandonment of his father).However this book is not about wallowing. King wants us to see how God uses hard times, pain and moments of weakness to further our transformation, ""Sometimes God will remove the weakness and sometimes he will redeem the weakness, but he will never waste your weakness"" (18). King shares about where God met him, blessed him amidst brokenness, taught him humility and redeemed the pain. In the middle of his grief, God's spirit was present with him, he was able to experience God's grace and forgiveness in a vulnerable time.This would be a good book for anyone facing hard times (which is all of us, at some time). King is personal and vulnerable. While saying to someone in a crisis, ""God works out all things according to his pleasure"" is trite, when someone shares that truth through their experience, it is a more apt word. That being said, those in raw grief probably aren't ready to read a book like this quite yet.

"Evangelicalism is the Christian movement I was born into and find my spiritual home. Whereas other Christian traditions have an impressive tradition and long pedigree, Evangelicals can be part of an Evangelical denomination, exist within a wider (non-Evangelical) tradition, or be denominationally unaffiliated.  There is no central teaching magistarium so there is a wide diversity in Evangelical doctrine and spirituality; however all Evangelicals hold to the veracity and authority of scripture, cling tenaciously to salvation through Jesus Christ and the missional imperative of preaching the gospel.Evangelicals Around the World: A Global Handbook for the 21st Century aims at giving an overview of the world Evangelical movement in all its diversity. Edited by Brian Stiller, Todd Johnson, Karen Stiller and Mark Hutchinson with contributors from all over the world. Brian Stiller begins the book with an introduction to the World Evangelical Alliance (formerly the World Evangelical Fellowship), a transnational organization in which he is the global ambassador. Albert Hickman then provides a brief chronology of 200 important events in Evangelical History before they turn to the essays in this volume,Roughly the first half the book focuses on issues that characterize the movement and the second half profiles the evangelical movement in geographical context. So it begins with chapters on the evangelical identity and mission, ecumenism and Evangelical interaction with other faiths, the Pentecostal and Charismatic (which overlaps Evangelicalism), and essays about mission and evangelism, prayer, social justice, politics, science, marketplace, stewardship, etc.  The later chapters show statistical data by global regions (the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, North America, Asia, Europe, Oceania) and discuss the unique challenges facing Evangelicals (and Christians in general) on each continent.This is a good resource book to have on hand. As with all multi-contributor volumes, there are chapters that stand out, and some that are overly simple. It demonstrates well  the wide diversity of the movement. Noteable contributors include R. Paul Stevens (Evangelicals and the Marketplace), Ron Sider (Evangelicals and Social Justice), Miriam Adeney (Evangelicals and Other Religions), Timothy George (Evangelicals and Roman Catholics), and more.The statistical data ad regional essays were particularly useful for me as I prepared a prayer guide for a prayer event for my church.

"My introduction to Ray Vander Laan came through the  men's group at my church. They have watched a number of his Holy Land tour DVDs. The blend of on-location-footage, connecting culture and geography to the biblical text, and Vander Laan's expository style makes for a rich study experience. Israel's Mission is volume 13 in his 'That the World May Know' series. These videos span twenty years of tours. Vander Laan is noticably grayer and occasionally shows his age, though his passion and energy show no signs of diminishing. He walks at the same determined pace and preaches with the same passion, but his reflections have deepened.The production of Israel's Mission is far superior to its predecessors. The graphics and maps are more eye-popping, the cutaways to tour members more natural, and the video more seamless. The earlier installments are hokey by comparison.But that all is aesthetics, what about content? In five sessions Vander Laan explores the mission of God's people--in the Old and New Testament. He examines Abraham's role as the Patriarch of his family and his role of caring for the house of the Father (Beth Ab) and his hospitality to three strangers. He explores the call of Israel at Sinai to be a kingdom of priests, Jesus' exhortation for us to seek the lost, and the parable of the lost son. In each session Vander Laan  prompts us to take up our role in participating in God's mission in the world.The accompanying discovery guide has notes from the DVD presentation, discussion questions and five days of personal study sessions for digging deeper. This study is well put together and will enlarge your vision of God's mission in the world.

"David Capes, Rodney Reeves, and E. Randolph Richards are three biblical scholars from  three different institutions (Houston Baptist University, Southwest Baptist University, and Palm Beach Atlantic Univerisity, respectively). They have previously collaborated on a book about the apostle Paul, Rediscovering Paul: an Introduction to His World, Letters and Theology (IVP Academic, 2007). They are back at it. Their new book from IVP Academic is Rediscovering Jesus: An Introduction to Biblical, Religious and Cultural Perspectives on Christ.Don't let the academic publisher or their resums scare you. This is an engaging and interesting and accessible read! I had fun with this book.  To me, this is really two books in one. Part I is a romp through the biblical images of Jesus, uncovering what is distinctive about the portrait of Jesus in Mark, Matthew, Luke and Acts, John, Paul's epistles, Hebrews, in the non-Pauline epistles and Revelation. Part II examines extra-biblical images of Jesus. Capes, Reeves & Richards look at the Gnostic Jesus, the Muslim Jesus, the Historical, demythologized Jesus, the Mormon Jesus, the American Jesus and the Cinematic Jesus.  In each chapter, after exploring the distinctive portrait of Jesus in the Bible or culture, they ask, ""What if this were the only Jesus?"" The result is they showcase the important contribution of each Bible writers picture of Christ, and show how cultural depictions of Jesus, while sometimes illuminating, often obscure our perception of who the Jesus really is.While there is some first-rate biblical theology and cultural analysis here, this is a completely practical and non-technical text about Jesus, appropriate for undergrads (or even a Christian high school). Part I is helpful because it reveals how the entire New Testament, all the books together, gives us our picture of who Jesus is. The Jesus of Mark appears on the scene, binding the strong man and fighting the religious establishment, but there is no mention of Jesus' virgin birth, his post resurrection appearances, his great commission or ascension. Luke's Jesus was more politicized, and didn't even give a theological account of the atonement (71). Matthew's Jesus is firmly connected with Israel's God and has the most developed ethic. John's Jesus is not of this world and focuses more on the after life than this life. ""Christians who read too much of John's Gospel and not enough of Matthew's might talk abut eternal life but not about caring for the least of these"" (86). Paul's high Christology is almost devoid of biography (how Jesus lived). If the Priestly Jesus of Hebrews were our only Jesus we'd focus on purity, perfection and completion. The non-Pauline epistles are immersed in Jesus' teaching but without the Gospels you wouldn't know that the origins of John, Jude, Peter and James' words are found in Christ's teaching. The apocalyptic Jesus is the disquieting image of the warrior lamb and the glorified Christ. Each of these images enlarge our picture of Christ. Any image that is excluded from our portrait of Jesus would result in bias and incomplete vision.What of  Jesus' cultural images? Capes, Reeves and Richards focus on images of Jesus that have a great deal of cultural pull. They profile the esoteric gnositic Jesus, the localized prophet of Islam, the Post-Enlightenment historical Jesus, the American hero, and the movie star. They observe (writing as one voice):Jesus outside the Bible can on occasion help us rediscover some aspect of Jesus that has been ignored or sidelined. More commonly, though, these nonbiblical images influence and color our biblical image. Understanding these images helps reveal ideas that need to be expunged from 'my Jesus.' While I found themes and emphases from the various biblical images of Jesus that needed to be reintroduced into my picture of Jesus, I also found other themes and emphases from nonbiblical images that needed to be extracted from my portrait of Jesus. both of these processes help me to rediscover Jesus. (261)The disparity between cultural images of Jesus and the Jesus of the Bible is highlighted well throughout part II. Perhaps it is the 'Cinematic Jesus' which highlights how much a depiction of Jesus for a particular era says more about that culture and time than it does about the real Jesus (244-245).This is a fun, thought-provoking book that deserves a wide readership beyond the classroom.

"For the Love of God's Word is an introduction to biblical hermeneutics. Andreas Kstenberger and Richard Patterson have teamed up again to help serious Bible students interpret scripture well (they previously authored Invitation to Biblical Interpretation, and this book is an abridgment of that text). Kstenberger and Patterson have a three part approach to interpreting scripture, what they call  'the Hermeneutical Triad': History, Literature and Theology.  This is similar to the approach of my own professors of Hermeneutics and Exegesis and does real justice to the interpretive task.Kstenberger and  Patterson are at their most brief in part I (, where they give a brief overview of Biblical history, discuss the contribution of archaeology to our understanding of Ancient Near East and Greco-Roman culture,  and they give some interpretive suggestions for distinguishing which biblical customs remain normative and those which are 'limited in application.' They do all this in about twenty pages.Part II is far more substantive, occupying the largest chunk of the book .  Kstenberger and  Patterson discusses Literature, focusing on three units: canon, genre, and language. In discussing canon, they discuss the applicability of the Old Testament, the concept of covenant and the way the Old Testament testifies to Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah. They go on to discuss how the various parts of the New Testament augment and supplement each other.  They then move on to discussing the distinctives of each genre in scripture: historical narrative, poetry and Wisdom, prophecy, the  narratives of the Gospel and Acts, parables, epistles and Apocalyptic. Finally they look at language (discourse structure and the meanings of words).Part III examines theology. Kstenberger's and  Patterson's focus is to make sure that our theology flows from the text (rather than our theology determining our reading of the text). The resources they suggest here are from the discipline of Biblical theology, rather than the theological tradition.  Their final chapter puts together a hermenuetical approach to getting an application out of the text.This is a text book intended for an introductory course in hermeneutics. However, its readable and understandable for the working pastor or any lay Bible teacher. For example, their section on interpreting biblical genres can be a reference point for preachers planning to launch into unfamilar biblical terrain. Or at least a refresher. My criticism of the book would be constricted to what's not here (i.e. an in-depth examination of narrative technique and poetic structure, discussion of how the wider theological tradition informs our understanding of the text, discussion of what the reader brings to the text, the role of the Spirit in interpretation, etc). However this is an introductory text and does a great job directing people on how to interpret the Bible in culturally  and literary sensitive and canonically aware  way. As a pastor I can readily see ways their approach is helpful to me. Those that follow Kstenberger's and  Patterson's will read the Bible well. I give this five stars.Note: I received this book from Kregel Academic in exchange for my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DBGHQ9RU50M6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825443369#wasThisHelpful","R1DBGHQ9RU50M6","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"]Rob Peabody and Chris Rodgers have put together a DVD curriculum designed to help. While Christians know they ought to share their faith with unbelievers we sometimes have a difficult time speaking in ways that are relevant to them. Why should non-Christians listen to the gospel? What about it is good news for them? Intersect follows the journey of five individuals who came to faith becaue their circumstances forced them to consider where their story and God's story converged. The stories of each individual illuminates the way Christ meets individuals: Paul had to re-examine his expectations and priorities. Chris dreamed of a successful music career. James went through a heartbreaking divorce. Mike learned to trust God. Lucy looked toward spirituality to help her find fulfillment in life. Each persons story reveals a bridge point to sharing the gospel.The short stories are followed by a nooma-esque sermon delivered by Peabody or Rodgers (somewhere outdoors with beautiful scenery).The DVD comes with a short booklet with a discussion guide and Bible study related to each presentation, so that this could be used in small group discussions. Generally I thought the production value was pretty good on these and I liked seeing glimpses of some real-people's stories. I think this would be a useful video in small groups or even something to pull clips from for a larger group setting. I liked that the videos were short and the emphasis in the discussion guide was on digging into Bible passages.

"Clinton Arnold is a New Testament scholar and the dean of Talbot School of Theology at Biola. I have appreciated his writing on 'the powers,' his commentaries (especially his Power and Magic: the Concept of Power in Ephesians), and his work on the Zondervan Bible Background Commentary. Jeff Arnold teaches high school, is a former youth pastor, and the creator of Unleashed (an intensive training program for Christian teens). The Arnolds have teamed up to produce Short Answers to Big Questions about God, the Bible and Christianity. In the spirit and vein of Josh McDowell's classic Answers to Tough Questions, Short Answers examines the questions many unbelievers, new believers and young people ask.The Arnolds tackle fifty questions ranging from the reliability, inspiration and relevance of the Bible, the problem of evil, the nature of faith and doubt, angels and demons, the after life, the nature of God, Jesus and the Spirit, and how to cultivate your relationship with God. The questions are topically arranged making this more of a quick reference book for particular questions than a cover-to-cover book of theology.This is a simple and practical resource which I think would be perfect for a muture high school student or a young college student. These are short answers to big questions, which means it doesn't answer these questions comprehensively. There is a great deal more that could be said for any number of the issues covered here. But these answers are a good start and sometimes we don't need to have a definitivie and final answer when we face various questions. We just need to know that there are answers. In their preface, Clinton and Jeff Arnold state, ""Short Answers is not meant to be the end of your study; rather, it's the beginning. Let this be the springboard for you to dive into the deep ocean that is understanding God"" (17).And a springboard is what this book is. With intelligent and pastorally sensitive answers the Arnolds make a good case for the reality and reliabilty of the God described in the Bible and insights on how to cultivate our relationship with him I give this book four stars.Note: I received this book in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVHC7U0VVZZXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801016665#wasThisHelpful","RVHC7U0VVZZXL","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bible Stories Gone Crazy! is a Where's Waldo style kid's book which pictures Bible stories all wrong Noah's Ark has a sizable, modern construction crew. The parting of the red sea depicts surfers and other water enthusiasts.  The destruction of Jericho has a big bad wolf, a wrecking ball, lego blocks and KISS.  The David and Goliath story has water guns a hotdog stand, and a world war II plane, The angels in the lion's den with Daniel are circus trainers and the lion are engaged in a range of recreational activities. Jonah and the Monster fish,  the feeding of the five thousand and the paraplegic man let down through the roof have equally ridiculous depictions. And of course each of these stories have teddy bears hidden in the scene.Josh Edwards and Illustrator Emiliano Migliardo have teamed up to help children learn about the Bible stories in this activity based kids book. Each picture has stuff to find, (i.e. different animals, people, activities) and fun things to look at. They also include the scriptural references to each story so that you can talk to your kids about what is right about the picture and what is just plain silly.I have three kids that have enjoyed this book. My four-year-old likes to look at the pictures and find stuff; my six-year-old is better at it and likes to talk about is off about the pictures. My eight-year-old enjoys the book but was initially disturbed that the author and illustrator could mess up these stories so completely. All and all the kids like and it is a fun, non-serious way to get them to engage with the Bible. The illustrations are cartoony and fun and another plus is the durable glossy pages which thus far have survived my seven-month-old.

"I like Christian apologetics book as much as the next guy which means not a whole lot. I do like the idea of them. A reasoned, rational defense of Christian truth is a great idea--something that answers questions and addresses difficulties can be very helpful. But let's be honest, most apologetic works suffer from  some serious defects. A few are overly simple and don't really offer more than trite answers to tough questions. Some books are just dry and boring. Rare is an apologetics book that answers questions well while remaining entertaining.The Atheist Who Didn't Exist or: the Dreadful Consequences of Bad Arguments by Andy Bannister is both highly entertaining and thoughtful. Bannister is the Canadian Director for RZIM.  Hailing from the UK, his prose is full of  British wit, humorous asides and puns. It is rare to read a book where the footnotes are this funny. Bannister takes on the rhetoric of the so-called New Atheists, exposing  bad argumentation, false claims, overstatements made by these antagonistic unbelievers. Richard Dawkins, the late Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett and the Derek Zoolander of New Atheists, Sam Harris, are all skewered by Bannister's masterful wit. He also endeared himself to me by taking several cheap shots at the Toronto Maple Leafs (the NHL team in his adopted city). I haven't read an apologetic book this entertaining since Randal Rauser's The Swedish Atheist, the Scuba Diver and Other Apologetics Rabbit Trails.Each chapter begins with a humorous story (most often a bit fiction) which highlights significant issues with these Atheist's arguments. Bannister then goes on to make some serious points about :what constitutes a good argument, the saneness of Christian belief, the reason why not all gods are the same, the problem with psychological arguments against God, why religion doesn't poison everything, the limits of science's explanatory power, the necessity of God to underscore morality and meaning, why everyone has faith and our reliable knowledge of Jesus. I doubt seriously he would win many converts from died-in-the-wool-atheists, but Bannister certainly demonstrates the warrant for Christian belief.Bannister focuses on the New Atheists, though some of what he writes applies to 'Old Atheism' as well (he peppers his prose with occasional references to Bertrand Russel and others).  What sets the New Atheists apart from the old, is the vitriol they direct at religion and faith. They don't describe religious people as wrong or misguided. They see us as evil. While their arguments against God are not always the most philosophically sophisticated, I've spent enough time on college campuses to hear Dawkins, Hitchens and Harris described as intellectual heroes from bright young people. Bannister does a good job of showing some of the places where their arguments are more flash than substance.However this book doesn't tackle every issue. One of the stickier points for some unbelievers is God's track record. Atheists like Dawkins and Hitchens point to the Canaanite Conquest and some troublesome stories in the Bible and posit that the God of the Bible is a 'moral monster.'  Bannister doesn't explore this issue or theodicy (the problem of evil) in any great depth and yet I think that this is the major issue for many people today.  This signals the limits of this volume. A skeptic may follow and appreciate Bannister's points and still come away with their principle objections untouched.But for an entertaining and thoughtful romp and critique of New Atheism this is well worth reading. I give it four stars.Notice of Material Connection: I received this book from Monarch Books and Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25G6QD3R5AOEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857216104#wasThisHelpful","R25G6QD3R5AOEG","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Recently I was in a gathering of Evangelical pastors. The man sitting next to me  made some comment about 'homosexuality' in our culture and asserted that he 'didn't consider homophobia a bad thing.'  I made no response. The comment stunned me. I understood what he meant. These days any sort of traditional, religious stance is labeled as homophobic by our increasingly affirming culture. He was asserting his right to have conviction and to stand up for the clear teaching of scripture. But 'homophobia'? Really? Is this really how we want to approach the LGBT community? Doesn't perfect love cast out phobias?In No Fear in Love,  Braner exhorts us to share the good news of the gospel in ways that listen, respect, and love. Compassion not motivated by phobias. As Braner says, ""It's fear inside that tells us, I don't want to allow anyone to think differently than I do because that may mean I need to change the way I think, or, If I validate some point they have that is contrary to my own worldview, I might have to rethink my position."" (19). This hunker-down fearful apologetic causes us to speak louder and prevents us from listening to others and responding with compassion.  Braner wants us to face up to our fears, hold on to our convictions, but to approach dialogue with non-Christians from a different space. Reflecting on John 10:10 (The thief comes to steal, kill and destroy; I have come that you may have life and have it to the full) Braner asks, ""Why do we always focus on the theif instead of taking ample time to focus on the full life? What if we started to see the world through a lens of abundance rather than remaining paralyzed by the things we're most afraid of? What would it look like?"" (43).And so this book shares Braner's journey from worldview warrior to someone who has sought to reach out to people different from him by seeking to embody the love of Jesus. The three parts of the book. The first section looks at fear: where Braner has experienced fear and his journey from fear to triumph. Part two examines where Braner has been able to minister beyond fear when his worldview clashed with others. There is a chapter about his learned hospitality to Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses and several chapters on his friendships with Muslims. Part three articulates 'beyond fear' responses to issues that often paralyze our Christian witness, issues like abortion, homosexuality and immigration.I really appreciated the tone and the storybook feel that Braner has. Despite talking about the move from fear to love, Braner has a sense of adventure and the conversations he finds himself in and the relationships he forges, are beyond what most of us can relate to. Braner tours a Mosque in the middle east and even joins a Muslim for prayer there. His love and respectful tone strike a different note than the arrogance his interlocutors were used to, but I can't imagine many of us finding ourselves in similar circumstances. I think I would have be served by a few more mundane examples of Christian witness. Still I liked that Braner tackled hot button issues like Christian-Muslim relations, sensitivity to women considering abortion, gracious witness to the LGBT community and a thoughtful look at immigration.I like what this book signifies and happily recommend it.

"I first became aware of John Walton  my first year in seminary. My Old Testament prof gave a lecture on creation, setting the Genesis 1 account within the context of other Ancient Near East (ANE) literature. The lecture was indebted to Walton and the professor highly recommended Walton's Genesis commentary (in the NIVAC series). When our class break hit, I sprinted the bookstore and bought the commentary before anyone else had a chance. It remains a favorite. I also gobbled up other books from Walton on Ancient Near East cosmology, including The Lost World of Genesis One.The Lost World of Adam and Eve picks up where that volume left off (the first five chapters are a bit of review). As with his earlier book, the chapters are propositions on how to read Genesis sensitively to its ANE context, so a glance at the table of contents gives a detailed summary of the ground that Walton covers here. Walton focuses especially on Genesis 2-3, but also pays attention to the wider context of Genesis 1-5 (and how the hebrew adam functions and the text). He also shows how his reading of the text functions within the rest of the canon of scripture. N.T. Wright provides a brief excursus in relationship to Proposition 19 (""Paul's Use of Adam Is More Interested in the Effects of Sin on the Cosmos Than in the Effect of Sin on Humanity and Has Nothing to Say About Human Origins"").If you are familiar with Walton's work, you will not be surprised by many of his claims here. Walton's project is to get us to read Genesis without expecting it to answer our modern questions. For example, the question of the material origins of the universe are not of particular interest to the Ancient world. Instead Genesis 1 is about the ordering of the world (i.e. the Spirit hovering over the chaos in Genesis 1:2) rather than creating ex nihilo. The text has more to do with functionality than materiality.Walton claims that Adam and Eve's story casts them in the role of archetypes and federal representatives instead of untangling the riddle of human origins (see propositions 6, 8. 9). However this is not meant to imply that Adam and Eve were not also real, historical people. Walton eschews the term myth or mythological because the popular use of the term implies this unreality. He prefers the term imagistic (137) and sees the Hebrew writers using the 'shared symbolic vocabulary' and questions that other Ancient Near East people did (139).In Walton's view, humans were created as male and female with mortal bodies (not ones that became mortal later because of 'the fall'),  were provided for by God and given a role of serving in God's sacred space (200).Because 'creation in Genesis' is about bringing order to world, the serpent is a 'chaos creature' who promoted disorder by convincing Adam and Eve to place themselves at the center of the order. Sin and Death now affects all humanity because of disorder in the cosmos. Jesus is God's plan to restore order to the dis-ordered world (Romans 5).Walton is not a theological liberal (he teaches at Wheaton). He is an evangelical who seeks to read the Bible well. His reading of Genesis is not at enmity with scientific explanations for global and human origins. He reads the text well while trying to unravel the questions and conceptual world of its author and original audience. Where evangelical/secular discussions often devolve into creation versus evolution debates, it is refreshing to have an approach to the text that is more interested in what the Bible communicated to the people it was originally written for. This gives space for some variety within the church on questions of cosmology and removes a potential stumbling block for those who find difficulty reconciling their reading of scripture with science (different sorts of texts, asking different questions).There are implications in Walton's account which will be challenging to those of us with a traditional theological bent (i.e. Walton provides no grounding for creation ex nihilo in Genesis, pre-fall death in humans and nature, etc). Walton gives a careful, biblically sensitive and ANE aware case for his reading. He rolls out N.T. Wright, the world's foremost Pauline scholar, to prove that his reading makes sense of the New Testament usage of Adam and Eve as well. Still there is a significant challenge here for us to work through if we are to remain biblical rooted.Regardless of your stance on the mode of creation (which is not the point), this book will challenge you and get you to dig into the text of Genesis. Walton is a good teacher and brings his readers into the realm of Ancient Near Eastern thought. I give this five stars and recommend it for anyone who wants to go back to Genesis.Notice of material connection: I received this book from IVP in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M6UJ1I80EFZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830824618#wasThisHelpful","R2M6UJ1I80EFZ1","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Normally I review books related to theology, ministry or leadership. Occasionally I review a Children's book. I think this may be the first 'game' I have reviewed: Bible Dominoes from Candle Books. Perhaps you see the dire need for such a game. There has never been a game so detrimental to the faith development of children as the godless game of dominoes.I'm kidding. Dominoes are fun and a great way to practice numbers. So what, makes this 'Bible Dominoes' you may ask? A short paper booklet summarizing ten Bible stories with illustrations drawn from the Candle Bible for Toddlers. The dominoes themselves, which are board-book-quality-cardboard rather than wooden tiles, have pictures from the stories in the book. Each number on the domino is either a digit or a picture (i.e. three ladybugs for the number three) and color-coded-by-number. This allows for easy play with young children who are still learning their numbers.My four-year-old boy enjoys playing this which means any sort of objective critique I have is totally blown. I offer this neat little syllogism: He likes it, I like him, therefore I like the game. Also since we have the children's Bible this is based on and my kids have all read it, it is easy for them to connect with. I give it four stars and happily recommend this, though I am not prepared to offer a serious comparison with the godless dominoes.Notice of material connection, I received this from Kregel Publications in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQQ4XTCWDOKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781281556#wasThisHelpful","R3IQQ4XTCWDOKF","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The prophets don't get the air play that the rest of Scripture does. Isaiah gets rolled out for the holidays, Daniel is featured at at every End Times conference, Jeremiah is selectively quoted, but by and large the prophetic literature is left untouched. No 'Book of the Twelve' on a Sunday morning because the church does not serve Minors!  Those who do try to delve into the prophets are often left confused about historical context. genre, and application.Gary Smith is a Old Testament scholar and commentator who has dug deeply and discovered the treasures that await us in the Prophets. In Interpreting the Prophetic Books: An Exegetical Handbook (part of Kregel's 'Handbooks For Old Testament Exegesis' series) Smith walks us through the process of interpreting the prophets well. The book is designed especially for students who are working with biblical languages, but the working pastor whose Hebrew is gone with the ruach, will find this a fairly accessible guide.Smith begins in chapter one by discussing the nature of prophetic literature. Distinctive features include the temporal categories in prophecy (prophecies describing present events, prophecies about a future era, and the apocalyptic/symbolic). Smith also describes the genres of prophecies and the poetic parallelism within the prophetic literature. Chapter two explores the primary themes of each book. Chapter three identifies the things you will need for interpreting the prophets wisely. These include knowing the historical setting of each book (and Smith provides a brief overview of the pre-exilic prophets of Israel and Judah, the exilic prophets and post-exiilic), prophecy in the Ancient Near East context, awareness of text critical issues, and the best commentaries and resources at your disposal.Chapter four is where the fun starts. Smith discusses various interpretive issues related to the prophetic literature. Including: are prophecies literary or metaphorical? Are they limited by context? Are they conditional or unconditional? Are they about the near or the far future? How the New Testament authors interpret the prophets and is their method legitimate for us? Chapters five and six describe the exegetical process for interpreting the prophets. Chapter five walks through how to 'proclaim the text' (interpreting with an eye for the central principle and application). Chapter six lays out a method which integrates all the earlier chapters.I don't expect exegetical handbooks to be exciting reading. There is too much method and too little metaphor, by the nature of the format. However I found Smith's discuss of themes, historical backgrounds and interpretive issues to be highly interesting. I will likely refer back to this book the next time I preach or teach on the prophets. That will likely be when I roll out Isaiah for the holidays. Oh and other times to, because I really like the prophets. I think it is sad that we don't aquatint ourselves with them more. Maybe with Smith's guide we will.

"Generally when I get a review book, my turn around is pretty quick. However I received Anna Whiston-Donaldson's Rare Bird outside my regular channels and the subject matter seemed to heavy to just jump in. So as my book stacks piled up, I kept putting her book at the bottom of the pile. A book that I'll definitely get to, soon-ish. When I finally picked it up to read in earnest, I read it cover-to-cover in one sitting.This book is a tearjerker. Whiston-Donaldson tells the story of the death of Jack, her twelve-year-old boy that drowned in a near by creek. Most of the book is the story of her, her husband Tim and daughter Margret pick up the pieces in the midst of their grief. Whiston-Donaldson is vulnerable about how Jack's death made her feel self-loathing, deep pain, isolation and broken. She also struggles to hold on to her faith in God through mourning. This memoir is set in the first year since Jack's passing, so you see her walk through the raw pain and shock, and the cloud of grief that settles in afterward. You also see rays of hope break in as she learns to live with the pain. She also comes to trust that Jack is somehow still close to her.This is Whiston-Donaldson's story in her own words. I think many of the short chapters, probably came to life as blog entries (she blogs about her grief online). It is a touching story and I am glad I read it.

"My parents are both nearing retirement. Now that I am pushing forty, that isn't as old as it used to be (It was really old whne I was in my twenties). My mom and dad are still active and I suspect they have many good years ahead. Yet they are aging. My father who hands were always strong now hands me the pickle jar to open for him. My mother is on her own entropic journey. YetAging is a reality and the day will come when I will have to take a more active role in caring for my parents. As a pastor, I walk alongside others, both aging parents and their caretakers. So I was interested to read Nancy Parker Brummett's Take My Hand Again: A Faith-Based Guide For Helping Aging Parents. Brummett walks through issues that adult children face as they care for their parents at the end of life. This includes helping them get their paperwork in order, making decisions about living and care, whether parents should keep driving, and helping them leave a godly legacy.This is billed as a 'faith-based' approach to helping aging parents and is published by Kregel, an evangelical, Christian publisher. For the most part, it isn't particularly 'faith-based' so much as practical and helpful. All the chapters have a Bible verse epigraph and maybe a verse or two is quoted in the text, but the advice that Brummett doles out is helpful for Christians or non-Christians alike. The exception would be the last couple of chapters that speak more directly to the idea of spiritual legacy and eternity. I think the broad appeal to this book is actually good. Most of the issues around issues aren't Christian, or secular. They are human.

"The Bible likes the  ""re"" words. No, I am not talking about: reduce, reuse, recycle. Those words are important but I can't find them in my Bible (perhaps in the Message?). Nor am I talking about the lesser ""re"" Bible words: resisting, reacting and rejecting. Nope, the big, important ones are: redemption, renew, repent, restore, resurrection, reconciliation and redemption.  In Restoring All Things, authors Warren Cole Smith and John Stonestreet argue that these are the most important ""re"" words in the Bible, even if our Christian reputation most often reflects lesser 're' words like rejecting and resisting (17). (Hey did you notice that 'reflect' is also a 're' word?).Smith is the vice president of the WORLD News Group, publisher of WORLD magazine, author and radio program producer. Stonestreet is a speaker and fellow of the Chuck Colson Center for Christian Worldview and host of BreakPoint (with Eric Metaxas) and The Point. They are both conservative (both politically and theologically) but they are gracious in their engagement with the wider culture. Much like Jim Daly, president of Focus on the Family, Smith and Stonestreet have not abandoned the convictions of their predecessors, but embody a noticeable difference in tone. Chuck Colson still looms large in Smith's and Stonestreet's eyes, but Abraham Kuyper is their muse. The epigraph at the head of their introduction is the oft quoted Kuyper quote, ""There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry: 'Mine!'"" (17).  Their fifteen chapters are an attempt to bring the lordship of Christ into every realm of contemporary culture including: poverty, capitalism, abortion, the plight of women and girls in our world, education, restorative justice, race, the prevailing secularism in the university, ministry to the LGBT community and those with disabilities, promoting marriage, caring for orphans, the arts, and local action.  Both Smith and Stonestreet earn their bread as Christian commentators and that is their primary role here; however each chapter tells  the stories of Christians who are active in each of these arenas.Four questions guide their quest on how to bring Jesus into the public square:What is good in our culture that we can promote, protect and celebrate?What is missing in our culture that we can creatively contribute?What is evil in our culture that we can stop?What is broken in our culture that we can restore? (25-26)And so Stonestreet and Smith celebrate the good (like capitalism), look for creative Christian contributions (the arts) call us to put a stop to evil (Abortion on demand, racial injustice) and call us to restore that which is broken (the institution of marriage, the prison system, etc). I really appreciate the stories of people and ministries that Stonestreet and Smith profile. They profile people I respect (i.e. John Perkins, Makoto Fujimura, Bob Lupton) and many others. The stories are my favorite part (and that is part of their strategy of capturing the culture). They take sensible stands on issues that many evangelicals ignore (such as the racism and prison reform). They also have helpful suggestions for readers to research deeper and begin contributing in each arena they discuss.  However on other points, I found the commentary one-sided (such as their passionate defense of Capitalism) or shallow. Perhaps a book that tackles this many issues is bound to be underwhelming in some places. Still I appreciate the aim and irenic spirit they have.

"Every year Wheaton college hosts their annual Theology Conference. These gatherings host scholars discusing pertinent theological topics. While Wheaton and its conference are broadly evangelical, they gather an impressive range of scholars from various biblical, historical or theological disciplines and church traditions. The 2014 conference, The Spirit of God: Christian Renewal in the Community of Faith, has just been published by IVP Academic (edited by Jeffrey Barbeau and Beth Felker Jones). In it, you will find historic, fresh and challenging perspectives on the Holy Spirit and his work in the church and world.Part one of the book, explores biblical and historical perspectives on the Holy Spirit. In chapter two Sandra Richter gives a 'bird's-eye-view' of the work of the Holy Spirit through out Scripture. In chapter three, Gregory Lee compares the pneumatology of Basil of Caesarea and Augustine of Hippo, representative voices from East and West, discovering a great deal of commonality. In chapter four, Mattew Levering examines Thomas Aquainas's theology regarding the Filoque clause that was added to the Western version of the Nicaea-Constantinople creed. In chapter five, Jeffery Barbeau recovers the pneumatological insights implicit in Charles Wesley's conversion (on Pentecost, May 21, 1738--a few days before John Wesley's famous Aldersgate conversion). In chapter six, Oliver Crisp describes the insights of Reformed Pneumatology. Chapters seven and eight describe the Pentecostal movement. Allan Heaton Anderson profiles the global Pentecostal movement, Estrelda Alexander focuses on the African American Pentecostal experience.Part two explores doctrinal and practical perspectives on the Holy Spirit. Chapter nine wrestles with the role of the Spirit in hermeneutics. Here, Kevin Vanhoozer expertly untangles the lack of pneumatology in many approaches to biblical interpretation and presents the crucial, formative role the Spirit has. In chapter ten Amos Yong explores the Spirit's role in creation and Michael Welker does the same for salvation in chapter eleven. Geoffrey Wainwright presents the Spirit's role in the liturgy of the church (chapter twelve). Doug Petersen talks about Pentecostals and social justice (chapter thirteen). In chapter fourteen, Timothy George explores the Spirit's role in Christian Unity. The concluding essay (by Barbeau and Beth Felker Jones) argues three basic premises: (1) The Christian life should reflect our worship of the Triune God, (2) Christian theology is fully pneumatological and (3) Christian practice should be characterized by love.Like all multi-author works, there are some stand out essays. Barbeau's essay about Methodism and Charles Wesley's contributions to pneumatology is quite good. As is Vanhoozer's recovery of the Holy Spirit for hermeneutics. I found both of these chapters insightful--the first for offering an anatomy of conversion with an eye toward the Spirit's work, the second for making hermeneutics spiritual. Yet my favorite chapter is Crisp's presentation on Reformed pneumatology. Crisp hones in on the Spirit's role in uniting us to God (and the Reformed, dogmatic presentation of that), and he offers two principles. The first is the Trinitarian Appropriation Principle (TAP) which posits that where one person of the Trinity is at work, all members are likewise at work (99-100). The Intentional Application Principle (IAP) claims that the aim at every Divine action is the telos, our union with God and the transformation of creation at the end of  the age (101). The second principle names the peculiar pneumatelogical dimension to God's work. While Crisp extrapolates from the Reformed Tradition (Calvin and Brunner, and the various confessions), these are insights appropriate for the whole church. Beyond these three chapters,Unity in diversity is especially important in a volume devoted to the Spirit's work. Of the fourteen contributors to this volume, three are people of color. Three are also people of color. The ecclesial diversity is somewhat greater. One of the contributors is Catholic, there are Pentecostals, Reformed, Methodists, and a Baptist (this book may be more ecclesial diverse than this, I am not sure of everyone's denominational affiliation). Lacking is a Greek Orthodox perspective on pneumatology, though at least a couple of essays present on and interact with Orthodox perspectives (see especially Lee and Levering's chapters). There also is not a Mennonite pneumatology here. I'm not sure what the specific Mennonite contribution would be, but since that tradition has helped shape my Christology and ethics I am curious about how Anabaptism may bring to the discussion.So certainly this group may have been more diverse, but it still does a fairly good job of presenting a good cross section of theological perspectives.This is not a scholarly monograph but a collection of essays. The authors do not agree on every point, in either theology or historical detail. Still books like this give you a taste of various perspectives. I thouroughly enjoyed this romp through (mostly) Evangelical pneumatology. I give this book four stars.Notice of material connection: I received this book from IVP Academic in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NIO4CDXKAY2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830824642#wasThisHelpful","R3NIO4CDXKAY2K","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Batterson is the pastor of the National Community Church in Washington, DC and the author of several Christian bestsellers (The Circle Maker, The Grave Robber, All In, Soul Print, In a Pit with a Lion on a Snowy Day, Wild Goose Chase). While I have read Batterson profitably, even if I have areas of critique. Richard Foth is a retired pastor a generation older than Batterson. When Batterson and his wife Lora arrived in DC to plant a church twenty-one years ago, they developed a friendship with Dick and Ruth Foth after they had Thanksgiving dinner at the Foth home. Foth became a mentor, friend and kindred spirit for Batterson.Foth and Batterson team up to challenge us toward adventure. A Trip Around The Sun shares Foth and Batterson's stories of how they each chose a lifestyle of adventure. In each of the twenty chapters, Foth and Batterson relate parts of their life journey. They tell stories of risk, adventure, learning, prioritizing relationships, investing in family, and trusting God. They aim at inspiring their readers to do the same.Each chapter closes with a succesories-style-slogan summing up a little life lesson. Things like: ""Choose Adventure"" ""When You Follow Jesus, All Bets Are Off"" ""Catch People Doing Things Right"" ""Never Lose a Holy Curiosity"" ""Don't Sacrifice Your Family on the Altar of Success"" ""No One Can Worship God Like You or For You""Both Batterson and Foth are good communicators (or Susanna Foth Aughtmon is, who helped them write this). I underlined things I found personally inspiring. Their challenge towards risk-taking and adventure is something I need to hear. I don't want my life, vocation,or faith to just happen to me. I want to press into life, grab all that God has for me, participate in his mission of redemption for my community and world. I want to love well and live well. To the extent that I feel pulled in that direction by Batterson and Foth, this is a good book. But I can't say that I connected well with what I was reading. Foth talks about being raised as a third-culture kid (before the term existed), of meeting famous people, and his lifestyle of trying to live faithfully. Batterson tells of church planting, taking his kid to a super bowl game, reading two hundred books a year and kissing his wife on the eiffel tower. These accumulated experiences are fun, significant, important, but Foth and Batterson never connect the dots for me in a way I found particularly helpful. They offer slogans instead of a compelling vision.But I did appreciate their relationship and the way their friendship finds their way into each others' stories. Batterson sees Foth as a godly mentor for him, which I am certain he is and has been. In the acknowledgments, Batterson admits that his primary goal for this book was 'to capture Dick's stories for posterity' (201). Dick sings Batterson's praise throughout these pages. I like the way they model a godly mentoring relationship.I give this book three stars. I appreciate their overall message, even if aspects left me feeling flat. Still, I choose adventure. . .Notice of material connection.

"When Christians talk about sex, beware. Popular Christian communicators tend to either fixate on abhorrent sexual practices in our culture or sing horndog-songs-of-praise about the gift of sex. The former use sex as exhibit A in their fear-mongering case about national moral decay. The latter write Christian bestsellers about the joys of marital sex with their 'smoking-hot-wives.'  There is a dearth of Christian literature  which speaks honestly about the gap between our church's and culture's visions of sex. That is part of what makes Redeeming Sex so refreshing.Debra Hirsch is the wife of ,and co-conspirator with, missional guru Alan Hirsch (they co-wrote Untamed, which may be my favorite Hirsch book). She serves on the leadership team of the Forge Mission Training Network and is on the board of Missio Alliance. She brings to the topic of sexuality twenty-five years of ministry experience to and with the LGBT community. The church that She and Alan planted and led in South Melbourne had about 40% of its members come from the LGBTQ community. When Debra came to faith in Christ, she was living and identifying as a lesbian. This book offers her wisdom and insights (and part of her story) about how to approach the issues around human sexuality with grace.The first thing to observe is that Redeeming Sex is not about 'sex.' That is, if you reduce sex to mechanics, genital stimulation and technique you won't find what you are looking for here. This is a book about sexuality. It tackles Christian attitudes toward sex, sexism, gender, our approach the LGBTQ community.Hirsch's book divides into three parts. Part one, ""Where Did All the Sexy Christians Go?"" tackles our attitudes towards sex and sexuality. Here Hirsch steers us past prudish repression, fear-based responses and our tendency to elevate sexual sin above other sins. She points to how the life of Jesus, his relationships with men and woman, affirms the goodness of sexuality.Part two, ""Bits, Bobs and Tricky Business"" looks deeper at Christian views, especially our approach to gender and same-sex attraction. Hirsch describes eight fumdamentals of sex: (1) the term sexuality names the impulse to genital sexuality and social sexuality, (2) sexuality involves the whole self, (3) sexuality is embodied, (4) sexuality celebrates difference, (5) sexuality is fractured, (6)sexuality is deceptive, (7) sexuality needs a chaperone, (8) sexuality is ageless.  These 'fundamentals' describe both the gifts and dangers of sexuality. In the following chapters, Hirsch discusses gender and homosexuality,  Hirsch pleads for dialogue and mutual self understanding of the various positions  on the options available for gay Christians (i.e. healing leading to heterosexual marriage, celibacy and affirmation of gay lifestye). She doesn't commend a one-size-fits-all approach to 'healing homosexuals.' At one point, she observes that heterosexuals are also in dire need of healing in their sexuality because all of us are sexually broken (120).Part three, ""The Mission of Christian Sexuality,"" draws these threads together. Hirsch offers a vision of participating in Christian mission in ways that  are cognizant and honor people's sexuality. Hirsch urges us towards ministry that emphasizes grace, ministry that gets beyond our stereotypes to engagement with real people, affirms the way we all are God's image bearers,  and ministry that is 'centered-set' versus 'bound-set' (not seeking to mark who is in or out, but helping people to take steps to follow Jesus in healthy sexuality where they are).Despite Hirsch's interest in ministry to the LGBT community and her personal history with it, I am not totally sure of her 'theological position.' I know that her church at one point of time worked with Exodus International but became increasingly uncomfortable with their position (Exodus International itself became uncomfortable with Exodus International's position). She quotes affirming authors and promotes dialogue between conservatives and gay Christians, but this isn't a book that tells you what your theology should be. This is a book that urges us to greater love and understanding as we reach out in the love of Christ. This is a message both conservatives and progressives need to hear.I enjoyed reading this book. Hirsch is funny, irreverent and insightful. She doesn't mince words about where we've mussed up a biblical vision of human sexuality AND the gospel of grace. Too often evangelicals are defined in our culture by their views on sexuality (i.e. homosexuality and abortion). Hirsch points us towards deeper love and mission to all who are sexually broken. This doesn't mean that we necessarily abandon our theological commitments; however it means seeking how to love well.

"Wesley Hill self identifies as a gay, celibate Christian. That is, he is same-sex attracted but his theological convictions preclude him from joining in a romantic, sexual partnership with another man. His early book, Washed and Waiting (Zondervan, 2010) tells of his journey of seeking to follow God with his Christian faith and sexual orientation in tension. In his new book, Spiritual Friendship: Finding Love in the Church as a Celibate Gay Christian, he explores the importance of friendship in the Christian life, especially for those in the LGBT community. Hill is bookish and thoughtful. He is also vulnerable about his struggles to form deep non-sexual friendships with other men. Despite the heartache he feels in pursuing the ideal of Christian friendship, he sees it as a gift to gay Christians. And us all.This is a short book, consisting of six chapters, divided into two parts. In part one, 'Reading Friendship', Hill explores the necessity of friendship in the Christian life. Chapter one explores some of the ways that friendship has been marginalized and eclipsed in contemporary culture (6). Hill weaves together a narrative of himself naming his need of friends (on the eve of his confirmation) with theological reflections from Benjamin Myers, C.S. Lewis and seveal literary references. As a gay Christian, he feels the need for friendships acutely but the lack of cultural space for friendships impoverishes everyone.Chapter two explores deeper the special dispensation of friendship and the cultural history of it. Hill points to Bethge and Bonhoeffer's friendship and how they saw how fragile friendship was and the ways it was not recognized by others (25). A later readings of Bethge and Bonhoeffer's relationship claim that it was 'really a homosexual partnership'. Whatever the nature of that relationship (text and subtext), it does speak volumes that later audiences can't conceive of such a close, male friendship without speculating about their sexuality (25,26). Hill  delves into the Christian tradition, exploring the insights on Spiritual Friendship in the writings of twelfth century Cistercian, Aelred of Rievaulx. Aelred wrote On Spiritual Friendship (which this book's title alludes to) and described the value and same-sex, celibate friendships with the context of monastic life. And of course C.S. Lewis's reflections on love, friendship (and homosexuality) are woven through these chapters. Chapter three explores the language of friendship (and family) in the New Testament.Part two explores the practical side of 'living friendship.' Chapter four describes some of the challenges to developing friendships (especially the challenges to those who are same-sex attracted). Chapter five discusses suffering in love and relates a particular difficult loss of a friendship for Hill (when a heterosexual friend got engaged). Chapter six gives six concrete suggestions for recovering friendship as a Christian discipline:Admit our need for friends.Start renewing the practice of friendship with the friends we have (not the idealized friendships we want).Remind ourselves that friendship flourishes best in community.Realize that friendships strengthen communities.Imagine specific ways friendships are doorways to the practice of hospitality and welcoming the stranger.Look for ways to avoid the lure of mobility--staying put and investing in relationships with people where you are.It should be evident from this list that Hill sees the importance of friendship for everyone. It would be impossible to read this book and not feel the call to deeper friendships. Hill is realistic on both the joys and sorrow, blessings and difficulties involved in cultivating friendships. Hill is in tune with how his sexual orientation informs his call to friendship, ""I want to explore the way my same-sex attractions are inescapably bound with my gift and calling to friendship. My question, at root, is how I can steward and sanctify my homosexual orientation in such a way that it can be a doorway to blessing and grace""(79). He also writes, ""My being gay and saying no to gay sex may lead me to more of a friend, not less""(81).This is a great book for the way it roots the challenges and blessings of friendship in Hill's own experience as a gay Christian. Too often sex is seen as the ultimate expression of human love, leaving those who are celibate (by choice or circumstance) feeling less than human. I think many traditional Christian apologetic of marriage and heterosexual love are pastorally insensitive on this point, describing the virtues of marital love as God's design but declaring it off-limits to gay people. Hill presents a vision of friendship that is not 'second best' but considers orientation, vocation and love together. This commendation to friendship is not a 'less-than' proposition but is every bit as life-giving and challenging as marital vows. Those of us who hold to a more traditional stance on marriage need to have this sort of compelling alternative to offer to those who don't have that option.But this is not a book about gay friendships as the subtitle implies. This is a book about friendship. Hill thinks through the implications from his own perspective as a gay and celibate Christian, but friendship is necessary for us all to thrive in our Christian life whether we be single, married, gay or straight. There is so much here! I give this book five stars.

"In recent years the idea of substitutionary atonement is often attacked. Substitution is the hallmark of classic Protestant thinking about the way Christ's cross saves us from our sins; however many are questioning whether the language of substitution does adequate justice to Christ's cross and biblical theology.  In Defending Substitution: An Essay on Atonement in Paul, Simon Gathercole surveys the contemporary discussion on substitution and its merits, the strongest exegetical challenges to the doctrine, and examines two key texts from the Pauline literature that explore the nature of substitution in Paul's thought (1 Corinthians 15:3 and Romans 5:6-8). Gathercole is not attempting to eradicate the insights of substitution's critics. He merely seeks to demonstrate that the language of identifying, representation and apocalyptic views of Christ's atonement do not do full justice to the totality of the atonement or Pauls theology of the cross. Gathercole is bringing the notion of substitution back to the table so we can see a richer picture of Chris't work.This book originated as an SBL paper in 2006 which underwent revision as Gathercole presented the material as a  academic lecture series  at three different institutions (Concorida, Biola and Acadia). Published here as part of the Acadia Studies in Bible and Theology series (ed by Craig Evans and Lee Martin McDonald), it still maintains the accessibility necessary for a public lecture format (10). Gathercole, here, is as brief as he is suggestive of the ways substitution rounds out our contemporary understanding of the atonement.After an introduction, Gathercole's argument unfolds in three chapters, a brief excursus and a conclusion.  In his introduction, Gathercole describes the importance of substitution for both Christian doctrine and pastoral care (14). He defines substitutionary atonement as 'Christ's death in our place, instead of us' (15). While substitution is associated with penal models, Gathercole untangles this, claiming, ""Substitution is logically distinguishable from related concepts such as penalty, representation, expiation and propitiation"" (18). He t sharpens the idea of substitution by profiling the distinctions between substitution and penalty (18-20), representation (20), propitiation (21-2) and satisfaction (22-3). This helps set limits on what Gathercoles claims in this essay. It is conceptually possible to speak of punishment, representation, divine appeasement and satisfaction apart from the idea of substitution. Substitution does not necessarily entail all (or any) of these other ideas. Gathercole closes his introduction with a survey of various contemporary criticisms of subsititutionary atonement (i.e. that it is a legal fiction, an immoral doctrine, its rejection on philosophical and logical grounds).In chapter one, Gathercole turns to what he feels are three strongest antisubstitutionary exegetical cases for the atonement. He profiles the Tbingen understanding of representative 'place-taking,'  Morna Hooker's Interchange, and apocalyptic deliverance. The Tbingen school (building on the work of Gese and Hofius) describes Christ's death through the lens of the Day of Atonement rituals (Lev. 4-5, 16). In the sacrifice of the bull and the goat, the priest and the people were invited to identify in the sacrifice through the laying on of hands. In a similar way we are set free by identifying with Christ in his sacrifice (36-7). Hooker's interchange emphasizes our union to and participation with Christ in his death (41). The apocalyptic view focuses on how Christ's death sets us free from the powers (46). Gathercole praises each of these approaches for the way they handle some biblical texts and describe aspects of the atonement; however, he also observes where each fails to do justice to everything that Paul says on the atonement. One area that he critiques  all of these approaches is in their failure to grapple with how Christ saves from our 'sins' (individual infractions) and not just our 'Sin' (our condition).Chapter two and three provide the exegetical case for where Gathercole sees the language of substitution in Paul. Chapter two focuses on 1 Corinthians 15:3, ""Christ died for our Sins according to the Scriptures."" Chapter three explores the vicarious death of Christ as described in Romans 5:6-8, ""For although we were weak, yet at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might dare to die. But God demonstrates his love for us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."" Between these chapters is a brief excursus on why if Jesus died in our stead, we still die. Gathercole argues convincingly that 1 Cor 15:3 builds on the notion of substitution with Isaiah 53 in the background whereas Romans 5 describes vicarious atonement with Roman and Greek parallels in the background.Gathercole isn't out to debunk contemporary discussions of how we participate in Christ's death and his atoning sacrifice. He has no bone to pick with idenitfication, representation or Christus Victor undderstandings of the atonement. What this essay highlights is the way these, in various ways, fail to describe all that happens in the atonement (and even all that Paul has to say about it). Nor is Gathercole foisting on us an either/or understanding where we ought to see the atonement as substitutionary only. Rather he helps us see a fuller picture of the atonement where in a very real way, Christ died so we don't have to. This book helps illustrate the richness of God's work in Christ. Personally I found it helpful because while I appreciate some of the developments in atonement theology, I've found the blanket criticisms of all things substitutionary puzzling. Another insight I gained from the way Gathercole profiles the alternative views, is he shows how a totalizing vision of the atonement determined what a passage is allowed to say. When our conceptual framework is too rigid we fail to see the full richness of what is described in Pauls theology (or other writers). Gathercole has a fuller atonement theology because he allows for the diversity in the meaning of Pauls material.

"Books on preaching are of two varieties (at least!). Some books focus on method and creative presentations for the preaching moment, others focus on the content and purpose of preaching. Books on the Missional church follow the same pattern. Some books are pragmatic, offering ideas about 'new ways of being church' in the community. Other authors focus on the conceptual framework of ministry shaped by our relationship with the missional God. Of course practical authors hope they are rooted in good theology and conceptual authors see practical application of their ideas, but they have different starting points.When Patrick Johnson, pastor at Frenchtown Presbyterian Church and adjunct professor at Princeton Theological Seminary decided to tackle both topics--preaching and the missional church--he tackled the conceptual side of both, offering a theology of preaching and mission. The Mission of Preaching: Equipping the Community for Faithful Witness is conversant with the discipline of homiletics and  the missional thinkers who have framed the contemporary discussion, people like Newbigin, Bosch, Barth and the Gospel in Our Culture Network (GOCN). He  is thoughtful about how preaching serves God's mission and where it fits in the larger context of the church's witness of Christ. Johnson is suggestive of ways to be more intentionally communal and formational through preaching.Johnson's four chapters represent several conversations about preaching and mission. In the first three chapters, Johnson discusses preaching as witness, the witness of Christian community and the witness of missional congregations.. Chapter four forms a nexus, connecting the early conversations and offers a 'missional homiletic of witness.'Chapter one examines three different approaches to preaching, from three authors, who each see the function of preaching as witness: The Witness of Preaching by Thomas Long, Preaching as Testimony by Anna Carter Florence and Confessing Jesus Christ: Preaching in a Postmodern World by David Lose. Each of these authors argue that witness is the most appropriate way to understand what a preacher does, though they diverge in their theological commitments, assumptions and points of emphasis. Long places witness alongside other images of preaching, outlines how the preacher bears witness, and places preaching within 'the context of Christian community' (4!), Florence repositions homiletic authority on 'the structure of testimony' (as opposed to education, ordination and training. (50). Lose offers an analysis of the epistemological challenges to preaching from post-modernity, adds to the idea witness the concept of confession (communal understanding o the gospel) and places preaching within the context of the church's multifaceted witness (61-62). Johnson closes the chapter with six questions raised by his examination of these three authors and highlights their various answers: (1) What or who is the object of the preachers witness?; (2) By what criteria should one assess the faithfulness of the preacher's witness?; What kind of witness is scripture?; What of ordination?; In what ways does the congregation bear witness?; and How does the witness of the preacher relate to the witness of the congregation?Chapter two examines the witness of the congregation through the lens of Barth's Church Dogmatics (IV,3.2). Barth saw bearing witness as the function of all that the church does. He therefore placed preaching under the larger category of Witness. The church witnesses through praise, preaching, instruction, evangelism, mission, theology, prayer, the cure of the souls, producing exemplary lives, service, prophetic action and fellowship (96-103).  Johnson observes that for Barth, ""witness is not a way of preaching, but preaching is a way of witness"" (103). Barth helps missional preachers move beyond their individual role in preaching to seeing how the act of preaching connects to the mission of the church and calls the church to orient itself toward the world it is called to reach.Chapter three focuses on the witness of missional congregations, using the patterns of missional faithfulness described in Treasure in Clay Jars edited by Lois Barret for the GOCN (Eerdmans, 2004). The eight patterns are: discerning missional vocation, biblical formation and discipleship, taking risks as the contrast community, demonstrating God's intent for the world, dependence on the Holy Spirit, pointing toward the reign of God, exercising missional authority. Johnson walks through each of these patterns drawing out the implications of how missional preaching helps contribute to and give shape to each of these elements in the life of the church.Finally chapter four draws all of these various conversations together. This is longest chapter of the book and in it, Johnson gives his definition of a 'missional homiletic of witness.' He begins under the sub-heading 'preaching' and gradually adds more detail until his heading offers a full definition of what he is calling for:Preaching Confesses Jesus Christ Through a Missional Interpretation of Scripture . . . to Equip the  Community for Witness in the World.Johnson builds on the thoughts of all the thinkers he previous profiled, as well as interacting with other recent proposals for missional preaching (such as Al Tizon's Missional Preaching).Johnson believes that the preacher has a crucial role in aiding and equipping the church for mission; however, his conclusion draws out several practical ideas from his study. First, he urges congregations to take seriously the idea of communal preaching (a shared ministry of preaching in the church). Because preaching is about bearing witness to Christ's ongoing (and finished) work, the ordained ministry is not the authoritative voice for the community but one who points to Jesus and his mission. This would mean that one of the tasks of the preacher would be to nurture other preachers in the community, believing that no, one person has all the necessary gifts and insights to prepare the whole church for holistic mission (219). Secondly Johnson focuses on the necessary focus on Jesus Christ as the content of preaching, and a missional hermeneutic of scripture which explores God's mission for the world (220,221). Johnson also reiterates again how preaching is just one component of the church's multiform witness.As a solo pastor and primary preacher at a small church, I found much of what Johnson says insightful and suggestive. I believe in the necessity of biblical preaching and think it is formative and missional but I have been uneasy with the way the preacher's voice (on any given Sunday, my voice) is privileged over and against others in the congregation. Seeing with Johnson (and Barth) that preaching is just one aspect of the church's witness is helpful . I also appreciate the hermeneutic lens of mission--reading the Bible with an eye for God's mission and seeking ways to exhort the congregation to participate in it. Probably the most challenging aspect of Johnson's proposal for my context, is the communal preaching component. I think I agree with Johnson that this is a good goal to move to, but the culture of my church has been that the called pastor delivers the message. Sermons from occasional members of the congregation or visitors are the exception rather than the rule. A good amount of groundwork would need to precede a move in that direction.This is a demanding read, examining a large swath of practical theology and systematics. It obviously will be useful reading for a preaching class or seminar at a seminary level; yet this book will also be read fruitfully by pastors, preachers and lay ministers. I give this book four and a half stars and recommend it for anyone who cares about the mission and proclamation of the church.Notice of material connection: I received this book from IVP Academic in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JY164R8QTNJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830840702#wasThisHelpful","R3JY164R8QTNJ0","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rachel Held Evans is a popular blogger and author on Christian spirituality. I don't always love her blog posts or short articles, but I've found many helpful. I have shared her posts via social media (along with everyone else you know). Searching For Sunday: Loving, Leaving, and Finding the Church is Evans at her best.Framed around the Catholic church's seven sacraments (Baptism, Confession, Holy Orders, Communion, Confirmation, Anointing the Sick and Marriage), Evans tells of her journey with church.  She tells of her evangelical upbringing, her growing church angst, her involvement in planting a missional/emergent type church, her inclusive vision of communion and meal/life sharing, her experience of the Spirit and entering into the wounds of others and how the mystery of marriage images the Kingdom (and the church).Evans was raised in a conservative evangelical environment. All her books and a good many of her blog posts describe her journey to a more progressive faith. She believes in evolution, argues passionately for inclusion of the LGBTQ community, and reacts strongly against the glitzy mega-church model prevalent in evangelicalism. She also, as her book's structure indicates, moved in a more sacramental understanding of church.One of the reasons why Evans is such a compelling and important voice is how honestly she opens up about her journey and shows empathy to the voices and people who have been marginalized by the church. She isn't a pastor or Bible scholar or theologian. She is a regular person who has struggled with church, theology and spirituality. As somebody who has not made the journey with Rachel to the land of post-evangelicalism, I still consider her an ally and think that she gives voice to what a lot of people feel. People who love the church and have been hurt by it. People who have longed for community and felt excluded. People who tried to walk away from the church but have been drawn back in by the beauty of sacraments and liturgy, on the church's better days.I don't think Evans is right about everything and if I could sit down and have a conversation with Evans I would challenge many of her conclusions. But I appreciate the honesty she has and her journey to the stance she takes. This is a worthwhile read. I give it four stars and recommend it for anyone sorting through what they think of church. I hope that readers of this book will come out the other side to vigorous participation in the local church (as Evans does with the Episcopal church).Notice of material connection: I received this book from Nelson Books via the Book Look Bloggers program in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI0YOGPVR1B0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718022122#wasThisHelpful","RI0YOGPVR1B0","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My interest in Faraway came after reviewing an earlier book by Daniel Mauer, the graphic novel, Sobriety, which explored twelve steps recovery. Here Maurer lends his skill as a freelance writer to aid an old seminary friend, R.K. Kline, in telling his story. Mauer and Kline were both ministers in the ELCA (Mauer left the ministry, Kline is still a pastor today). Faraway tells the story of the openly gay, Kline coming to terms with his sexuality in his teen years. It also tells a horrfiying tale of how he was groomed and recruited into prostitution at the age of 14.It was the 1970s when Kline first discovered his same-sex attraction. With sleepovers and an active 'gaydar' he began to experiment sexually with other boys. One boy from school, named Tim groomed him and introduced him to Ray, the adult with a van who would become his pimp.Some of Kline's experiences as a teenage hustler were enjoyable to him. Others were profoundly damaging and frightening. He found himself the victim of perversion and violence. But he also befriended two other boys, Stevie and Squirrel, who became his community and protection on the street. Kline would tell his parents he was sleeping over at a friend's family house, and then turn tricks in the park with Stevie and Squirrel.By the end of the summer of 1975, Squirrel was beaten violently by a police officer, nd a few weeks later died in a tragic accident. By the fall, Stevie died of alcoholism on the street. Kline is suicidal (saved only because the gun he had access to was an 1860 replica muzzle loaded pistol and it was hard to commit suicide while drunk).This isn't what you call a happy story and theologically I have my misgivings (I pastor in a denomination that is welcoming but not affirming of an LGBTQ lifestyle. But this is a human story. Kline struggles with the way his same-sex attraction cut himself off from the community (suburban Missouri was not exactly supportive of alternative lifestyles in the mid 1970s). As awful as it was for a fourteen-year-old to turn tricks, he finds acceptance with his fellow street hustlers. There was something broken in the lives of Stevie and Squirrel but there was also something beautiful about Kline's friendship with them and the way he pays tribute to their lives.This is a well written memoir. It is also graphic and disturbing. There are plenty of folks I would not recommend this book to and would issue disclaimers to those who I would. But it a real--ugly and beautiful and ultimately redemptive story. It is sad that Kline and his three friends were sexually misused in their teens. Sadder to that it still happens.

"The Old Testament is Scripture, but not easy reading. It is full of disturbing passages, strange laws and unsavory characters. Anyone who would dare take up and read will be faced with questions, interpretive challenges and hard texts. Matthew Richard Schlimm has written an entertaining and informative book exploring the difficult questions and  how to read the Old Testament well. This Strange and Sacred Scripture: Wrestling with the Old Testament and Its Oddities is basically a undergrad level exploration of the First Testament. It was as fun to read as David Lamb's God Behaving Badly, though far more comprehensive. Schlimm doesn't cover the wisdom literature or prophets much, but he does a good job of exploring law, narrative and various themes that run through the Hebrew Bible. His purpose is not to make the Old Testament simple for us to digest, but to help us grapple with it in a more substantial way.Schlimm's twelve chapters take us through various issues that relate to the Old Testament. Chapter one discusses the uneasy history Christians have had with the Old Testament. Chapters two and three explores the creation account. Chapter four describes the 'R-rated' stories of the Old Testament'--the messy reality that the scriptures inhabit where even the saints behave badly. Here Schlimm describes how stories work on us as readers. For example, many failed attempts at reading through the Bible have been wrecked on the shoals of the book of Numbers. Schlimm is worth quoting at length:As we read Numbers, we shouldn't expect to feel uplifted. We shouldn't look for inspiration. Instead, we should expect to feel like the Israelites did out in that desert wasteland. Ironically, you're reading Numbers well if you're sick of the characters and want to stop reading. You are reading well because in that moment you begin to understand in new ways what things were like for the Israelites and for God.Through the trials of reading Numbers, we can emerge as better people. Someone might rattle off a cliche like ""Count your blessings."" Or we might admit, when we stop and think about it, that complaining is not a great way to go through life. However, many of us need something more to put our grumbling aside.When we read Numbers, something interesting happens. We are exposed to constant complaining. We are forced to suffer alongside Moses and the people. We grow sick and tired of their bitterness. And hopefully, complaints in our own mouths begin to taste like ash. (56)Chapter five explores the violence in Old Testament texts, such as the imprecatory psalms and Joshua and Deuteronomy. Schlimm addresses several faulty premises that Christians bring to interpreting these texts: (1) that we should imitate Bible characters' actions, (2) that we should imitate God, (3) that we should apply every text to our individual life, (4) that we should read individual passages in isolation from one another, and (5) that we should have an answer for every question raised by disturbing texts. Against these, Schlimm invites us to a way of interpreting passages that is humble, communal and dialogical.Chapter six tackles gender and the role of women. Schlimm admits that the Old Testament is androcentric and sometimes misogynist; however he refuses to give up the sacredness gender or the sacredness of the Bible. He reads egalitarian texts like Genesis 1:26-27 in tension  with texts like Leviticus 27:1-8 where women are valued as less than men. Far from ignoring these texts, he grapples with the contradiction and asks God why a text like Lev 27:1-8 is in Bible. Schlimm goes on to explores the nature of Biblical law (chapters seven and eight), the multifaceted nature of truth (chapter nine), sadness and anger of God expressed in the Old Testament (chapter ten), God's wrath (chapter eleven) and the authority of the Hebrew Bible (chapter twelve).I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Schlimm imparts his love for the Old Testament. His prose is winsome. He doesn't provide i easy answers on how to sort through genres, horrifying tales and difficulties. Instead he invites us to a conversation with the Old Testament where we name the exclusion of Ezra, place it conversation with the inclusion of Ruth (and the apostle Paul). Schlimm isn't bothered by contradictions and the sometimes disparate witness of the Old Testament. For him it is bringing these texts into deep conversation and wrestling with them that we begin to see the truth about God and ourselves. Rather than avoiding strange and difficult texts, Schlimm posits that the texts that are most difficult for us, may be the texts that we most need to hear. If you find the Old Testament difficult and are not always sure what to do with certain passages, this will be a good book for you. Of course by focusing on oddities and interpretive difficulties, Schlimm doesn't spend as much space exploring covenant, mercy, and justice as he may otherwise. This would be a lopsided introduction to the Old Testament if read as a stand alone treatment, but for those who have read and struggle, this is pretty great. I give it four stars.Notice of Material Connection: I received this book from Baker Academic in exchange for my honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TIELYGFQJL00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801039797#wasThisHelpful","R1TIELYGFQJL00","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the challenges of biblical interpretation is the way that the Bible describes God. In some places in the Bible, God is above the heavens and there is none like him. In other places, God seems like any other earthly ruler--sitting on a throne,waging ware, standing, laughing, getting angry. The difficulty of sorting out God's godhood from his human descriptions has been an issue that theologians have wrestled with from the early centuries of Christianity. We have a lot we can learn from the Ancient theological approach to ScriptureMark Sheridan is a Benedictine monk and vice rector and dean of the faculty of theology at the Pontifical Athenaeum of St. Anselm in Rome. He has written several monographs and edited the Genesis 12-50 volume of the<em>ancient Christian Commentary on the Scripture.</em>In<a href=""http://www.ivpress.com/cgi-ivpress/book.pl/code=4064""> <em>Language For God in Patrisitic Tradition: Wrestling with Biblical Anthropomorphism</em></a>, Sheridan examines ancient biblical interpretation, exploring what the church fathers have to teach us about reading Scripture andtheir theology of God.One of the hallmark's of patrisitc tradition is the commitment to interpreting the Bible in a manner ""worthy of God"" and ""useful for us."" Anthropomorphism and anthropopathism in the Bible, make God seem ""too human."" Sheridan demonstrates that the general patristic consensus was that God was wholly unlike humanity; however where the Bible involves human matters, 'it carries the human intellect, manners and way of speaking' (30). Thus the otherness of God is preserved, but the fathers had a way of parsing those places of scripture where God seemed all-to-human.Sheridan's eight chapters form a tight and compelling argument. In chapter one, Sheridan reads Numbers 23:19,""God is not a man nor as the son of man to be threatened,"" in tension with Deuteronomy 1:31."" [He]carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place."" This illustrates the way in which the Bible talks about God differently, in reference to Godself and in relationship to us in the economy of salvation. Sheridan shows how the fatherspicks up this distinction.In chapter two through four, he illustrates the major influences on the patrsitic interpretive tradition. Chapter two explores the way the Greek philosphical tradition handled the capricious, too-human pantheon of gods in the Homeric epics. Ideas about what is 'worthy of God' in Plato, have their influence on the theological development of the church's early centuries. Chapter three describes the Hellenized Jewish interpretation of scripture (especially Philo) and they handled passages where God was too human and too passionate. Chapter four examines the New Testament interpretation of the Old Testament and the manner in which the patristic tradition saw their interpretive strategy in continuity with Paul and the gospels. Chapter five surveys major early Christian writers and the various ways they employed the ""worthy of God"" strategy in interpreting the Bible. While there are differences between early theologians, and regions (Alexandria and Antioch in their approach to 'allegory'), there is a broad consensus on what is worthy of God and what isn't. Passages whre God 'gets angry' are placed inside a larger theological frame where God is impassible and<em>divine emotional outbursts</em>are merely connote the human experience of God's wrath.Chapter six highlights three cases which exemplify patristic interpretation: Genesis 1-4; Genesis 16 (the Hagar and Sarah story); and the conquest narratives. The creation story (and fall) has a number of anthropomorphisms. Sheridan demonstrates the way ancient interpreters bracketed out any biblical interpretation that would be demeaning to God's dignity. The Sarah/Hagar story presented a different challenge. Because this story related Old-Testament saints behaving badly (i.e. Sarah and Abraham using and abusing Sarah's slave), it was interpreted variously as an allegory or a morality tale. The conquest narratives were allegorized because of patrsitic discomfort with the way God commanded the total destruction of the Canaanites (and what that implied about God's character). Chapter seven shows how the Patrisic tradition handled he imprecatory Psalms.Chapter eight, Sheridan's final chapter, describes what he thinks modern interpreters ought to learn from our ancient counterparts. Sheridan holds up as sound, the patristic 'rule' of interpreting anthropomorphisms and difficult texts in a manner that is 'worthy of God and useful to us.' At various points our interpretations will diverge with patristics because we bring a different set of questions and assumptions to the text (i.e. ancient interpreters sought to defend the Bible against ancient<em>mythos</em>whereas modern interpreters seek to set the creation story with in the context of Ancient Near East literature). Yet Sheridan also challenges us to learn from patristics how to move beyond what the narrative of scripture describes to ask what it means for our lives (i.e. differences in contemporary and ancient approaches to Genesis 16). At other points, Sheridan thinks that we ought to listen keenly to the questions that patristic scholars are asking. Contemporary evangelical scholars read the conquest accounts literally, seeking to minimize their destructive nature (i.e. hyperbole in the text, reading the destruction in Joshua alongside the gradual conquest in Judges, etc). Sheridan argues we have a lot to learn form the ways the fathers asked what divine conquest says about the character of God, and how to interpret these sections in a <em>worthy</em>manner. He sees similar value in allowing patristics to inform our understanding of the imprecatory psalms (and how we are to pray them).Sheridan offers a great overview of patristic interpretation and is incisive in his analysis of the way the ancient church interpreted scripture. The notion of interpreting in a manner 'worthy of God' seems a noble aim and certainly ancient authors as diverse as Origen, Tertullian, Augustine, John Chrysostom, Ambrose and Gregory of Nyssa each helped untangle anthropomorphisms for us.Yet as valuable as I find this study and patristic interpretation I am not totally convinced. First off, and this may just be my evangelicalism talking, I am suspicious of where allegory ignores or replaces the literal meaning of the text. In pastrictic interpretation the literal meaning<em>sometimes</em>provides clues to the deeper meaning of the passage. At other times, the deeper, allegorical meaning is used to replace or explain the literal sense away. I have less problem when the text is metaphorical in its anthropomorphisms (i.e. God walking in the garden, etc) but feel the rub a little more when a whole section of sacred scripture (like the Canaanite conquest) is spiritualized because the early interpreters saw this piece of Israel's history as beneath God. I admit that the literal interpretation of Canaanite destruction opens up questions about God's character and goodness that are difficult; yet I think employing allegory is too easy and too readily shirks the difficulty of wrestling with the text. Additionaly, I worry about the ways in which the Greek philosophical tradition informs the patristic understanding of what is 'worthy of God.' I applaud the way the fathers sought to guard the image of God from seeing God as a capricious person; however I am uncertain that ancient Christian understanding of Divine immutability always does justice to the God revealed in Jesus Christ.My caveats name where I sit loose to some patristic conclusions, but. I think we have a lot to learn from them and Sheridan provides a great and accessible overview of their interpretive approach. I would have found this a helpful book in seminary as I sought to untangle historic interpretation. This book is sufficiently non-technical for the the general reader. I give this 4.5 stars and recommend it for anyone interested in theological interpretation, historical theology or spiritual exegesis.Notice of material connection: I received this book from IVP Academic in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QK0KLLDRUGJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830840648#wasThisHelpful","R2QK0KLLDRUGJJ","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first picked up a book from Enzo Bianchi, I had no idea who he was. As the founder and prior of the Bose Community (a lay monastic community in the Benedictine tradition) and as consultor of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity (appointed by Pope Francis in 2014), he is a major voice in monstic and Christian spirituality. Lectio Divina: From God's Word to Our Lives is now the third book I have read from him (and the third book translated to English and published by Paraclete Press). In each book, Enzo has challenged me to new depths in my spiritual life.Bianchi's treatment of Lectio Divina was more than I  expected. Most other Lectio Divina books I have read, either give simple practical guidelines and a method for the practice, or are gleanings from the author's private devotional life. Bianchi does give practical advice on how to practice (especially in part two of this book) but he also gives a fuller treatment of the hermeneutics of spiritual interpretation. He references Ratzinger, De Lubac, Urs von Balthasar and others, as well as a range of patrisitic sources (Augustine, Origen, Ambrose, etc). For Bianchi, the practice of Lectio is not a subjective, privatized word from God, but an attentive reading (attending to the Spirit, to Christ and the text). He uses critical methods; yet reading in this way, is always about spiritual encounter.In part one, Bianchi commends spiritual interpretation. In chapter on,e he describes Origen's exegetical method. Origen is representative of the Christian biblical exegesis practiced until the sixteenth century, before the critical era  began and we had 'simply one possible way of reading the Bible' (9). So chapter two explores the relevance of spiritual exegesis for today, arguing for the Bible's centrality in the life of the church, and the way it testifies about Jesus throughout the canon; however this isn't a repudiation of critical gains in reading the Bible, though historical method is dethroned of ultimate importance.  In chapter three, Bianchi explores God's Word--Jesus Christ--and helps us think through how the Bible is also God's word ( both inspired and human, reflecting the incarnation). Chapter four examines the unity of scripture and the way both testaments testify about Christ its center.  In chapter five, Bianchi connects spiritual interpretation with the classic  four-fold sense of scripture (literal-historical, allegorical, tropological, and anagogical). He relates each of these four levels of meaning to the four stages of Lectio Divina (Lectio, Meditatio, Oratio, and Contemplatio). This was a new insight for me.Part two is less conceptual and more practical. After giving a brief overview of the history of biblical interpretation in chapter six, Bianchi spends chapter seven walking his readers through the practice of Lectio Divina: (1) set aside a time and a place,  (2) pray for the Spirit to open up the Word to us, (3) Read with an eye to the literal-historical meaning of the text, meditating and investigating the scripture to get at its deeper meaning, (4) pray and enter into the dialogue with the text in order to make more room for the Lord in your life, and finally (5) contemplate the passage and and have our gaze transformed into God's way of seeing. Chapter eight describes challenges during Lectio Divina (i.e. that Catholics have experienced a 'long estrangement from the Bible, the need for dailiness, and failure to read the Bible critically, engaged and Christologically. Finally chapter nine describes other challenges to practicing Lectio Divina (the text's otherness, the need for community, etc.).Of the three books I have read from Bianchi, this may be my favorite. Bianchi takes us on a journey through patristics, spiritual theology, exegesis, contemporary Catholic theology and hermeneutics. Bianchi synthesizes these disciplines well and I came away with some fresh insights. I appreciate the way Bianchi connected the practice of Lectio Divina to the theology of  spiritual exegesis operating in the church for centuries. I loved that he incorporated critical insights and study into meditation. In Bianchi's approach, the Lectio part of Lectio Divina involves reading with sensitivity and accuracy, discovering the intent and message of the original text (the literal-historical meaning). Meditatio involves study--checking commentaries, study notes, etc--in order to discover the theological and canonical connections. This, and Bianchi's insistence that Lectio Divina is a communal discipline, guards from its practice becoming purely subjective and private. Bianchi's approach is theologically sophisticated.And that is perhaps the weakness of this book.  I tracked my way through Bianchi's theology of scripture, Revelation, biblical exegesis, patristics and Christology. Had this been my first trek through these disciplines, I would have found this a hard read. Okay, I still found it a hard read, but I think a complete neophyte would be a little lost in places. I recommend this book highly to readers of theology and Christian spirituality, but I think Bianchi's Echoes of the Word (Paraclete, 2013) may be more accessible for the general reader. I give this book five stars!Notice of material connection, I received this book from Paraclete Press in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UZV0VN181R02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612616429#wasThisHelpful","R1UZV0VN181R02","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes we approach issues ready to do battle. Talk-radio warns us of a subversive liberal agenda while the rest of the media caricatures conservatives as money-grubbing, hate-mongering xenophobics. Often faith gets co-opted in debate.Evangelicals are defined, in many eyes, by their stance on abortion and traditional marriage. Progressive Christians are written offfor their lack of theological substance. Is there a way to 'stop taking sides'? Can we approach issues without drawing battlelines? Is it possible to listen and hear the good on all sides of an issue and still offer a critique? This is the approach that Scott Sauls commends in<a href=""http://files.tyndale.com/thpdata/images--covers/500%20h/978-1-4964-0093-2.jpg""></a><em><a href=""http://tyndale.com/Jesus-Outside-the-Lines/9781496400932#.VTq-qyHBzRY"">Jesus Outside the Lines</a>. </em>He aims at approaching issues and people in ways that are generous and tolerant andwith clarity and conviction. This doesn't mean watered-down niceness anymore than having strong beliefs means we have licenses to be jerky.<img class=""alignleft"" src=""http://files.tyndale.com/thpdata/images--covers/500%20h/978-1-4964-0093-2.jpg"" alt="""" >Saul' has two parts to his book. In part one he focuses on issues that divide Christians from one another. These include Red and Blue politics, abortion and justice for the poor, personal faith versus the institutional church and our different approaches to money. Sauls can find things on both sides of these issues to affirm. I liked his chapter on money because he points to a middle way between pursuing financial blessing and feeling guilty about our enjoyment of money. I appreciate that the extremes of prosperity and poverty are to be avoided (though I still weigh sacrificial giving/living a little more).In part two, Sauls promotes a generous response to those 'outside the lines of Christianity.' He argues that Christians should be quick to affirm the good in culture while still offering our critique. He gives a plea for us to emphasize both accountability for oppressors<em>and</em>compassion for victims. He challenges us to not write off eachother as<em>mere</em>hypocrites but to see that we are all<i>works in progress.</i>Sauls gives a traditional defense of human sexuality but one that is sensitive to the LGBTQ community and the ways that they have sometimes been treated by the Christian community. He showcases how Jesus imparts hope for a brighter tomorrow<em>and</em>allows us to take a realistic look at the suffering of the world. Saul also takes us beyond Self-Help culture, helping to see ourselves how God sees us (which affirms the individual without enthroning her).This is a readable and sensitive book. I appreciated the way that Sauls navigated the cultural polarities and highlighted a third way. His opening chapter, begins with an anecdote where one of his sermons caused one person to dismiss him as a right-wing extremist while another congregant thought he was a left-wing Marxist (3). Often the way of Jesus is unsatisfying to all parties on the battlelines. But it is a better way!Sauls does not offer an exhaustive treatment of every important issue. Nor does hename every battleline. Two big issues that I think white, conservative evangelicals need to approach with generousity are systemic racial injustice and climate change. The past few years has highlighted ways in which our legal system treats minorities. Think Ferguson and similar tragic encounters between African Americans and police and the ongoing problem of minority mass incarceration. The dismissal of climate change by those on the Right and the alarmism of the Left reveals the way special interest has sometimes framed the contours of debate.

"Testimony has a significant impact on the faith development of adolescents. As young people learn to tell their story of faith, it cements their understanding of God, fosters identity formation and allows the wider community to feedback into their experience and when necessary offer a critique. Amanda Hontz Drury explores what happens for youth as they testify, and puts forward a theology of testimony and offers practical advice on how churches can incorporate intentional, public testimony into youth ministry.Drury has fifteen years of youth ministry experience and is professor of practical theology at Indiana Wesleyan University. In Saying Is Believing: The Necessity of Testimony in Adolescent Development, Drury offers a similar case for testimony as Thomas Long's Talking Ourselves into Being Christian, though she is much more sophisticated in her use of sociological research and theology than Long (cementing for me, yet again, that the most interesting work being done in the area of practical theology comes from the youth ministry world). Having read both Long's and her book, I would say this is the better book. I also see a similarity between Drury's project and Brandon McCoy's Youth Ministry from the Outside In which builds off social construction theory and helps youth 'thicken' their connection to God's story as they learn to share their own. There are differences between their approaches but I think enough of an overlap that these books are worth reading side by side.Drury draws on her experience in youth ministry and her holiness heritage (where a mic in the aisle meant we'd hear from more than just the pastor). As you would expect, she has anecdotes about the telling our particular faith story, but at its core this is a book that is well-researched, sophisticated and theologically thoughtful. Drury doesn't simply make claims of the necessity for testimony but engages serious research. Her chapter on a 'Theology of Testimony' synthesizes the perspectives on witness in Phoebe Palmer (the Nineteenth century, Holiness evangelist) and Karl Barth. This is a creative and thoughtful treatment on testimony.The book's five chapters lay out Drury's case for testimony. Chapter one forms her introduction. Chapter two discusses the findings of the National Study of Youth and Religion which illustrated that young people are inarticulate about their beliefs. Drury argues that teaching youth to speak about their faith strengthens their understanding of Christian truths and their grasp on where God has been active in their lives. Chapter three utilizes the insights of narrative psychology to illustrate the importance of telling one's own story for identity formation. Chapter four outlines a theology of testimony. Here Drury creatively synthesizes Phoebe Palmer and Karl Barth in attempt to give a full account of the role and function of testimony for the Christian life. Palmer considered herself a 'Bible Christian' and had little use for 'theological technicalities.' Barth for his part, would be dismissive of Palmer's subjectivity (95); however Drury points out that Barth corrects Palmer in offering a Christocentric spirituality focused on Jesus rather than the individual self (97) and Palmer corrects Barth in placing personal testimony within the domain of biblical witness (98-9). Drury places these thinkers in dialectic and illustrates that testimony is a Christian call, an expression of gratitude for what God has done, and is enabled and empowered by the Holy Spirit. Her final chapter offers her pragmatic approach to implementing testimony with North American adolescents.The theological core of this book is applicable far beyond the realm of youth ministry. All ages and stages would benefit from intentional space for testimony; however the way that learning to tell our story impacts our grasp on reality and our self-understanding is of peculiar importance for adolescents. Drury offers practical insight in how to incorporate testimony into youth ministry. As a pastor who is concerned that the youth of my church grow in their knowledge of Jesus and in relationship to Him, I appreciate Drury's take.This book is more 'theological' than your typical youth ministry book. Drury isn't offering a ""How to"" so much as providing a conceptual framework and a re-orientation around the theme of testimony. Obviously this is a good 'student' book for those who are learning and thinking about youth ministry but I hope it finds itself in practitioner hands. I also think her theology chapter is widely applicable beyond youth.

"Peter Leithart is a fun theologian. As professor of theology and literature at New Saint Andrews College, contributing editor for Touchstone and president of Theopolis Institute, his books often wed theology with cultural, literary or historical connections. Traces of the Trinity showcases the kind of creative theological thinking I've come to expect from Leithart as he probes creation and the human experience to see signs of the Triune God.Leithart picks up on the tradition of looking for vestiga Trinitatis--traces of the Trinity--clues to the Triune life, the imprint of perichoresis (vii). He is not trying to  argue compelling evidence for the Christian concept of God apart from special revelation. Leithart takes special revelation as his starting point, affirming that the God revealed in scripture is revealed as Trinity. He then works backwards, and seeks to trace God's presence in His creation.The themes of perichoresis and mutual interpenetration runs straight through this book. In chapter one, Leithart picks up on the Cartesian distinction between the Self and the outside world and shows how though these realms are distinct, they overlap and penetrate one another (i.e. our bodies are outside our mind but part of the self, we need to consume matter and eliminate to remain alive in ourself, etc).  Chapter two describes the individual and her relationship to society. As with Cartesian dualism, Leithart affirms the distinction between individuals and society but shows how each domain contributes to and defines the other.  Chapter three discusses the visceral interpenetration of sex and the accompanying physical, spiritual and psychological intermingling. Chapter four examines the way the past and the future inhabit the present (the past through memory, through structures and culture making, the future through possibility and the telos of things).  The inter-textual nature of words and languages also evidences an interplay between shared language and individual expression (chapter  five), as does music (chapter six). Chapter seven implies an ethic of hospitality--making room for the other--which underlies human community and chapter eight probes concepts, logic and relationship further. Chapter nine is where Leithart speaks specifically about Trinity and also the perechoretic unity in the thing called church.This brief summary points at the breadth of Leithart's survey (all within about 150 pages) but the beauty of this book is in the details:The world is not patterned by mutually opposing things that need to be kept in ""balance."" Things are much more intricately interlaced. The world is designed according to a pattern I've called ""mutual indwelling"" ""reciprocal habitation"" ""interpenetration."" I've used words like ""intertwining"" and ""interleaving"" and ""twists"" and ""swirls, whirls, curves and curls."" I've written of how things circle back on themselves, of Mbius strip and Celtic knots. I claim to see the pattern everywhere--in physical reality, in language, sounds, sex, personal relations, ethics, and the concepts we form to understand the world. (129).This romp through philosophy, politics, culture, music, sex and ethics highlights the interconnection between the alleged poles. This is poetic theology and an enjoyable read. Leithart is at times concrete and in other places abstract, which makes this book somewhat complex in its execution, but it is tightly argued and well thought through. It is worth tracing Leithart's argument all the way through.Leithart is careful to call these instances of perichoresis 'traces.'  Leithart's project doesn't appear to be another Thomist attempt at 'analogy of being' (at least how I understand it). This seems far less ambitious than that. Leithart starts with the Divine life (as described in the Bible and the theological tradition) and argues that the inter-relationship between Father, Son and Spirit gives us a window into the nature of creation.  That creation images God is discernible only to those who know the God whom they seek.  I give this book four-and-a-half-stars and recommend it for anyone interested in the nature of revelation.Notice of material connection, I received this book from Brazos Press in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27P73HJ6S42PD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1587433672#wasThisHelpful","R27P73HJ6S42PD","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The synthetic, the industrialized, and the mass-produced have fallen on hard times. Everywhere you look there is a rediscovery of natural and sustainable methods. People love local, organic vegetables, artisan bread, real chocolate, good coffee, craft-brew and good music.  John Joseph Thompson explores this cultural shift away from mass-production toward more wholesome fare and asks what the implications are for the spiritual life. Is this a re-discovery of something important here that will re-enliven our vision of the Christian faith?Jesus, Bread and Chocolate is much more than an exploration of three of my favorite things. Thompson explores a range of plastic-y products ranging from twang-less pop-country music, bread for the masses, chocolate that is more chocolaty than chocolate, bad coffee, and cheap beer.  Alternatively, he holds up honest, raw music which has a healthy dose of reality (twang), artisan bread crafted with love and care and good ingredients, pure chocolate, the perfect cup of coffee and a cultivated taste for the local and the small. Interwoven with these chapters on less-industrialized fare are reflections on justice, gardening and Thompson's story.  This book chronicles his personal journey from consumer to enjoy-er. Thompson explores how the turn away from the industrialized, commodified, and mass-marketed prepares us to drink deeply from the real Jesus.I think two different groups of people will appreciate this book. Because Thompson is attentive to justice (i.e. environmental impact, farming practices, etc), he presents a vision of faith and life that is responsible and responsive to the world around him. Thompson adds his voice to a chorus of evangelicals who are starting to be thoughtful about creation care, especially in his chapter on organic gardening. Secondly, this is a sensual book. Thompson really enjoys good sounds (music), good smells, and good eating. This is a foody-faith-buffet, inviting others to come and enjoy the feast. In both regards, Thompson imparts a thoughtfulness about what we consume and what nourishes us. I like Thompson's reflections and where he calls me to enjoy the good things in life. I also think he is appropriately attentive the way industrialized food (and faith) fail people. Certainly there are other domains of the Christian faith that Thompson leaves under or unexplored, but I appreciate this book for what it is.  The link to biblical theology could be clearer and Thompson's cultural analysis could be more incisive (though he points in good directions). In the end, this is a personal journey and Thompson's own reflections around food and faith. It is also a popular level book. For that, I give it four stars.Notice of material connection: I received this book from the publisher via the booklook bloggers program.

"I first heard of Noel Castellanos when I attended the Christian Community Development Association (CCDA) conference in Atlanta over a decade ago. Castellanos shared the stage with John Perkins and Wayne Gordon and showed how the CCDA song may be sung in a Latin key. Today Castellanos is now the CEO of CCDA. I have a deep appreciation for the work CCDA does in transforming whole communities. Decades before other evangelicals were talking about holistic mission and incarnational ministry, the CCDA folks were doing it, seeking to live out God's justice in neighborhoods. So when I saw that Castellanos published Where the Cross Meets the Street I knew this was a book I had to read, but as much as I love CCDA, I wasn't expecting to enjoy this book as much as I did. CCDA publications often focus on introducing readers to the philosophy behind their approach. Which is good but that gets repetitive. Certainly Castellanos also cares about delineating his approach to ministry but this isn't a book outlining ""the eight components of Christian community development"" or the ""three r's.""  This isn't so much a book about components or principles, though Castellanos is thoughtful about the dynamics of incarnational ministry and he imparts some principles for urban mission from Nehemiah.  This is much more Castellanos's own story of his coming to faith and eventually his life work in Christian community development.Castellanos narrates his early life in Texas and California. He was born to Tejano parents. In California, Castellanos worked at losing his Spanish speaking. Though raised Catholic, he invited Jesus into his life at a Young Life camp.  After attending Whitworth College, Castellanos found himself increasingly drawn to those on the margins.  This culminates in his relocating to Chicago's La Vilitta neighborhood (after attending the first CCDA conference). Ministry in a Latino context helped Castellanos reconnect with his own cultural heritage and put him in a place of humility as he had to rely on his neighbors to help him to relearn Spanish. He learned things as he sought to minister in his context. For example, his ministry among neighbors who were undocumented immigrants sensitized him to the need to advocate on their behalf:I am shocked and appalled by the insults l against undocumented men, women and children in our nation. Yes, they have broken laws to be in this country but they also have been hired, used and of abused by employers and our economic system in need of cheap labor. Because of their vulnerable status, it has become common to scapegoat and hurl insults at them without regard to the fact that they are human beings created in the image of God. Most shocking is that they types of insults are sometimes made by those claiming to be followers of Christ.  (141)Castellanos doesn't stop at immigration reform but advocates on behalf of the poor and flawed in all sorts of ways. When he voices his concern about injustice in our country, it is not some arm-chair liberal diatribe or paternalistic platitude. These are issues Castellanos has come to care about through walking alongside people in pain and making his home with them.Castellanos is passionate about effecting systemic change--not just raising individuals but whole communities. This puts him on the same page as his mentors John Perkin and Wayne Gordon. And Castellanos shares other traits with these two men. Like them, Castellanos has invested his life in neighborhoods and people that others had written off. Like them he has stared down difficulties, struggle and false starts but he remains hopeful and confident that Jesus confronts injustice, demonstrates compassion and restores communities.I recommend this book for anyone seeking to do neighborhood ministry and who cares about justice. I love that Castellanos is so attentive to his neighbors and what Jesus is up to in the neighborhood. In a world where issues of systemic injustice, racial tension and poverty can seem overwhelming it is inspiring to read such a hopeful account. CCDA is in good hands and I am excite what God will do.

Do you think of someway to avoid the potential fall-out. Linda Minte is a therapist, academic and blogs regular on her BeliefNet blog, Doing Life Together. She wrote We Need to Talk to help people navigate the sometimes troubled waters of relational conflict.The fourteen chapters of this book explore a number of issues that feed into the dynamics of conflict. These include trying to avoid it, trusting the other person, acknowledging differences, how negativity exasperates the issue, our different 'styles' in conflict, and solvable and unsolvable problems. Mintle also discusses at length the need to manage expectations and to have proper boundaries. She addresses the challenges of conflict within a blended family system, the different ways males and females approach sex, dealing with difficult people, the dynamics of anger and resentment and the power of forgiveness.Mintle offers a great deal of sage advice and the sort of things that go on internally and interpersonally when we lock horns with another.She has written a self-help book to help people navigate through some difficult spots.

"Frank Viola enlisted the help of Mary Demuth for his follow up to God's Favorite Place on Earth. The earlier book focused on the city of Bethany, a place where Jesus was accepted and loved and where Mary, Martha and Lazarus lived. That book told stories from Jesus' life, narrated by Lazarus. In Viola's follow up, he wanted to present some of the significant interactions Jesus had with women he encountered but didn't feel, as a man, he should write the narrative sections from their perspective. So he enlisted DeMuth to bring these women to life.The Day I met Jesus profiles five women: the woman caught in adultery, the prostitute who washed Jesus' feet, the woman at the well, the hemorrhaging woman and Mary of Bethany (a story in three acts). The first three of these women struggled in the area of sexuality, the hemorrhaging woman struggled with a physical problem. Mary of Bethany is exemplary in her devotion to Jesus. All of them are transformed by their encounter with Christ.  These women give us a window into the power of God to set us free and fill us with Joy.Demuth's narrative sections are the heart of the book and she does a really good job of telling these stories. I didn't necessarily envision each story as she did, but in storytelling you make your exegetical choice and commit. I think she gave these women life and made their choices understandable. Demuth did a fantastic job. Following the narrative sections were a section that explored the meaning of the biblical passage, offering some exegetical insights and some practical takeaways. I think generally this was the work of VIola but there are some creative elements here too. These are also interesting but I was less enamored with them.To me, I wish the book did one or the other. If story is powerful and evocative then tell the story. If you need to explain the significance of the story you just told, then you don't really trust the power of story. This might be my own hobbyhorse, and I will happily admit as much. A number of readers do appreciate the mix of fictional and non-fictional elements that Demoth and Viola bring. But for my money, I want the narrative told without an editorial essay on the 'moral of the story.' I think Viola said some great things in his commentary sections, I just wished those were more thoroughly encapsulated in the stories they shared. Story is show and not tell. This book was more than half tell.

"Christians are found of saying that God reveals himself in two books: the Bible,God's special revelation, and creation, God's general revelation. While there is some baseline recognition that 'the heavens declare the glory of God and the skies proclaim the work of his hands' (Psalm 19:1), Protestants are generally suspicious that we can apprehend or trust much truth 'out there.' Robert K. Johnston, professor of theology and culture at Fuller Seminary, and author of Reel Spirituality: Theology of Film in Dialogue, here tackles the issue of general revelation with God's Wider Presence: Reconsidering General Revelation.  Johnston sees ample evidence to see God's Presence in the world  through nature, culture and even world religions; however this is not a capitulation to some sort of universalist pluralism, but an acknowledgement that God's Spirit works in mysterious ways and places.Johnston's eight chapters are a romp through modern theology, Bible passages and the world of film and fiction. In chapter one, he argues that our problems with general revelation and lack of theological reflection on it stems from several causes. First we have too narrow of a 'definitional' focus. Johnston observes:Rather than understand general revelation as any encounter with the Transcendent that occurs outside the believing community and that is not directly concerned with redemption, many have wrongly reduced it to a perceived 'lowest common denominator' by limiting 'general revelation' to those general truths that are communicated by God to all persons at all times and in all places"" (8).This understanding plays out in our biblical theology as well, ""Theology's bias toward the redemptive over the creational, and toward the propostional over the narrative is perhaps the second explanation for the relative paucity of theological thinking on general revelation"" (10-11). Thirdly, Johnston sees a dim view of human receptivity to divine revelation in much of conservative evangelical theology. Against these objections, Johnston suggests a way forward that invites a theological dialogue about ""God's revelatory Presence outside the church and without direct reference to Jesus Christ"" (15). Johnston calls us to have a robust two-way conversation between Scripture and the theological tradition and the realm of culture and  personal experience (15).Chapter two describes the growth of spirituality in contemporary times and some of the challenges that face this discussion. Johnston points to God's revelation in creation, conscience and culture (which he will return to later). He gives testimonials from a number of people of where they sensed God. He also refers to the work of Rudolph Otto and Peter Berger for their significant generalizations about the observation of Presence in the world. Otto observed the human experience of the holy in a variety of religious contexts (34). Berger's observations led him to the conclusion that 'there were experiences of the human spirit that pointed beyond that reality, that had ""an immediacy to God""'(35). Johnston acknowledges the cautionary words of other theological explorers of culture, that we can be self-deceived in our fallen human reasoning, but he sees an equal danger in failing to look for God (any)where he may be found:The danger of self-deception, if not outright blasphemy, is ever present and must be taken seriously. . . As I will argue this is why it is crucial for one to have a full-orbed theological hermeneutic, a robust methodology that includes scripture, tradition, and community as well as experience. One does not whisper ""God"" by shouting ""man."" The witness of God's revelation in Scripture is authoritative and the testimony and reflection of Christians through the ages foundational. But the danger for Christians is also on the other side. We can exclude by an overemphasis on sin and salvation the real, revelatory Presence of God through his Spirit that is the clear testimony of the vast majority of Westerners today (37).These two chapters set the trajectory for the rest of the book. Chapter three looks at the experience of transcendence in film by Johnston's film students (in a variety of styles of films). Chapters four and five illustrate how scripture itself testifies to the Presence of God outside of the covenant community. This includes the borrowing of sayings in Proverbs from Egyptian origins, Yahweh speaking through Pharoh Neco to ward Josiah off of battle. King Huram of Tyre sends Hurumbai as a skilled artisan for the construction of Solomon's temple,  Cyrus of Persia in Chronicles and Ezra is seen as God's instrument, Additionally, Johnston highlights two creation psalms (19 and 29) that speak of the revealing nature of creation (and not just reflecting on the creation as described in Genesis). Other examples include Melchizedek, Elijah's hearing God on Mt. Horeb, Balaam, various non-covenant peoples in the prophetic literature, Paul's use of natural theology in Acts 14 and his use of Roman poetry and religion in Acts 17. He makes a strong case that the Bible leaves open the possibility of God speaking through unlikely vessels.In chapter six, Johnston engages the theological tradition.  Johnston examines three different thinkers who were influential on twentieth century Christian thought and takes his cues from them on revelation. With Barth he affirms that natural theology cannot happen from below (recalling his famous answer to Brunner) but ""that revelation always needs the Spirit as Revealer--it is event"" (127); with Schleiermacher he affirms that general revelation is not accessible through rationality ""but through an intuition of Something or Someone beyond us and our feelings that result from that encounter"" (127-8); from CS Lewis he gets the idea that general revelation is more than just an insignificant trace in comparison to the glory of Christ but ""an experience of the wider Presence of God through his Spirit mediated through creation, conscience and human culture"" (128).In chapter seven Johnston tracks this wider Presence of God through the writings of John Taylor, Elizabeth Johnson, and Jurgen Moltmann. Taylor tackled the reality of real Spiritual encounter in the realm of experience in mission and world religion. Feminist theologian Elizabeth Johnson explored how the Spirit was ""God's livingness subtly and powerfully abroad in the world"" (174). The social-trinitarianism of Moltmann, releases the Spirit from  his subjectivity to the Son, acknowledging the Trinity as a co-equal community. This allows for more freedom for the 'wind to blow where it may,' and the Spirit to show-up outside of the tale of our redemption. The final chapter continues to examine the Spirit is at work in the realm of creation, conscience and culture.Without a robust understanding of general revelation, we have to remain skeptical of any spiritual experience, or moment of transcendence anywhere outside of the Word of God.  That means a moving book or a film, a orchestral piece that brings you to tears, or any cultural achievement is at best merely a human endeavor, at worst demonic. If Johnston is right about the operation of God's wider Presence, this gives space to critically engage other traditions and perspectives, allowing us to not be dismissive and suspicious of everything, while still acknowledging that aspects may be destructive, delusional and in conflict with the gospel. This gives us a different starting point in our conversations with non-Christians, one where our hunt for common ground reveals God's Spirit already at work in the life of the world. Throughout this book, I appreciated how seriously Johnston takes the experience of Transcendence as a revelatory event. Even Barth, who was suspicious of  human ability to apprehend God unaided, affirmed that Mozart, a non-practicing Catholic had heard the harmony of creation and captured it in his music (137).  God's wider Presence sings if only we hear the music. five stars: Notice of material connection: I received this book from Baker Academic in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H7V7ET1RDOH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0801049458#wasThisHelpful","R3H7V7ET1RDOH1","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have friends that came to faith through Christianity Explored, the evangelistic DVD course produced by All Souls Langham Place, London, staring Rico Tice. I even had the opportunity to review that course for another context, so I am aware of Tice's ministry. So that piqued my interest in his new book, Honest Evangelism: How to Talk About Jesus Even When it's Tough (Good Book Company, 2015).Tice begins where most evangelism books do not. The opening sentence of his introduction  says, ""I find evangelism hard"" (11). Coming from one of the most visible and effective evangelists, it is refreshing to find that he too finds evangelism difficult. His first chapter he discusses the difficulty that awaits the would-be-evangelist. He says first that hostility, persecution, hardship, rejection will be our experience. But the other half of the story is that in addition to hostility, you will see hunger for good news. Tice writes, ""The same rising tide of secularism and materialism that rejects turth claims and is offended by absolute moral standards is proving to be an empty and hollow way to live"" (20). While Tice offers no guarantees on the results of our efforts, he writes, ""Hostility and hunger, that is what you will find as you tell others about Jesus. And of course, at the moment you open your mouth, you don't know which you are going to be met with; and you don't know what your words may do to people years later. You have to risk the hostility to discover the hunger""(23).In chapter two, Tice explores how 'evangelism is worth it.'  He roots evangelism in three motivators: the glory of Christ, the guarantee of new creation, and the grim reality of death and hell (25).  Certainly he sees the reality of hell as a significant piece of evangelism (loving people means warning them), but I think his order is significant. Tice begins with the glory of God, then the promise of new life in Christ, before addressing hell and death. This is not scare tactic evangelism, but he doesn't ignore hard subjects. In Chapter three Tice talks about why we (still) don't evangelize. His conclusion is that it is because we harbor idols in our hearts which keep us from participating in God's mission. Chapter four, gives three truths to remember as we share our faith: God's sovereignty, God's grace and God's power (48).Chapter five begins the practical section of the book. Tice lays out his approach to the gospel and frames the gospel in terms of Jesus' Identity, Mission and Call (62) which is the same approach he takes in Christianity Explored. In chapter six he encourages us to bear witness in our own style. Peter was confrontational, Paul was intellectual, the ex-blind man was testimonal and the woman-at-the-well was invitational (76-79). Tice encourages us to bear witness in whatever style is most like us. In chapter seven, he explores how to evangelize in a culture of increasing tolerance and permissiveness. In his final chapter he exhorts us to pray and proclaim.Some questions I have whenever I read an evangelism book is, ""Is this the full gospel ?"" "" Does the author rely too much on 'technique'?"" ""Is the story they are telling compelling?"" I think Tice does a good job of letting the gospel sing, placing evangelism in the wider context of God's purpose and plan. But he does focus his presentation on Jesus' mission, on dealing with the problem of guilt and death. I think more could be said here about freedom, participation in God, restoration, but I didn't feel like Tice's presentation was reductionist or transactional. He is also organic in his advice on how to share your faith, prioritizing it without prescribed methods. I felt called by Tice to more purposeful witness, but I didn't feel guilt-tripped by him. In the end, this is a helpful book for anyone seeking to share their faith.

"In Desire Found Me Andr Rabe explores Ren Girard's theory of Memetic Realism and Christ's mimetic atonement (with its single scapegoat mechanism). Girard is a Catholic anthropologist. His theory has the advantage of taking seriously human falleness and our need for a redeemer. Unfortunately Girard is a subtle thinker and his works are not particularly accessible. Rabe, for his part,  is a strange choice popularizer for the great french thinker. For most of his career, he was an IT guy, designing e-commerce sites and administration systems. Like Girard himself, you would not expect someone with his CV to be this theologically astute, but Desire Found Me is a great summary of Girard. Rabe incorporates Girard's insights into his overall theological vision.In part one, Rabe chases the development of human mimesis in relation to the fall. Mimesis means something like 'imitation' or 'reflection.' The creation of humankind is described in Genesis 1-2. In it, we were created in God's image--created to perfectly reflect God to the cosmos. When human beings chased after the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, there entered into their heart a desire for something other than God and their mimentic desire became twisted. They began to reflect forbidden desire. This led to serious consequences, a sense of lack, 'fruitless chases; and projections of  'fGod' which were false (55). Building on Girard (for example, in I see Satan Fall Like Lightening), Rabe sees this twisted desires as the condition named in the expanded form of the last of the ten commandments: covetousness (64-5),  This twisted desire leads to mimetic rivalry, culture making to justify violence, and ultimately the need for a 'single-scapegoat'-mechanism embedded in human culture (fore shadowing Christ and his cross).Part two is the most complicated section of this book. Here Rabe endeavors to illustrate how the Bible is conversant with mythology, how it developed within the context of the Ancient Near East myths and how its vision and understanding has become distinct and unique among world faiths. Also in this section, Rabe demythologizes Satan, making him not a being of personal evil but the resulting spirit of societies and structures based on twisted desire. This paves the way for the coming of JesusIn part three, Rabe unfolds his understanding of the gospel and the cross. Following Girard he sees Jesus as subverting the whole system of mimetic violence, defeating 'satan' by exposing the structures as evil and making visible the love of God.  He also reviews other popular atonement models to illustrate how Mimetic theory complements or critiques each model (hint, Penal substitution is rejected for the way it caricatures the Father, while moral exemplar theories and Christus Victor are synthesized along mimetic lines).There is something to Rabe's (and more so, Girard's) analysis. I can see why this theory is popular. It examines sin with acute psychological insight and seems to describe reality. Nevertheless I am wary of this approach to the atonement as a totalizing vision of what Christ does on the cross. I also do not share Rabe's interest in source criticism and the development of the biblical text. It is not that I don't think there are sources and development, it is that statements about what should be attributed to 'Elohist' or Yawehist source (or how YHWH became the high God El) are beside the point. I prefer a synchronic reading of the text and eschew the modernist arrogance that thinks that claims that we can 'now understand what is really happening in scripture' because of more scientific methods. I also see the reality of powers as human structures (as Rabe and Girard do) but also as a personal, spiritual evil, even if I can't always sort out which is which. But yes to what Rabe is saying in a broad thematic sense, even if I disagree sharply on the details.If you are unfamiliar with Girard, Rabe's Desire Found Me is a great place to start. Not only does he synthesize and explain a number of Girard's (and other theologians works), he has a helpful 'Recommended Reading' section at the end, arranged topically by chapter.

"Guy Prentiss Waters has penned a new commentary on Acts from a conservative Evangelical, Reformed perspective.He is Professor of New Testament at RTS in Jackson and a teaching elder in the PCA and a cessationist. He wrote his Acts commentary for the EP Study Commentary (series edited by John Cirrid). For my part, I am more justice-minded Evangelical nurtured in the faith by Pietism and the charismatic movement. (with a healthy load of Anabaptism thrown in).  But all that isn't to say I didn't enjoy this commentary and read it fruitfully! On  the back cover is a gushing endorsement from D.A. Carson. I like plenty of commentaries and commentators that Carson doesn't have much use for (N.T. Wright, for example); yet his endorsement says to me a quality and careful reading of the text and that is what I discovered as I braved these Waters.While Waters writes from a Reformed perspective, quite self consciously, he does not  do so in a sectarian way. He doesn't spill any ink arguing for the veracity of infant baptism over believers' baptism. His doctrine of election is not the central feature to this text. Many of his doctrinal distinctives would be felt more sharply  in one of the epistles than in Acts. This is a close reading of Acts with exposition in view. Waters draws out the meaning of the text for the preacher. This is not a technical commentary but a good mid-level commentary (with footnotes to more detailed treatments).Where Waters's theological heritage is most evident in the text is in the application section in each subsection (below his comments on the passage). There cites the Westminster Larger Catechism and John Calvin to warn against unfruitful speculation about the future (44). He also goes to pains in places to explain his understanding of redemptive history. His cesassionism means that he is careful to hedge the fence of Holy Writ. What we read in Acts was historical describing a moment in redemptive history. Waters argues that the outpouring of the Spirit evidenced by signs and wonders and tongues is not 'the normative pattern of Christian experience for all generations (74). This was a unique apostolic age that died with the apostles (39).I have more charismatic leanings than Waters and think that he overstates his case,  but I applaud his attentiveness to scripture and the words on the page. He has a different theological lens he does illuminate features of the text I would otherwise miss. I also appreciate that while he relegates supernatural manifestations of the Spirit to the distant past, he doesn't treat this first century church account as 'merely descriptive and never prescriptive.' When he reads an evocative account in Acts, such as the life sharing in response to Peter's sermon in Acts 2:42-47, he parses those aspects as he sees as unique to the apostolic-age (signs and wonders in v. 43) and those  aspects that apply to us--namely, devotion to apostolic teaching, life sharing and evangelism (100-101).On the whole, Waters is balanced and a careful exegete. I found plenty I disagree with, but I think he does a great job through out of capturing the Spirit's mission in the first century. I give this commentary four stars and plan to use this further as I plan towards Pentecost.Notice of material connection: I received this book from the publisher via Cross Focused Reviews in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R115QPG400U7OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783970030#wasThisHelpful","R115QPG400U7OI","A2MRMWRVCRX1CT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MRMWRVCRX1CT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A. J. Swoboda wrote A Glorious Dark about three days. The Friday we call good when Jesus died on the cross, Sunday when Jesus surprised everyone by refusing to be dead and the Saturday in between ( 'awkward Saturday')--a day of silence when defeat appears complete and we are full of doubt and questions. The fancy-shmancy word for these days is Triduum,the last three days of Holy Week. Many denominations and spiritualities major in one of these three days. Friday people enter into suffering and loss. Saturday people allow space for doubt, questions and deconstruction. Sunday people are the clappy,happy people who emphasize blessing. Swoboda sees a problem when Christians treating any one day as though it is the total Christian vision and experience, ""We need both Friday and Sunday, not just one or the other. Some want to suffer with Jesus; others want to be resurrected with Jesus. Few Desire both. We can't prefer one day and reject the rest"" (5).So instead Swoboda takes these three days, the last three days of Holy Week, and treats them as a comprehensive vision (though not exhaustive) of Christian spirituality. The book's fifteen chapters are organized under the broad headings of the days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday), each giving a 'glimpse of that day.'  On Friday, we reflect on Christ's cross and in it see both God's great love for us, and our own need with greater clarity. The cross confronts our sinfulness, our personal need for a Father, our addictions and apathy. In its place we see God's lavish love and welcome. We also see Jesus so identify with the struggles of humanity that for the briefest of moments on the cross, he looks like an atheist. Awkward Saturday is a day of silence and rest and questioning. It is a day for 'sitting, waiting and hoping.' On that  day what Jesus built on earth and what we've done ourselves for God, seems very insignificant. There are reasons to question everything. Yet the questions and doubts are part of the waiting, so in the tomb we wait.Sunday is a day of surprises The same Jesus who came born of a sixteen-year-old Virgin, shocked everyone by coming out the tomb. Through Jesus' resurrection over the grave he secured for us the victory over every power and strong hold that held us captive and He invites us to share in his life, becoming part of his resurrection community.Swoboda weaves his theological reflections with personal narrative, pop-cultural references, and stories from his church. He is a pastor of an urban church in Portland and talks about his vocation and context throughout. He is also funny, bookish and insightful. I enjoyed these reflections and think they are appropriate not only for Holy Week (which is when I read this book), but throughout the Christian year. We are Easter people and the truths that Swoboda explores are constantly relevant.  While this book is organized around the three-day-theme, it is also more like a conversation than a tightly written treatise. The conversational tone makes it an engaging read but it also occasional made me impatient for 'the point' of a chapter (or kept me wondering how it related to the overall theme). But I'm not sure I'd like a pared down version of this. Swoboda is engaging (it makes me want to pull his previous book, Messy, off my shelf and actually read it).

"This is one of the best books Ive read in 2015 so far!  Two young children are admitted to the hospital, one with severe burns on his legs, the other unconscious.  When investigators discover they are brothers, their mother, Daniella, is arrested for child neglect.  Her refusal to talk leads them to dig further into her family history, including interviewing her 5 other children.  But the secrets that the family so fiercely protect are even more revolting than anyone could have expected.  Add to the mystery a kabbalist sect, a manipulative rabbi, and a jaded detective, and you have one helluva story.As horrific as it is to read about child abuse, this was so skillfully written.  The chapters alternate between the ongoing investigation and Daniellas past, first her courtship and marriage, then the birth of her children and relocation from America to Israel, and finally her religious fanaticism and decent into madness.  The question driving the novel is, How could a woman allow her children to be so viciously harmed, and stand by and do nothing?  Beneath Daniellas rigid exterior and blatant denials is a fragile and terrified woman who has been coerced and brainwashed.  The religious implications made are not unique to Judaism or even Israel, and there is a sad realization that what happened to Daniella and her family is not that rare.  The premise is terrifying, but the execution of it all was so engrossing, I could hardly put it down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R165UV564COA6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250043131#wasThisHelpful","R165UV564COA6P","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Addie is sent to the U.S. from Italy during WWII, she meets the four Connally brothers and is immediately welcomed into their family.  Addie quickly falls for the oldest, Charlie, but with war looming, he is determined to enlist.  Suddenly tragedy strikes, and Addies plans are shattered, so she tries to escape her pain by going to Washington.  When the Connallys also run away from their grief, Addie loses touch with the family that has meant so much to her. A year later, she encounters Charlie, but seeing him is too much to bear.  So she high-tails it again, this time to London.  Amid the ruins of a city devastated by the Blitz, she tries to start a new life and possibly find happiness with her correspondent boss, Teddy.  Then Charlie shows up again.  And again, Addie is filled with regret, doubt, and guilt.Though it sounds a bit redundant, it was interesting seeing Addies story unfold first in Philadelphia, then Washington and London.  She is definitely a flawed character, always questioning her own feelings and hesitant to get close to anyone.  Though she could easily find happiness with Charlie or Teddy, Addie has convinced herself that just because she is with a man, he possesses her.  I liked her independence, and though her self-doubt was a little frustrating, it was understandable as she was an outsider in a foreign country.  The losses Addie suffered make her more sympathetic and there were some great secondary characters that helped her along the way.  Witnessing Addie abandon her idyllic childhood to become a resourceful adult shaped by war and tragedy wasnt always pleasant, but it was a solid story overall.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NQS0UN37SHX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317544#wasThisHelpful","R1NQS0UN37SHX5","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book started strong enough: a young woman is found dead of an apparent heroin overdose, but there are indications that she was actually murdered.  It seems more than one woman met the same fate in a colossal cover-up, and a serial killer may be on the loose.  Add to that an international political and financial crisis that has led to Chinese military presence on US soil.  The concept was compelling, but once journalist Maddy starts investigating her own sisters mysterious death, I found it hard to stay interested.Maddy was a somewhat infuriating main character.  Her stubbornness gets her into trouble, and though its her journalistic curiosity and personal connection to the murder that drives her, I sometimes wondered whether her priorities were in order.  There were endless pages describing her scouring the internet for clues, and the tedium of her investigation made the whole thing seem overlong.  The political aspect of a cutthroat gubernatorial election made it hard for me to stay engaged.  During the conclusion, there was an allusion to Maddys secret that only she, her sister, and her mother new about, but that additional piece seemed contrived and completely unrelated to the rest of the plot.  It was hardly alluded to previously and seemed as if it was only a device to explain Maddys insomnia.  Maddy wasnt entirely sympathetic and her erratic behavior was frustrating.Overall, the substance of the novel was good, it just wasnt executed properly.  If it was trimmed down and more focused, it would be a captivating thriller.I received a complimentary copy of this book from TLC Book Tours.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AAA11K9C7471/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062207555#wasThisHelpful","R3AAA11K9C7471","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A comprehensive history of the first English settlements in America, this book details the decades-long struggle to establish a colony in the unknown wilderness of the New World.  Heres what youll find inside:-Elizabethan policy on colonialism and privateering-A biography of Sir Walter Raleigh-Conflict between the English and Spanish-The mystery of the lost Roanoke colonists-Complex relations between settlers and nativesIt details every failed expedition and the reasons for each failure which was generally due to lack of provisions and overall laziness of the colonists.  What I liked most was the romanticism that Raleigh lent to the whole endeavor.  His motives were genuine, if somewhat commercially and financially motivated, but he had his Queen and her kingdom at heart in wanting to expand into this uncharted land.  Of course, Im captivated by anything to do with the lost colony of Roanoke and I think its significance was well-detailed here.  There are other familiar characters in the saga including John Smith and Pocahontas who add some color to the narrative.  This book is an accessible and well-written account of the struggles and successes of the earliest English enterprises on American soil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4CDS1PWG6KD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OI1AG6#wasThisHelpful","R2F4CDS1PWG6KD","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rons son Karl is in prison for murdering Mariss daughter Calla.  When Maris receives a call from Ron, hes standing on the Golden Gate Bridge, offering Maris a chance to dictate whether he should take his own life.  Rons motives are initially unclear and theres a muddled sense of guilt mixed with something deeper.I originally thought this book was going to be a tense psychological commentary on the repercussions of violence, or even a battle of wits between Maris and Ron.  I pictured Ron gripping the rails of the bridge having a desperate dialogue with Maris as he contemplated jumping, but it turned out to be a minor catalyst for the rest of the novel.  It was really about both families, deeply affected by tragedy, learning to move on and find happiness in a world that has disappointed them in so many ways.  Maris attempts to build a new life for herself and Ron reconciles his mental anguish by connecting with his wife and son in ways he never could before.

"This book is my first encounter with McMahon, and based on this one experience, I am definitely going to devour her backlist.  The Night Sister delivered!  Besides the ultimate creepy factor, it had great suspense, excellent character development, and a well-constructed story that went back decades and generations.The setting is a once-thriving motel in Vermont.  In the late 1950s and early 60s, it was a successful destination for travelers prior to the interstate system, where sisters Rose and Sylvie lived with their parents.  Fast forward to the 80s and Roses daughter Amy is growing up on the grounds of the now closed motel with her grandma.  She and her friends Piper and Margot stumble upon clues that insinuate something sinister may have happened to Sylvie.  15 years later, adult Amy is still living in the house near the dilapidated motel with her own family until a very fateful night.  What appears to be a murder-suicide, leaving Amy, her husband, and her son dead is much too convenient considering the brutality of the scene.  Amys daughter is the only survivor/witness, but what the little girl knows is almost too sinister to believe.Though there was a somewhat supernatural/folklore element to the plot, it totally worked here.  I really enjoyed how the three stories alternated, each one slowly revealing clues to Sylvies disappearance in the 60s to Amys death in 2013.  The run-down motel with its crumbling keep was the perfect Hitchcock-esque backdrop for this super creepy story.

"Needless to say, any Downton Abbey fan will love the insiders look at life inside Highclere Castle and the woman who resided there during the time the show takes place.  Despite being illegitimate, Lady Almina brought the de Rothschild funds to the estate enabling her husband and family to live a highly privileged existence.  From throwing huge parties to hobnobbing with royalty, life at Highclere was certainly something to be envied.  Though theres only one chapter devoted to the downstairs aspect of castle life, it gives great insight as to how such a household operates.It was WWI that really changed the landscape of the country and estate life.  Almina commited herself wholeheartedly to the cause and established a hospital first at Highclere, then in London.  Nursing gave her purpose and her vast wealth ensured that those in her care received the absolute best treatment. A great deal of the book is devoted to this period, because so many people with ties to Highclere were affected by the war: lowly staffers who enlisted, Alminas brother-in-law, and numerous acquaintances.The most intriguing aspect of the book was the involvement of Alminas husband in the discovery of King Tuts tomb.  The Earls fascination with Egyptology resulted in numerous excavations in the Valley of the Kings and he and his partner literally hit the jackpot when they uncovered the unmolested tomb.Overall, this is a fascinating look at a bygone era and unimaginable wealth.  Lady Almina was an inspiring figure and did so much good with her funds and her gracious spirit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IANN1RCAD3FJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770435629#wasThisHelpful","R1IANN1RCAD3FJ","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As much as I geek out after all things Alice in Wonderland, I must say this book was a hot mess.  It didnt seem to me that Maguire could decide whether it was a retelling of the original or a commentary on Victorian life in the 1860s.  Ada inadvertently follows Alice down the rabbit hole and spends the rest of the story in pursuit of her friend in Wonderland, encountering many of the characters that Alice has already come across. One redeeming quality was seeing a few familiar characters. The adventure narrative alternates with whats going on in the real world: Alices sister and Adas governess searching for the girls.  The parallel narratives are so disconnected, its tedious, not to mention the two aforementioned characters are hardly likeable.Were not dealing with the real-life inspiration Alice Liddell here, but the fictional Alice in a nonfictional Oxford with real characters like Charles Darwin.  I got the impression that Maguire was trying to be cleverer than what he achieved. Its as if he couldnt just settle on channeling Carroll to recreate Wonderland in his own way, so he also used this as a platform to wax philosophically about slavery, Victorianism, and evolution.  Piggybacking on a classic and giving it a dark, Dante-esque spin just was not successful.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26RV3EL2DKNH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060548959#wasThisHelpful","R26RV3EL2DKNH3","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book had so much going for it: great character development, a bit of history, and an entertaining look at life on a kibbutz in 1994.  Adam travels to Israel after his grandfathers death to return an antique brooch to a woman he only knows as Dagmar, his grandfathers lover in the late 1940s.  A Holocaust survivor, Grandpa Franz was to bestow this brooch, crafted in the 1300s, upon the love of his life, but all Adam knows is that Dagmar rejected Franz.  Adam blames himself for Franzs death, and assures himself that the only chance for redemption is to return the brooch to Dagmar.Once on the kibbutz, Adam encounters a handful of motley characters including octogenarian Ziva, Russian immigrant and Jewish imposter Ulya, and Claudette, a French-Canadian Catholic mental patient. As each individuals story unravels, the characters become more intriguing.  Though Zivas stubbornness is infuriating, its also kind of endearing.  She has every right to be proud of the community she founded and the nation she helped forge.  Adams determination is admirable, but hes also flawed and struggles with addiction.  I knew Ulyas dishonesty would lead to desperation and the ultimate betrayal.  Claudette experienced the most transformation during her time on the kibbutz and it was nice to see her come to terms with her troubled past.  There were a few other side stories, like that of Ofir, a musician whose hearing is ruined in a terrorist bombing, and Franzs rescue from Germany, escape to Israel, and relationship with Dagmar.Then theres the brooch, which survived centuries, handed down generation after generation.  I just wish I knew more about its provenance.  Sure, we see where it originated during the European pogroms preceding the Black Death, but I wanted to know more about its travels over the centuries.  And although the epilogue alludes to the broochs destiny 20 years later, it was the how and why that left me curious as to how it got there.  It was the same thing with the characters.  Because I was so captivated by their stories, I wanted to know more about their fates after that auspicious summer in 1994.  I could have kept reading, but I must say, I was very satisfied with the book as a whole.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZVG9T2A5BU0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941493068#wasThisHelpful","R2ZVG9T2A5BU0N","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The Campbell sisters live in constant fear of their abusive and alcoholic father, until one night an explosive fight forces them to flee their home.  Just when their circumstances couldnt get worse, they stumble upon imaginable horrors.  17 years later, the three women are trying to lead normal lives and forget the nightmares they endured.  When their past catches up with them, they must return to the small town that hosted their trauma.  The story is gritty, violent, and terrifying. The ordeal these women survived is not easy to read, but Stevens doesnt shy away from the brutal realities of immense cruelty.  Ive enjoyed all of Stevens prior books and this is another fast-paced page-turner that her fans will love.I received a complimentary copy of this book via the GoodReads FirstReads program.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PBDGYD8NVNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250034582#wasThisHelpful","R1PBDGYD8NVNA","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Its been 3+ years since Ive read the first book in the Ruin Trilogy, and though I had to reacquaint myselfwith the overall premise, I fell back into the adventure pretty quickly.  The great mountain citadel in Ruin, Turkey is in trouble.  There are divided factions within and their vying motives will have very different outcomes.  Liv has unleashed the Sacrament, and she will either need to return it to its origin or suffer an eternity locked away.  There are harrowing chases through the desert, a desperate cardinal who will stop at nothing to protect his interests, and a gruesome plague affecting the residents of mountain fortress.  Will the prophecy be fulfilled in time for mankind to be saved?It all sounds ambiguous and formulaic, but I like that Toyne does not claim any historical provenance.  There is no Ruin in reality, so the story is not bogged down with alleged factual details; its just a fun story with a religious, almost supernatural element.  I am certainly curious how the final book will conclude the trilogy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB2B9H0T6KFJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062038338#wasThisHelpful","RB2B9H0T6KFJB","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me provide a little bit of background  I bought this book for my husband because hes of the optimal Star Wars fandom generation.  I grew up familiar with the movies thanks to my older brother and distinctly remember seeing the special editions and Episodes I-III in the theater.  Neither of us would consider ourselves uber-fans or profess an undying devotion to the franchise, but I was curious about this cultural phenomenon.  SoWhat I enjoyed the most about this book was that it became an immersive experience, because as soon as I started reading about the Star Wars universe, I had to re-watch all of the movies.  Though it was occasionally bogged down with the minutiae of every detail of George Lucas, his creative process, franchising, filming, his various companies, finances, et al, there were more interesting tidbits that I found intriguing.  Example: Elvis Presley was in the process of securing a Star Wars print to screen for himself and Lisa Marie at Graceland the day before he died.I was most interested in how the story and the films evolved, first in Lucass brain, then to a more tangible thing.  One of my favorite quotes pretty well defined Lucass attitude concerning his creation:I was afraid science fiction buffs would say things like you know theres no sound in space, Lucas said in 1977.  I just wanted to forget science.  In space, everyone can hear you go pew pew.Of course, the influence Lucas had on pop-culture, science fiction movies (Aliens, Blade Runner, James Cameron, Tron, etc), and special effects is immense.  Alien is to Star Wars what the Rolling Stones were to The Beatles.  Its fascinating how this one man had an idea, turned it into a vast collaborative empire, and made himself a billionaire through his creativity and ambition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WR0NU7XAL7TV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465089984#wasThisHelpful","R1WR0NU7XAL7TV","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though not quite as captivating as The Midwife of Hope River, this was still a very solid follow up novel. It skillfully portrayed the difficulty and desperation of the Great Depression in rural Virginia, told from the perspective of Nurse Becky Myers. Becky returns to Hope River in an attempt to establish some sort of life for herself and her catatonic charge, Dr. Isaac Bluhm. Both the nurse and the doctor have experienced tragedies, but Isaacs past has left him a shell of a man. Becky is tough, smart, and quick to solve problems, but she has her own insecurities and flaws, which makes her all the more relatable.Midwife Patience Murphy returns as a calming presence and a force to be reckoned with. Taking Becky under her wing, they do whatever they can to survive the harsh conditions of their situation. Though no one has much, the entire community comes together to provide support. As Becky finds her footing and Isaac returns to himself, their purpose in Hope River becomes clear and they heroically rally to save lives. Its a great story of determination, cooperation, and loyalty.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPJPO9GXYRI4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062358243#wasThisHelpful","RPJPO9GXYRI4R","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book had so many things going for it:  a plot that kept me guessing, a unique narrative device, and a narrator who initially seems trustworthy only to reveal himself as unreliable.  The story plays out as Paul is having dinner with his wife, his brother, and his sister-in-law, and throughout each course of the meal, Paul reveals more about the two families circumstances.  There are some aspects he is deliberately vague about, but it was effective in maintaining a level of ambiguity about the overall conflict.It was about halfway through the novel that I realized how utterly bat-turd crazy all of the characters were.  Paul seems fixated on punching people in the face, knocking teeth out, and creating a bloody pulp.  His wife indifferently turns a blind eye to her sons violent and criminal behavior.  Pauls brother is a politician (enough said).  The final pages demonstrate Pauls instability and how he, his wife, and their son are so totally effed up.  I loved the deviousness, the way Paul misled me to think he was just a regular guy, when there is something much more sinister beneath his (usually) calm demeanor.  If I were to write a one-word review, I would say: Unscrupulous.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LPGL0J9H8LUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385346859#wasThisHelpful","R1LPGL0J9H8LUW","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the Israeli Embassy in Rome is bombed, who else but Gabriel Allon can find the perpetrator and seek justice on behalf of his people?  This may be the most intense novel in the series so far, and it delves into the historical hostilities of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and its inherent violence.  Usually Allon is recruited as a contract player to uncover some nefarious plot lingering from WWII.  But now that his cover as an art restorer is blown, he must return to Israel to work directly for the Office to track down a ruthless terrorist.  For once his enemy is two steps ahead of him and Allon is at his most vulnerable.  I was intrigued by the historical justification of Palestinian entitlement and Israeli defensiveness.  This book certainly conveyed the complexities of the region and Allons own reticence about the role he plays protecting his nation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31T4MIX8E9QLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451215737#wasThisHelpful","R31T4MIX8E9QLY","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Despite all of the uncomfortable situations, there are so many positives that made me smile, and I enjoyed his whole experience.

"The beginning of this book really hooked me and I was intrigued by the premise of a boy and his agoraphobic mother.  Life in their home is almost otherworldly and Will has no experience with the Outside, so his innocence and naivet is endearing.  Learning about his mothers lifestyle and the psychology of her phobias was compelling.  Then Wills curiosity gets the best of him and he ventures Outside, eventually convincing his mother to send him to school.  As he becomes familiar with everything the Outside has to offer (including skateboarding), the novel takes a dark turn.  The crippled economy of Thunder Bay and its seedier elements include criminals, bootlegging, missing orphans, and poor race relations with Native Americans.There was definitely a malevolent undertone to the second half of the book, which went in a different direction than I anticipated. There were some aspects that were predictable, and an odd little narrative thrown into the middle.  Overall it was about struggling with mortality and loss, which was so debilitating to Wills mother.  But Wills bravery and determination to overcome these insecurities was inspiring.  I enjoyed witnessing him flourish outside of the confines of his mothers rigidity and paranoia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M486I3PLLE0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140804#wasThisHelpful","R3M486I3PLLE0S","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My childhood was filled with songs from the soundtrack of The Sound of Music and Im surprised the VHS tape of the movie we owned lasted as long as it did.  So what a delight it was to read Marias own memoir and learn the true story of the von Trapps.  Maria is the most pious, devoted, and enthusiastic soul, and that comes across in her recollections.  Her instant love of the 7 von Trapp children in her charge is sweet, but its even more darling how the widowed patriarch becomes besotted with her.  She integrates seamlessly with the existing family and she adds three more children to their charming brood.It is their love of music that comes to define them.  When financial ruin and German aggression force them to go on concert tours, they eventually find their way to America.  One of the cutest parts was Marias awe and curiosity having arrived in New York City to all the wonders of a metropolis.  And her determination to learn English is so endearing. In their adopted home, they use their unique gifts to fund their lives Stateside, eventually falling in love with a piece of property in Vermont. They are quite industrious, building a house basically with their bare hands and limited materials and funds.  They develop a farm, growing crops, raising livestock, harvesting orchards, and they even create a music camp on their property.  Marias narrative is somewhat saturated with gospel lessons and prayers (she was almost a nun, after all), but that just demonstrates her devotion to her faith.  More than anything, though, this is a truly inspiring story about family and love.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L9IF78NHZTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060005777#wasThisHelpful","R1L9IF78NHZTX","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this book surprising because it went in a completely different direction than I anticipated.  When I first read the premise that Patrick, the recipient of a heart transplant from 16 year old Drew, I assumed there would be some psychological aspect about Patrick adopting some of Drews characteristics.  No so much.  Formerly a womanizing college professor (and somewhat of an arse), Patrick does mellow out a bit after his operation.  When he learns of Drews identity, he doesnt insert himself into Drews family or anything like that, but he does value the invisible bonds that have tied him to the young mans existence.There are a few alternating perspectives, primarily Patrick during his recovery, and Drews final year of life.  The only thing that I didnt care for in this book was the long historical element.  As told by Drews 19th century ancestor, Willie Beamiss, I found his part of the narrative overlong and not terribly relevant to the overall story.  The only thing it really added was to highlight the rebelliousness that runs in the family.Otherwise, I really liked all of the characters, and how Patrick learns to appreciate the relationships he previously took advantage of (ex-wife, two grown kids) and the new friendships hes developing (the transplant counselor, Drews mom).  It wasnt an overly-schmaltzy reflection on benefiting from a second chance in life.  I enjoyed witnessing Patrick evolve into a more sympathetic version of himself.I received a complimentary copy of this book via TLC Blog Tours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C36EURUO2J4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFG44G0#wasThisHelpful","R3C36EURUO2J4M","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(4.5) I rarely give a book a four and a half star rating, but this one is definitely an exception.  While it wasnt The Best Book Ever, it was certainly captivating and quite well-written.  Its the type of novel I could easily read 50 pages and not realize an hour had passed.Anyway, the plot  Private Investigator Wyatt returns to his hometown of Oklahoma City 26 years after he survived a robbery that left 5 of his theater coworkers dead.  Hes there doing a personal favor for a friend and while hes trying to figure out why his client is being harassed (and whos doing the harassing), being in the proximity of the crime brings back the familiar question: Why did he survive?  In another part of the city, Julianna is still haunted by the unsolved disappearance of her sister Genevieve the same summer of the theater massacre.  Juliannas desperation to find out what happened to Genevieve often clouds her judgment. Despite her obvious intelligence, it can be frustrating, but it also demonstrates her fierce loyalty to her sister. Wyatts experience as a PI makes him clever and deductive, a likeable smart alec.  I became so engrossed in their stories, which is a testament to how solidly crafted the characters were.  In their quest to find answers to their most troubling questions, Julianna and Wyatt occasionally cross paths, but not in a way that seems too contrived. The conclusion isnt tidy, but it is certainly intriguing and satisfying, with both characters coming to terms with their tragic histories.I received a complimentary copy of this book via TLC Blog Tours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28NFUKZGY7GWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062292439#wasThisHelpful","R28NFUKZGY7GWJ","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Faber has written an unusual, thought-provoking, and wholly original novel.  Missionary Peter is sent to the planet Oasis to minister to the native population. A mysterious corporation has created a settlement on Oasis and it takes a rare individual to endure the isolated environment there. The strange new world Peter encounters is mesmerizing; barren and desolate yet wondrous and beautiful.  The book isn't straight science fiction nor overtly theological, but incorporates elements of both.  Peter struggles with his mission, conflicted about the wife he left behind and the alien race he serves.Despite the challenges of living among the extraterrestrials on another planet, Peter learns more about human nature than he ever did ministering on Earth.

I read the whole thing cover to cover in just a couple of hours and found myself laughing out loud and some of my favorite quotes.  The book focuses on the chronological history of Homer and the Simpsons family (like a scrapbook), but what I found most interesting was how Groening incorporated the more obscure episodes from their past (90s grunge scene).  There are several flashback episodes that are presented (Lisas fist word, Homers dream job), and it all flows together seamlessly.

"I was excited by the idea of ONan writing about a quintessential American author, but I was disappointed that he chose the most unexciting and depressing period of Fitzgeralds life.  With Zelda shut away in an asylum and their Jazz-age days behind them, Scott is trying to renew his career in Hollywood.  He attempts writing for movies, only to get taken off projects and denied credit.  Broke and boring, Scott begins an affair with gossip columnist Sheilah and his existence centers around schmoozing studio executives for his next job and staying sober.  He occasionally shuttles back east to reunite with Zelda and their daughter, which only reminds him of how depressing his life has become.  Besides working sporadically and fighting with Sheilah after drunken relapses, he hobnobs with stars like Humphrey Bogart.  Theres plenty of name-dropping and extolling the Hollywood scene, but when war breaks out in Europe, those things become trivial.While it was a well-written depiction of Fitzgeralds final years, it just wasnt a captivating novel.  Witnessing Scotts decline was somewhat tedious.  I would have rather read more about the literary scene (although Hemingway does make a cameo) than Hollywood in the late 30s.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T6MII584XYVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670785954#wasThisHelpful","R1T6MII584XYVC","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is not for everyone for several reasons.  First, it is very stylized, with a stream of conscious narrative.  And that becomes even more cumbersome when it is from the perspective of chimpanzees.  Plus dialogue is not distinguished by quotes.  Second, it deals with animal testing, and the cruelty that the chimpanzees endure may be disturbing to some readers.  Finally, theres the basic understanding that chimpanzees are wild animals and that keeping them as pets is dangerous.  The inherent violence that is a consequence of keeping chimps in a domestic environment is presented in a brutal way.Judy and Walt are childless, and figure that adopting a chimp is the next best thing to being parents.  But as Looee gets older and larger, the inevitable happens when his animal instincts take over and he attacks humans.  He spends the next 14 years in a research facility, being tested, injected, sedated, and kept in a cage.  Eventually he is introduced to a population of other chimps and he had to learn to interact with unfamiliar animals.  Its a unique perspective as it attempts to demonstrate the social structure of chimp society.  I was disappointed that I didnt get to know more about Judy and Walts lives after their world was shattered.  I really wanted to know how the people attacked recovered from their grave injuries and how they learned to adjust to life after Looee.

"Delving into the mind of a serial killer always makes for a fun read.  But this book went in a totally different direction than I initially thought.  What started as a gruesome portrayal of dismemberment and caged victims turned into a dark comedy when Mr. Murderer falls in love.  The meticulous, merciless deviant seems detached from reality and emotion until he meets Rachel.  When he is smitten, he is careless, and that won't fly when the police come asking questions.  He tries desperately to curb his bloodlust, but one of his victims is causing trouble for him and his sloppiness is causing suspicion.  The conclusion was bizarre and intense, and the ending was left to the reader's imagination.  Will he be found out or will he get away with it?

While there were plenty of anecdotes illustrating the grim realities of cremation and body disposal (I wouldnt recommend reading the chapter about dead babies during dinner), it wasnt quite as in-your-face as I anticipated.  I give the girl props  to immerse herself in the business of dying as a profession takes gumption.  Her morbid curiosity of death and the macabre comes off as purposeful, if quirky.  Her humor isnt knee-slapping hilarious, but Doughty is clever and witty.  This book is really her own crusade to alleviate the stigma surrounding death and to advocate alternative practices in the funeral industry.  The standards we have come to believe as normal in the 20th century arent necessarily a requirement.

"I was completely enamored with this book  Until the final pages.  The conclusion completely threw me.  It wasnt bad by any means, but I didnt expect Picoult to venture into M. Night Shyamalan territory.  The supernatural element took the entire plot and flipped it on its head.  You have to suspend disbelief, because although the mystery presented in the preceding pages came together, the psychic connections were a little too convenient.Back to the book.  The mystery centers around an elephant sanctuary and a tragedy that occurred there ten years ago.  Picoult succeeds with the elephant narrative where she fell short in Lone Wolf.  The most engaging aspect of the novel was learning about what intelligent creatures elephants are.  I enjoyed the quirky characters: a 13 year old girl whos too smart for her own good, a psychic whose gifts have abandoned her, and a dead beat alcoholic P.I.  The unlikely trio team up to discover what really happened at the elephant sanctuary a decade before.  What they discover about the incident and themselves is devastating.

"I initially began reading this book sequentially but found myself skipping around to read topics that were of particular interest to me: the JFK assassination, the Lindbergh baby, Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  There were other subjects I completely skipped over.  I didn't really care if Rachel Jackson was a bigamist or whether Daniel Boone was a traitor.  But I must say I did enjoy what I read and was intrigued by a few topics I previously knew nothing about (Amelia Earhart, Salem Witch Trials, Cortez and the Aztec, Iran-contra) .  I liked that each subject was relatively brief (4-8 pages) and delving into an individual story wasn't too time consuming.

"This novel is the perfect example of why Im a McEwan fan.  He delivers shock factor like no other author.  It started a bit slow, but once I got about 25 pages in and the perfunctory cold war rhetoric was out of the way the plot picked up.  I really liked the main character, Leonard, who initially comes off as timid, yet proper.  He is very aware of his Englishness, especially when hes around his American colleagues, but once he meets Maria, she brings out some confidence in him.  As he begins his first love affair, he is also participating in a secret operation to tunnel into the Russian sector of Berlin and tap into the communist communication lines.It is the last third of the book that had me completely captivated.  Without giving too much away, I will say that Leonard and Maria get themselves into quite a situation and the way they deal with it is quite shocking.  Then Leonard goes a little crazy and every time he made a decision contrary to his initial plan, I wanted to shout into the book, Seriously Leonard?!  What are you thinking?!  McEwan creates the most absurd circumstance and allows his characters to do the most insane things and its ever so much fun.  I think The Innocent is one of my favorites in McEwans repertoire and Im a little bit sad that now Ive officially read everything hes published.  Then again, Im glad I save the best for last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24O8638C890EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385494335#wasThisHelpful","R24O8638C890EN","A33EVEMS61JYRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33EVEMS61JYRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set of sheets is pretty impressive, since it tells us upfront that it is 200 thread count--which on shopping channels implies old time feed sack quality.  Think again. These are soft and smooth, with a mild sateen finish, generously sized with deep hems. I will use these, and like another reviewer, not hesitate to order more for myself or gifts.

"As one who considers the volume, ""Consider the ForK"" one of my all-time favorite books, I expected to be intrigued by this book, but even I was wonderfully surprised. While it has 470 pages, the writing style is concise, and the black and white illustrations add a great deal, and it is packed with all kinds of information that can be accessed. There are two tables of contents:  one by chapter and the other by recipe, not to mention an index, so a cook or reader can find what is needed. The contributors include our friends from America's Test Kitchen, which ranks high on this household's choices on Prime Video on Demand, besides the usual PBS. The book can be enjoyed either straight through, or dipped into by surprise or specific topic. The print size is not tiny and is black-on-white, so it can be enjoyed by those with older eyes. It is heavy enough that it lies pretty flat when open on the lap or table.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DPFSPIYCOAV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1491928050#wasThisHelpful","R2DPFSPIYCOAV8","AMYTL79JMGQ6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMYTL79JMGQ6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having this book fall into my hands during the broadcast of ""Home Fires"" (reflections on WWII England) probably enhanced my enjoyment, but it would be a pleasure whatever the season. Every family deserves an interpreter of chronicles as gifted and astute as Ian Buruma, but few are so blessed. His editing of his grandparents' correspondence is deft, and the research and personal experiences he uses to enrich his material are touching. I felt I became acquainted with the whole circle, and appreciate his sharing them. I was swept into the picture with his first chapter which described the wonderful Christmas celebrations of his youth, about two decades after the trauma of World War II. Then, getting the backstory from 1915 is remarkable. There are twists and turns enough for anybody, from the poignantly gripping (cherishing refugee children) to the determinedly proper (consuming mayonnaise misserved instead of custard). This is biography, memoir, and letters at their best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D65TYE8J7DGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204381#wasThisHelpful","R1D65TYE8J7DGU","AMYTL79JMGQ6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMYTL79JMGQ6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The target readership for this book is middle graders, and it is right on point. There is enough of a supernatural element to appeal without any dark overtones, in spite of a locale next to a cemetery. The characters are challenged with sorrow, physical handicaps, economic woes and the cares of us all, but these are surmountable. Children of any age--not to mention the rest of us--are feeling their way to find their place in their circles, both family and community, and this story deals with that issue realistically, and ultimately with triumph. The people are likable:  the good guys are good guys, and the bad buys are not deviant.

"I am a real fan of Lamaze toys for baby, so was thrilled to be offered this one to evaluate.This one is targeted for 9 months plus, so its purpose is not so much 'cuddly with engaging noise and texture' as 'interactive and visually grabbing'. It is the size of two softballs, and they are hard (because they contain the electronics) but not heavy. Of the appendages, the feet do nothing, and one paw does nothing. The triple ears and one paw contain activating buttons, and the tummy lights up. (I wish the tummy could be turned on to glow as a night light  for about ten minutes, but that is not an option.) It talks in four languages, and to opt for one language, the electronics in the body must be dealt with. One left ears play 12 seconds of cheerful music, and one right ear play 12 seconds of sleepy music. This one is only surface washable, because of its electronic component, but by nine months plus a child will not have to chew everything in his/her explorations, so it should stay clean enough. I would consider it is as engaging as a busy box or board book, but it will probably not be a prime 'lovey'. This is a real beginning toy.If your little one has had a Lamaze toy at a younger age, this one makes a familiar transition to more complicated playthings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CN3N7AL5TRGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFSANWI#wasThisHelpful","R2CN3N7AL5TRGT","AMYTL79JMGQ6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMYTL79JMGQ6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my fourth set of tongs, and I do not barbecue. I use them for other kitchen chores, and to reach things all over the house. Two sets are shorter than this, and one is the same size. This is a premium tool because it has silicone tips that are nearly filled with metal reinforcement, so they  hold tightly, and they have silicone strips right where one instinctively holds them to use.

"A good can opener can be hard to find--either they twist too hard, gather gunk, refuse to give up the can and lid without drizzling, etc. I have been using a Kitchenaid can opener for years, but was ready for a new model because I think it may be getting dull. I even ordered another model well reviewed and sent it back because it was too hard to turn. Along comes THIS RED MODEL:  It takes up exactly the same space as the old one, even though it looks flatter. The new one is not shiny--metal is matte, and so is the plastic handle cover. The handle is hard, no silicone give to it. It nicely opens a can with an ordinary amount of turning pressure. My hands are old but not crippled, and I can turn it fine (not like the reject I sent back). The bonus feature is the magnet on the tip. There is a tag attached to explain how to use it, and it works great. When the can is open, unfasten the jaws and use the tip of the opener to lift off the can lid without having to touch the lid or fish it out of the contents. Some reviews mention getting duds that did not list long. This does have a one year warranty that should cover that. It is mentioned on the card the opener is ziptied to.

"I live in rural America and spent six years in a mobile home, besides teaching at all levels in public schools. The segment depicted in this book, while present in the 1990s, is not typical of life in the USA--even in these economically challenging times. The group at a dance is described as sorting itself out by ""genes, marriages, or restraining orders"". While those are legitimate guidelines, most people are not quite as depraved, hapless, and sordid as the ones gathered in these pages. I picked this book to read and review because it purported to be lighthearted. I read it all, and the change never came.

"This is the kind of book that puts flesh on the bones of history. The book was written with love by Noel Streatfeild about her father's family nanny, but the love that shines through--as it should--is the devotion of Emily Buckwell to her nurslings. It begins in the 1870s, and its perspective is strictly that of Emily, whose life's work is to provide her instinctive 'cuddles' to her charges. From the day and night nurseries, it is surprising how much drama comes into the tale, in spite of Emily's efforts to keep everything stable, serene, not 'overexcited'.I don't consider it a 'spoiler' to say that with careful reading outside the book, I figured out that Noel Streatfeild is Victoria, second daughter of the eldest son.

"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE PERSONAL SIZE  MODEL THAT RUNS ON A WATER BOTTLE. Small is the operative word, but it works like its bigger brothers. The footprint is 4 inches by 5 inches. It immediately starts spewing cool vapor from its turnable spout, when it is turned on, and adjusts easily from no-vapor to lots. Instead of having any kind of tank, you use a typical personal-size water bottle. For my test, I used a bottle of Niagara-brand water which has a half-depth cap and flimsy sides. The short neck was no problem--just pushed it on the adapter, got a perfect seal, upended the bottle, turned it own, and away it worked.While a personal water bottle will not run forever, I like knowing the exact age of the opened bottle of water in the little machine. This helps keep 'old' water from being present to possibly grow any kind of mold. (My mother sickened once years ago with that situation.)The little device is very quiet--about like an electric clock.  I am sitting about six feet away, and I can definitely tell it is changing the air. It will be perfect near a bed or chair, where one family needs some extra humidification without turning the whole house into the tropics. There is no reason to use a new bottle of bought water, either, every time. One can easily refill an empty bottle with filtered water from the fridge door, or distilled water from a larger jug, or just plain tap.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X867UOSK1LQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4LN3I2#wasThisHelpful","R1X867UOSK1LQM","AMYTL79JMGQ6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMYTL79JMGQ6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If one is living where the local water has issues, and is not blessed with filtered water from the refrigerator, then this is a premium pitcher for home use. It holds eleven cups, which is just shy of three quarts--larger than lots of filter pitchers. What really makes this a winner is the shape of the pitcher. It is tall, but narrow, so it will fit on the door of most refrigerators. The handle is comfortable and generously sized, so the center of gravity makes it easy to use the pitcher, even for a child of about seven. The instructions say wash before using, and you will because it comes smelling like new toys, but that dissipates with the washing.

"The space required is 18 inches by 36 inches, and must be within three feet of a power source (outlet or power strip) because it runs on a black thing with a wire, like a recharger. Assembly was fairly intuitive, due to the picture on the box. The included instructions were extremely small print in grayscale on thin paper--to the point of calling for a magnifying glass. Included with the kit is one foam piece (postcard size) that fits into the cover for the waste which is said to be odor controlling for 30 days. It does not smell itself and I do not see how it will add anything. Also included are two thin (think grocery sack) bags 6x14x6 to use one at a time to line the waste receptacle. We are not told where to buy more, however, I think we can substitute a piece of wax paper, typing paper, or a trimmed grocery bag to ease emptying the dish. The waste pan is attached to the whole thing, so one cannot just pick it loose, dump it, and pop it back. It does have to be attached, too, because of how the rake flips the lid to deposit the waste. There is a fill line on the littler box, and not very much litter is required to work. There is no litter waste, because the rake only moves waste clumps--the litter stays neatly behind. The amount of waste that can be stored in the tray is about the same as fits into the Omega Paw drawer we are used to using.As mentioned, we have been using the Omega Paw for a year, so our cat is used to having a covered box. The instructions with the Healthy Home do outline a plan for transitioning. We just replaced the Omega Paw with the new system, which has no cover, and watched to see what happened. The rake timer can be set to rake at 1 hour, 4 hours, or 8 hours. We set it for 8 hours, since we only have the one cat. The cat looked longingly at his old box (empty of litter and facing the wall), and did use the new box, and has continued to do so, with no complaints (and he would complain if he wanted to--cats do make opinions known). The box sits there neatly raked, and the only way to know it is used is by flipping the waste lid and peeking inside.I cannot say how long the motor will last, of course, but it really does offer a clean open box all the time, and an easy enough way to dispose of the clumps (be sure to use clumping litter). I will keep the Omega Paw to return to, if this one quits. This system is pricey, but it does stay neat and will not need to be tended to any more often than once a week, if need be. Our former box got rolled about every other day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2735MYD0LIGIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DSMRDE#wasThisHelpful","R2735MYD0LIGIZ","AMYTL79JMGQ6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMYTL79JMGQ6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This toy has a good deal going for it. Of course, it runs on batteries--4 AA, and it comes with short-life, non-alkaline is place, so it can be used right out of the box. The instructions were well-hidden, but necessary, under the sub-floor of the packaging. They explain that it comes turned up to its maximum sensitivity, so it detects everything--even the nails under the carpet in the floor.  Once you adjust the sensor down a bit, the fun begins. It really does sense metal, so stuff can be hidden under a rug or blanket for indoor explorations. Where it really shines is in a sandbox, because things can be hidden and retrieved. The white scoop is perforated in the bottom, so the sand can be sifted through, to leave the find in the bucket. It rolls freely and is light. I would suggest this for ages four to seven, at least. This does not duplicate any other toy I have seen, and has a good deal of creative play value. The packaging is bigger, but it will fit in a shoebox.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YLD0EQIIDV5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHCV5AY#wasThisHelpful","R2YLD0EQIIDV5O","AMYTL79JMGQ6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMYTL79JMGQ6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this interchangeable teether-age puzzle, which has three vividly colorful animals. There are some surface colors that are applied to the base color, and I was concerned that these colors might gnaw off by a teether. I did not gnaw it myself, and my testing child has not had it long enough to get it off--but I did claw and scrape at it with a nail file and scissors blades, and I can say the color spots did not mar or budge. My evaluation of four stars instead of five is due to the size.  If the scale were about 3/4 as large as what they are, they would be easier for the intended age child to handle, whether chewing or interchanging. After they come apart, they do go back together, but it takes a bit of oomph to get the parts seated, which may be beyond the dexterity of the youngest players, but they will grow into it. These just sit--there is no loop to attach the pieces to anything to keep them off the floor or getting away from the play area, either. They are certainly washable in a dishwasher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YLEJ9WO0FS19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013Q13312#wasThisHelpful","R1YLEJ9WO0FS19","AMYTL79JMGQ6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMYTL79JMGQ6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thought I had read all of Ms. Aldrich's books years ago, but this one had slipped through the cracks--and it is well worth getting second-hand from the United Kingdom, if necessary. This one was written ""contemporary"" in the 1920's, unlike some of her others that are pioneer stories. However, the dynamics of families do not change, and this one is spot-on, whomever of the group is the main character, chapter by chapter. Whether it is a small-town bazaar, a school program, separate family vacations, or a ""New Broom in Town"", the scenarios are both familiar and with twists that are thoroughly entertaining.

"I, too, have read other books by Homer Hickam. I think this is every bit as engaging as his earlier offerings in different ways. The plot of this one is the way family stories are not told in one session, but are revealed layer by layer over the course of our lives by several narrators for different reasons--and we are just lucky if we ever really get to the ending. At the beginning of Chapter 23, Mr. Hickam writes, ""Elsie had always felt her life was life a jigsaw puzzle with no picture on the box to show her how the puzzle pieces should fit together."" Most of us can identify with those sentiments. This book of eleven sections is touching, funny, and convoluted. It reminds me of Southern novels I read growing up, which are not easy to find anymore--but refreshing when they turn up. If the movie, ""Secondhand Lions"" struck a cord with you, this novel is likely to do the same. Albert did not live in vain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OZ868CKVN4OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062325892#wasThisHelpful","R2OZ868CKVN4OY","AMYTL79JMGQ6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMYTL79JMGQ6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I was shopping hard for a sturdy, heavy-duty chair at a reasonable price, this one seemed too good to be true.  There are also some reviews with caveats. Well, I have had the chair for a month and have waited to review, expecting something unpleasant to happen. Nothing unpleasant has developed. The chair is bigger than most, and so is the delivery box--also heavier. In spite of that, I assembled it myself to the point of setting the seat onto the base (I am more than somewhat infirm, too.) While it is large, it is not so huge that it looks outside in its space. A complaint of previous chairs with my weight is that the pneumatics give out and the seat collapses so near the floor I became stranded. This will not happen here, because it is high enough to use comfortably and arise at its lowest point. The seat is truly 25 inches wide, and that is what I wanted. The arms are unpadded, but look okay. The seat is comfortable enough, and not so thick it trips me as I sit down--a personal scenario true with thicker, puffier models.

"Having read several of Antonia Fraser's books of history, I jumped at the opportunity to read this, to review. As the title says, she and her mother were avid noters, correspondents,  and diarists, with memories like traps, and she has chronicled the 20th century from her always age-appropriate perspective. The whole book is readable, down-to-earth, and tongue-in-cheek, besides. Especially touching is the chapter about her coming to faith and formally embracing the Catholic faith during her early teens at school in Ascot. She tells her tale from her viewpoint (with a memoir she should), but like her historical writings, she is careful to be as unbiased as possible and shed light that has come forth in later years that was not knowable at the time of occurrence. That is the beauty of living a long life--we get to see the ending for some stories. If a reader has enjoyed her other books, this one is a personal triumph.

"This game is a winner for the targeted audience (4+) It comes in a sturdy, slick, cardboard box that is just at 11x11x2. It should hold up better than cheap uncoated boxed that smack of flimsy. The contents  are bright and attractive, and plastic coated, so they can easily be wiped clean, if need be. There is a warning about choking hazard for 3 and under, but the apple/balls are really pretty good sized, at over an inch in diameter. The game can be played by two to four people. The pieces are easy to set up, and can be done by a 4 year old. The rules are minimal and not frustrating. The minimum moves to complete a game is five for each player, so the games will not last too long--we can play again, and maybe win the next time, etc.Learning to behave appropriately while game-playing is an important developmental landmark--Kindergarten progress reports have ""Plays well with others"" for a reason. We cooperate, share, win and lose gracefully, take turns, encourage, and clean up after ourselves. This game promotes all these positive skills for the beginners among us, but would be fun for fourth graders to play during recess, too. (As a teacher for all this age-range, I know.)Finally, it will not bore the mind out of the parent, grandparent, caregiver, or older sibling playing, so we can stand to play just one more round.

"UPDATE: This evening as I was preparing to cook a meatloaf in the cooker, I was wishing for a RACK to lift the loaf above the drippings that were going to seep from the loaf. Unmentioned in the promos is the presence of a nice rack. The steamer basket bottom can be unswiveled from the side rings to produce a perfect rack raised on one inch legs to do exactly what I want. This machine gets better all the time. I have used it enough now to be able to mentally adjust recipes from conventional to using the multi-cooker. 10/8/2015I love this thing already. It is a versatile dream, having all these cooking functions and a nonstick pan to hold the contents with bright white measurements up the inside. It has a handle. The chimes are hearable, but soft enough not to disturb a household. What I have made, out of the 35 item cookbook comes out very tasty.Now for the suggestions: The lid needs to open a few degrees wider to get the pan out of the machine, straight up, when it is holding liquid. There need to be some guidelines on how to convert my own recipes to preparation in the cooker. There are no suggestions included, and 35 recipes will not go very far.  I have found some good ones at the KitchenAid multicooker site, and the FagorAmerica site, not to mention the ones on Pinterest. But for this money, Phillips should meet me need, instead of having to go to the competition.Do note that all the instructions and the cookbook are in English, French, and Spanish--separate but equal.For learning curve comparisons, it is about as easy to use as the bread machine I got last year, which quickly became my favorite thing.

When Vine offered me a pound to sample, I though, ""Sure"". Well, what a pleasant surprise! It really is a cut above the other guys' similar products. We all have some favorites that we select, in spite of a possible difference in price or ease of getting it home.

"Our cat was unfortunately found to have a tumorous cancer which was removed through surgery.  A few weeks after surgery while looking at ways to prevent the tumor from growing back or at least slow its progress I read about ES Clear having positive results on cats with cancer and decided to give it a try.  The first issue I had with this product was the amount you have to give the animal.  Our cat was 15 lbs and very difficult to get any type of liquid medication into her mouth let alone the huge amount of this product that would need to be given per day if following instructions correctly for a cat of her weight.  I put a few drops worth in the dropper to start with to see if that would have any effect and it did-a negative one.The first day I gave her this product the cat started throwing up an hour or so later.  I barely got a drop in her mouth due to her fighting off the liquid and most of it spilling on the floor1  She threw up so many times over the course of the day that eventually nothing but blood was coming out and lots of it.  She was 14 years old and had never thrown up blood in her life prior to this day.  I took her to the vet and they found nothing wrong and just said she must have an upset stomach, so I stopped giving ES Clear to her for a few days and there were no further issues.  The second time I gave her ES Clear the same thing happened constant vomiting to the point where she was throwing up blood all over the house.  At this point the ES Clear got dumped down the sink.  She lived for about 6 months with the tumor afterwards and never again threw up blood or had a vomiting spree again.Also on both occasions I gave her this product she developed large welts on her body.  The first time she had one on her side that I found while petting her the second time she developed one on her head near the ear that was visible.  Both welts lasted around a week and then went away.  Like the vomiting this only happened after giving this product out of her entire life.Was she allergic to something in ES Clear that caused the vomiting?  Is this product toxic..will the same happen to your cat?  I don't know the answer all I can say is our cat lived over 4,000 days and there were only 2 where she threw up blood and grew welts, both of those times it was after taking this product.  There were no other changes to her diet or anything else-this product caused the issue.  I regret ever purchasing this or giving it to our cat.  If you are looking at this product it is probably because you are hoping for some miracle cure to cancer in your animal like I was and unfortunately this is not it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KHRYU7WXWOM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIRLAU8#wasThisHelpful","R3KHRYU7WXWOM6","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought this for a Bar Rescue fan and decided to read it since it arrived well before Christmas when I am going to give it to them.  Overall the book may have some useful advice if you work specifically in a bar or restaurant but even then the advice given is highly questionable.  If you have watched an episode of Bar Rescue you already know everything that is stated in this book and have no reason to waste money on it.If one thing is certain after reading this book Jon Taffer thinks he is a god and is absolutely in love with himself.  The entire book is bragging about his accomplishments primarily using examples from the show Bar Rescue.  The following quote from page 211 gives an idea of what you will read on every page about how much Taffer loves himself As a professional consultant, someone who has owned a lot of businesses, and president of the largest bar and nightclub trade show in the country.""  If you think Jon Taffer is the most fantastic human being to ever walk on this earth this book will definitely reinforce your thinking.  Its like he is in a job interview with you and reiterating his accomplishments from his resume over and over again.Bars that have failed after being rescued by Taffer are blamed as the problem he accepts no type of responsibility in any failures throughout the book.  Anyone with an internet connection can look up the reality of what happens after an episode of Bar Rescue has been filmed.  Some bars have been sued because Taffer failed to get necessary permits, others have failed because the window dressing he provides cant save a bar that is in a horrible location, read up on it if you have been believing the great success that is reported on each episode at the end.Jon Taffer loves to speak about his scientific approach to the industry but this book is as far from science as possible.  Almost every page includes some type of reference to a survey with specific numbers but nowhere does it say who conducted that survey, where those numbers came from, or provide any type of references at the end for anyone interested to do further research.  Examples of what I am talking about appear below:Page 53 - ""Increasing guest frequency by just one visit a month increases revenue up to 12 percent.""Page 141 ""Chains that landed in the top 25 percent...""Says who?  Where did this information come from?  Did Jon Taffer make it up or was there an actual published survey/research saying this?  You walk away from this book not knowing the answer because it isnt provided in any way whatsoever.  Science provides references, without them this information is completely useless and anyone believing it is a fool.Another thing you can read from the book is that Taffer must have financial ties to many businesses such as TGI Fridays which is mentioned so many times it is ridiculous.  The whole book reads like an advertisement for a few chain restaurants and bars.It is a very quick read, takes maybe an hour or two so if you are able to find it in a library check it out but I would not spend money on this if you are actually looking to open a bar or turn around a failing one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XZF1A7FFCCRE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544148304#wasThisHelpful","R1XZF1A7FFCCRE","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the same mrror they sell at the local auto parts stores for about 3x the price.  If you are seeking a telescopic mirror this is a cheap and perfectly usable option.

"Purchased this to mirror my Seagate 5TB 3.5"" desktop external hard drive which has about 1 TB of data on it.  There were two concerns I had when deciding whether to get this drive or not and both were unwarranted.  One thing I was worried about was cooling capabilities since this has no type of fan or way to keep cool, but this drive stays cooler than any other external hard drive I have owned.  If I am transferring things from my Seagate drive to this or vice versa the Seagate drive heats up to a toasty 95 degF while the Silicon Power never goes above 80 degF.  I've had the Silicon Power drive connected at work for 8+ hours a day for the past week and it has never gotten hot yet.  Another worry I had was that the USB cable in the product photo looks ridiculously short (it is) but when it arrived I found out the drive comes with another USB cable that is about 3 feet long as well.  The short USB stays in the notch on the side of the drive for times when you don't want to carry around the longer cable.  Small size, waterproof, dropproof, stays cool, and works with no issues so far I have no complaints.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I0MIFTE551LT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KF4E83G#wasThisHelpful","R1I0MIFTE551LT","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have numerous mice, rats, shrews, or whatever in my backyard of various sizes that leave trails of poop spaced about every inch every night in the windowsills.  They are like little poop machines and I am tired of cleaning it up daily.  I wanted to catch them alive and relocate them elsewhere so I looked into a live trap.  I bought this model because on the Havahart website (and here on Amazon) this trap is listed as supposedly perfect for rats, mice, shrews, etc and since I have no idea which species of these animals is in my backyard..I figured this would be a good catch all trap.My overall issue with this trap is it it WAY too small to catch the species it claims to catch.  Unless the mouse you are trying to catch is a newbord baby or species that grows to less than 2 inches in adult length it is not going to get caught in this trap.  I have attached a photo of one of the mice, rats, whatever it is in my backyard next to the trap and it is clearly longer than the trap.  What happens is they enter the trap and take the bait and when the trap starts to close it just hits them in their back and they walk right out with the trap closing behind them.  Even if by some stroke of luck one went all the way in and the trap managed to close it would be an inhumane and tortuous night spent in this trap.  A creature in this trap would be unable to turn around, move, or defend itself in any way leaving them vulnerable all night. In the hours between when I go to sleep and check the trap in the morning a group of fire ants or mosquitos could kill the poor victim stuck in this trap.  At the minimum a night spent in this trap would be incredibly uncomfortable for whatever is trapped inside.The description of this item from Havahart needs to be revised to state that it can only be used for incredibly small species and rats, chipmunks, mice, etc definitely should not be listed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MLC89JU1B2XX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DINGG#wasThisHelpful","R2MLC89JU1B2XX","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a barefoot runner who only wears shoes when absolutely required for running (too hot or too cold to run barefoot).  I bought the Sockwa X8 since the specs looked good and I truly wanted to like this shoe but unfortunately it is an absolute disappointment.ConsSizing - The sizing chart Sockwa provides on its website makes absolutely no sense.  My feet measure 9-3/4 inches which according to their website chart makes me a size 9.  The size 9 arrived in a white cloth sack and was smaller than my foot so I exchanged for a 10.  The size 10 arrived in a box with a size chart printed on the side that clearly showed my foot as a size 11, which is the size I eventually got after a second exchange.  If you are looking at the size chart on their website order 2 sizes larger than whatever it shows you the size chart on the Sockwa boxes and the size chart on the Sockwa website are as different as day and night.  I wear a size 9 dress shoe and size 11 Sockwa.Ground Feel  Doesnt exist in this shoe.  The sole is thin but I would not be able to tell the difference between concrete, grass, or anything else underfoot if you were to blindfold me with this shoe on.Inner sole - The inner sole of the shoe is ridiculously slippery and your foot moves back and forth with each stride which caused numerous blisters on the bottom of my feet when wearing these.  Running barefoot on concrete I get no blisters but with these shoes on I had a minimum of 4 blisters on the bottom of each foot due to the slippery insides.  The back of the shoe also rubs my feet the wrong way and gave me a blister there.  I tried wearing socks but then it was so slippery inside that I couldnt even walk, let alone run.  The inner sole of the shoe needs to be redesigned to not be so slippery.Outer sole  The outer sole bend and squishes together inward with each stride and caused me to trip on numerous occasions.Height  They are a little too high for my liking and would be better an inch or so shorter around the ankle area.Upper material  These shoes are hot and retain sweat like a sponge.  Each shoe weighed a full ounce more after my runs due to this issue.  The upper material is absolute thin garbage.  After less than 20 miles running with this shoe on I got tripped by the outer sole for the thousandth time and my toes on my left foot came straight through the upper material.  See the attached photo the hole is nowhere near the end of my toes when standing still the shoes just bend over on themselves so much while running they are unwearable.  My nails were trimmed a day before this happened that was not the issue, the upper is just so thin and cheaply made it is a joke.  The upper of this shoe is basically the same thickness as a pair of womens leg pantyhose.ProsWeight  They are light, my size 11s are 3.3 ounces each.  That is the only good thing I can say about these.Overall opinionIf you want to waste money on a cheaply made piece of garbage that will fall apart in less than 20 miles of use by all means purchase this shoe.  For the rest of you out there who want something worth their money do not even consider purchasing these.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VQUZUES64W6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3KEN00#wasThisHelpful","R3VQUZUES64W6L","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this camera body for about 6 months now and overall am satisfied but there are big reliability issues in my opinion.  I switched to Micro 4/3 after years of using Panasonic compact travel zoom point and shoot cameras (ZS/TZ series) previously so will be reviewing from that perspective.  As point and shoot manufacturers have continually engaged in a game to see who can offer the most megapixels the amount of noise in the newer point and shoot camera images forced me to switch formats.ProsImage quality is excellent compared to the new point and shoot cameras and on par with DSLR's.  The images taken by the E-P5 are very sharp and can be cropped without losing quality.  The Auto and Scene modes work well for those who want point and shoot functionality and not worry about adjusting ISO, aperture, shutter speed, etc.  Excellent image quality is the main reason I have chosen to stick with this camera.The tilting LCD screen is excellent and I find myself wondering how I was ever able to use a camera that did not have one.  It is an incredible help when taking images at odd heights or in harsh lighting.Menus and controls are incredibly detailed and customizable.  It takes time to get used to the menus to know where to find things but almost everything can be customized if you know where to look.Image stabilization in the camera body works well and I can get great shots handheld with all lenses except the 75-300 at the 300 end where I have to either use a tripod or stabilize against a nearby object.The all metal camera body stands up to the elements well.  I have bumped mine into countless tree branches in the woods and dropped them a couple of times onto grass and don't even have a scratch on either body.  I would definitely appreciate a water and dust proof body like the OM-D model but the OM-D is just too big.I have not used a viewfinder for years and always use the LCD screen on cameras to take shots.  I have incredibly light sensitive eyes and always wear sunglasses in daytime hours so could not look through a viewfinder even if this camera body had one.  The lack of a viewfinder means less weight and bulk and is a positive thing to me.Burst mode is impressively fast and I've used it to take around 90 shots consecutively of an animal on the move using a class 10 memory card with no waiting for buffering.ConsReliability.  I purchased my first E-P5 body in May and within a month had to send it in for repairs because it began shutting itself off immediately when power was turned on.  When I got it back from repairs in less than a month's time it broke again and would not recognize any lens that was attached.  This happened while I was on vacation on an island and I had to use my old point and shoot that I had luckily packed for all photos.  While it was getting fixed the second time I purchased a second E-P5 body as a backup in case of another failure at a critical time and within the first two months of owning that body it also had to go in for repairs because it had the self shut off problem experienced with the first body.  It is due to this horrible reliability so far with two bodies that I cannot give this item more than 3 stars.  If I was going somewhere where a camera was critical (hiking for example) I would have to carry two bodies because I cannot trust this camera to work when needed.  I will revise my review in time if reliability gets better but for now my opinion is this model is unreliable and if it breaks again I will probably give up and get a different brand.Size/ergonomics - Yes this camera is smaller than a DSLR but it is still quite large and heavy.  My Panasonic compact point and shoot camera packs a equivalent focal length of 24-720mm and weighs about 12 ounces including the carrying case.  The Pen E-P5 body alone weighs around a pound.  If you toss in a minimum of three lenses to try to match the functionality my compact camera has (12mm prime, 14-150, and 75-300 for instance) you are now carrying close to 5 pounds of camera equipment and cases.  Over the course of a 20 mile day hike with thousands of feet in elevation gained and lost 4 extra pounds of weight on your back is incredibly significant.  Size wise it is a large camera body compared to a point and shoot and required me to try all types of larger cases for carrying.  Ergonomically the camera fits well in the hand and all controls are easy to reach but I really dislike the eyelets on the sides of the body which dig into my hands.The interval shooting mode is limited to 99 shots.  There is no reason for this limitation that I can think of other than to cause annoyance to the consumer.  Aftermarket timers are available but they are also limited to 399 shots.  There are point and shoot cameras available that can take 999 interval shots and this camera should offer at least that many.The on camera flash is weak and if you try to use it with any of the longer lenses (14-150, 12-40 PRO, etc) you will see a significant shadow in each shot from the lens.  An external flash is mandatory for most indoor or night shooting.The battery door is flimsy and does not fits loosely compared to the rest of the body the battery door is junk.iAuto mode always takes photos in ""Enhanced"" color mode which produces some very fake and unrealistic colors in many situations.  I would love to have the ability to default this to ""Normal"" or ""Vivid"" color mode instead.I geotag my photos and have to synchronize my camera time to my GPS to do so.  It is hard to do with the Pen E-P5 because you cannot adjust or see the seconds.  For instance, it shows the time as 12:00 but is that with 0 seconds, 10, 30, I have no idea?  Because of this it is impossible to synchronize camera to GPS with complete accuracy.  Would appreciate the ability to set the seconds in the future.Not a con of this camera specifically but of the Micro 4/3 format as a whole is telephoto lens limitations.  The longest Micro 4/3 lenses currently available are a 600mm equivalent.  This means that my tiny point and shoot with a 30x optical zoom (720mm equivalent) has more reach than a Micro 4/3 with the longest available lens attached has.  At some point it would be nice to see some longer telephoto lenses developed.UPDATE 2/1/15 - I'm bumping this up to 4 stars based on my recent use in Costa Rica.  I had both of my Pen E-P5 camera bodies out in rain and high humidity constantly.  Both got soaked numerous times with raindrops but performed flawlessly.  This is not meant to be a waterproof camera body but it handled water with no failures or breaks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGEZ89UC2A1SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CI3R7BM#wasThisHelpful","RGEZ89UC2A1SS","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since switching to Micro 4/3 format I have been trying different carrying cases constantly to find something minimal that allows quick access.  Most of the small cases out there are way too large for me.  The best thing I have found so far is the Capture Camera Clip Pro.  I mount this on my Camelbak shoulder strap and can carry a Pen E-P5 with lens (usually the 14-150) attached easily and always have the camera in reach.  It is incredibly easy to get the camera in and out of the clip if you can get yourself dressed each day you should be able to figure this out.  It really is just as easy as the promotional videos make it appear, I dont know why there are so many complaints about it being difficult online.  You push a button to unlock and slide to remove a camera from the clip and simply slide it on to reattachthats it.  The clip holds the camera in place very securely I have tripped, scrambled, climbed, and bumped into various things getting through the thick woods in my area with this attached and never had a failure.  Most importantly you can mount this wherever you want-shoulder strap, hip strap, belt, hat, its up to you.  This was the key reason I went with this over other devices on the market that require being attached to a belt.There are three issues I have with this device.The included attachment screws are too short to fit this clip onto anything thicker than about .  My backpack shoulder straps are way too thick for this and even my older backpack with worn out padding is too thick.  To fix this get two NO 10-32 x 1 long all thread rods/studs.  I ordered a pack of 25 aluminum studs online for less than the Peak Design sells their set of 2 (part number CB-8L), if you want to get ripped off buy it from Peak Design.The PRO model weighs almost 5 ounces and is a bit heavy for what it is I would prefer it to be made out of something lighter.  The regular model is probably lighter but only the Pro model was available with the Micro mount so thats what I ordered.Even though the Micro mount is smaller than the other mounts and meant for use with point and shoot or Micro 4/3 cameras it is still too big and gets in the way of tilting LCD screens.  The Pen E-P5 screen hits the mount when tilting which blocks the full range of motion-have attached a photo showing this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1664FUSWNEGK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7JY1GG#wasThisHelpful","R1664FUSWNEGK3","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been a user of 100% whey for over a decade since back in the days when this cost less than $25 for a 5 lb container and had no issues till recently.  For the past few years I have bought the Cake Batter flavor exclusively and use it twice a day.  Recently I bought two 5 lb containers and both had issues-the tasted horrible, mixed to the thickness consistency of a Dairy Queen Blizzard, smelled wrong, and gave me horrible diarrhea afterwards.  As i've said in 10+ years of use I know what the stuff is supposed to taste and smell like and that it shouldn't mix together at the consistency of sludge.  I emailed ON and told them about the two bad containers and they sent me back a 50 or so question email to fill out so they could investigate the lot numbers.  They told me how serious they took the matter and would get back to me within a couple weeks but that was it I got no further replies for over a month even after asking again.After giving up on the hope that ON would stand by their own product I contacted the retailer I bought it from and they sent me replacements with a prepaid shipping label to send back the bad two.  In other words the retailer did a fantastic job of fixing ON's horrible protein at their own expense.

"This book is fantastic and points out exactly the problems in the area where I live.  At first I was hesitant to order this book because it is not a recent publication but when reading the first couple pages it was mentioning my everyday problems of traffic, lack of community, etc.  The city I have lived in for 30+ years has turned into a horrible place to be as more and more development has occurred and the reasons why are explained very precisely in this book.  This book is not recently published but it is very up to date on problems and unfortunately not much has changed for the better since it was published.  There are many pages devoted to solutions and not just a discussion of problems which is great compared to other books on related subjects.  If you are tired of development that requires owning an automobile, increased traffic, lack of mass transit, and endless suburbia definitely pick up a copy of this book you wont regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28ZIMHSZU7FUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0865477507#wasThisHelpful","R28ZIMHSZU7FUG","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this to monitor an animal that had surgery and would be recovering and wearing an e-collar for around a month.  The plan was to use this monitor to be able to work in my home office and be able to help the animal out when necessary without hovering over the animal all day staring at it.  For my purposes this monitor worked perfectly but I would NOT recommend this monitor to a parent watching a child due to the bright LED light on the screen which cannot be turned off or dimmed.ProsThe screen is large enough to see the subject being monitored from multiple feet away.  I placed it on my desk next to a computer monitor and it worked well.  The screen size is much better than some of the other competitors out there with tiny flip phone looking screens.Battery life is excellent I only charged this a couple times while owning it and using it for numerous hours each day.  Not sure of the exact battery life but it lasts long enough unplugged to go multiple days without charging.I never had to do anything to connect the wireless between the camera and screen all I did was plug in the camera and turn on the screen no additional steps needed.  I had no connectivity issues in my house or interference.The two way speaking works well it allowed me to yell at the animal whenever her e-collar was finally removed and she kept trying to scratch her healing surgery area to get her to stop.ConsWhen the lighting in the room with the camera is dark but not dark enough to switch the cameras IR light on (cloudy days, closed blinds, etc) the viewing screen is not visible from directly in front.  I found that I had to look at it downwards or else all I could see was a black screen regardless of how much I turned up the brightness.If you use the screen outdoors it is not visible while wearing polarized sunglasses it completely disappears.The LED light around the controls is very bright and there is no way to turn it off.  It flashes different colors whenever sound is picked up and I couldnt imagine trying to sleep in a room with this bright light on.  I only needed to use the monitor during daytime hours and even then the light becomes annoying after a while.  This light would be a fantastic feature for hard of hearing parents where the flashing LED would be an indicator that the child is making noise.  Levana needs to give the user the option of turning this light off for this to be a viable monitor.  Unless you can sleep soundly in a room with a bright flashing disco light on I would not recommend this monitor simply because of this LED light.As with all baby monitors I know of there is a slight delay between what you see on the screen and what is actually happening of probably 1-2 seconds.  Not sure if there are any monitors out there that can stream instantly from camera to screen yet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q0QDHSC5APFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDJ4YXM#wasThisHelpful","R3Q0QDHSC5APFB","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent and well written history of the LH7 ranch but also a depressing one.  Depressing because unfortunately I live and work near where the ranch was and hate to say for those who cannot drive by that the LH7 ranch is gone.  The ranch houses, etc were bulldozed and the site is currently being developed into a massive sprawling apartment complex.  The Heritage Society and historical marker did nothing to protect this historical site as was hoped for in the Epilogue of this book.  The Marks family descendants sold out their family history to developers for profit.This is a very interesting read and there is a lot more history to this ranch than I would have imagined prior to reading the book.  It is hard to imagine the wide open space that was here only a short time ago when looking at the suburbia that exists in the area today.  This is an excellent read for anyone interested in the history of the Katy and West Houston areas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R155D7EES215DX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=157441111X#wasThisHelpful","R155D7EES215DX","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for a cat who had a tumor removed from her head between the eye and ear and currently has staples along the surgery site.  I was hoping this would be a good alternative to the vet supplied soft plastic type collar she is wearing.  Unfortunately the Comfy Cone is poorly designed and cannot be used for any animal with any stitches, staples, or exposed areas on their heads which was not clear from any of the other reviews or information on their website.  The issue is that the neck size is adjustable using Velcro that is built onto the cone.  In my case the cone would have to be adjusted to the second of three Velcro straps as it is too small on the third one.  This leaves an exposed Velcro strip on the INSIDE of the cone where the cats head is which could  rub, irritate, and possibly cause significant issues to the staples and exposed flesh on her head.  There is a cover provided for one Velcro strip on the outside of the cone which will not rub on anything but there was no thought put into providing a cover for the strip on the inside where the animals head is?Weight wise the collar is heavy (3 ounces) compared to the vet supplied collar I have (0.5 ounces) and could be problematic for smaller animals.  The material is also very stiff and unlike the vet supplied collar which bends a bit when the cat needs to eat or drink I don't know how an animal would even be able to do either with this collar on.  I had thought it was comfy like a pillow but its not its more like hard cardboard all around your pets head.If your animal is wearing the collar to prevent them from reaching their licking or scratching their heads do not buy this product because unless you are lucky and it fits perfectly with all three Velcro strips you will be left with exposed strips on the inside of the collar.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI4L8R84RDSEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MVURV2#wasThisHelpful","RI4L8R84RDSEX","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own several Fenix flashlights and have always been impressed by their weight to brightness ratio so when looking for a new bicycle light buying a Fenix was my first choice to replace my Princeton Corona bicycle light.  To say the BC30 is bright is a severe understatement.  On turbo mode (1200 lumens) this light is brighter than my trucks headlights with the brights on going down the road and brighter than any spotlight I have ever owned.  The beam is a wide flood type pattern and when riding down a trail at night does an excellent job of lighting all of the surroundings.  I've used it a few times now and pretty much keep it on the lower modes which are more than bright enough.  The light has remained cool to the touch in 80-90degF weather during my use and have not had any of the shut off problems mentioned in the other review even when on for over 2 hours continuously.If you are purchasing the light for the 1800 lumen burst it can only be activated while you hold in the button on the remote pressure switch it is not a constant mode.  At first I thought it only worked in certain modes then figured out the issue is the remote switch connection to the light.  You have to press in until you hear it click into place otherwise it may look like its connected and work a time or two but it wiggles loose when you start riding.The only gripe I have with this light is the release knob for changing batteries.  My best description is it's like a paperclip bent into a U shape that you have to turn and there is  spring pressure resisting against it when you are inserting batteries.  It is poorly designed and not easy to do.  If you have large hands or grip issues there is a good chance you will not even be able to operate this stupid little thing without pliers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OG9V0190CFGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZ5GG5W#wasThisHelpful","R3OG9V0190CFGS","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used this tent about 10 times now and overall it is ok but not great.  My main reason for purchasing this tent was that my $25 Ozark Trail tent accumulated too much condensation during the night and the airflow vents on the top of this tent were supposed to prevent that.  Unfortunately during all nights except the one I spent in Death Valley this tent accumulated a ridiculous amount of condensation under the rainfly.  So much condensation is accumulated that it is impossible to even exit the tent without getting drenched either from brushing up against it or from the puddles of it dripping to the ground.  I camped with my brother last week with me using the Kelty and him using the Ozark Trail and the Ozark Trail had no condensation accumulated in the morning while the Kelty was completely soaked so it is in fact worse than a $25 tent.The tent is very easy and quick to pitch although I had to replace the included stakes which bent during the first use.  The advertising for this tent talks about it being color coded but I have no idea what portion supposedly is since all the poles are orange and no color coding is present.  The floor of the tent is so thin it is see through and purchasing the available footprint is a requirement in my opinion, the footprint is color coded to the tent at least.  There is more headroom in this tent than many other models which helps when getting dressed in the morning.  If you are car camping and dont need something light my recommendation is get something cheaper because there is nothing about this Kelty that is special and it is too heavy for backpacking.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VX6CT3ZXXZMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005F5L900#wasThisHelpful","R1VX6CT3ZXXZMY","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the large size to use for some near car and near house camping where it would not have to be carried more than a few feet.  Overall I find it more comfortable than the Exped Synmat I previously had but not too a good choice for side sleepers.  The problem is that when the pad is fully inflated it is very uncomfortable unless you sleep on your back.  To make it comfortable for side sleeping I had to let out a considerable amount of air.  Once the air was let out I could find a comfortable position on my side and distribute my weight evenly while awake but the slightest movement resulted in my hip bone hitting the ground while sleeping and waking up sore in that area.  The pad is made out of too thin of a material with no noticeable type of insulation to prevent the hip bone from hitting the ground.  The Exped I had previously had some insulation within the pad and prevented the bone from hitting the ground. The material is also very noisy when touched or if you roll over.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYUVA84Q8IT1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B006634#wasThisHelpful","RYUVA84Q8IT1H","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this cd for a cousin who is a fan of Counting Cars somewhat as a joke but the numerous positive reviews here had me wondering if this could actually possibly sound good.  Ive given the cd a listen and think that The Count Danny should stick to working on cars.  I will give credit where it is due-the band is actually very good and they have the potential to do very well if someone else were singing.  The weak point on this album is Dannys bad singing voice and poor lyrics.  Dannys voice just is not made for singing he hits none of the notes correct he sings just like he talks on the show.For the questionable lyrics look no further than the chorus on the song Save a Little Something For Me  which goes I wish there were more than 24 hours in a day but there's not and i'm sorry but I wouldn't have it any other way""  What in the world is that even supposed to mean?  He wishes there were more hours but there arent and he is happy about it and wouldn't change it.what?Some of the songs are Rock & Roll where others are more Blues like such as the one mentioned above but none are worth listening to.  I will continue to watch Counting Cars because it is a great show but wont be buying any more of his cds.

"First off I agree with other reviewers that this should have just been supplied with the 14-42mm EZ lens for free.  Second, there is absolutely nothing about it that makes it cost over $30 since it likely costs pennies to manufacture.  Moving past that, it is a great thing to have and saves me the trouble of popping off the lens cap to take a picture and keep track of where I put it.  Im using this on the Pen E-P5 and all I do is turn the camera on, the lens extends, and the cap slides open just like with point and shoot cameras.  I wish this type of cap was available for the other micro 4/3 lenses.

When I ordered these I got worried becauase the name on the package changed from Sanyo to Panasonic and I was not sure if they changed them for the worse.

"Years ago I gave up on screen protectors when the only option were the horrible Invisishields which dried with bubbles all over and were a mess to put on.  When I bought my E-P5 though it was quite expensive and I decided to give this protector a try and luckily this item is easy to put on.  There is no water needed during installation and thus, no air bubbles.  Basically you just clean off the screen with the included cloth and sticky sheet then just peel the protector like a sticker and put it on.  I unfortunately didn't clean off a couple specs of dust so they show but the protector is not noticeable with the camera on or off.  Two protectors are included so if you mess up you can try again.

"I have a couple pairs of snake proof boots that are supposedly waterproof but somehow manage to leak in a little water if I am walking around in water for an extended period of time.  This boot dryer does an excellent job of drying them out without having them bake in the backyard sun all day.  I was seeking a dryer with a built in timer and this was the cheapest option I could find and overall am happy with it.My main complaint about this dryer is that all four vents have to be on at the same time and I would appreciate the ability to turn them on independently or in pairs of two.  I only have two feet and do not need four vents on at the same time.  I live in Houston and it is close to 100 degrees all summer long so I am forced to use the non-heated option on this dryer or else I would have the two unused vents pumping hot air out and making the room even hotter.  If you plan on using the heated option you need to also realize that the heating element smells and must be plugged in the garage or somewhere you don't have to deal with the stink.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM50Z6C1IVBOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001O3ATVC#wasThisHelpful","RM50Z6C1IVBOZ","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has become my default lens that is always left on the E-P5 paired with the auto lens cap.  It is an extremely small lens that allows me to carry the camera with lens attached in the smallest camera bag possible and snap photos quickly.  My main subjects of photography are reptiles and amphibians and I need a zoom lens because depending on the species (venomous or non-venomous in particular) I will be different distances away.  This lens also works excellent for landscape photographs.  Carrying numerous prime lenses (17mm, 25mm, etc) is not something I have any interest in doing and there is no need when this lens works so well and does the job of two or three of the prime lenses alone.  Photos come out excellent, sharp, in focus, and in most cases better than handheld photos I take with the 60mm f/2.8 macro lens.  I feel as if many people have missed the point of Micro 4/3 to carry around less gear.  This lens is for those of us who want a small, practical lens and the ability to carry around the camera without having to lug around a purse full of prime lenses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NM43U765HO78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWMOZEG#wasThisHelpful","R3NM43U765HO78","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall this is a lens I dont particularly like but will use for now because there is not much else on the market for 300mm Micro 4/3 lenses.  My main issue is that the lens is enormous and looks ridiculous when zoomed to 300mm and placed on my E-P5.  This lens causes the camera to become very front heavy and must be used on a tripod if you want to take shake free pictures.  I have tried changing shutter speeds and various settings on the camera such as the shutter lag time but 300mm (600mm with crop sensor) hand-held shots with this lens are blurry 99% of the time.  The problem is this lens is just too large for a smaller Micro 4/3 camera, something larger like the OM-D it might be perform better.  I have used many compact point and shoot cameras with 24X optical zoom (600mm) or greater hand-held and they all performed better than this lens at delivering a blur free image.When using a tripod photos taken using this lens come out in focus with nice color but somewhat slow focusing time.  I am waiting to see what the price and size of the Olympus 300mm prime will be when it is released and hopefully it will be a viable option to switch to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1680PZQ46ATMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3QYBIW#wasThisHelpful","R1680PZQ46ATMT","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw this in the book reviews section in the back of Herpetological Review a couple months ago and ignored it at first because I thought it was a field guide to Taiwan snakes.  After reading the reviews here though it became clear that this was a book filled with tales of herping similar to other classics like Snakes and Snake Hunting, etc.I have taken many trips to Asian countries and done a lot of herping there but never even considered Taiwan as a destination.  From reading the tales in Hans book though Taiwan is an excellent place to photograph snakes and has a large number of herpers also practicing the hobby.  This book is essentially a field journal of Hans herping adventures filled with natural history notes and photographs of the various species.  The stories throughout the book are entertaining and kept my attention.  I also appreciated the chapter on the pangolin at the end of the book as they have always interested me.  One tip I took from the book was road cruising in a jeep with the doors removed to cut down on the amount of time it takes to get out of the vehicle (also would prevent locking the keys inside) and will try that next time Im herping in Nevada.My only grudge against the book is that the author stresses how he did snake presentations at schools and constantly tried to educate people but at the same time filled his book with misinformation.  The aggressiveness of many snakes and results of their bites are greatly exaggerated in this book in numerous placessome examples of what Im talking about appear below.Page 63 - Referring to Elaphe carinata ""in the wild it strikes readily and bites without hesitation""Page 216 - Referring to Sinonatrix percarinata suriki ""if you've ever tangled with an American Nerodia, you're probably casting a knowing glance at your scars right now"".Page 229-230 ""Bats have an impressive number of needle teeth, and also carry enough crazy diseases to keep an entire virologist congress giddy with excitement""The quote from page 216 is particularly ridiculous because as someone who has bitten by countless Nerodia over the years and knows others who have there is not one scar on my body from them.  Nerodia bites result in nothing more than a small scratch or puncture that will heal within a few days with no trace of the bite left behind.  Thorny plants in the woods are more dangerous to the skin than a Nerodia bite.  These types of exaggerations will cause non-herpers who could potentially read this book to become even more scared of snakes.Altogether it is a good book to read if you are a herper and wanting to read some tales of herping in Taiwan.  Im knocking a star off because of the exaggerations mentioned above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGFFQ7CVWYVSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616461292#wasThisHelpful","RGFFQ7CVWYVSO","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had the size MW Synmat but sold it after a few nights because it was too uncomfortable for me side sleeping.  When inflated this pad is essentially the same as sleeping on one of the pool lounge floats due to the raised dome shaped channels running its length.  I found that the only way to get reasonably comfortable on this sleeping pad was to have a minimal amount of air in it but that also led to my hips touching the ground while side sleeping which hurts on hard surfaces.  If you have too much air in the pad it is way too hard and uncomfortable.  The pad inflates and deflates properly with the built in air pump and fits back in the carry sack with ease.  If you are considering buying this take a couple dollars and buy a pool lounge float and try sleeping on that first to determine whether you are going to like this type of design, personally Im going to get a pad with a flat surface next time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R572H32U6XSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038WRNAC#wasThisHelpful","R3R572H32U6XSU","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A couple months ago I spent time backcountry camping in Death Valley and realized just how bright the night sky was there compared to other areas Ive visited over the years.  I had seen this book mentioned in a magazine recently and decided to order a copy after my hiking trip.  The book is very interesting and highlights all kinds of issues I had never thought about related to our overuse of lighting at night.  Things discussed in the book include health effects related to artificial lighting, historical writings before artificial lighting was invented, various lighting advances over the years, etc.  I had never known there were groups that actively work with businesses, parks, communities, cities, etc to correct light pollution until reading this book.  I also never knew there were whole cities and communities designated as dark sky areas who have passed laws and restrictions on types of lighting allowed.  I am unfortunately surrounded by neighbors who have security lighting in the front and back of their homes turned on all night every night and there are references to articles proving security lighting to be a fallacy in this book.  The notes section at the end of the book has many good references and other books to read if you are interested in more information.The book is packed with information but at times it is hard to follow where quotations from other books end and where the text for this book begins.  For instance, the author will quote some lines from a historical book on night walks and then set out to physically walk the same places and I got lost many times trying to figure out whether a sentence was a quote or not.  I was also confused on the purpose of the discussion on the word melancholy that appears between pages 166-169 which seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the book.Overall, it is a good read but at times a confusing one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32URFNTIBMRY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316182907#wasThisHelpful","R32URFNTIBMRY4","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Take for instance the Coriolis effect, I had been convinced that toilets flush and sinks drain in a different direction in Australia but thanks to this book now I know how that MYTH came into existence.  There are plenty of other facts like this throughout the book which I will not spoil.  Chances are pretty good that you will learn something new from reading this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UJ8GVJYM7CC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0471409766#wasThisHelpful","R1UJ8GVJYM7CC5","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great book for learning the history of our national parks and the people who helped them become a reality.  As other reviewers have mentioned this is not a photography book of park pictures or a detailed guide to any of the parks, so do not buy it if that is what you are seeking.  The purpose of the book is to explain in detail the story of people like John Muir and Teddy Roosevelts involvement in the creation of Americas national park system.  The pictures are primarily of the people being described although there are many nice pictures of the parks and plenty of historic ones.  There are plenty of people in the book that I had never heard of prior to reading it who played pivotal roles in the creation of our park system.  Size wise the book is large and heavy and not comfortable to sit down and read it on your lap it is more something to place on a table and read.  Altogether, its a great book if you are interested in learning more about how Americas national park system came to be in existence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TSKAF8WQCOX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307268969#wasThisHelpful","R1TSKAF8WQCOX7","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this game hoping that it would improve my memory and concentration and overall I find it more annoying than helpful.  The Dr. Kawashama character who appears as a talking head is the primary issue I have with the game.  The premise of the game is that you spend 5 minutes of training a day but that 5 minutes is actually around 15-20 due to all the stupid talking you must endure from the Dr (holding down the stylus to fast forward helps some but not much) .  First, when you turn on the game each day you must endure a brain training tip almost every time.  When you choose Devilish Training and open one of the games you must sit around and hear how you did last time and between each level you must hear the same speech every time you scored greater than 85% going down a level blah blah blah.  After playing the game for 3 months I get the point already and dont need to hear this between each level!  If you play with the volume on and do something wrong the Dr. will start making stupid comments at that point as well like oh you almost got it or something similar.  While playing any game you must look at the Dr.s huge head in the background the entire time, it is just so annoying.Moving beyond the Dr.s annoyance to the actual game I find that this version doesnt do much better than any of the past Brain Ages when it comes to recognition of what you are writing or saying.  If you write a lowercase g, p, or q while doing Word Attack the game does not recognize it 99% of the time.  I once spent over 2 minutes just getting it to recognize an absolutely perfectly written p.  While doing number games like Calculations x 20 half the time it does not recognize the numbers you are writingyou might write a 1 and it somehow picks it up as 24 or something similarly ridiculous.  Devilish Pairs I find to be incredibly inconsistent in that one time you may have multiple pairs next to each other and after that none are even nearby.  This causes the problem of allowing you to move up a level and think you are getting better when in actuality you may never advance again when the pairs are not close by.Altogether, there should be an option to turn the Dr. off and not hear his speeches or see the head in the background of each game the annoyance factor is the primary issue with the game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LL2H03P2LA5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098F1Y3K#wasThisHelpful","R3LL2H03P2LA5T","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book because I spend the majority of my free time researching and photographing reptiles and pick up pretty much any book that has to do with alligators.  The instant I looked at the photograph of the shirtless author on the cover I had a feeling this book was going to be entertaining because it is nothing like the typical author photo you would expect on a book jacket.  This book is without a doubt the most entertaining thing I have read in a long time and I actually enjoyed it more for the authors stories and style of writing then the actual crocodilian research.  The overall premise of the book is to explain the travels and people involved with the authors research done while writing his thesis on crocodilian communication.  The way he travels and the descriptions are in most cases both ridiculous and amusing at the same time to anyone who travels in a typical fashion.  I cant even imagine travelling some of the ways he did and would never do many of these things myself.  There are perfect descriptions for many things in this book that I have also observed such as some photographers seeming to base their egos on whose camera lens is the longest.  Descriptions of bribes and cultures around the world are laughable but true and I especially liked the authors mention of a foreign official not accepting a bribe in his passport once as witnessing a miracle.For those interested in reading the actual thesis that was written by Vladimir you can find it on his website in PDF format for free (the website address is mentioned on the inner book jacket).  There are also PDF versions of various research papers he has published in scientific journals along with English translations of some of his earlier books.  I actually learned a lot about alligators I never knew before reading his research papers regarding hunting strategies and communication.  I highly recommend this book both to people interested in reptiles and people just looking for a hilarious story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25SE1W5CILHET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611458935#wasThisHelpful","R25SE1W5CILHET","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall when this camera works correctly it is a remarkable piece of equipment.  My childhood was filmed using enormous VHS recording camcorders, followed by the VHS-C, and Mini DV all of which took horrible quality videos compared to something as tiny as the GoPro it is truly a huge technological wonder.  I use this camera primarily in 1080/60P narrow mode and do not like any of the wide angle fisheye looking modes.  Video quality is excellent for the size and when used in correct situations.  The GoPro is made for action and use in places where you would not risk using another camcorder in my opinion.  I would never mount my Panasonic HD camcorder underneath my car or take it underwater for instance but I do it with the GoPro rather frequently.  The underwater housing works well both underwater and to protect the camera from rocks and things when driving down the road.  One thing I wish they would offer on the next model is the ability to take the highest MP photos without it having to be the stupid wide angle mode.My reason for a negative review is that this camera consistently gives me corrupt videos.  Before you type me a smart comment saying the issue is my memory card and that I am an idiot read on.  I am well aware of the counterfeit memory cards causing problems that is not my issue.  I have multiple Sandisk Extreme Micro SD cards that I use with this camcorder which have all been purchased from reputable retailers and all pass testing with both H2testw and Flash Drive Tester with no errors whatsoever on read or write.  All of the memory cards work flawlessly in other devices I own as well.  Every time I use them in the GoPro however I get at least one corrupt video usually within the first 60 minutes of videos.  The videos transfer to the computer as mp4 they just have no thumbnail image and they are not playable.  I have tried transferring them using Adobe Premiere Elements 10, GoPro Studio, and simple dragging and dropping off the memory card onto the computer they are corrupt either way.  My GoPro has never been knocked off or stopped recording due to damage or battery life running out.  There is no message on the GoPro after recording saying it is fixing the video.  I have contacted GoPro support about the problem since the camcorder is less than 3 months old but they are useless.  All they will tell me is that the problem has to be the memory card and will not take the camcorder back or exchange it I have been going back and forth with them for a while now it is like talking to a wall.  At some point if I get a properly working camera I will revise my review but as of now due to the loss of numerous videos with no solution in sight this is not trustworthy enough of a device to recommend to anybody.  Luckily I use this device for somewhat unimportant things and have not lost anything critical.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19564KL6A32AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3F0GLU#wasThisHelpful","R19564KL6A32AJ","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Checked this one out from the library because I am incredibly bored at work and looking to switch careers so reading anything I can get my hands on for free regarding career moves.  It is an entertaining read the authors stories are engaging and I finished the book quickly.  Overall however there is nothing really gained from reading this book other than the entertainment value of the read.  The points being explained in the various chapters are things that anyone with common sense should already know like not quitting a job until you have something better already lined up.  The vast majority of the book seems to be trying to drive traffic to the authors blog since it is mentioned on just about every page.  Perhaps some people will read this because they are fans of his blog but personally I had never heard of the author or the blog before reading this book.  If you are looking to switch careers and become a full time blogger or want to read an entertaining book then definitely read this, if you are looking for insightful information on career changes though this book is not of much value.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPYZ27VKHCS9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982986270#wasThisHelpful","RPYZ27VKHCS9U","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a Nintendo handheld user since the first Game Boy came out and am now an adult in his early 30s.  Previous to the 3DS XL I was using the DS Lite which is about as close to perfect as I could ask the weight was right, size was good, bright screen, matte finish on the inside, and comfortable to play for hours.  The 3DS XL on the other hand is terrible.  I put off purchase of this device for a long time but eventually all the new games I wanted to play or download required the 3DS platform.  Here is my summary of this device after owning it for 6 months now:ConsWeight  The 3DS XL is too heavy, it is uncomfortable to hold for more than a couple minutes.  The top screen seems to be top heavy and it constantly feels like the whole thing is pulling down backwards.Ergonomics  The buttons are placed horribly and the device does not feel good while in your hand.  I find the joystick control to be absolutely useless for the games I play (New Super Mario Bros series and other downloaded NES or SNES side scrollers primarily).  The arrow keypad is placed in an uncomfortable area and if the joystick were eliminated it would be a better device.  I see a lot of reviewers complaining that they wanted a second joystick control but that serves no purpose for me  When I play games like Brain Age I have a hard time writing on the screen and come nowhere close to records I set on the DS Lite.Screen size  The screen is large but at the end of the day it is too large for any non 3DS games.  When I try to play Solitaire in Club House Games the cards are so pixelated they are almost illegible.  Old NES or SNES games downloaded through the eshop look terrible.  This device appeals to the bigger is better crowd who carry around cell phones the size of a tablet and think that the largest thing is automatically the best.Screen wobble  The top screen wobbles too much.  I have tried to eliminate this by placing a rubber foot between the two screens like various videos online show but they constantly fall off and the screen wobbles again until I can replace them.3D  My eyes cannot tolerate even the minutest level of 3D.  I have the 3D effect turned completely off, meaning the one thing that made this device different from the DS is pointless.ProThe 3DS XL has one positive thing going for it which is the matte black finish surrounding the inside screens.  I would love to buy the regular 3DS if they offered it with a matte black inside screen.  I do not understand why computer monitor manufacturers and Nintendo think that having shiny light reflective material surrounding a screen makes sense.Summary  I wish Nintendo would have made games such as New Super Mario Bros 2 playable on the DS Lite so that I would not have had to upgrade to the 3DS XL.  Alternatively, make a 3DS Lite or offer the 3DS with matte black inside screens for those of us who do not enjoy having light reflected in our eyes the whole time we play.  I'll give it 2 stars because those of us who played the original Game Boy can attest to how much better this is than that at least.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2224ZMAQLAXYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1A1SP6#wasThisHelpful","R2224ZMAQLAXYO","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to use with the WG-3 GPS camera.  I knew that the battery could not be changed and accepted that fact before purchase so giving a poor review based on other problems I found out afterwards.The first problem with this item is that the range is extremely limited.  It only works up to I would say less than 10 feet away and has to be pointed directly at the sensor on the camera with nothing in between, if you point it 6 inches away from the sensor it does not work.  If you were planning to use this remote to take a portrait of your family for instance this remote does not work because you would have to be holding it pointed directly at the camera in the picture and could not trigger the shutter with the remote behind someones back or in your pocket.The second problem is that the remote cannot turn the camera on or off, which i'd assumed one of the two buttons did.  I was hoping to use this to take night time photos of the sky while camping without having to leave the tent but since the remote cannot turn the camera on that isn't going to happen.Due to the limitations above I have found this remote to be completely useless.  This remote will not do anything for you other than allow you to trigger the shutter when the camera is already turned on and you are standing within arms length with the remote pointed directly at the sensor on the camera.  If you are looking to take night landscape pictures with no camera shake or portraits use the self timer or an interval shooting mode and save the money you were thinking of spending on this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VW20KWO90RWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ERG30W#wasThisHelpful","R2VW20KWO90RWC","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I searched around for a long time online for a good camping pillow for a side sleeper and came up with the large version of this as the winner. It made sense to purchase since i've used an Exped Synmat sleeping pad for over a year which I like.  Recently tried it for the first time camping in Death Valley and wow did I hate this pillow.  The slanted design where one side is higher than the other just kills it for me.  Regardless of which end I tried laying on and different air pressures there was just no comfort with this pillow.  It felt like trying to sleep on a wrongly inflated balloon.  I really wish I had tried this out before my trip because I ended up sleeping on one of the headrests pulled out of the rental car when it became obvious after 3 hours trying with this air pillow that I would never get to sleep on it.  If you are intent on getting an air pillow you would be better off buying a seat for an inflatable boat for about half the price of this pillow.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HL1OXAU606G8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047BXDBG#wasThisHelpful","R1HL1OXAU606G8","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have owned two pairs of this shoe in the original version 1 so figured this would be an easy purchase since those two fit me fine for years now.  I went to a New Balance store to try these on and my version 1 size was way too small so I ended up buying a wide version of these to get the same fit.  I tried them on in the store with normal socks on and figured since I usually wear them sockless that the reason they felt weird was due to the socks.  When I got home and tried them sockless I realized the problem is actually the arch area is different from the version1 shoe.  The version 2 arch on the inside of the foot is much higher, basically the sole of the shoe comes halfway up your foot.  I returned these because the hard arch is just completely uncomfortable and a poor redesign.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PMF8ATGMIED2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BH3ORZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1PMF8ATGMIED2","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a user of the Panasonic superzoom models for years now an all of them have been excellent.  Currently I am on my third ZS15 due to breaking the previous two because I do not treat them nicely.  The image quality is second to none in this product category.  My main uses for the camera are wildlife/nature photography and landscape photography while hiking.  I carry this camera typically in a small Pearstone bag and use the chest strap on a Camelbak to hold the camera bag via the belt clip.  I will never own a DSLR because I hike as light as possible and do not have the patience or room to haul around multiple lenses anywhere.  Why bother when I can have this camera hanging by my chest and take excellent pictures?  As a tip use the ""Vivid"" color mode for any of the Panasonic superzoom cameras it produces the highest quality images and sharp colors while the normal mode is somewhat bland.If you own a Panasonic superzoom camera sooner or later you are going to get dust/dirt behind the lens on the CCD sensor.  My recommendation to you is to search on Youtube and you will find a very well done instructional video on how to clean that sensor.  Prior to going on a trip or somewhere important make sure to clean the sensor in advance so that all your pictures are not ruined by that tiny piece of dirt. On a previous Panasonic model I sent the camera back to Panasonic repairs to clean the sensor for me and it took them over 2 months both times, while it takes me less than 5 minutes after learning how do not waste your time with their warranty service for the CCD sensor cleaning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R387NU68OYMWE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00728ZAHG#wasThisHelpful","R387NU68OYMWE6","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the book to get if you are planning a trip to Costa Rica and doing some Herp photography.  Costa Rica is an excellent country to locate Reptiles and Amphibians and you can find them just about everywhere.  Savages book is without question the most detailed at identifying and learning about these species.  One issue I have found after a trip to Costa Rica is that the taxonomic names for species in Costa Rica are a mess.  Most taxonomic names have changed since the publication of this book and most seem to have changed multiple times, it is a bit ridiculous.  Plan to look up the current taxonomic names for any species you photograph while in Costa Rica because the name in this book is probably no longer correct.As a tip when you photograph amphibians in Costa Rica if you want to identify them you will need to get both pictures of the animal above, below, and the feet if you plan to identify them.  A lot of the frogs are almost identical with the only difference being something on the bottom of their feet or whether a certain toe is webbed.  For this reason, I ended up with a lot of pictures that just had to label as unknown frog.As a second tip this book is heavy at just under 7 lbs and you probably will not want to lug it with you to Costa Rica.  There is a company named Rainforest Publications that makes small pamphlets for identification of different creatures (Frogs, Snakes, insects, etc) which are laminated and you can carry those in the field with you while in Costa Rica much easier than this book.  You can buy those guides before your trip and save some money, but they are sold pretty much everywhere in the country if you forget including the airport.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCZHZ9UUYRQ5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226735370#wasThisHelpful","RCZHZ9UUYRQ5H","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am planning a trip to Death Valley and bought this book to get some ideas on where to go other than the well known destinations.  This book is packed with off the beaten path hikes and every single hike has a tremendous amount of background information on the specific area.  The author has obviously done a lot of research on Death Valley and there is probably more information in this book than you would ever even want to know.  Hikes are detailed enough to know that the author has done them, knows the terrain, and has spent a considerable amount of time in Death Valley.  If there is anything that would improve this book I wouldn't mind GPS waypoints for some of the hikes but as it is this book is excellent.Update 4/24/14 - I finally took my first trip to Death Valley this month and this book I will say again is excellent.  There are many mines that you would never know are there without this book like those around the Racetrack and Ubehebe Peak.  I am already planning my next trip because I loved it and realized after reading the book again afterwards that I missed things that were right under my nose and should have read certain pages better.  As a bonus I noticed when reviewing my pictures that I took the exact same picture that is on the books cover in Fall Canyon without knowing it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S2K4K476IIIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0965917800#wasThisHelpful","R3S2K4K476IIIQ","A1OZYQ4V83X8K4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OZYQ4V83X8K4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this nail clipper set  it comes with both large and small clippers, plus a bonus emery board and a handy little travel case. The quality of the clippers is great  thicker metal with smooth movement so I don't feel like I'm going to accidentally break the clippers. I have a husband and four sons who have been using these clippers and no one has popped them apart yet, as has happened with lower quality nail clippers when the boys try to trim thicker nails. The blades on both clippers are extremely sharp  they trim fingernails and toenails quickly and cleanly without bending or splitting them. With the included carrying case, this is a great nail grooming set to keep in your purse (or briefcase, or gym bag, or wherever).I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OV3WTSES73ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMDAGGS#wasThisHelpful","R2OV3WTSES73ZJ","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even after reading the product description, I was surprised at the size of these storage bags. They really are enormous! I've never used vacuum storage bags before, so I did have a teensy bit of a learning curve, i.e., I overstuffed the bag the first time I used it. But even packed to the brim, I was happy with the results. I took a huge pile of my son's outgrown clothes and packed them into one of the bags. Since I'm expecting a baby boy in October, I'm saving these outfits to hand down to the new baby, but they won't be needed for a couple of years. The clothes overfilled an 18 gallon storage tote, but all fit into the bag (which is where the ""overstuffed bag"" comes in). I closed the top of the bag (kind of like a double-sealed Ziploc bag), removed the cap from the vacuum hole, and sucked the air out  it compressed the bag down to about half of the original size. I've since discovered that I can get better results by not stuffing the bags so full, but I'm more worried about keeping the clothing safe from moisture and spiders as they sit in our basement than I am about sucking them flat, so I left that first bag as it was. The seal is really tight (I made sure to screw the cap back on as tightly as I could), and no air has gotten back into the bag since I vacuum sealed it. (I'm going with the theory that if air can't get in, neither can dust or spiders). I do kind of wish that the bags had handles somewhere, as the size makes them sort of awkward and heavy to tote around (especially if you're seven months pregnant), but other than that I'm very pleased with these bags. Now I need about twenty more to store all of our blankets, my older boys' outgrown clothes, my own clothes that I'm hoping to fit back into someday, etc. and so forth!I received this product in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IB0LIWU0CST9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XB97KOG#wasThisHelpful","R1IB0LIWU0CST9","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd never used a crystal nail file before purchasing this one, but now that I've tried it, I'll never go back to the cheap emery boards again. When I first opened the package, I really wasn't sure how well this would file rough edges off my nails, since the file feels almost smooth to the touch instead of rough or sandpapery. But it actually works SO much better than any other type of nail file I've ever tried. I have medium length fingernails and it drives me nuts to have rough edges on them that snag and catch on things. With other types of files, you have to be careful with the direction you're filing, otherwise you'll just create more rough edges. With this one, I just glide it over my fingernails in any direction and it shapes them perfectly and leaves perfectly smooth edges.Obviously I can't speak as to whether or not this file will truly last a lifetime, since I've only had it for four weeks, but so far so good! If you've used cardboard files, you know that you can see the lines of wear on them pretty quickly as you use them and rub the grit off. Since this one is made of hardened glass, the grit doesn't wear down and you can't accidentally bend it either. I would assume you could break or shatter it if you tried, but this one comes with a protective case that I keep it inside. The case itself is just thin, lightweight plastic, nothing fancy, but it serves the purpose of keeping the file from possibly getting broken if you keep it in the bottom of your purse like I do.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHD0I5W4M2RQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6DVVHE#wasThisHelpful","RHD0I5W4M2RQW","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this watch as a gift for my 19-year-old son, and couldn't be more pleased with it. It's a much ""classier"" watch than what he's worn before, more suitable for an adult than the plastic or faux-leather styles he's worn in the past. I love the natural patterns in the wood and the carved details. On the back of the watch face, all the information (such as the Bewell logo) is actually carved right into the wood. The wood is very, very smooth, with no rough edges that might catch on your skin or clothing. It's also listed as water resistant (although not waterproof), which is a must-have when gifting a watch to a young adult.This is a larger watch (about two inches diameter across the face of it), so while it looks a little oversized on my scrawny little girly wrist (pictured), it's a good size for a man's watch. Despite that, it's incredibly lightweight. The band itself is adjustable up to about 8.5 inches around (in comparison, my wrist is 7 inches). The description states that you can easily make the band smaller by removing joints from the strap  I haven't tried to do this myself yet, but it looks like it would be relatively simple to do. The clasp on the watch is unique  one end fits to the other like a puzzle piece, with magnets in both ends to hold them together.The packaging of this watch is also quite nice, ready for gifting. The watch wraps around a cushioned velvety pillow inside of a sturdy black cardboard box; the lid of the box has a plastic ""viewing window"" that displays the watch inside. And the cardboard box comes inside of a clear plastic box for extra protection.This is a very attractive watch, and I would love to get one of the more feminine styles for myself now that I've seen the beauty and craftsmanship of this particular design!I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWKUUQRRFLT5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010B17AJQ#wasThisHelpful","RWKUUQRRFLT5H","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great assortment of decorative butterflies in various sizes. The body of each butterfly is molded plastic, and the wings are a sort of medium weight glossy paper. I checked and you *can* tear the wings, but not easily  I had to actually try to start a tear on one of them. The colors are bright and vibrant, and the wing patterns vary so you're not stuck with a bunch of boring identical butterflies.The butterflies arrived separated by color into two clear envelopes; in addition to a small magnet on each butterfly, each package contained a sheet of 12 round double-sided sticky circles. The magnets aren't super strong  plenty strong enough to hold the lightweight butterflies to your fridge or other surface, but probably not enough to use them to hold up anything other than the weight of the butterfly itself. The sticky tabs, on the other hand, are super sticky  I tried to move one of the butterflies after sticking it to a wall that has a flat paint on it, and the butterfly came off the sticky tab before the sticky tab came off the wall. I was able to remove the tab without damaging the paint, but it took a little bit of effort and might possibly damage some kinds of paint. You could, of course, use your own mounting tabs instead of the included ones if you wanted to make sure you could remove the butterflies without damaging the surface underneath, though. I did find that the included tabs didn't stick very well to a textured wall painted with some sort of glossy, slippery paint, but NOTHING sticks to the walls in that room.Overall I found these to be a really cute and easy way to add some color and fun to the walls (and refrigerator). At two dozen butterflies for the listed price, this is well worth the purchase.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M8MZL6AAXGS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S4XBSLK#wasThisHelpful","R2M8MZL6AAXGS3","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been a little bit of a hippie at heart, so tie-dye bell bottoms are perfect for me. And these pants are incredibly soft and comfy in addition to being a fun style. They're stretchy without feeling tight or restrictive. They actually fit similarly to leggings with the amount of stretch to the fabric, but the wide flare on the bottom keeps them from looking like leggings. I'm 5'10 and found the length of the size large pants to be perfect (which means that shorter girls might have to hem them a bit). I'm also seven months pregnant, but the material (95% rayon and 5% spandex in the pair I ordered) is stretchy enough that it goes around my tummy without binding or feeling tight or uncomfortable.The material is also extremely lightweight, so these pants are comfortable even on a warm summer day (although they'd be too thin for cold weather without something underneath them). They can become slightly sheer when stretched, but only in bright light (and if someone's looking specifically). Quality-wise, I'm very pleased  despite the light, stretchy fabric, I don't feel like the material is ""fragile"" or like it will snag or tear if I catch them on something.

"Living in an older house with my husband and our four kids, I believe that there's no such thing as too many (or enough!) carbon monoxide detectors. And this one comes with everything you need, including two AA batteries so you can put it to work right away. Also included are two screws and two anchors for hanging it up. There's a circular mounting plate that you attach to the wall with those two screws, and then the batteries are installed into an open compartment on the back of the CO detector (that section rests against the mounting plate, and the detector itself is held in place with tabs on the mounting plate, making battery installation and changes very quick and easy).The front of the detector has three lights  power, alarm, and fault  and a display screen, plus a test/hush button and a ""peak level"" button. As long as everything's okay, the green power button gives a quick blink a couple of times a minute so you know it's working. When you press the ""peak level"" button it lets you know the highest detected level of carbon monoxide since the last reset. In the event of dangerous CO levels, the red alarm light would blink plus the audible alarm would go off. ""Danger"" levels start at 30ppm, and how fast the alarm goes off is determined by how much CO it detects  if it detects as low as the 30ppm for 120 minutes, you'll get an alarm; higher levels would set off the alarm much faster. For example, 300ppm would trigger the alarm after just 3 minutes.It's recommended that you have at least one CO detector on each level of your house; in a perfect world, one in each individual bedroom.  And I definitely recommend this particular CO detector, in particular because of the peak level feature.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R250TK6ER3D1YJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVUETFI#wasThisHelpful","R250TK6ER3D1YJ","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really looking forward to trying this product out  my husband and I like to do a lot of outdoor activities, and I thought this would be a good way to keep our phones charged up while we're out and about. Sadly, I could not get this charger to work for the life of me. So far I've only tried it with my phone (a Samsung Galaxy S6), but even sitting in direct sunlight, my phone never charges. I tried leaving the charger sitting outside (at the recommended 45 degree angle) on a bright sunny day for several hours, and still nothing  I don't even get the charging symbol on my phone. It's like plugging my phone into a charging cable that's not plugged into anything at all. I am going to have my husband give it a try this weekend and see if he has any better luck; if so, I'll update my review to reflect his experience.On the plus side (if I could actually get it to work): Since this solar charger comes with suction cups and carabiners (four of each), there are multiple options for places to put it (like attached to a backpack or suction-cupped to a vehicle windshield). A short micro USB cable is also included. The back of the charger has a zippered mesh pocket to hold everything it comes with  I can even fit my phone (a Galaxy S6 in an Otterbox Defender case) in the pocket and zip it closed.

" 5:29 MinsThis was my first time ever setting up and using a dash cam, and I found it quite easy to do. It's basically plug-n-play, although I did have to track down an SD card, as that's not included with the camera. It comes with both a sticky-tape dash mount and a suction cup attachment, so you have your choice of where to put it. I used the suction cup, which has a locking feature that makes it very secure - I didn't even wash the windshield or get the suction cup wet before mounting, and it still stayed stuck to the window even when driving over cobblestones. The camera lens swivels back and forth with a little ridged dial on the side, and the display, while small, is quite clear. Also included are an extra-long USB cord and a cigarette lighter adapter, so you don't have *have* to have the camera fully charged before you take it out for a test ride.Once you turn the camera on, the interface is really intuitive. There are four buttons below the display - in rest mode, the first one contains all the menu options, the second one takes you to a folder of saved images/videos, the third one takes a still shot, and the fourth one starts the camera recording. There are a lot of features, options, and settings to play with in the menu screen,  everything from the standard date/time set and stamp to adjusting the white balance, color, exposure, ISO, etc. In record mode, the first button is ""SOS"" which will lock protect the section of video it's currently on (so that the looping doesn't overwrite the file). The second button turns the microphone off or on, the third button zooms in and out, and the fourth button stops the recording.When trying to review the dash cam footage on my computer, I couldn't get my computer to ""see"" the camera, but I just popped out the SD card and accessed the files that way. The recording is smooth and the video resolution is really good - if I were ever involved in an incident and needed to use the camera footage it would be completely possible to do so, as I could clearly read street signs and license plate numbers when playing back the recording. My only wish is that it would automatically save the recording in the event of an accident instead of someone needing to hold down the SOS button to save the file - but overall, for the price and quality of the video recordings, I'm definitely a fan of this camera.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPEMMP48Q9ZGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011I4XMXS#wasThisHelpful","RPEMMP48Q9ZGG","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:45 MinsMy two-year-old son LOVES this train set! He's a big fan of trains in general, but a little too young (and destructive) for a standard train set. This beginner train and tracks is perfect for a train-obsessed toddler. This set comes with 12 pieces of track, four little ramp-thingies to support the raised sections of track, a battery-powered train, and some stickers (which I chose to leave off, since my son would just peel them off and stick them to the wall anyway).There are no instructions included, but you really don't need any - even with ""help"" from my little guy, it took under five minutes to set the track up and have the train making laps. (Using the picture on the box as a guide to which pieces of track go where is the key). The pieces each have tabs to connect them to the next section, although they don't ""lock"" in place, and the ramps serve a dual purpose of both supporting the raised sections of track and holding those pieces of track together. The train takes two AA batteries, and the battery compartment is secured with a screw. (Note: there's no gasket inside the battery door to hold the screw in place once you've loosened it, so be sure you don't drop that teensy little screw when installing the batteries!) The train has a simple on/off switch, but sadly no volume control. Oh well, the owner of this particular train is the youngest of four boys, so it's not like my house was calm and peaceful to start with! Once you turn the train on, it makes some impressively loud train sounds, the light on the front flashes, and the wheels spin to pull it around the track. It stays on the track perfectly, even around the curves and up and down the hills - until your toddler derails it. It can be a little bit tricky to get the wheels lined up with the edges of the track, so mom or dad will probably have to be in charge of putting the train to rights every time your little engineer takes it off-roading.All in all, I'd definitely recommend this beginner train set for any kiddo who's fascinated by trains - my son even set the iPad aside to play with this train set, so you know it's a winner!I received this product in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCPELYTO2K8A0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7F218W#wasThisHelpful","RCPELYTO2K8A0","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm 5'10 and currently 6 months pregnant, and this shirt in a size XL fits perfectly. (I usually wear a large, but went up a size given my current ""expanded"" state). The drape of the panels on the bottom of the shirt are very flattering, and while it's still obvious that I'm expecting while wearing this shirt, I believe it'll do a lovely job of camouflaging my post-partum tummy in a few months. The bottom of the shirt hits me at hip length (though it should be mentioned that I have a shorter torso for my height).The material is very lightweight and breathable (97% rayon and 3% spandex) so it's comfortable to wear even on a warm sunny day. It does appear rather sheer at first glance (before you put it on), but happily it's not see through once it's on. I did wear a camisole underneath the shirt just in case, but even outside in direct light you can't see the camisole through the material of the shirt. It's labeled hand wash and line dry. You're also not supposed to iron it, but it doesn't seem to wrinkle (and I don't iron anyway). The material has a bit of stretch to it (the neckline does not, however), which makes for a very comfortable fit. The scoop neck is cut low enough to be flattering, but not so low as to be considered revealing.

"This is a great set of gel pens, with colors and styles for just about any art project.  I started using gel pens when I developed an interest in adult coloring books  they're more vibrant than colored pencils, and easier to use than even fine tip markers. They also don't bleed through like markers do.This set comes with TWO packages (identical) of 48 pens each; each package has four trays of pens in it, so they're somewhat sorted by style (standard, neon, swirl, glitter, metallic, and milky). Since you get two identical sets, it's ideal for either keeping one for yourself and gifting the other set to your favorite artist, or having backups for when your favorite colors eventually run dry. Personally, I have two teenage artists in residence, so two sets of pens means they both get a set of their own.Most of the pens worked right out of the box with no scribbling required to get them going, although a couple of them did take a couple of scribbles to get the ink flowing. The tips vary in size between 0.6 and 1.0 mm (depending on the pen style), and all of the pens in the package that I opened write cleanly and smoothly with bright, vibrant colors. Both the caps and the ends reflect the color of the pen so it's easy to find exactly the shade you're looking for. While I purchased these as gifts for my artistic teens, I'll probably be buying another set for my own personal use, since they work better than the brand I've been using.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW4H1TJXKFOED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KO8UK80#wasThisHelpful","RW4H1TJXKFOED","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm really impressed with these baby proofing locks  they're super for areas that are more difficult to childproof! I have four children, including a very curious and clever toddler, and another baby on the way, and I also have an old house with hard-to-childproof ""features."" For example, our kitchen sink is an old-fashioned porcelain cabinet unit, with metal doors in the cabinet portion. So I can't secure the cabinet under the sink (where most people, including me, like to store cleaning supplies) with standard cabinet locks  that are designed to screw into wooden cabinets. These cabinets also don't have handles that I can loop a childproofing latch through. I was seriously considering supergluing a hasp to the cabinet and padlocking it shut, and then I discovered these locks and decided to give them a chance first.I followed the directions on the back of the package and couldn't be happier with the final results. You can adjust the straps to the length you need by trimming the end. Once you have it set to the length you need (I left it as the length it came for my under-the-sink cabinet), you lock the black tab in place  I found it easier to tug up on the end of the strap to slide the tab into the locked position. The 3M foam adhesive tape sticks very securely  the packaging recommends giving the adhesive 24 hours to fully cure, but I was able to tug on the cabinet doors just a few minutes later and the adhesive didn't budge. Once you have it all installed, you just slide the tab on the other side open to release the lock, and push it down onto the base to re-lock it. And ta-da, no more worries about the baby drinking the dish soap!The package came with six of these nifty little locks, and there's no shortage of places they'll come in handy  locking the oven door, locking the refrigerator, locking the toilet lid I'm even planning on using one on the door between my toddler's bedroom and the bathroom as a back-up to the doorknob cover. These locks are terrific, and even if you have wooden cabinets, these ones are MUCH faster and easier to install than other child safety locks/latches I've installed before. I haven't tried to remove them yet (and won't be for several years), but apparently they're also easy to remove when you no longer need them just by heating the area where the tabs are attached with a hair dryer for a few minutes.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RABTJX7NB5H88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y01D6BK#wasThisHelpful","RABTJX7NB5H88","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great product, especially for the price. I've definitely seen lower-quality toys for much higher prices. My favorite feature is that you can easily control the speed on a ""sliding scale"" depending on how much power you want. The vibration speed is controlled by a ridged band at the very end of the battery cap, you just twist it to turn the speed up or down.

"This is a great set of frequently-used essential oils  if you're just starting out using essential oils and aren't sure which ones will be most helpful for you, or if you want to keep a set of oils in a different area of your house, this is an ideal collection. It would also make a great gift for anyone who uses or is interested in essential oils, and the packaging the set comes in (a very sturdy, thick cardboard box with attractive graphics that's sealed upon arrival) adds to the ""gift giving"" attractiveness.Calily uses dark amber glass bottles with a screw-top plastic lid that's sealed upon arrival. I've purchased other oils where I could tell what was in the delivery before I even opened it because the scent ""leaked"" from the packaging; with these bottles, you can't smell anything until you actually open the bottle. Once opened, the caps screw back on nice and tight, with no leaks (of oil or scent) even if you store them on their sides. The bottles also have built-in droppers that are easy to use to dispense just the right amount from. Each bottle is clearly labeled with the type of oil inside.The oils themselves seem to be high quality, with lovely scents. My favorite is the lavender  lavender oil is what started my interest in essential oils, as I have a child with autism and his therapist used lavender oil as an amazingly effective calming technique when he would start to get overwhelmed. I'm also a big fan of the peppermint and sweet orange  a few drops of each in a diffuser helps energize you, which is something I'm in desperate need of! And the tea tree oil is great as a disinfectant and to help treat acne. A couple of the varieties in this collection are ones that I haven't used before, so I'm quite excited to expand my knowledge of essential oils and learn about the uses of the less familiar varieties.I received this product free in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA79E2N284PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UGHNIWO#wasThisHelpful","RA79E2N284PW","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several portable power banks, and I have several external speakers. But this is the first product I heard of that combines both of those in one item. The PowerSource MusicStick comes with an instruction booklet, a USB cable, a cable with 5 interchangeable connectors (mini USB, micro USB, 8-pin/Apple lightning, 30-pin/MacBook, and what I have tentatively identified as a Nokia charger), and a handy carrying pouch. In terms of size, it's not very heavy (just over 6 ounces), but it's a little larger than a ""pocket sized"" power bank  you *could* carry it in your pocket, but not securely (and probably not at all if your pants have the typical stupid ""girl pockets""  i.e. half the size of normal people pockets). The MusicStick is only 1.5 inches diameter but it's 5.5 inches long.The end of the speaker swivels (lift and twist) to allow access to the ports, which is a pretty nifty design. To charge it up, you open the end to expose the USB port and use a USB cable to plug it in to another USB port, like on an electrical adapter or on your computer. (This is a little bit different from most power banks, as there's no available micro USB port for charging  it's USB to USB only). When all the lights on the LED status bar are lit, it's fully charged. The audio jack is built right into the cap part of the MusicStick.The power bank portion of the MusicStick features 5200mAh battery capacity with a single 1A port and an output of 600mAh. My phone, a Galaxy S6, has a 2550mAh battery, so I could charge my phone from dead to 100% twice without having to recharge the MusicStick. It doesn't charge up my phone as quickly as other (larger and heavier) power banks I have due to the 1A port (instead of 2.1A) - according to my status bar, it would take approximately 38 minutes to fully charge my phone when the battery is at 82%, which is fine if you want to recharge the battery while you're sleeping or while your device is in your backpack or whatnot. And it'll at least slow the drain on your battery if you're using your phone (or other device) while it's plugged into the power bank. It works like any other portable charger to charge your device  plug one end of a USB cable into the charger, and the other end into your device. The interchangeable cable that comes with the MusicStick comes in very handy here, since you can swap out the tip to fit whatever device it is that you want to charge.As a speaker, it should first be noted that this is NOT a Bluetooth speaker  you have to plug it directly into your device's audio jack. The biggest negative, as other reviewers have mentioned, is that the audio jack won't fit if your phone has a thicker case (like an Otterbox) on it. Since my phone cost more than my monthly mortgage payment it pretty much never leaves its Otterbox, so I'll be sticking with Bluetooth speakers for it, but if your phone is naked or in a thin case you shouldn't have a problem. Basically, you need to be able to press the end of the MusicStick right up to the edge of your device where the audio port is. I have a small, inexpensive MP4 player for my kids that doesn't have a case, and the speaker works great with that. (I wonder if there might not be a way to add a short retractable cord onto the end of the audio jack, so that it might be pulled out slightly from the cap of the MusicStick, with the cord retracting back into the endpiece when not in use?) The sound quality is quite good and gets very loud. You need to turn up the volume on your device to get the speaker to kick in, but once it's going you can turn the volume back down if you want to and it'll keep playing.Another nice thing about the PowerSource MusicStick - I'm always on the lookout for products that will make great gifts  products that are not only useful, but also come nicely packaged, and this fits the bill for that. Overall, the PowerSource MusicStick is both convenient and cost-effective  it's less expensive (and much more convenient) than buying a portable charger and an external speaker separately. (I've seen similar power banks alone, without the speaker function, sell for more than this product). It would be great for either personal use or as a gift for someone who'd enjoy the convenience of having a power bank and speaker in one small package.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CREXD9GRNSTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLY6ERM#wasThisHelpful","R1CREXD9GRNSTR","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This hammock works great to contain my son's stuffed toys. Stuffed animals take up a lot of space in the toy box, so it's really helpful to have an alternative storage solution for all of his squishy friends. I really appreciate that this toy hammock comes with three hooks and three wall anchors, so it's ready to hang up as soon as it arrives. Installation is really fast and easy  mark the three drill spots, drill the holes, tap in the anchors, screw in the hooks, and attach the hammock. The edges of the hammock are super stretchy elastic, which is a feature I haven't seen in a toy hammock before. (The other one we have has canvas edges with no stretch to them). The elastic edging is actually really convenient, as it makes the hammock more versatile in terms of how much stuff you can put in it. As you add toys, the elastic stretches to accommodate the influx.The package insert includes installation instructions on the back for how to position it to prevent it from sagging and from toys falling out of it. The instructions recommend that the side hooks be installed 3.8 feet from the corner (minimum listed in the product description is 31 inches). As it turns out, my son's bedroom doesn't have a single corner that has 3.8 feet of space available on both sides due to doors/windows/closet. Therefore the picture I'm adding to my review is what the hammock looks like if you only go out just over a couple of feet from the corner. It's still perfectly functional, just not as secure at holding toys as it would be if I were able to install it per the instructions. I could still add plenty more stuffed animals to it as-is, though. We're in the process of setting up a downstairs playroom, though, and we'll be moving the toy hammock to that room  and installing it per instructions - once it's ready.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJF0MQJFO1F7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8W1QM2#wasThisHelpful","RRJF0MQJFO1F7","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this two-pack of swaddling blankets - I'm expecting a baby boy in October, and we're setting up an ""ocean"" theme for the nursery, and these are a perfect addition! Besides the adorable patterns, these blankets are made of 100% muslin cotton, which I discovered with my toddler is the absolute best type of fabric for swaddling babies. This type of fabric feels ""delicate"" and is very lightweight and breathable, but also strong and durable  and can be machine washed and dried.I was also impressed with the packaging  you can't fully appreciate how high-quality the box that the blankets arrive in looks just from the product images. My first thought when I opened the package was that they'd make a great baby shower gift  the blankets are incredibly useful and adorable, but the packaging really sets it up to be a great gift. I actually plan to get another set to gift to my sister-in-law who's also expecting.The size of these blankets is great  at 47x47 inches (or just shy of four feet square), they're much larger than typical receiving blankets. The larger size makes it much easier to swaddle a baby (AND they have visual step-by-step swaddling instructions on the back of the box!) The combination of size and the lightweight material also makes them ideal to use as a nursing cover or car seat cover  or even as a light summertime blanket for an older child. My two year old is fascinated with the patterns on these blankets so he's currently using them  and this type of fabric gets softer the more it's washed, so they'll be extra-comfy by the time the baby gets here.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9NAJW2LHMUHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0102XMDAY#wasThisHelpful","R9NAJW2LHMUHY","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very handy little water resistant (not waterproof!) Bluetooth speaker. With four music-loving kids (including two teenage boys) I'm always looking for creative wireless speakers to use around the house, both indoors and out. We've actually been using this speaker as an outdoor speaker instead of in the shower, because of one of the kids forgets and leaves it on the porch, it's not going to be ruined if it gets a little bit of rain or morning dew on it. (It's also pretty sturdy if a kid drops it, which is nice).This speaker from Perfect Life Ideas comes with mini USB and 3.5mm audio cables; the ports are located under a water resistant plug on the bottom of the speaker. It works as both a Bluetooth speaker and as an FM radio (you toggle between the two using the ""Source"" button in the center, and the indicator light changes color to indicate what source is active  blue for Bluetooth and green for radio). You can also answer your phone (and end the call) with this speaker.The buttons are pretty self-explanatory. To advance or go back one track (or go one spot back or forth in radio mode), you short press the buttons on either side of the source button; a long press with increase or decrease the volume. The top button will pause and play your music when short pressed, a long press will either redial the last number you called when in Bluetooth mode, or scan through radio stations if you hold it down (approximately three seconds  short press it when you find a station you like).There are also three different ""where to put it"" options with this speaker  you can hang it using the hook on the top, you can stick it using the suction cup on the back, or you can just put it on a flat surface  there are little rubber treads on the bottom to help it not slide around. We hang ours from one of the planter hooks on the front porch, but the kids have also stuck it to a window and the suction cup works very well. The Bluetooth range is quite good, especially in an open space (with no walls to disrupt the signal). The battery life is also impressive, it can go all afternoon and into the evening without needing a recharge.There are a couple of small things I noticed that kept me from leaving a five star review (at least at the current price point) - the volume level doesn't go incredibly loud, which is fine for us since we live in a residential area and this actually prevents my kids from annoying the neighbors with their music too badly, but if you're looking for a super loud speaker, this isn't it. The sound quality is also okay, but not terrific. It would also be helpful if there were a little display to show what radio station you're on when in radio mode  as is, you sort of have to guess until you get to a station you're familiar with, so it can be tricky to find a specific station.I received this product free in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B03Z52FW8GQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5L0F1M#wasThisHelpful","R2B03Z52FW8GQ6","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:48 MinsThis is the third brand of diffuser I've purchased, and I have to say that I LOVE this one - it's definitely my favorite of the bunch. The design, the LED light band, the ""babbling brook"" sound, but especially just how well it works to diffuse the essential oils inside. (And really, isn't the ability to diffuse EOs the most important function of a diffuser?)The RiverRock diffuser is a bit larger than I envisioned it being - that's not a bad thing, just an observation. The larger size is actually good, because that means it holds more water than I'd expected and therefore will run for a longer period of time. It measures roughly 7x4.5x3 inches - although I've never seen an ostrich egg in person, that's the word that comes to mind in terms of size and shape.This diffuser comes with the diffuser itself, an instruction booklet, a power cord, and a small plastic measuring cup for adding the water. The measuring cup is a nice added touch, and one that I haven't seen included with other diffusers I've purchased. Operation is pretty self-explanatory, especially if you've used diffusers before. Lift the lid, add water, add a few drops of essential oils, replace lid, and turn it on. There's no power button with this diffuser; what you get is a sticker that says ""Press Down Firmly Here"" and that single spot controls all the functions. One push turns the RiverRock diffuser on with the LED light band cycling through the colors; a second push will stop the color cycling so it stays on one color; a third push turns off the LED light, and a fourth push turns the diffuser completely off. Once you're familiar with where to press, the instructional sticker easily peels right off.When in operation, this diffuser does an amazing job of diffusing essential oils. Its ""reach"" is a lot better than the other diffusers I own, with a stronger scent too. The cycling lights are very pretty - not too bright, but bright enough to clearly see the different colors as they cycle even with an overhead light on. And I adore the sound this diffuser makes, which is different than the typical diffuser sound. It really does sound just like water babbling over a stone-filled creek - a very quiet sound, but perfect for relaxing and falling asleep to. For that reason, this diffuser will be getting the ""place of honor"" on my bedside table. Being able to stop the LED light band on a particular color (like the soothing blue shade) or turn the lights off entirely also makes this an ideal bedtime diffuser.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RECMYMN2CQA88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9NR672#wasThisHelpful","RECMYMN2CQA88","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are few sounds more annoying than that of a single fly buzzing around an otherwise quiet room. Or the whine of a mosquito nearby as you're trying to go to sleep. I hate using a fly swatter because of the gross mess it leaves on whatever surface you swatted the bug against, and I'm pregnant so using any sort of chemically based bug killer is out.Now, I'm normally a pretty non-violent person, but I have to admit that I do get a sense of satisfaction about zapping a bug that's been stalking me. It makes a very loud ""zapping"" sound when it makes contact with a bug (just like if you have one of those hanging light style of bug zapper). The Electrocutioner is about the size and shape of a toddler-sized tennis racket, but definitely NOT for toddlers to play with. It takes two AA batteries (not included) that fit into the handle. The battery cover is the sliding type and doesn't require a screwdriver to open (another good reason to keep it away from kids, in case you needed another reason beyond ""it'll zap you if you aren't careful""). I have NOT tested out the effects of the swatter personally (by touching the metal grid while it's activated), but from what other reviewers have posted (and from its effect on the bugs I've zapped with it), it packs quite a punch. I recommend that you keep this product stored in a safe place, where small children (or teenagers, for that matter) can't access it. I actually store it with the batteries out for safety reasons; it only takes a few seconds to pop them back into the handle.In addition to indoor bugs, I've also found this very effective for outdoor use  I like to sit on my front porch with a cup of coffee in the mornings, but the horseflies like to try to hang out with me. One well-timed swing and I'm back to enjoying my coffee in peace. And I have two teenage sons who are now fighting over the rights to be Head Electricutioner (and who are under STRICT orders not to use it on each other).The one downside is that it's not effective for creepy crawly bugs  anything on a flat surface (like the spider that decided to skitter down the wall behind my desk as I was writing this review) is pretty much safe from the Electricutioner. I think it'd be possible to sort of rest the metal grid against a crawling bug if it were large enough (taller than the frame of the Electricutioner), but awkward to do. But, bonus: Since you have to hit your target in midair (as opposed to squishing it against a flat surface), it helps improve your hand-eye coordination!I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O2WLNCX65UON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RQS7D68#wasThisHelpful","R3O2WLNCX65UON","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love this skirt  I ordered the Native Tribal Bush patterned skirt in a size medium and couldn't be happier with my purchase.The material is lightweight, super soft, and quite stretchy, with a smooth and silky sort of texture.

"These are very comfortable pajamas and the sizing is pretty spot on. I'm 5'10 and usually wear a large (14 or 16), but I'm currently six months pregnant and have been going with an XL in maternity clothes  I ordered these in an XL and they fit great. The material is stretchy enough that the bottoms fit over my pregnant stomach, and they'll probably fit for at least another month. (After that they're going in my hospital bag, because these are definitely going to be great for post-partum and breastfeeding wear as well).The top is perfectly designed to allow for discreet yet convenient nursing. The material is both soft and super stretchy. The ""main"" layer of the shirt has a low scoop neck (it just covers the top of my bra), with a second ruched layer over that. The top layer has a ""twist"" design that allows you to lift one side without exposing the other side. The bottom layer pulls down for easy nursing access. For moms who've nursed before, it works along the same lines as the ""tank top under the t-shirt"" method, but all in just one lightweight shirt so you don't swelter in the summertime. As a bonus, the shirt is cute enough that I would (and plan to) wear it as a regular nursing top, not just as a pajama top. The bottoms are made of the same soft, stretchy material. On me they hit just above the knee  partly because I'm taller, and partly because I have them pulled up over six months worth of growing baby.These were definitely a great purchase (I'm actually wearing them as I write this review, and plan to get a LOT of use out of them), and I'd recommend them to any pregnant or nursing mom.

"This is an ""alternative use"" review of these great little reusable pads. I'm currently six months pregnant with my fifth child, and without going too far into TMI territory, sometimes coughing or sneezing can be dangerous. (Or having a toddler climb in my lap, or standing up too quickly, or you get the idea). Before switching to these, I was using regular disposable pads, and I even tried using those disposable menstrual underwear, but honestly, they made me feel like I was wearing a diaper (which I basically was). Nothing like amping up the discomfort and ""unsexy"" feelings of being pregnant like wearing the equivalent of a diaper!These cloth pads are both discrete and comfortable, and work perfectly to handle occasional light bladder issues. (I should mention, however, that these probably wouldn't be effective for anything beyond ""light"" issues  they work great for a trickle when you cough, which is all I need, but I don't think they'd hold up to a full deluge). I especially love how comfortable they are against sensitive bits  the lining is super soft, MUCH more comfortable than disposables. (For that matter, they're more comfortable than underwear lining too). And the charcoal layer is effective at containing odors. They're discrete with their cute geometric pattern on the outer layer, and they stay in place just fine when I use the snaps to secure them. (And the snaps work both ways, so they also keep them folded nicely both before and after using them).Convenience-wise, they're a tiny bit less convenient than disposables, but with more than enough benefits to make up for it. You'll want a ""wet bag"" of some sort to keep them in after you rinse them until you get a chance to wash them, but they're more comfortable, they're better for the environment than disposables, and they'll be a money-saver over the long run as opposed to buying expensive disposables every month. After reading the positive reviews of more typical usage, I'll definitely be using these after my baby is born too.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25X0NP75WG5PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJNPOH6#wasThisHelpful","R25X0NP75WG5PY","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:07 MinsWhen we were little, my mom always used to sing the ""You Are My Sunshine"" song to me and my sisters, and I've carried on that tradition with my own kids. This necklace is absolutely adorable and will make an ideal gift.The larger charm is hammered silvertone metal stamped with ""You are my Sunshine my only Sunshine."" The disc is a circle roughly the same circumference as a nickel but about half the thickness. If it flips around (and what necklace charm doesn't?), the back of the charm has grooved lines that catch the light radiating from the center. The smaller charm (which was the selling point for me, because it's absolutely adorable) is smaller, with a sunshine cutout stamped with the image of a smiling sun, which goes over the larger charm.The chain the charms come on is a delicate 18 inch chain with a lobster clasp. It's adjustable down to 16 inches, with two extra clasping rings built into the chain down its length. Both the length and the delicate style are perfect for a young girl, but it *is* long enough that an adult could wear it also.My only suggestion? (And this is just an idea for the sellers, not a criticism of the item I received) - I've seen this necklace available with both charms in goldtone; I'd love to see an option with the larger charm (the one with the words) in silver but the sunshine charm in gold.

"You don't really realize that there's a difference between ""bad"" tweezers and ""good"" tweezers until you've experienced both. (Spoiler alert: these are good tweezers!) The bad ones don't grip the hair properly and aren't tight enough to yank a hair out in one tug. Sometimes they're also quite awkward to get a good grip on in the first place, before you even start trying to get your eyebrows (or whatever) into decent shape.These tweezers from Malva Belle have none of those problems  they're well designed and do their job with finesse. You only need slight pressure to bring the tips together tightly, so you can use them even if you have minor mobility problems with your hands or fingers. (I have some minor nerve damage in my fingers and have no problems manipulating these tweezers, unlike others I've tried). The tips are slanted so you can get a good grip without pinching the skin around the hair (or splinter, or whatever it is you're trying to yank out).

"I love my Keurig, but I don't love the expense or wastefulness of standard disposable K-Cups. These reusable K-Cups are the perfect solution, and have several other benefits as well. You can make a stronger or weaker cup of coffee by varying the amount of grounds you put in the cup. You can fill them with whatever brand of coffee you like - my favorite coffee, a local store's brand, isn't even available in K-Cups  problem solved! You can mix flavors for custom blends, or even adjust the caffeine level by combining regular coffee with some decaf. And the only thing you have to throw away is the grounds, which are compostable, so you're not filling up your trash can (and the landfills) with a bunch of K-Cups.Functionality-wise, these work perfectly. They're made of solid plastic with micro-mesh cutouts around the sides. The lid closes securely, and the mesh is tight enough that even espresso ground coffee won't spill out. And I love that they're purple (my favorite color) and the mesh cutouts are dolphin shaped. They're also easy to clean  just tap the grounds out and give 'em a rinse and they're ready to use again. (They're also dishwasher safe).

"I have an absolutely tiny downstairs bathroom with no storage space  no medicine cabinet, no counter space next to the sink, nothing. I've been keeping my ""girl stuff"" (makeup and the like) in a box under the sink  inconvenient, but good enough temporarily. This organizer, however, is a much better solution!This organizer is the perfect size to store all the little odds and ends that tend to clutter up the countertop (assuming you have a countertop to clutter up, that is). The three drawers are each large enough to hold several items (multiple tubes of lipstick; assorted powder cosmetics; a variety of jewelry), but the organizer as a whole is small enough to fit into a small space (like the top of your toilet, which is pretty much the only flat surface I have in my bathroom).The drawers also come all the way out, which is convenient for retrieving and using those smaller items stored inside. They're lined with removable cushy black mesh padding that serves a dual purpose  it protects your possessions (and the drawer itself) from getting scratched up, and it also keeps those items from sliding around within the drawer. Also included is a little pink microfiber cloth (like the kind you use to clean eyeglasses or electronics) so you can keep the organizer free of smudges and fingerprints.I received this product in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R360FHK4A8Y6NL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VV22G8K#wasThisHelpful","R360FHK4A8Y6NL","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carbon monoxide is kind of terrifying  odorless, invisible, and deadly. My husband and I and our four (soon to be five) children recently have a 100+ year old house (radiator heated by a gas-powered steam boiler).  We already had an older (but still functional) carbon monoxide detector that we installed right after buying the house, before we even moved in, but we knew our large two-story house needed more than one. And this carbon monoxide detector from X-Sense is great!This carbon monoxide detector comes with everything you need to get it set up right out of the box  not only does it come with the hardware you need to mount it on the wall (two screws and anchors), it also comes with the two required AA batteries. And the battery installation is as easy as it gets, no screwdriver required  the battery cover just slides over, and it's on the front so you don't even have to take the detector off the wall when it's time to change the batteries. So instead of setting it aside until you have a chance to find batteries for it, or while you're looking for a screwdriver to open the battery compartment, you can take it out of the box and put it to work in under a minute. Additionally, if you don't want to (or aren't allowed to) drill holes in your walls to wall-mount it, there's a built-in stand that flips out on the back, so you have the alternative of setting it on a flat surface (great if you're renting and can't put holes in the walls).There are three indicator lights top and center of the detector  power, alarm, and fault  with an LCD display underneath. When all is well, the green power light flashes about every 30 seconds to let you know it's working and the display screen is blank. One of my favorite features of this particular detector is that it measures both the specific levels of carbon monoxide as well as the length of time that level has been present. If there are dangerous carbon monoxide levels, in addition to an audible alarm, the red alarm light would blink every ten seconds and the screen would display the level of carbon monoxide detected (from 30 to 999 ppm). The response time of the alarm varies based on the amount of carbon monoxide detected. The minimum level is 30 ppm of carbon monoxide for 120 minutes, but it only takes 3 minutes if it detects 300 ppm of carbon monoxide. It also automatically resets when the danger has passed. Another great feature is the built-in memory. The test/hush button on the front of the detector also has a ""peak level"" indicator, which when pressed will tell you the highest carbon monoxide concentration since the last time you reset it (cleared the memory). It was a little scary for me to see that it's detected 20 ppm of carbon monoxide at some point since we set it up! That's a terrific feature to alert you to potential problems ahead of time, before they become critical.I definitely plan on purchasing at least a couple more of these detectors, both to replace our old detector and to add additional layers of safety to our home. At minimum you want one CO detector on each level of your house (including at the top of the basement stairs), but for extra safety you can add detectors in each bedroom and in the basement itself (but at least 20 feet away from any fuel burning heat source).I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KZ2FEWAULZ6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLVWAXC#wasThisHelpful","R3KZ2FEWAULZ6L","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great set of six of the most frequently used essential oils. The selection is perfect to restock your own supplies (or to keep a second set of oils in another room), or it would make a great gift set for someone who's just starting out using essential oils. The packaging also makes this gift-giving quality (although the box containing the bottles is so well sealed and tightly fitting that it was a little difficult to get it open the first time).The bottles that the oils come in are great  they're dark glass (ideal for essential oils) with plastic screw-top lids that are safety sealed. The built-in stopper inside the bottles lets you easily dispense the oils a drop at a time (and no having to fiddle with an eyedropper style cap). I'm not an expert on essential oils, but the oils themselves seem to be high quality and emit great scents when used in a diffuser. I personally use the Calily diffuser, the one with the color changing LED lights and multi-function remote, and these oils work wonderfully in it.I use oils semi-frequently (diffusing lavender oil is a WONDERFUL way to help to calm my autistic son), but since the set is described as a ""starter set,"" the addition of a basic list of the benefits/primary uses of each oil would be a great addition to this set.

"This is a convenient, easy-to-use essential oil diffuser. It comes with the diffuser itself, a multi-function remote that works from across the room (batteries included!), the power cord, a cleaning brush, and instructions.This diffuser is really easy to use, even if you've never used a diffuser before. The cover lifts straight up from the base, revealing the water/oil reservoir beneath. After connecting the power cord, you just pour 100ml of tap water into the reservoir, add in 2 or 3 drops of essential oil, replace the top cover, and plug it in.The remote offers you a lot of choices in how you prefer to use this diffuser; it's not just a straight on/off remote. You can set how long you'd like the diffuser to run for (dependent upon how much water you have in the reservoir)  the settings allow for 1, 2, or 3 hours continuously, or you can set it to diffuse intermittently (15 seconds on and 15 seconds off) for 2, 4, or 6 hours. (The instructions do state that you should avoid using it for more than 3 hours at a time, and to allow it time to cool down between sessions).You can also use the remote to set the diffuser to cycle through four colors (blue, green, purple, and red) or pick your favorite color and set it to stay on that one. The brightness is adjustable as well. Or, if you prefer, you can turn the light off entirely.As far as operation, this is an ultrasonic essential oil diffuser. There are different types of diffusers you can get, but the benefits to an ultrasonic diffuser like this one are that they're quieter than a nebulizing diffuser (I can barely hear this one running at all, just a low ""white noise"" sort of hum) and they don't run through your oils as quickly. Additionally, they can double as a humidifier.Safety features: This diffuser uses cool mist, and states that it's cool to the touch. That's been my experience  I haven't let it run for long periods of time yet (I have a houseful of kids and pets, so I turn it off when I'm not right near it), but after half an hour of continuous misting it was still cool, not even warm, when I touched it. It's also designed to automatically shut off if it does happen to overheat, and when the water level drops too low.The only difficulty I ran into with this diffuser was trying to figure out where the ""max fill line"" was located  if you put too much water in the reservoir, the diffuser won't mist properly, and I put too much water in the first time I tried using it. When I didn't see any mist, I dumped the water into a measuring cup and realized that I'd gone well over the listed 100ml. Once I lowered the water level, it started misting as soon as I turned it on. I'm not certain, but it appears that the little orange cap inside the reservoir is the maximum fill line  that's where the water level was at when I adjusted the amount to just shy of 100ml, at least. So I would recommend measuring the amount of water you add the first time, just so you're familiar with where that level is inside the diffuser.Overall, I found this diffuser to be simple to set up and use and very quiet in operation. The LED light features take this from being an effective diffuser to being an aesthetically pleasing one as well.

"When I first heard about ultrasonic pest repellers, I was dubious, but I figured it couldn't hurt. My husband and I bought a big old drafty house that's like Grand Central Station for spiders and carpenter ants. (Mice also used to congregate here, but our two cats took care of that problem). We started using a Hoont pest repeller a couple of months ago and were incredibly pleased with the results (no more ants in the bathroom!), so when I got the opportunity to test this model out, it wasn't even a question.Twice in the week before receiving this pest repeller, I was accosted by very large, very scary looking spiders in our downstairs bathroom. (And watching a spider creep towards you while you're helplessly indisposed in a compromising position is one of the worst feelings ever). And while spiders freak me out, I also don't like killing them. I'd attempted to negotiate with them previously  they stay out of sight and eat any other bugs that got into the house and I'd leave them alone. Their visible presence in the bathroom obviously proves their violation of that agreement, though. Since I'm pregnant and our family consists of four kids (including a toddler who touches EVERYTHING), two cats, and a dog, we didn't really want to use poisons to combat the spider problem. We tried using peppermint oil (which can be dangerous for cats, but we kept them out of the room we sprayed it in) to repel the bathroom spiders, with minimal to no success.And then I plugged this pest repeller into the wall. And even though the instruction sheet says you might see an increase in pests for a couple of weeks as they're flushed out of the walls, I haven't seen a single spider (or anything else) since putting this product to use. We keep the bathroom door closed so our toddler doesn't play in the toilet/the dog doesn't drink out of the toilet, and the instructions also say that the sound waves can't penetrate solid walls, so this might just be a coincidence but I also haven't seen a single pest in the kitchen that's next to the bathroom since installing the pest repeller, and spiders liked to hang out there sometimes too. And the pest repeller doesn't bother our cats or our dog (or our kids, for that matter) at all.You can get this information in the product listing, so I'll just do a quick overview: there are three different pest control technologies built into this product. There's the ultrasonic pest control (high pressure sound that irritates insects and rodents); the ionic pest control (negative ions to clear the air of pollutants and odors); and electromagnetic pest control (digitally-processed magnetic vibrations that travel through the wiring in your walls to create a hostile environment for any unwanted residents). You can cycle between these three technologies to choose just one or to have all three of them active (which is what I went with). There's also a built-in blue LED night light that's bright enough to make your way around an otherwise dark room, but not so bright that it hurts your eyes if you get up in the middle of the night and use that for your sole source of illumination.The important part of all this is that its worked for us to keep all the creepy crawlies away!

"Before you even read this review, you need to know that Stephen King is my favorite author  I've never met a Stephen King novel that I haven't liked (although I haven't LOVED them all, and I've been lukewarm on a short story or two). So while this book isn't flawless, I still very much enjoyed it and would recommend it. (But oh, how I wish I could be a beta reader for King and help catch those little errors before the books go to print!)This novel, like Mr. Mercedes, falls outside of King's ""regular"" genre of horror. There's only the slightest hint of the paranormal in this novel (although I expect that will be expanded upon in the final novel of the trilogy). I wouldn't exactly call it a mystery, because while there are mysteries for the characters, the reader already pretty much knows the answers. Suspense, crime fiction, detective fiction, or even thriller would be a more appropriate classification - definitely not horror, in my opinion, even though there are some horrific elements. That being said, there are ""tones of King"" in this novel  the very plot itself revisits past King themes (the lengths book addicts will go to in order to get their next fix in particular).I think you might have to be one of those people who's more than a casual reader to fully appreciate the motivations and actions of both Morris Bellamy and Pete Saubers. Avid readers might even find themselves having the slightest twinge of sympathy  just a teensy bit  for Bellamy and his motivations. Bellamy was obviously already unstable before his imprisonment, but I think waiting almost four DECADES for a particular book would drive any passionate reader insane. When you're emotionally invested in a character or book series, the wait for the next book can be agonizing, especially if the wait is particularly long (fans of The Dark Tower or Wheel of Time feel my pain here, I think). Six years between Dark Tower books was torture, and the books weren't even written yet (that I know of). To know that there's another novel (or two) in a beloved series, just sitting there and waiting for you to come dig it up, a story that no one other than the other has ever read before to wait thirty-six years to be able to actually read it? To know that there still might be hope for a character that  you believed the author had ""destroyed,"" a chance for that character to redeem himself in your eyes? And then to finally be able to retrieve those writings, only to find them gone? If Morris hadn't already been crazy, that right there would've tipped him over the edge.When I read Mr. Mercedes, I was unaware that Bill Hodges was going to be the star of a trilogy. Mr. Mercedes concluded satisfactorily as far as I'm concerned; I didn't feel like there were unresolved plot points when I reached the end of the book. Finders Keepers, however, definitely has some loose ends to be tied up in the next (and final maybe) novel, The Suicide Prince. Don't keep me waiting, Mr. King! Because we all know what happens when you keep your fans waiting","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B8DJH6GYMG3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501100076#wasThisHelpful","R3B8DJH6GYMG3W","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years ago, I was introduced to the concept of adult coloring books as a stress reliever/meditation aid, and I've been hooked ever since. However, this is the first coloring book I've had where the colors are basically reversed  these are black pages with white designs to color in, as opposed to the usual white pages.The mandalas are very intricately designed and have varying levels of difficulty (with difficulty level determined by how many teeny tiny spaces there are to color in). Because the page is black instead of white, if you do happen to accidentally color outside of the lines, though, it's less noticeable. And the black background has the added benefit of making the colors you use really stand out  I particularly liked coloring the pages with bright jewel tones, and the results are pretty enough to frame.So whether you're looking for a relaxation activity for yourself or perhaps a gift for a loved one, these beautiful patterns will provide hours of coloring enjoyment.I received an e-copy of this book in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LRLVR2TDM5F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1512228141#wasThisHelpful","R2LRLVR2TDM5F0","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are incredibly handy little deodorizing bags, especially if you're a mom of boys. My husband and our two teenage sons keep their shoes in a wooden drawer under our stairs, and the ""boy smell"" was sometimes overwhelming whenever the drawer was opened. I put two of the bags in the drawer with their shoes, and the odor is gone. And additionally, that drawer has a naturally ""musty"" odor to it (we live in a 100+ year old house, so all the small places are musty smelling), and that odor has dissipated as well. As we also have younger children, including a curious toddler, I love that these bags are chemical-free and safe if our little guy gets his hands on them. Since this package has four regular bags plus two smaller bonus bags, I can put more bags in those other musty areas, like the kitchen cupboards or my own shoe storage area.

"I'm used to using plain, wired earbuds without any extra features, so these wireless earbuds are a huge step up for me. (For comparison's sake I asked my husband, who uses wireless earbuds regularly, to test these out too, and he liked them so well that I think he's keeping them).Instead of one-size-fits-all (and hope they don't fall out), these earbuds come with everything you need for a custom fit: four sets of ear tips and 3 sets of ear stabilizers in varying sizes and cord management clips so you can custom-fit the amount of slack in the cord, plus a carrying pouch and a micro USB charging cable.Now, I've gotta say, I've never used earbuds with ""ear stabilizers"" before, and it took me a couple (okay, several) minutes to figure out how they worked. Normally I just stick the buds in my ears and hope that they stay put. Between the instruction booklet and a mirror, though, I sorted it out, and I'm happy to report that these earbuds stay securely in place even if I shake my head around a bit. (Apparently I have tiny little ears, though, or maybe just oddly shaped ears, because even the smallest stabilizer was a little tricky to fit on my right ear).The earbuds have a feature that I haven't seen before  a magnetic clasp within the earbuds themselves. When you're not wearing them in your ears, you can put the earbuds back-to-back and the magnets hold them together so they stay securely around your neck, like an earbud necklace. But even with the magnetic clasps built into the earpieces, these earbuds are very light and don't feel like they're so heavy they're going to fall out.Pairing was simple and fast  you just hold down the center button for 8 seconds, but by the time the earbuds said ""pairing,"" my phone had already found them. The controls for power, volume, etc. are in a little remote built into the cord near the right earbud, so you don't have to touch the earbuds themselves (or your phone) to change the volume, skip to the next music track, or answer/end a phone call.The sound quality goes from ""meh"" to quite good once you get the buds properly adjusted in your ears. When I first tried out these earbuds, the music seemed tinny and the balance seemed off between the two sides. But after I fiddled around with the different sizes of tips and stabilizers and got the earbuds properly situated (which took me probably ten minutes of trying out different combinations), I was really pleased with the sound quality  it was comparable to the quality of my good set of wired earbuds. These aren't bass-boosting earbuds, but I personally don't want my earbuds to assault my ears with heavy bass anyway  I save that for when the speakers aren't millimeters from my eardrums.As far as Bluetooth connectivity goes, the listed effective distance is 33 feet, and while I was able to get that far away from my phone before the earbuds actually unpaired, the sound started cutting out after approximately 12 feet (with my phone sitting out in the open on my desk with no walls between me and it).  That's just as good or better than other wireless earbuds that my husband has, though. (He says ten feet is pretty typical).And obviously the water resistant/sweatproof feature is a huge bonus  I bought these primarily to use them for activities like yoga, bike rides, and kayaking, where they're going to get sweaty and possibly get a little water splashed on them. They hold up well to physical activity, both in terms of water and sweat resistance and in staying put and not slipping out of your ears.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJO9E8099399E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3ZK9YG#wasThisHelpful","RJO9E8099399E","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son recently turned two and is just about to transition to a toddler bed, and with a big boy bed comes a big boy pillow. This one attracted my attention because of the high thread count and the fact that it's machine washable. The size is just right for a toddler-sized head, and this pillow achieves the perfect balance between softness and firmness  soft and squishy enough to be comfy, but firm enough that it's supportive. I do plan on putting a pillow case on it even though it's not necessary just so I don't have to wash the pillow itself as often (and also because it's white and therefore bound to get stained sooner rather than later if it's not covered with something). Although he's not yet using it to put his head on when he sleeps (he cuddles up to it instead), my son likes to carry his pillow around with him and ""squish"" it like it's a stuffed animal and has also been using it to sit on (another great reason to get a pillowcase for it).I received this product in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9WDGZ6BQO86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJRBUEY#wasThisHelpful","R1Z9WDGZ6BQO86","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I switched over from waxing to tweezing around the time my fourth child was born  the time and money saved makes it worth a little extra hassle. I've used the cheap silver tweezers that you can pick up at the grocery store, and they sort of work if you don't mind tugging on the same hair a few times to get it out, or leaving some shorter or finer hairs behind because you just can't get a good enough grip on them. This is one of those cases of ""you get what you pay for."" With these tweezers, the slanted tips make it easier to grip shorter hairs, and there's just the slightest bit of texture added to the inside of the tips so that they don't lose their grip on even fine hairs. I'm currently pregnant, so I have random little stray hairs showing up in a wide radius around my actual eyebrows, so I've been able to really thoroughly test these tweezers out, with great results.

" 0:31 MinsThese are a set of four super cute iridescent dinosaurs that are infused with catnip for your cat's amusement. We have two cats, both of whom are older but who still love a good dose of catnip (I think it reminds them of their reckless youths). This set comes with two each of the pink and the iridescent green dinosaurs, so there's enough fun for more than one if you're a multi-cat household. That's also handy for when one gets batted deep underneath the couch and you don't feel like retrieving it right away - you can just toss over one of the other three and save the heavy furniture moving for later.The toys are also nice and light, so they're easy to play with for both older cats who might have mobility issues, or for younger kittens who are too small to be able to move around larger toys. The catnip scent isn't overwhelming like it is with some cat toys (or with straight catnip), but it's present enough that the toys got the attention of both cats, who sniffed and pawed and nibbled at the dinosaurs when I presented them. My cats are not, however, cooperative about playing with toys and being cute in front of people (they're like my toddler that way), so they're acting fairly nonchalant in the video.

"This is a great DVD set for little ones. I have a son who's almost two, and the first time I put in the alphabet DVD, he stopped what he was doing to watch  and read the letters back as they were said. (And then looked over at me each time to make sure I was noticing how clever he was being  and trust me, I was!) He didn't, and doesn't, stare at the screen with these videos, which is good, but he'll go back and forth between playing and checking out what's happening, and frequently repeats the letter/number/shape/color the narrator recites.The music and animation are both slow-paced and repetitive  as an experienced mom (nearly 20 years of parenting and preschool entertainment), I'm mostly immune to the monotony. Repetition is a great way for little ones to learn, and having the animation set to music helps with retention. My little guy is definitely picking up on the content, and is getting practice at both learning the concepts and speech as he repeats the information on-screen.I received this product in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWL5LVBJLYXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094J4CD4#wasThisHelpful","R3VWL5LVBJLYXN","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like the design of these headbands and the various colors they're available in. I chose to try out the black headband first, since black goes with everything (right?) The braided style is really cute, and the backing doesn't stick to my hair to the point that it tugs when I put the headband on. It was a little small for me when I first got it (I think I have an average sized head, but maybe it's a little larger than average - I'm tall for a girl), but I stretched it out around the flap of a box (nearest thing I had handy) and left it there for a couple of days. Now it definitely still has plenty of stretch to it (meaning it's not likely to wear out anytime soon), but it's also a little bit looser so it's more comfortable for me to wear. It also stays put really well even though other circular-style headbands tend to slip up the back of my head.This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZILDJSDJQ4SJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OI67ZV4#wasThisHelpful","RZILDJSDJQ4SJ","A29NNYBMVN3DDB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29NNYBMVN3DDB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really cute necklace, and my son (who's working on his last four teeth) loves chewing on it. It took me a while to decide which color to pick - I love the bright purple! - but I wound up going with black so it would match with everything. I can wear it whenever we leave the house and if my son gets fussy, I have the necklace available for him to play with and chew on no matter where we are. (Much more convenient than digging through my purse hoping that I remembered to toss a teething toy in there before we left!) And it's designed so that it isn't *obviously* a teething necklace - it looks similar in style to a lot of the statement necklaces that are so popular right now.The beads have a fun slightly ""squishy"" feel to them, so I can understand why they're so much fun (and comfort) for a baby to chew on.

"Habanero peppers are one of my favorite foods  it used to be jalapenos, but once I discovered the spicy-sweet flavor of habaneros, there was no going back. I live up north (aka the land of ""we don't like flavor""), so it can be challenging to find habanero products in stores around here - so I'm very grateful that this habanero salsa is available (and I don't even have to get out of my pajamas to get it!)This salsa has a heat index listing of 9 out of 10  in other words, have the milk close at hand for this one! I think I'm pretty tough when it comes to spicy food, but this one had me reaching for the milk after the third or fourth bite. Not that I'm complaining, mind you! If you like heat in your food, you're going to LOVE this salsa! This is a thicker, chunky style of salsa (just the way I like it), and I love the inclusion of corn, which I haven't seen in the salsas I've purchased off the shelf at the grocery store. The corn adds a great touch of sweetness to the fiery flavor of the peppers, it's SO good!This salsa is great with tortilla chips, but you know what I liked even better? Using it as a cheeseburger topping! ). The heat is less extreme when you eat the salsa this way, so it's a great way to give a burger a kick without overheating more sensitive palates.

We have tons of gadgets in our house - smartphones, tablets, an iPad, portable chargers, earpieces, etc. - that all need a USB cord to charge.

"These flameless candles are a terrific alternative to regular candles. I have four sons, including a toddler, so for safety's sake I can't always light a candle when and where I want to. (Mostly my candles have just been sitting around gathering dust since my youngest got mobile). There are all sorts of things I love about these candles. I can put them pretty much anywhere without risking one of the kids trying to burn the house down - I can even put them on my bookcase or on a windowsill without having to pull the curtains way back. They have a light vanilla scent and they're actually made of wax, so they feel like real candles too. And there's a remote that I can use for all sorts of things - changing the mode, changing the color, setting a timer - really quite ingenious, I've never had remote-controlled candles before! I can set them on the fireplace mantle and then make changes from the couch!You will need quite a few batteries (not included) to get them set up (again, with four kids, I already keep a stash of batteries on hand at all times so I was good to go). Each candle takes three AAA batteries, and the remote needs a CR2025 battery (the larger round button cell battery).

It's incredibly comfortable and very versatile - it's casual enough that I can wear it with a pair of strappy sandals for a casual dinner date with my husband, but I can also dress it up with a fancier hairstyle and heels. I'm also very impressed with the way it fits - I'm a taller girl (5'10) with a larger bust, so I wasn't sure that a size large would fit me, but I'm happy to say that the fit is great! The back of the dress is a shirred elastic that allows for some ""give"" if you're a little larger up top. The dress is shorter on me than in the product images (obviously), but the style is such that it looks great even with a shorter hem. (The dress comes to about mid-calf on me, with the bottom ribbon above the ruffle hitting just below my knees).

"I really like this showerhead  the lights are pretty, the 10"" rainfall design is luxurious, and the included extension arm is wonderful. (Both my husband and I are tall  my husband is 6'8 - so that extension arm is a must-have!) The person who designed my bathroom was an idiot, so even though the bathroom has a window and a ceiling light, the inside of the shower stall is dimly lit even on a bright day with the bathroom light on. The upside is that the LED lights on the showerhead are more effective than they'd be in a brightly lit bathroom (gotta find that silver lining somewhere!) The picture attached was taken at night, but with the bathroom light on. If you have a nice brightly lit bathroom, the LED lights aren't going to be as obvious. (I also took out the water flow regulator before installing the showerhead, since I live in an old house with questionable water pressure, and maybe the faster water flow makes the lights brighter? That I'm not sure about).I found the showerhead to be very quick and easy to install, less than a 10 minute job from start to finish. Other reviewers mentioned the showerhead being noisy, but I don't notice any noise at all when this shower is running, other than the typical ""water is running"" noise. Maybe those people got a bad showerhead; maybe I'm just immune to noises that are quieter than a dull roar (I DO have four sons, so ""quiet"" is rare for my house). I also didn't experience any leaking issues as others have mentioned, not even when it was first installed. But I do have a fair bit of experience with plumbing-related activities (I've swapped out showerheads before plus have done plenty of plumbing-type repairs, between the four kids and an old house).

"Two Kids covers a year in the lives of Rob and D.C., two twelve-year-olds who meet at a summertime birthday party. As a former extra-tall 12-year-old girl myself, I related to the main female character, D.C. (although I was all gawky, with none of D.C.'s athleticism or confidence). D.C. also experiences a tragedy in her life midway through the story that my family also experienced, and it's the details like these that drew me into the story.This book reminds me a fair bit of one of my favorite children's books, Bridge to Terabithia  Rob and D.C. have vivid imaginations and create their own fantastic stories and make-believe games, yet there's also real-world personal tragedies that the kids must deal with. But the friendship between the two kids is strong, and this story shows how those friendships formed during that awkward heading-into-puberty time can turn into strong lifelong bonds.The story was a lot longer than I expected it to be  I don't really look at page numbers with ebooks, I read enough that I usually know about how long a book will take me (depending on the target audience  adult, YA, middle grade, etc.). I expected this one to be about half the actual length given the target audience. That's neither a negative nor a positive, though. However, I do feel that a more imaginative title would have improved the book as a whole  I think the simplistic title also led me to believe that this would be a shorter, simpler book (with less tragedy and more of the fun parts of a coming-of-age story).

"I work from home and spend a LOT of time sitting in front of the computer.

"My dog is a miniature schnauzer, who is sort of between a medium (she had that when she was spayed at 6 months old), and the large (which she is wearing now after a toe amputation).  The medium fits her neck, but is too short to keep her away from the toe (bandages).  The larger one is a bit big, but keeps her away from the toe.  Both have loops on the inside to put a regular collar in to adjust the fit- which is what made the large one fit.  Without the inner collar (which needs to be purchased separately, or use the normal collar on the dog), she could get the large one over her ears, and off.Easy to blow up once you figure out how to squeeze the inside portion of the ""blow up thingie"".Both times I've purchased these, I've been pleased- and my fur baby has had something more comfortable to wear while recovering.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BACA2MG7LVRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00943X3Z8#wasThisHelpful","R1BACA2MG7LVRL","A2C9XE9I8RSKNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2C9XE9I8RSKNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reason for purchase:  GERD, chronic gastritis, (also esophageal spasms, but not purchased for that)Prescription meds used:  Protonix (pantoprazole- most effective, yet still have symptoms), Prilosec (omeprazole- effectiveness 'wore off'), and Dexliant (brand only- got samples; not much help at all), Zantac (ranitidine- made things worse).Other OTC meds used -  Gas-X (simethicone)- helps, but doesn't address the gastritis; Tums- helps, but again, more of a 'bandaid' than solution, papaya enzyme (to help with protein digestion)Effectiveness of Gaviscon Extra Strength tablets- very good.  I could feel the relief within minutes.Taste:  A sort of creamy vanilla- it's not unpleasant.

"I got this set through a different seller, but absolutely LOVE it.  It's a lightweight, so much easier to maneuver with klutzy arthritic hands, and less than stellar arm muscles.  They clean up very easily with some warm water, dish soap, and a paper towel.  Scrambled eggs slide out, grilled cheese get a nice even browning, and anything else I've cooked washes out nicely.  The handles stay cool with the silicone between the end of the handle and the pan itself.  I've gone through some medical issues (most notably chemo, that left me with neuropathy), and haven't cooked much because my old set of hard anodized aluminum pans were just too heavy.  I'm now cooking more, so getting more 'whole' and simple foods.  This was a great buy- not a cheap purchase (I got mine on a payment plan elsewhere), but worth it if I can actually use it and make healthier meals.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UZ6Z7WDP3KPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0093AO6SK#wasThisHelpful","R3UZ6Z7WDP3KPX","A2C9XE9I8RSKNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2C9XE9I8RSKNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I LOVE these pans (I got a set of 2 through a different seller ).  They are lightweight enough for me to lift (a  huge issue), but get the job done with searing meat, scrambling eggs, burgers, homestyle potatoes, etc.  They work like cast iron at a MUCH lighter weight.  The handle stays cool, and it's very easy to clean up- just  a bit of dish soap after the pan cools off, and a gentle sponge or dishrag.  No sticking.

"Great value on non-GMO canola oil.  Even the shipping was acceptable (flat rate box- I ordered 2 1/2 gallons and they fit in one box).  Organic (the reason I get it is for GMO free canola) is much more expensive per ounce in smaller bottles, without shipping.  This is cold expeller pressed, and contains only canola oil.  I will gladly get Italian oil for the non-GMO aspect of it.  It might seem like the shipping is expensive, but it's a lot cheaper than a plane ticket, and the actual half-gallon (64 oz) is pretty cheap per ounce.

"I have used these lancets for years, and while I can get individual lancets free from my Medicare diabetes supply provider, I pay for these out of pocket because they are that much better.  I use each lancet 2-3 times (they stay sharp enough to not 'grab' or hurt), so each 'drum' is like 10-15 lancets.  They make testing much easier.... it helps to have the drum for clumsy fingers as well.  I have arthritis, and using those individual lancets isn't all that easy.  The drum protects the lancets between uses, and disposing is easier, as the points never see outside of the drum.  They have a 'thing' that pulls up when the drum is removed from the lancing device, preventing reuse.  I still use a sharps container- but I know their secure should they accidentally hit the trash.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26UG7VZG7CIA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJURYXU#wasThisHelpful","R26UG7VZG7CIA3","A2C9XE9I8RSKNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2C9XE9I8RSKNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the next book in the Hitman Series and features Rafael "" Rafe"" Mendoza , a mercenary, and Ava, a hand model, who is being used a mule to save her best friends life. Rafe was a tough Alpha when it came to his job but he was a huge wimp when it came to his personal life. Ava seemed as she was the stronger of the two who was willing to do what it took to save her friend's life. The whole thing with Rafe's issue dominated too much of the story and while I can kind of see that what happens in the past can warp your future I think it was a little unrealistic.Rafe is 35 years old and with his job you would think he would have gotten over his problem if he would have just went to counseling. Ava who is no counselor and is younger had more common sense than Rafe does.

"I wish we could give half stars because this is more of a 3 1/2 star product.  I am not a super technical user. I am your average, everyday consumer, so this review will reflect that.Pros:This has a solid feel. It reminds me of our Samsung laptop but without the back lighted keyboard.It is small enough to throw in a purse or small bag without taking up much room, but it is still big enough to use as a computer, not just a tablet.The fact that it has Word, PowerPoint,  etc. is awesome. You can use the Windows cloud service to save documents or a flash drive.As a mini laptop,  this isn't bad. If you are thinking about getting a Chromebook,  this may be an attractive alternative since it has a scaled down version of Microsoft Office.Cons:As a tablet, this stinks. It is not intuitive.  When typing, you have to click the button to pull up the keyboard and put it away. No clicking on a search engine and the keyboard automatically popping up. This may not seem like a big deal, but try going without this feature for awhile...The apps available are slim. Microsoft only allows you to use their app store, so a lot of your favorite apps will not be available.The touch response on the tablet is not as good as others. I often had to click multiple times to get it to respond.The processing time was a little longer than my son's 7 inch Samsung tablet.Overall, if you want a small laptop for work or school that has the Windows suite, this is pretty good.  If you want a tablet for games and apps with the occasional need for a keyboard,  keep looking.The photo compares it to my son's 7 inch Samsung tab","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ZCETU7HDKSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014854RGK#wasThisHelpful","R33ZCETU7HDKSV","A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 8 year old was over the moon when I opened this package. The sheer size of this toy makes it exciting. When we finally got it out and played with it,  he couldn't stop thanking me.The Transformer's arms move in robot mode.  The eyes light up blue when you press the Transformer button, and it says several phrases.  It easily goes in car mode, and it does roll. It has a little scraping noise because of how the legs are made, but I didn't see any scratches on my floor. It seems well made. There are not a lot of parts, so it should hold up well.The Transformer app is pretty fun on its own, and scanning your toy just makes it feel cooler. You get more tokens by scanning it, but I could not tell any other difference by scanning it.Overall,  the sheer size of this toy adds to the joy your Transformer fan will feel by playing with this. My son played with it for three hours straight after receiving it. That is a successful toy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JFS84RUV8U92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOFZFBM#wasThisHelpful","R2JFS84RUV8U92","A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first tried this product, I was concerned.  It felt oily to the touch. I was happily suprised that it did not look oily on my face. I have very oily skin that is prone to break out, so I am very cautious about what makeup I wear. This glides on easily and covers just as well as heavier foundation. Overall,  I am very impressed. It is hard to find a good oil free base makeup, but this is a good one. My cheap side shudders at the cost, but if you are accustomed to buying non drug store makeup, you will like this one. It is a good matte makeup that doesn't look chalky on your face.UPDATEDAfter a week or so of wearing this, I have to delete a star and make this 4 stars. The makeup still looks good, but it stays oily feeling on your face.  It still doesn't look shiny, but I don't like to brush a hand against my face and feel like an oil slick.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQU6QT26714BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBJWP86#wasThisHelpful","RQU6QT26714BE","A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These underwear are very comfortable.  The material reminds me of a thin pair of basketball shorts. The idea of air holes all over is neat, but I don't think it actually does anything.  They are thin and light, so they aren't hot. The fit is pretty conservative and does not ride up into places it is not supposed to go. My only complaint is that they run a smidge big.

"I have a confession to make.  I rarely floss.  I know I should, but it rarely happens. I also have never used an electric toothbrush.  In today's world, I know that seems crazy. When this toothbrush came up on Vine, I jumped on the idea of trying it.I love it!  The power is a little overwhelming,  but after I used the brush with longer bristles,  I felt like I had a dentist cleaning! It is fantastic. I had an initial naive moment where I turned on the toothbrush before I had it in my mouth : toothpaste everywhere.  My bad...Now that I know how to use it, it would be hard to go back. It is obviously superior to a standard toothbrush.  Why only 4 stars? I am very budget minded. This is a big chunck of change for a toothbrush.  If you can swing it, it is well worth the investment.  I am thinking of getting one for my boys because I know they will have clean teeth with little effort; like a lot if little kids, they are not known for their brushing prowess.Overall,  if you are on the fence about getting this, hop off and buy it now!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26VA9WOXU6M9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7YP8#wasThisHelpful","R26VA9WOXU6M9B","A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I nurse him while lying down, and then I put him back in his crib.I had been using Pampers Swaddlers for months with occasional night time leakage while nursing in bed. That was annoying, but it didn't happen but about once a week. After awhile, Swaddlers were not fitting well, so I bought the same size in Cruisers. ( Yes, I followed the size suggestion)The first 5 nights wearing them, he leaked out of them every night! Furious,  I decided to try Luvs at night. Imagine my amazement when they did not leak!

"My husband has used a traditional tower charcoal smoker and a different electric smoker in the past. They got the job done, but they had their flaws. This smoker is fantastic!With just a little handful of wood chips and water, my husband was able to perfectly smoke six Cornish hens in about two hours and forty minutes. The built in thermometer didn't give us any trouble. The meat was done and extremely juicy.  The only down side is that it takes about 40 minutes to preheat. If you think about your prep time with charcoal,  it probably evens out. The glass front is great. I loved seeing the progress. Overall, this smoker is easy to use and produces the most moist meat I have eaten. I can't wait to try smoking other things.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26Y4S4SMTAQEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMRXYCE#wasThisHelpful","R26Y4S4SMTAQEH","A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This table has six different activities, all but one making noise.  It is well made with bright colors and lights that capture his attention.  Right now, I hold his waist for support while he leans over and plays with everything. It is almost too big to hold upright while he plays with it in my lap, but I make it work. I can see this becoming a favorite toy once he crawls and walks.  As far a s lasting power, this toy is a good investment.

"It is always refreshing to read something completely different from everything else on the market, and this novel fits the bill.  The idea of jinni in this novel is so unique.  In my mind, I want to conquer up the genie from Aladdin, but the complex world of these jinni are completely different.  At the beginning of the novel, the author lists the different types of jinni and their powers.  This was helpful in setting up the world building.  It was a little complex at first, but you are so quickly sucked in that it fleshes out rather quickly.Our heroine is a strong woman who is still caring and sensitive after all the things she has been through.  She never got on my nerves or seemed whiny with her circumstance.  Our hero is strong both physically and mentally.  He is young to be the leader of a rebellious movement, but with his life experiences, it seems logical that he could do it.  There are several ""bad"" guys in this novel, and one of the aspects that I love the most about this novel is the complex way the author presents Malek, the heroine's master.  We are supposed to hate him and have a small soft spot for him at the same time.  I did.... I am a sucker for anti-heroes, and Malek fits the bill.  He clearly has feelings for our heroine, but he just doesn't know how to be a ""normal"", good man.This was a very addicting read.  I started it early one night, and I finished it a few hours later.  I devoured it.  If you are a fan of darker romances, you will enjoy this novel.  This is marketed as a Young Adult novel, but I believe it is just as satisfying of a read for adults.  As far as teens go, there are some dark, violent, scenes.  There is also bad language.  I do not think young teens should read this book, but that is up to the parent.Overall, I loved this book, and I can't wait for the next installation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFKUO0S01HZXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006231856X#wasThisHelpful","RFKUO0S01HZXE","A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We actually have all the Kindergarten and 1st grade books at our house.  My eldest son is going into the second grade, but I wanted to keep him fresh during the summer months.  This was a great review for him.  The start of the book was pretty basic for him, but it was still good for him to remember all those terms that he will be using in class soon.  My youngest is going into Kindergarten, and he was able to do a lot of the Kindergarten aged books.  When they started getting into writing whole sentences, he did struggle a little.My boys love Star Wars, so this was a great series that motivated my boys to want to work.  My youngest wanted to do his ""work"" off and on all day.  If you are not a Star Wars fan, you may have a few issues with name pronunciations and fill in the blanks.  Other than that, this is a great series of workbooks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FKFNIZG8DRYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761178082#wasThisHelpful","R1FKFNIZG8DRYU","A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like to prepare for multiple scenarios.  Tornadoes are a huge worry where I live, and I also like the idea of being prepared in the event of a disaster of any kind.  This small, handy radio gives me a small sense of security.  This can fit in any backpack along with other emergency gear, and the long list of features for the price is second to none.  The crank is a little cumbersome, but because of its size, that is understandable.  The light is bright and long lasting.  I haven't tried the cell phone charger, but the specifications state that 10 minutes or so of cranking can allow for a short emergency call.  From my experience, cranking is definitely the faster, more efficient way of charging this device.  If you have left it run dead and need this device, you will want more immediate results anyways.Overall, if you are looking for an emergency radio/light/charger, this is a great one to just throw in a bag or have ready when bad weather strikes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4I3P7ZC7FJKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H88EK3A#wasThisHelpful","R4I3P7ZC7FJKO","A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Transformer will appeal mainly to the younger kids with its sounds and easy transformation.  If your child is older than seven, I think you should look into some of the more complex Transformer toys.  The transformation is not that awe inspiring, but it is easy enough for little hands to do it.  This toy didn't keep my kids hugely occupied, but they occasionally pick it up to play with it.

"I LOVE Contigo cups.  We have several in our house all the way from kids, travel mugs, and straw cups.  These stainless steel cups keep things hot or cold for hours.  They never leak, and they are a breeze to clean.  These cups will keep coffee hot three hours or more, in my experience.  My husband travels for his work, and he sips on his coffee for hours in these cups. The SnapSeal kind of travel mugs are not quite as easy to one hand operate as the Autoseal kind., in my opinion.  The Autoseal you simply press down a button while drinking.  The SnapSeal has you snap part of the top open to drink and snap closed to keep from spilling.  It is really a matter of preference, but you can't go wrong either way.  While they are a little expensive, you get what you pay for.

"This nursing pillow has many cool features.  The duel sides offers a soft side for nursing and a firm side for when your baby gets older for spoon feedings.  It also has a new feature since I first started having kids, vibration.  This vibration disk emits a gentle vibration that is not over powering.  The disk goes in the middle of the pillow.  The only problem that I have with this is the fact that you have to unzip and put your hand in the pillow to turn the feature on and off.  This isn't a huge deal, but it is a little annoying.  It also takes a lesson than common battery, C.  Again, this isn't a huge deal, but a lot of people do not have this type of battery in their battery/junk drawer.  It also is a little snug, but that aspect can be considered good or bad depending on how you look at it.Overall, this is a good, quality nursing pillow.  The unisex pattern and colors is also a plus in my book.  If vibration is important to you, this is worth the extra money.  If you don't care one way or the other, I would stick with their basic nursing pillows.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TWNQ3WT6KOJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HCSYQVM#wasThisHelpful","R3TWNQ3WT6KOJQ","A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Decent for the price, but overall I didn't like these too much. Even the smallest size earpiece hurt my ears a little, I found the buttons hard to press/annoying, and the size of these makes it annoying to even open up the dust cover to recharge them.

"Overall, these do what they need to if you don't have a lot of heavy cables. Too much weight, and they're likely to unstick themselves and become useless (the foam adhesive underneath rips and becomes useless). I had one fall off on its own with not too many cords, but then others haven't. Cords are fairly easy to pop in and out and each slot easily accommodates cords about 1/4"" thick (which goes back to the too much weight issue, though). My other issue is the colors are mostly kind of goofy, but at least these cable clips are usually hidden (which makes me wonder, why make them different colors at all?). It might make sense if they were kids toys, or if you stick two together and let your cat swat it around. I wish they came in plain colored black/white packs, but just for hidden utility these colors work. Anyway, so far mostly good for hidden light duty jobs.Note: this product was provided to me as a promotion in exchange for an honest review, but I review honestly.

"This is a pretty delicious coconut water and it has no added sugar. I have found some coconut waters taste a little bit better because of added sugar but it's more healthy to have none.

Solid healthy drink choice if you hate water, but keep in mind it still has 80 calories per pint. So far I haven't run into the sour/bad batches that 1star reviews mentioned, but I've only drank 2 cartons so far.Although not as cheap, I definitely recommend buying this organic coconut water instead of from some dude on a Cancun beach who hacks open a warm coconut with a rusty machete then puts a straw in it.Note: this product was provided to me in exchange for a review, but I review honestly.

"Not much that makes it stand apart from other Google Cardboard products, which isn't a big deal. It is what it is. Overall happy with this, although the on-box directions could be a bit more clear. Also, recommend using a larger phone like iPhone 6, since my 5S was a bit too small and was short by an inch so it bounced around inside. Besides that, my only negative was opening the box... manufacturing defect in the tear off strip made opening it a little annoying.Worth the price, though, for an intro to basic Virtual Reality using miscellaneous apps that are out there. This is a vehicle to those apps, which vary from simplicity like interactive Google Street View so more creative uses of the technology.

Still, three thumbs way up!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHAFR7L5KAOHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016E6Y1G2#wasThisHelpful","RHAFR7L5KAOHX","A2XOUBTCDPFMBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOUBTCDPFMBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice sunglasses, much better than the usual $5-10 sunglasses I usually end up buying randomly on vacation or at the mall. Quality-wise, I love these... but still deciding if I love how they look on my face. It will depend on your personal preference; I would remove a star because I don't love the look (the look a little too much like lady's glasses to me), but it's just my opinion. I'll adjust my review if these break or something, but so far these are recommended if you like the style.The Good:+ Nice quality; feels nice/premium+ Nicely packaged; comes with a handy case, soft slip case, and cloth wipe+ Blocks out all the necessary sun rays while still being able to see clearly+ Classy look, although not for everyone, and thankfully has no goofy design accents like many sunglasses doThe Bad: Design is standard, but styled different enough where some people may not like them (I'm personally a simple RayBan style kind of guy). Some people my find these sized too small; I have a small head and they are slightly tight (which in my case is good, they def wont fall off)Note: this product was provided to me at a discount in exchange for a review, but I review honestly.

"Nice item. Well packaged (for cheaper Chinese-made stuff), included remote, 5 ports, and a low profile look that is easy to fit into your setup. Then I started using it. The first few minutes I was sold; remote worked well and switching inputs was surprisingly fast. Even the automatic input switch was quite nice, since all you had to do was turn on another device and it switched to that by itself. For the price, this unit seems  great. Just before if you happen to get the older defective run/model that had a white remote, be ready to return it on the chance it's a bad one. I wasn't so lucky with mine, but the seller was very communicative about fixing the problem and getting me a replacement quickly.Received a free replacement with the latest model, and works well so far.

"Nice item. If you like the look of this from the pics, and are good with the price, I recommend. The watch portion is removable as well (attaches/detaches with a magnet), so you could always fit another iPad here or use the indentation from the watch stand to put rings, jewelry, stack of condoms, other watches, whatever.

"Overall nice pair of pruning shears. Quality is not 100%, though, as a nicer product like Fiskars. I noticed small defects in molding such as rough edges in the rubber handle, the brand name sticker was put in the wrong place, and the hole at the base of the handle was imperfect and partially filled in. Thankfully, these blemishes don't get in the way (yet) of the utility aspect of these. So far, they cut nicely because of the sharp blades. Keep in mind, the ratchet function is good but doesn't work miracles. For larger branches, you will still need good hand strength.So far, they seem to have plenty of leverage to cut through what you'd expect for shears of this size. Recommended as of now, since they seem to be decent quality. I'd check a Home Depot or something, first, though as personally I'm not sure these are worth $20. The price combined with the little nitpicky imperfections knock it down a star. Utility-wise, though, 5 stars.UPDATE 11/2/15: Used these outside trimming trees for a solid half hour, and they held up well. Ratchet function works well and I was able to cut some pine branches that were 3/4"" to 1"" thick. Keep in mind, it's possible but it takes still quite a bit of hand strength!Note: this product was provided to me free in exchange for a review, but I review honestly.

"Overall: I question whether this product is really even necessary. If you have a speakerphone feature on your phone, it's basically the same thing (except this clips to your visor, and you can feel for the button instead of looking for your phone and taking eyes off the road. It works well enough, and fairly simple to use. If you are picky with your electronics like I am, I'd spend a little more to get something nicer. On a strictly 'get the job done' basis, this'll do ya just fine. I removed one star for overall quality, but I can't really knock because it does what it is supposed to. If you want something louder, more versatile, there are plenty of options out there. I'll update my review if it proves not to stand the test of time or if other issues come up.The Good:+ Decent packaging+ Small form factor and unobtrusive+ Fits and mounts easily to your visor with provided clip and magnet+ Pairs very easily with your phone over bluetooth; connected to my iPhone without issue in less than a minute+ Good price if you're looking for a lower end product with decent capabilities+ So far battery life seems to last as advertisedThe Bad: Feels cheap, buttons feel cheap and clicky (but expected for this price point) Volume on the unit is not very loud Can pause/play music on your phone, which I found to be strange and pointless (and sometimes annoying)Note: this product was provided to me free in exchange for a review, but I review honestly.

"I have ADD/ADHD/whatever you want to call it... and this book helped, sort of. The problem was, it had good ideas, but most of what I read in here I had learned on my own while dealing with my ADHD. One example; a tip they give you is to leave items out to help you remember in the morning. Like put your keys on the kitchen table so you remember it in the morning, etc. It's just common sense when you have these types of scattered thoughts and issues. My main problem with this book is the writing is so simple that after a while, I found it borderline offensive. They probably thought, ""these simpletons need small words, big font sizes, and the information repeated multiple times or they'll go running off towards something shiny.""  It seems like the authors are so out of touch that they felt the need to address the reader like a child. Even the book itself is large, with large fonts as if designed for a senior citizen. Thanks for the extra legibility, but my eyes are fine.Bottom line: The book DOES indeed have many helpful tips on how to organize your life, but it's described in a simple, overly drawn out way. If you're really having trouble, and looking for kind of a beginners guide, the book may help you with the basics. Personally, as a moderately ADD-affected guy, I found it irritating and mostly speaking to common sense.

"Pretty much just vitamins, if maybe more specifically developed. I have tried these a few times after a night or two of wine drinking. They seem to work well enough. Don't expect a miracle though... the directions specifically say to take with a large glass of water, which in itself helps avoid a hangover. I'm pretty sensitive to getting hangovers as I've gotten older, and I did notice a difference after taking these (although nothing drastic). The directions say to take 2 at a time, and each gel cap is light and medium sized, so if you have trouble taking pills these may be slightly hard to get down. I had no problems, though.I'd recommend giving them a shot, but clearly not a necessity. Try a multivitamin and a glass of water before you drunkenly go to sleep and it will likely do the same thing.

"Very nice quality sleeves... I can't test them myself, but judging by the thickness of the sleeves and the foil/metal lining that each has, they are legit. Each sleeve fits about 2 credit cards, big sleeve will fit a passport (make sure to put your passport in chip first to be safe... with US passports, you can see the chip on the bottom of the front cover). The credit card size fits fine in a wallet, and has a smooth, soft touch outside that's quite nice. My only thought is that if you carry a bunch of credit cards, you may want to invest in an RFID secure wallet instead of individual sleeves. I can see these being annoying to take different cards in and out on a trip if you need one sleeve for each card.

I found my phone very slowly dipping from it's own weight even when I thought I tightened it pretty well Base grip needs a flat surface to be stably secured to, which can be a problem if you intend on attaching this to a bed's headboard that is has cylindrical bars Base clip has a strange choice in design; sparkly elastic which I suppose is to protect the surface you are attaching to from being scratched. Good in theory, but looks-wise I don't like it (looks more fit for a teenage girl's clothing than a tech item)Airvent mount:Didn't fitt well in my vent, and depending on your car may be in a strange spot/angle that's not so great. I tried getting it into my vent a few times and it either got stuck, or wouldn't go in all the way so it just kind of hung there. If you have wider vents, try it... but did not work for me.

"My first thought when I came across this product was, 'psh, why in the hell would you want to sleep in a coffin... you're not a vampire.' Then one night after the bar, I made a drunken purchase and blew all my gift cards on this bed. This is where my story begins.The coffin was waiting on my front porch when I woke up the next afternoon, as if my purchase was predetermined. I decided I should return it, so I left it on the porch until I could follow the usual Amazon return process with UPS pick up. There it stayed for the remainder of the day, until something unexpected happened late that night. I was having trouble sleeping, so I wandered downstairs for a little midnight snack. While stumbling through the dark, I slammed my shin hard into what I thought was our coffee table, and fell to the floor with a groan. I flicked on the lights to find the Nicodemus Coffin Bed leaning seductively against the living room wall, spread wide open to reveal it's enticing velvety red interior. I could have sworn the wrinkles in the fabric winked at me, but I blinked once and never saw it again. The smell of pine, freshly glued velvet, and black lacquer was strangely inviting. After re-reading all the 5 star reviews, I reconsidered my purchase and was confident this would be the best night of sleep I'd ever experience. How wrong I was.I laid in the coffin, closed the lid, and instinctively crossed my arms over my chest. The cozy padding enveloped my body like a sea of the finest Amish quilts, and I comfortably drifted off to sleep in seconds. I awoke in a panic not too long after, struggling to breathe. I realized that I was running out of air and partially hallucinating from choking on an hour's worth of sleep farts. I clawed frantically at the coffin's interior, and surprisingly a secret panel slid open in the siding. I felt a large button (which said 'kablamo', according to the braille beneath it), and pressed it. A whoosh of fresh air burst into the coffin as an LED operational display lit up in front of me on the backside of the lid. I felt great relief, both for the fresh air and also because the screen was HD with luscious pixel density running the latest iOS 8. After I turned on the 'reduce motion' setting to prevent vomiting, I explored my in-coffin options. There was the usual unnecessary apps like iBooks and Apple Maps, but one in particular caught my attention. The icon was a stylized image of Spock's face with the name ""BeaMeUp"". Of course I tapped it.It forced me to sign up through Facebook, which was annoying, but at least it was one less password for me to remember. After logging in, I came to a screen that said Beam Locations. I was still a little confused, so I clicked the only one available named Warehouse. Within seconds, the coffin went black and I felt like I was in Disney World riding Space Mountain. Thirty seconds later, the movement stopped. I hesitantly peaked out of the lid to see owls flying everywhere, holding boxes of varying sizes. I looked around cautiously, and judging by all the logos, I was in Amazon's warehouse. I was about 2 stories up on a shelf, with security robots searching everywhere with flashlights. I knew I shouldn't be here, so I quickly navigated the app's simple yet boring interface to take me home. After a few finger taps and a quick ride, I was back in my living room. What a rush. I was blown away by the possibilities, that I immediately ordered another Nicodemus Coffin Bed before finally going to sleep.Since that day months ago, I have saved an inexplicable amount of money on my daily commute as well as a vacation to Australia. By simply placing the second coffin in another location (or shipping it to another country to save on airfare), I not only save money but also a lot of time. I have yet to fully research it, but I think it is also much more environmentally friendly than a Prius and the rechargeable battery on The Nicodemus lasts about 2 weeks before recharging. My commute is now approximately 1 minute each day, which frees up lots of time for me to sleep or write Amazon reviews. My only negative is that the interior is not removable or machine washable. This is a big deal for me, since I routinely sleep nude and it's a real hassle to lug this thing to the dry cleaner.After the initial buyer's remorse, I highly recommend blowing a full paycheck on this product. Well worth it, you will not be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V397N7KGDYU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CHK3YI#wasThisHelpful","R1V397N7KGDYU8","A2XOUBTCDPFMBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOUBTCDPFMBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not really qualified to start critiquing musical aspects of this album, so my review will be short and non-technical. As a long-time Bodyjar fan who owns all their albums, I was pretty excited when I heard this was coming out. They've always been catchy, fun, and consistently delivered enjoyable music. This album is no exception, however, it did take me a few listens to latch onto it. It's still same-ish formula, but seems more mature and less poppy than How It Works. Anyway, if you're a fan, you'll love it (even if you are unimpressed at first, it will grab you the second time around).Favorite tracks: Role Model, Stranglehold, If This is It","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R357DL36EQEDQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FR0V1EM#wasThisHelpful","R357DL36EQEDQA","A2XOUBTCDPFMBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOUBTCDPFMBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's sturdy, grippable, and seems to do a good job with 'panning for gold'. I use Feline Pine, which starts out as larger pellets then becomes more like sawdust as it gets used (recommend this litter too). This scoop works well with either state of that particular litter, and depending on what angle you hold it can either sift or remove the unwanted litter. The holes in it are on the larger side, but I think it would work well for clumping litters as well. Overall, for such a simple item, it does a good job and seems like it will last a couple years without breaking. Also, it seems to resist turds and such from clinging to it, keeping it looking less gross looking than my previous dollar store scoop. So far, it has put up with a lot of s*** and remained decent. I have not regretted this purchase, and I doubt anyone would. My only worry is that it's so beautifully designed, someone may break in to burgle it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROMZKFWNKPLH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035HB8XI#wasThisHelpful","ROMZKFWNKPLH1","A2XOUBTCDPFMBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOUBTCDPFMBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In these times of extreme busyness, you can't help but get frustrated sometimes and think ""there's just not enough time in the day!"" With this item, your capacity to ""get s*** done"" is increased exponentially.PROs:* Get s*** done* Colors are not only pleasing to the eye, but scientifically proven to encourage productivity and movements* No need to flush, built-in incinerator removes waste after motion sensors detect your absence* Small enough that you can leave your iPad installed and just carry the whole thing with you* Can download a free bidet app (although after the trial period, you have to pay for it with an in-app purchase)* Installing your iPad doesn't cover up the camera lens, for easier multi-tasking (Skyping and wiping?)* Seat sensor technology detects up to 4 individuals, adjusting seat height and warmth automatically according to programmable presets* Magnetic smart lid keep animals out, and scents inCONs:* No Bluetooth support, will not sync with a smart watch or wireless headphones* I'd love to see this in a champagne color or maybe customizable lidsThis is the best money I've spent in years... I will be buying more of these. 2 thumbs up!UPDATE: I have dropped my review down to 4 stars. Currently, my left buttock is securely lodged in the seat. While I wait for the fire department to arrive, I wanted to share my further experience with this product. Since I was unable to Facetime for help (less than ideal Wifi access) and had fallen over during my struggle, it wasn't until the mailman found me on the front porch that I was able to call for help. It clearly needs some sort of safety mechanism to prevent cheek lock.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M6G8T9SFRYCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3G8UGQ#wasThisHelpful","R1M6G8T9SFRYCQ","A2XOUBTCDPFMBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOUBTCDPFMBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall nice item. I love it, aside from the fact that it sounds like there's a bunch of crap rattling around inside it. I almost want to shake it over some ice cream to see if sprinkles come out.

"I've always had a soft spot for Reggie since my college years, so I was legitimately excited to hear about this 'comeback' album. I do find most of the joke tracks funny (on first listen, at least). There are some great songs on here, and I admittedly really wish the joke tracks were a bit more of a minority (I feel that way about most Reggie albums). Album would kill it if there were a few more serious[ish] songs like Revenge is a Dish... that song rules and is catchy as hell. The dude obviously knows how to make great music, but sometimes it seems like it's a battle over making cool music vs. joke skits. Some songs you have no urge to go back to after that initial chuckle, but there's definitely enough content on here to keep listening (even a couple jokier tracks are fun enough to enjoy more than once). Loving this album so far, and I think it's catchy enough that even non-fans will enjoy the majority of it. Revenge is a Dish is still my favorite... if you're unsure, at least buy that track. Welcome back, Reggie! I can't wait see one of your shows next year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22FQS2AXIG9OO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOMDE70#wasThisHelpful","R22FQS2AXIG9OO","A2XOUBTCDPFMBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOUBTCDPFMBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And I'm not sure mine will last much longer, even though it's spent half its life folded in the box. I have barely used this thing over the past 2-3 years, inflated it to the specified size. Now it's developed a bulge at the top, transforming it into a 'fitness egg'. I'm strangely looking forward to the painful hilarity that will accompany the moment it randomly explodes as I'm doing some awkward situp. End result, besides the future falling-to-the-ground-in-a-climactic-fitness explosion, is that I will probably not buy this product again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AYV0N3PEPMDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FH2W4A#wasThisHelpful","R3AYV0N3PEPMDT","A2XOUBTCDPFMBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOUBTCDPFMBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I dig it. This is definitely one of the stronger pilots being voted on. Characters are likable, with enough chuckles to keep me into it. I generally have ADD tendencies, so it's a rarity that I don't get bored easily. Story was so-so, if anything I'd say it's average.

"Fairly funny, great especially for a pilot. This one has my vote, I'm sure it'll get better as it matures (if Amazon decides to move forward with the series). Some of the jokes try a little too hard, in my opinion, though. There are only so many times I can hear them say the word 'hater' before it gets old. Maybe it's because I'm not ghetto? Most of it was funny, creative humor, though. I think it would be way better if they dropped the annoying ghetto slang terms, their mannerisms, voices, and attitude clashes with their situation just fine without them. This show would feel right at home on Adult Swim, I'd DVR this. Nice job, Amazon... looking forward to more in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WHHID78FDB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBNR95I#wasThisHelpful","R30WHHID78FDB5","A2XOUBTCDPFMBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOUBTCDPFMBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keeping it short, wish I could rate these pilots without writing a review! Overall I enjoyed this, and really liked the characters. I felt they were likable, sometimes funny, and relatable. I think it would get even better with time as you get to know them. I thought the show was mostly well acted too.

"Unfortunately, I was hit with the inconvenience of one. I just received my Nexus 7 yesterday, and enjoyed it for the hour that it was working. The apps seemed cool, I started loading some ebooks on there, the free Transformers movie looked fantastic even though the movie itself sucks sack. I was happy... until I downloaded Google Sky and started playing. Not sure if it was coincidence, but after that the unit's stopped accepting any of my touches on the screen. It was just done. I tried a soft restart, hard reset, and nothing seemed to fix it even when done multiple times. I couldn't even get past the lock screen, except for 2 random times when I was pawing at the screen like a frustrated 5 yr old. Somehow, my frantic swipes got through the lock screen and I was able to get to settings to do a wipe to factory defaults. Still, the screen was F'd up. So... RMA time for me.I'm not a diehard Apple fan, or Android fan. All I want is something that works well, looks cool, and lets me customize it out the arse. It sucks when you get so excited for something, and it completely disappoints you. I don't want an iPad, I have an iPhone (and honestly it bores the hell out of me). The most customization you can do with iPhone is change your background. iPhones are nice, but designed so simply that it's borderline outdated at this point. They haven't redesigned the iOS look in how long? Or even changed a ringtone in 5 yrs? Oh well... I digress, as my hopes for the Nexus 7 are over for now. It's sad too, because I can tell it's a fantastic device if it actually worked. I've rarely ever, no matter what brand, had a product be this obviously defective. I refuse to even try to exchange for a new Nexus, I am going to wait on the next generation to see if they are manufactured better.If you really want to give it a shot, be aware of the possibility of a dud. If you get a good one, then luck you... from what I have seen in my hour of use, it's a fantastic device.EDIT: I decided to try ordering another from B&H a week later. Now that I've had a few days, I've raised my rating a little. I do really like the N7, BUT guess what... a few days into using it and I am having a different (also seemingly common) defect. I have screen flicker when reducing the brightness down. It's not terrible, but annoying. If I buy something, it should be perfect out of the box. I also noticed that at the lowest setting, the screen is still pretty bright. To compare, iPhone and iPad backlight goes down super low when wanted, saving lots of battery life and making it easier on the eyes in the dark. I'm not sure why Android refuses to make their backlight control go comparably low (aside from having to get an app to do it). My original Droid phone was the same way with it's overly high lowest brightness setting. Anyway, now I am again stuck in the 'return or exchange' dilemma. I'm not sure I'm willing to take the 'third time's a charm' route.EDIT 12/10/12:I've had my second Nexus 7 (unfortunately bought before Google changed prices/GB versions) and I'm loving it. There are some minor quirks and imperfections (screen flicker, etc as noted earlier) but overall I don't notice it much since I've installed Lux. I use it fairly often, and at this point I'm pretty happy I gave it a second chance. My one new issue is the camera, which is AWFUL quality pics. It's basically unusable except for video chats since it's front facing. I tried it with Instagram out of curiosity, and the picture quality was so bad that I realized it's not even worth messing with it. Slight annoyance, guess I'll stick to my iPhone for that. Other than these things, I now highly recommend the Nexus 7, especially the newer versions where they've probably worked out all the little quirks. Screw the iPad Mini.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ST60SM4MDWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008M04V1E#wasThisHelpful","R2ST60SM4MDWX","A2XOUBTCDPFMBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOUBTCDPFMBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is easily the cheapest and most energy-efficient air conditioner I have ever experienced and it works with incredible speed and ease of use. I figured I'd take my product research straight to the streets for a real-world test in August at the Jersey Shore. In my search for a helpful volunteer, I came across a self-defined 'studly gent' named Giovanni, who was sporting an FBI (Female Body Inspector) t-shirt, expertly pruned eyebrows, and a healthy orange glow. The dude looked like he could benefit from some high-quality air conditioning. I asked him, ""Hello, sir, how would you like to test out a portable air conditioner that makes the outdoors feel like a walk-in freezer?"" He replies, ""Yo, bro, as you can see, I'm always hot, hit me up with that!"" So I instructed him, ""Put this against your neck, hold down the button, and you'll be shaking with the chills in seconds!"" Eager to beat the heat, he snatched it from me with his finely manicured hands, and wasted no time pressing it against his 12"" diameter neck. Giovanni's eyes rolled back in his head, and he dropped to the ground with pleasurable, heat-lifting chills. He was swinging his arms at me (probably because he wanted a pinch more cooling down), so I gave him 5-10 more seconds of that sweet, sweet air conditioning. Strangely enough, he was so relaxed from the cooling down process, that he emptied his bowels and bladder before falling sound asleep on the hot boardwalk. The gathering crowd was applauding wildly, proof that everyone there was equally as stunned and impressed by the air conditioner as I was. Two thumbs (way) up, and highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R194QGAB4RGYDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XN7QG6#wasThisHelpful","R194QGAB4RGYDD","A2XOUBTCDPFMBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOUBTCDPFMBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't get into it. The whole time I was reading, I was waiting for that moment in a book where you start to get sucked in, and it never happened. Many of the chapters I found flat out boring because they revolved around politics/details within the armed forces and the government. These parts felt pretty bloated and made my eyes glaze over, some of it was intriguing but mostly a borefest. I quickly found myself skimming these parts. I got about 1/3 through the book when I realized that if I'm skimming pages already, why should I bother forcing myself to keep reading just for the sake of finishing? I feel the book was well written, but I agree with some other reviewers... I also found the format to work against the book as a whole. Besides hearing about the emotional parts, how it was effecting actual people and characters, I wasn't often emotionally invested in many of the stories. I didn't really care to read pages about the inner workings of the government/politics from the point of view of an army general. Maybe I didn't give it much of a chance, but I wish it were more stories like in the beginning where it felt more human/relatable. I'd rather read a book that I have trouble putting down, and this was not not one of them for me. This zombie fad is getting tired, I'd much rather close this book and watch The Walking Dead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQGWXROCEKRGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307346617#wasThisHelpful","RQGWXROCEKRGE","A2XOUBTCDPFMBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOUBTCDPFMBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My cats seem to love it. Maybe they are just little fat arses that eat anything, though. All I know is that my one cat used to have constipation issues before Wellness and Wilderness. He'd get a little random butthole bleeding (yuck) and discomfort of which he relieved by leaving lovely skidmarks across my carpet. So far this has been gone since the food switch off of garbage ProPlan. They also seem to have more energy, coats seem shinier as well. I would definitely recommend spending the extra money on either Wilderness or Core Wellness (grain free foods) for your little guys. I'm confident the money saved on crap junk foods like Purina, etc, will not make up for expensive vet visits further down the road. I'm not sure if they have indeed changed the formula, or exactly how it changed, but I switched to Wilderness anyway. My cats went right to it, I don't usually need to transition them.One issue I have had with this food is my cats still occasionally drop a vom-bomb on my floor. I don't think this is due to the food, though. I think they are just little pigs, and sometimes I take too long to feed them. It seems they eat too fast and then -- BLEH, out it goes. Also, I wish they'd package it in more environmentally friendly bags though, there has got to be a way to not make the bags out of thick plastic (or whatever it is). It just has that feeling... like it's an unnecessary amount of material for what it's needed for. It was most likely some art director (I am one) that created the packaging and decided customers would think it feels fancy so it's worth the price.Overall, I've done much reading about various foods, and this food seems great for them, aside from a raw diet.

"Overall, I like my Apple TV and would recommend it. Do I think it's one of Apple's best products? Nope. Maybe I've just become increasingly critical in my olding stages of life. Anyway here are my goods/bads:SWEETNESS*Streams pretty flawlessly in various formats, have not had any stuttering*HD movies on my iTunes look pretty great (even if they are only technically 720p)*Netflix, radio (new), many options for video/audio*Easy to use interface and navigation*Anything you put on your computer (music, photos, videos) is available through ATV, which is niceCRAPNESS*You have to turn your computer on, then open iTunes to use anything*Apple TV remote is very clicky (hard clicks, doesn't feel all that comfy to use), inputting passwords, etc is a real chore*Sometimes ATV refuses to shut off after turning the TV off. You need to go to top menu, then hold center button on remote to shut it off... it will randomly not turn the unit off, and you must repeat this a few times then all the sudden it works*Light randomly comes on for network activity (supposedly) even though the unit isn't on... but it looks like it's on? Sure, ok, Apple.*iTunes store is built in, but seems to be a ripoff. $4 to rent, $15 to buy (avg, non-HD) a movie? Two rentals and you might as well have gotten a month of Netflix.For $100, it's a pretty good deal in my opinion. I have enjoyed it, except for the minor annoyances with the hardware and having to go turn my computer on before using it. The computer thing is my biggest grievance, but most of the time I have mine on already anyway. If that's a dealbreaker for you, you'll have to shell out some more bucks for a product with built-in storage. I'd wait on this ATV, though, since it looks as if a newer model is in the works.

"The good: It's easy to take down and put up, has been surprisingly sturdy, and overall decently built product. If my feet and ankles weren't so pathetic from wearing shoes all my life, I'd hang from it like Batman. I weigh about 180 but if I were 200+ I would probably be more hesitant to trust this thing. So far I don't see any chance of the door frame breaking/bar popping off/you falling to the floor and shattering that sweet arse you've been working on. It does what it's supposed to do. If you feel so inclined, you can also dazzle your guests by leaving it in the doorway and hang potted plants from it.The bad: As another reviewer said, the crappy foam ends leave black marks on white molding (it did for me). I don't care, though, since I rent an apartment and they'll just put paint layer #217 on it after I leave anyway. Also, this same foam that rests against the door frame will eventually split and tear half off from the pressure. Both sides of mine are flat and splitting off, which means that the bare metal is pressing against the door frame. The last thing I don't like about it the foam grips are cheap and thin, so your hands will be a little uncomfortable. Weight lifting gloves help.This experience comes from owning it for a few years.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AXH3GINZY7S3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EJMS6K#wasThisHelpful","R3AXH3GINZY7S3","A2XOUBTCDPFMBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XOUBTCDPFMBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 9:23 MinsAs an entry level digital micrometer, I couldn't find anything that came close.I have both this iGaging EZ Mic and the Full Vernier IP65 iGaging digital micrometers and they both pretty much nail their price points. It's not really as much of a question of quality & accuracy  Vs. Price, as it is a question of size/weight Vs. features. This one(The EZ Mic) is much lighter and feels better in the hand. The IP65 has the full vernier scale on it and a much beefier weight and feel. Personally I will probably keep the big one at my workbench for precision measurements and CAD work, and use the EZ Mic as my Go-To micrometer that I keep in the shop and use for everyday dirty jobs.I tested the accuracy against my gauge blocks and feelers and it's right on the money.Pros:~ Same accuracy and resolution as the higher end micrometers~ Lighter and more ergonomic feel~ SPC Data cable output~ Carbide Tipped anvil and spindle (Measuring faces)~ Friction Lock~ Ratchet stop in the large thimble makes it a one turn operation~ Simple to use and easy to read~ Absolute and increment measure modes~ CR2032 battery (extra included)~ Comes with ball adapter and battery toolCons:~ No Vernier scale for manual measurements~ Plastic doesn't look quite as cool as polished chrome, but it feels good in the hand.I did a video review of it's bigger brother as well.Check out my GadgetClass Channel on YouTube","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GK9922EUHPST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INL0BTS#wasThisHelpful","R1GK9922EUHPST","A38J352T8TIPMX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38J352T8TIPMX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 10:00 MinsI compared the iGaging EZCal to 6 other digital calipers in this Video RoundUp.(Video Size and Quality was reduced to meet Amazons limits, Watch the full video on my YouTube GadgetClass channel)The stock pics on Amazon need to be updated, because they don't really feature this caliper well. The pics don't do it justice.The iGaging EZ Cal digital caliper easily stands out in quality and accuracy when compared to the other 2 main contenders in the under $30 price category (the Neiko and Carrera). Comparing them side by side it is no contest in terms of build quality and finish. You can tell they took extra steps in the polishing and finishing process which makes them look more sleek and professional. It is also obvious they they build these to much tighter tolerances than the Neiko and Carrera. There isn't any ""slop"" or ""wiggle room"" between the measuring body and the ruling body which is why it scored the highest of all of the calipers for accuracy and repeat-ability. The display is HUGE and covers most of the measuring body. Very smooth over-all.While it's bigger brother,the iGaging OriginCal, took first place due to it's absolute origin feature, I would not have any hesitation trusting the EZCal for critical measurements down to .0005"" which is not something I would say for the Neiko or Carrera.Pros:~ Good Accuracy over-all.~ Solid build design!~ Well polished/finished which makes it look better than the others~ Takes a Commonly available CR2032 (comes with an extra battery)\~ Battery Compartment is Not Going to Break On You~ IP54 rating for moisture and dust resistance~ Large, Clear, Easy to Read Display. Largest Display of all of the calipers~ Auto-Off After Inactivity Feature~ Fractional measurement to the 128th~ Over-All, the best $25 you can spend on an entry level caliperCons:~ No Auto-On when you start moving the body.

" 10:00 MinsI compared the Carrera Precision to 6 other digital calipers in this Video RoundUp.(Video Size and Quality was reduced to meet Amazons limits, Watch the full video on my YouTube GadgetClass channel)The Carrera Precision comes in a few different varieties, all of which are just slight styling changes. There is a Titanium a Platinum, TF etc. They all use the same heavy cast metal body(not made of titanium or platinum) and stainless steel caliper parts. The metal case actually throws the balance off quite a bit. The build quality and accuracy is not all that great compared to the iGaging EZCAL. There is a gap between the internal measuring jaws which renders all internal measurements inaccurate.Summary:I would stay away from the Carrera and get the iGaging EZCal for the same exact price.

"These lights need 3AA batteries first so open up the compartment. It's simple just unsnap it and place the batteries inside. Then close it back up. You don't need screws or a screw driver. How great is that so its easier for you. Then you turn them on to make sure they work for you. The lights are on a wire. This makes it easy for DIY projects. You can add them to just about anything.

I can hide the box that holds the batteries under the small tree skirt.*Runs on 3AA batteries*No screws or screwdriver needed*Timer*Great for DIY project*They are on a wire which lets you easily place them where you want them.*Great to use if you don't want cords running to outlets.*You can do so much with these lights it's up to you.Overall; I'm very pleased with ours and thinking what can I do with more of them.

"My kids LOVE pizza making night at our house. They toss whatever they want on the pizza. We cook it up. Once it's done I use to use a cheaper roll around cutter. Now I use this nice pizza cutter. It's 14"" long and has a wooden handle. It's super nice. You would see this kind of cutter in the nice pizza places you eat at while in town. I cut the pizza myself (don't trust the kids with it yet). Then we all enjoy it. This is one of those pizza cutters I don't have to go across the slices more than once.

"I'm picky about shower heads as most don't make me feel as clean as some do. However with this one I found the perfect match for my shower. I didn't need a Plummer to help me install it. I simply took my old one off and replaced it with this new one. I jumped in the shower to try it out. I didn't notice any leaking just water coming out. I played with it and noticed it has SIX settings on it which include; Saturating Power Blast, Pulsating Massage, Gentle Rain, Water Saving, and 2 Mixed Modes.

This serum comes in a nice blue bottle. You will notice it also comes with a nice size dropper. I always smell things before I place them on my face.

"First I would like to state this is ONLY a game. It doesn't include the plush beanie babies. This only includes game pieces. However it's a really fun and educational game to play with children. It's ideal for age three and up. I love how it will help teach children colors, shapes and numbers. Pre-K and K Teachers would love this game for days when its raining outside and kids are having to play inside for the day. The game is very easy to put together and is about how you help Peanut the Elephant find his lost boo friends. You (the player) roll a die and go around the board collecting your character's shapes. The winner is the first person to collect all their character's shapes. It's simple but yet fun. When you are finished with the game it's easy to clean up and put away until next time.*Teaches colors, shapes, and numbers*Easy to set up*Easy to clean up*Ideal for kids age 3 - 6*Cute colorful game pieces*Educational*Great game for teachers to have on hand for rainy days at school when kids can't go outside and play*Great giftOverall; It's a fun and educational game.

"I wanted this drum set for kids for our music room. I try to keep toys in there as well as the real deal. I loved adding this drum set to the mix in the room. I put it together without much effort and fuss. I don't recall any instructions but usually I don't use those long as I have a picture to look and go by. Once I got it together my kids were ready to make some of their own music. It sounds fine. I like how it's not extremely loud. It's really not loud enough to bother me unlike the real drums in the room. It's a nice set for the price. You get a lot of piece which makes it look like a more expensive set. This would make a great gift for a child who loves music, wants to be like their favorite drummer like my kids or even one who you want to introduce music to. Think of the face of a child waking up to this drum set on Christmas morning. Priceless memories can be made with this drum set.I received this product at no charge in exchange of an honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R8BPTX3Y0PDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVA9KJ4#wasThisHelpful","R2R8BPTX3Y0PDL","A18MY9XGO51DYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18MY9XGO51DYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son is going to have a blast with this for Christmas. It only goes one speed, but that's totally fine. He loves cars and trucks that are remote control. I got to play with this one today. It was neat to see it in action. It's well designed and looks like a small version of the real car. I love that it has headlights and they actually work when you make the car go forward. Now this was a neat feature. You also have rear lights in this car like when you back up and the lights come on the same happens with this car. I was shocked to see this as I haven't seen it on other remote control cars we had owned in the past. The two colors are nicely put together and the rims are awesome and makes the car really stand out. The only thing I didn't like was how you recharge the car battery having to take off the bottom piece, but I guess it's also a safety feature for kids. I do however like that you can play a long time when you do recharge up your battery that is with the car.*Goes fast*Has a remote control*Nice car*Rechargeable batteries*Headlights and reverse lights - that WORK!con's:*The place where you recharge the batteryOverall this car would make a great Christmas or birthday gift for a child. It would be lots of fun. If you get two you may have to make sure they both aren't running on the same wave because then when you press one remote it will make both go or cancel out one car to make the other go.I received this product at no charge in exchange of an honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JY1GDO6CAJ2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQV9NCE#wasThisHelpful","R3JY1GDO6CAJ2Q","A18MY9XGO51DYR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A18MY9XGO51DYR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is made of silicone for baby food or really anything that you want to store. You can freeze these which is neat. My mom has to eat small amounts now after weight loss surgery so I was thinking this would be perfect for her. She can have like a nice freeze pop we homemade. She could even make small portions of homemade soups and out in here. It is just the right portion size for her to eat and not get sick having too much at once. It holds 7 different places of food and it's spill proof so I'm sure you could mix up what your doing. I love the color is orange and read that these do come in other colors. Which would be neat to do one for like breakfast, dinner, lunch and snacks. Well until she got where she could eat more or wanted different things.These are also great for making your own baby foods. Plus it makes it cheaper on you as a parent and more convenient.You can put these in your dishwasher or you can hand wash with soap and water. Easy to store but we use ours a lot! I don't store it unless it's in the freeze until next time.Would make a great baby shower gift or gift to a new mother.

"These bags are a great deal for the price. They don't rip even when I put magazines inside of. I was cleaning out my room this last week and used a good many of these bags never had a problem with them. I use them mostly in my bedroom trashcan and in my bathrooms. They work great in there.

"I'm so excited to replace my plastic one we have used for years. This one is made of stainless steel. It's super nice, big and can hold 5 quarts too. I can drain my pasta, noodles, veggies and even fruit. My noodles don't try and slip though these holes like with my plastic one. This even has two nice handles so you can hold on to it and not drop it. Then the bottom is made so you can sit it on a cabinet and it will stay in place because of how it's made with the design.

As such, if your loved one gets annoyed by the alarm, they just need to open and close the lid and go about their daily business -- and get no further reminders and will forget to take their dosage.There are better things out there, although at this price point it is okay IF you continue to set it up and monitor it.

"The TALKABOUT T480 is a small radio union  weighing in at 8 ounces, that receives the weather channels, FM radio and permits you to talk to other that have the same radio or compatibility. I only received one for review purposes thus I cannot evaluate the talk feature.In the box is the radio, a battery, charging cord, instructions and a wall holder. The unit weighs 8 ounces thus is a little heavy to constantly carry around although there is a belt clip. The instructions are printed in such small print that I needed a magnifying glass to be able to read parts of them. Once the battery was installed the unit went to work immediately broadcasting the weather reports locally. The sound is good and you can control he volume with the off-on switch.The radio is weather and water proof and that is a good feature. The wall hanger will permit you to hang on the wall for future use. There were no screws for attaching. There is a built in flashlight in the front with a switch on the side. Works well. There is an emergency call button on the side. You can use either the battery that came with the unit or you can use 3 AA batteries. The AA batteries would be good in the event the rechargeable battery went dead.Switching from one mode to another is easy and quick, just punch of a button. There are many additional features that you can use such as 20 different call tones and quiet talk. The unit is compatible with all FRS, GMRS Two Way Radios.The radio seems to be well built for rugged use. I did  find it a little annoying to carry on my belt for a long period of time due to its weight. I do not know hold long the rechargeable battery will hold a charge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TFK0LRAWLSEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W75BLTU#wasThisHelpful","R1TFK0LRAWLSEB","A2HMF8ZR67BNZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HMF8ZR67BNZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I obtained an advance copy of this book thru the Vine program. When I receive a book for review I always take a loo at the quality of the book , binding and print as I really dont like those 10 cent novel printed on newsprint. This book is a quality book with a great binding and pages lay flat each time you turn a page. The print, like many of todays books, is light and hard to read unless you have perfect eyesight and great lighting. I mention this but many  will probably obtain this book as they will have an interest in Civil War history and that vertically eliminates the younger generation who apparently seldom even pick up a  book let alone read one.Wen I got the book there is a section referred to as introduction and on page 11 there is an accusation that William Hickok was a murderous lawman---not my words but those of the author. William Hickok according to the info I have read was not the most law abiding person before he turned lawman and while there are at last half a dozen deaths attributed to Hickok, I think one should closely look at the circumstances, the number of deaths and the end results before labeling Hitch a murderous lawman. I managed to get myself beyond that printing and headed for the books chapters.The book is about 70 people after the Civil War and what each may have contributed  or not contributed after that aftermath. Many of the writings are about the good and even a touch of bad about each of these people; however there are individuals the writer does not find a lot of good to write about. Dont expect a full expos of each of these people, who are actually real, but rather just a few pages about them and some of their exploits.I once developed a college paper about Andrew Carnegie and Andrew was a chapter in the book, with a title Man O Steel. While Carnegie was shrewd business man he was also a ruthless employer that had little use for some, since as those such as those employees that once struck one of his steel mills. I found the sketch interesting but not even close to a full recording on Carnegie. Just brush up on history and add to what you read in this book.I found the book interesting and kept asking myself after each chapter, What is the rest of the story? You will no doubt find the book interesting, as I did, and want to do some more research yourself on each of the characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15XED3E058DR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426215622#wasThisHelpful","R15XED3E058DR9","A2HMF8ZR67BNZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HMF8ZR67BNZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right out of the box I felt I had a professional level hair trimmer just like the ones in the barbershops. The ergonomics are great making it easy to hold. There are three attachments that are for hair, beard and body hair. Each is easy to remove and insert. The first place I tried it was my side burns, with the pop up trimmer and I got a great even cut across the bottom of the sideburns. It takes about an hour to fully charge the trimmer which will them run about an hour on the full charge.You probably wont get the full benefits right out of the box as I found that it would take a learning curve to get the proper adjustments. The quick adjust dial will help you get that the desired length. It is waterproof, thus safe in the shower and thank goodness no cord hanging down while trimming before the morrow. You can use the cord is you had rather.There is a two year warranty and the unit runs on 100-240 volt power. This looks to be one of the best built trimmers I have ever owned. The unit is quit and comes with a storage/travel case to keep all the attachments in one place. Great trimmer which I really like.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R133KCCXYN5842/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TO54PAI#wasThisHelpful","R133KCCXYN5842","A2HMF8ZR67BNZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HMF8ZR67BNZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This small electric chain saw is the perfect addition to your saw cutting collection. It is easy to use and does a great job. There is very little assembly right out of the box. Just attached the saw blade, make some quick adjustments and add the chain oil (which does not come with the package). When cutting be sure and use a heavy duty electric cord as a light weight cord may over heat.The saw has a 16 inch blade and come with a  low kickback design. The motor is plenty strong for small jobs. The tool free tensioning for the chair works great and is very easy to use. The automatic oilier works great and there is an oil level that will show you how much chain oil is remaining in the reservoir.This is am impressive small electric chain saw that should provide years of service is really great form the small clean ups around the yard.

"This piece of equipment looks and feels really heavy duty. The brochure states that it is engineered for a broad range of grinding, cutting and deburring applications, the 4.5"" 900 Watt WP9-115 Quick compact angle grinder features a smaller, ergonomically designed body with integrated non-locking paddle switch for increased safety and more comfort, the quickest wheel change system available, and a tool-free quick-positioning guard that allows for fast change-over from grinding to cutting. The powerful Long Life 8.5 Amp, AC/DC, 10,500 rpm motor includes advanced designs to optimize air flow for cooler operation and extend longevity in harsh environments. The S-Automatic Safety Slip Clutch helps to prevent kick back if a disc or wheel should jam.I find the handling of this grinder to be excellent although it is quite heavy. I was all excited when I got a chance to test and review this item and could not wait to open the box. To my disappointment the unit comes with no accessories, not even a  single cutting wheel. At first I though that was a mistake however after reading the box label I found that no additional items , including cutting wheels, were in the box. Thus I can only write about what the company states and cannot provide the readers an actual test report since I have no cutting wheels. I just checked at one of the large hardware stores and they do not have cutting wheels either. I did locate then on the internet however it will takes several days for the wheels to be shipped and arrive. I am giving the unit five stars because the construction looks great, the feel of the grinder is very good and when I turn the motor on it is one powerful ""dude"". I like it just will have to wait for some cutting experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC23IMVX7V2QI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJOWTKE#wasThisHelpful","RC23IMVX7V2QI","A2HMF8ZR67BNZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HMF8ZR67BNZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The stapler looks nice in its pretty colors but works like a very cheap stapler. The handle is hard to push an forget about a couple of sheets to be stapled as it does not do that good a job. Staple many sheets and it works fine.

The lubrication formula helps penetrate the surface thus keeping the eyes moist for hours. I found that I get a better price at the local big box store than on the internet. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PJ7E7HZRORGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NN1XP0#wasThisHelpful","R2PJ7E7HZRORGT","A2HMF8ZR67BNZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HMF8ZR67BNZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have been looking for these for a long time, after we noticed several hamburger restaurants were using this size to serve their hamburgers on. Just wasn't available in the local stores, then we saw them listed on Amazon and at a price that was most reasonable. The aluminum is very heavy and these pans are well constructed and should last a long time. We have learned the hard way on some of our pans and know now that a hot pan will warp if you put the hot pan in cold water. That won't happen to these. We can cook a small can of biscuits (5) in one of the small pans and it works out great. There are also those five cinnamon rolls to a can and they too work great. The pans have given us good looking biscuits that cook evenly in the pan and all five look identical with no hot spots. Also since there are just tow of us we can cook a small amount of french fries in these pans. Great purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ODLJ63YD9VOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RYPHRK#wasThisHelpful","R1ODLJ63YD9VOB","A2HMF8ZR67BNZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HMF8ZR67BNZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My spouse says this is a fantastic hair dryer. It has 1875 watts, is translucent and looks great. It works really well with a true cold shot button along with three heat levels and two speeds. Easy to work and all the controls are clearly marker and visible. There is a concentrator attachment which with my spouses short hair she does not use. This is one powerful hair drier.The carton says it has been designed with salon performance and that I believe that is true. You will get 50% faster drying, and according to CONAIR up to 3X longer life. The hairdryer has a limited four year warranty.Ceramic technology helps to protect hair from heat damage while ionic technology gives you smooth, shiny hair with up to 75% less frizz.

"This is a super nice electric grill that I can use indoors or outdoors. Dont look for assembly instructions, as there were none in my box, however it is easy to construct and all you need is a Phillips screwdriver to fasten the handle on the top. It takes about fifth teen minute to assemble the grill and the stand. This is the perfect size outdoor grill for those that have a small amount of space and want to grill outside like on a patio plus you dont have to worry with that heavy can of propane or charcoal.I do find that the top part of the grill is heavy and causes the grill not to be all that steady. That should not be a problem unless you have very small kids around and I would then be a little concerned about them tipping the grill over. The grill it self is ceramic coated and that is great for cooking hamburgers. You can place more than a dozen burger patties on the grill. The burger patties will come out will grill marks just like the big grills and the non-stick surface will not end up having tid bits of meat that stuck to the grill.  The grill does not heat from the top and bottom, only the bottom, thus you will more than likely have to turn your patties at least once. Hot dogs are a breeze to cook.  By the way there are no cooking instructions such as time, etc. in the small booklet that comes with the grill.The grill gets its power from a single wire hook up that goes directly into the grill. The cord is well made and easy to remove for storage. By the way, outside storage is not recommend in the booklet that came with the grill. I like the fact I can remove the grill from the stand and use it indoors. Finding a place for permanent storage though may be an issue and it will probably not go into the post and pans section of your cabinets. I have a special four shelf shelving that I have just outside the kitchen door so that all appliances as large as this one can be stored and easily accessed.I would never use any utensil that could scrape the surface of the grill thus when washing you should be careful. The grill top is made into the overall unit and thus is not removable for washing. I used a wet sponge for cleaning and it worked really well. I think it would have been better to have manufactured a removable cook top. I have  a small George Foreman grill for making sandwiches and waffles and those cooking surfaces are removable. Due to the ceramic surface clean up I found to be rather easy. There is a drip tray to catch excess juices and it is removable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13URPLY21MZJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUXO#wasThisHelpful","R13URPLY21MZJV","A2HMF8ZR67BNZS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HMF8ZR67BNZS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a VINE product which stated 8 packages. I received one package which was delivered by the US Post Office and left in my mail box on a Sunday according to the Sunday delivery label. . We had no reason to check the mail box on a Sunday thus the mail was not checked until Monday morning. The temperate here in Dallas was at 100 plus degrees and the box was beginning to swell from the heat.I opened the box and heated the contents however after one bite I could not eat anymore. I noted on the box there were no preservatives and this was an organic product. The box is paper with an aluminum lining. The soup did not taste good and I was afraid to try to eat any more. The liquid has noodles, small pieces of chicken and other vegetables.I now have a lingering after taste in my mouth. I think the box had sat in the heat too long. I destroyed the rest. I would definitely not purchase this product. This product falls short of Campbells quality products.

I have purchased two different size bottle, one was 20 oz and the other is 16 oz. This is really great dressing. Suggest you cut your salad or use a pre-cut package and then mix the salad dressing in a large bowl juts like they do at Olive Garden. I think it spreads better than adding to a single salad dish.

"I am a casual table tennis player and was a tennis player on a tennis team when in college. Therefore I am far from being a great player but nevertheless love to play an occasional game of table tennis or ping-pong. All the paddles in my past have been those which I have purchased at a discount sporting goods tore and never once did I pay anywhere close to the price of this excellent tennis paddle.The first think I noticed was the weight which was great and the paddle seemed to ant to balance itself regardless of how poorly I held the paddle. The paddle coating lets one pout a tremendous amount of spin on the ball and the speed, while not being at the top range of Stigmas paddle, its nevertheless excellent.I am amazed at all the various layer used to construct this paddle. My first paddle as I recall had a plywood middle board and covered with sandpaper and alter rubber or sponge. This one is many years advanced and I intend to take care of it by never leaving out on the porch on top of the table.I love this tennis paddle. The handle grip is outstanding.

"These are not your normal paper towels. They are water activated which means you get some soap in the towels when you wet them This is great fro cleaning surfaces.

"I already have two Fellows shredders however I needed one additional for the second floor so we could stop running back and forth. This shredder will easily shred 12 sheets at one time. I have never tried to use more than the recommended number of sheets maximum. The motor is about average for quietness. The blades seem to be extremely sharp and that should be expected with a new shredder. I have always used a shredder blade oil in my shredders and will do so with this one.The micro cut is perfect for a complete destruction of the papers I am shredding. Much better than some of my previously owned shredders. There is an auto/stop on the machines and a manual reverse function plus if it should get too hot from shredding there is a light indicator. Casters on the bottom make it easy to move around ones desk and the five-gallon wastebasket will hold a lot of shredded paper before it needs emptying. According to the paperwork with the shredder that wastebasket will hold about 450 shredded sheets. I am no where near that capacity right now.There is a  one year manufacture warranty which seems to be about standard for the industry. Paper shredders are really a consumable product around my office and house as we go through one very few years and have to replace it. Never have used a warranty for replacement and dont expect to do so on this one.A note about the price. You an buy really cheap one at an office supply store, however we think you  get what you pay for and they sometimes dont last very long.

"This cover for stackable chairs is in my opinion an excellent product. It is well constructed, made of heavy polyester materials and fits more than just four stackable chairs. I have just used it to product a lounge chair and ottoman from the rain and sun and it was a perfect fit. It also covers four stackable chairs the same way. The materials is very heavy so dont worry about it leaving the chairs during heavy winds and the thickness of the materials will protect your chairs against even the heaviest rain downpours which we have recently encountered.The cover measures 36 X 25 X 47 inches and for my chairs was perfect fit. There are toes that can also be used to hold the cover in  place. The materials are woven polyester fabric laminated with polyvinyl chloride backing.The base has a protective splashguard to help with heavy rains and the interlocking seams add strength and durability to the cover. This is a quality product that greatly exceeds the attributes of the cover I am replacing. I may have to purchase another for the other lounge chair plus a second one or the love seat.

"I will start, since this is a new release as I write, by saying that I did not order or expect a HC edition, so I don't have the complaint the others here (so far) have with this. I will say that I miss the inspired artwork of the first few volumes of this series: the lush, art-nouveau look that made the reintroduction of the character so vivid and memorable. That out of the way, I highly recommend this to anyone following the series and do so otherwise unreservedly.The stories here are genuinely involving and Kate Kane may well have the most interesting and complex private life of any current SH character. I would welcome an episode or two that just focus on that, frankly. Even so, the action here is terrific, and if the artwork is now more conventional, so it goes. The writing and plotting are first-rate and I am impressed with the way the stories develop and expand, both tying up previous strand and introducing new ones.If you are new to the character, or have not followed the series to this point, this is not the place to start.

"I cannot really express how much I enjoyed this. It is an absolute hoot. You can get the product details above, but in short, this is simply, flat-out fun. For kicks:All of the villains have wonderful names like Lord Death Man and Professor Gorilla.All of the villains look like Clark Gable at various stages of his life. All the scientists (and there are plenty) have large foreheads and fluffy white hair. And mustaches, of course. And lab coats. You can't be a scientist without a lab coat.Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson are always, always immaculately dressed. Dick has what appears to be a pompadour.The stories are all ""science""-based, with some great ray guns, rather like Doofenschmirtz' -Inators. The pulp content is off the charts.Batman has a number of cool vehicles, including something that looks like a Plan-9-style space ship (with retractable grasping arms, naturally).Clearly, Japanese kids in the mid-60s understood, and accepted, evolution.The artwork is astonishingly clean and tight. Not to insult, but it is like the guy who drew Nancy (name not recalled off the top of my head) did the ink here.There is evident glee on every page, and not the Dark Night is not even a glimmer in anyone's eyes. This is pure corn and pure delight. Safe for young 'uns except for, as noted in an earlier review, a couple of ""dammits"" from hard-boiled cops and henchmen.

"I liked Vol 1 of Bedlam quite a lot and am pleasantly surprised and happy to say that I like Vol 2 even more. The story is genuinely gripping and the continued unfolding of the over-arching themes and story lines is intriguing. The series seems to be coming into its own. I honestly don't know what's coming next, or how things will play out. The characters continue to grow and become increasingly 3D and, a great step forward as far as I'm concerned, the art work tones down the gore. The jittery lines and jagged edges are still there, but the blood and meaty bits are dialed down. This lends the art a feel more sinister, atmospheric and less grind-house exploitation, which was one of the few blemishes on Vol 1. I am sincerely looking forward to Vol. 3","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZU9V799TKE39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160706846X#wasThisHelpful","RZU9V799TKE39","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wrote my original review in haste and sold this terrific book rather short (though not the 5-star rating). So I'm amending below the original, short one.Thankfully, I live in one of those cities that still has a handful of good, and a couple of great, delis left. Because it only took me about 20 pages to be overcome by the physical need (NEED, I say) for pastrami. Real pastrami.This book will do it to you. Goodness, how I love it.NEW:All of that still stands, but this is really a lot more than just an ode to delis. It is also a wonderful history of delicatessens and their place in both Jewish and the larger culture. Sax makes some very serious and real connections between the state of the deli and it place in Jewish life and culture. As a goyem, I can only comment from outside, but having cooked at Fox Deli in Indianapolis for several years in the early 1980s, I was privileged to see the place of a great deli )okay, pretty good) deli in a neighborhood and a community. I learned a lot and picked up some great jokes, too. One of the things I learned was an ongoing and continuing love of kosher and kosher-style deli foods. (Here in Chicago, Manny's is what I imagine heaven is imagined to be for people who believe in heaven.)But I also became aware of how a deli can be a meeting place, unofficial cultural center and melting pot. Sax takes that and turns it into a tribute and elegy here. So while just looking at the cover does make me hungry, there is a lot more here than a travelogue and dining guide. Very much recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F2PSF0VNKZNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547386443#wasThisHelpful","R1F2PSF0VNKZNF","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the seemingly ever-growing horror-mystery genre, this is a good one in the Silence of the Lambsish sub-genre. The premise is intriguing and the characters develop nicely over the course of this first collected volume. Not as gripping as, say, Bedlam, but not far from it.Only complaint is the rather ham-fisted imagery that routinely pops up in the transitions. After the first grisly murder scene cut to a close up of a ridiculously blood steak on someone's plate, that sort of thing gets a little old. Those of us over 14 get it.Small quibble, though, and overall an entertaining introduction that certainly creates anticipation for Vol. 2. Looking forward to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27QDTL9ZSDS33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=163215112X#wasThisHelpful","R27QDTL9ZSDS33","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful reboot, a fascinating origin story, and an admirably original new hero. Others here has done a nice job of thumbnailing the story, so I will only add that as an old guy, who had been away from comics for a long time before slowly climbing back into them over the past couple of years, I found this remarkably touching.There is a warmth and joy here that is missing from much, if not most, of the superhero genre. The artwork works in concert with the text and dialog to form an organic whole that is uplifting, as well as engaging and entertaining. It's obvious to the point of cliche that there is still a dearth of interesting female comic character, but Ms. Marvel, as well as the recent reboot of Captain Marvel, is showing that this need not continue to be the case. Long may this young girl grow and bloom.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFM9DYMX80RWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078519021X#wasThisHelpful","RFM9DYMX80RWA","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An interesting and mostly successful one-shot merging of Batman and A Christmas Carol.The art is lush and gorgeous. There is definitely a feel of an old Victorian Christmas card feel here, with some Victorian Gothic mixed in. A few of the interiors come dangerously close to Thomas Kincade territory, but manage not to fall over that cliff. All in all, lovely and lovingly-drawn and inked book. Todd Klein's lettering is outstanding, adding atmosphere while still being clear and readable.The story is, as a whole, surprisingly effective as an attempt to address the often overly grim Dark Knight mood. This doesn't bother following a specific continuity, but as a one-shot, that's no big deal, and probably a strength. It gives the story more of a individual feel that let's it exist on it's own plane. My only quibble, but it is the reason for docking a star from ""love it"" to ""like it"", is that in establishing the need for BM's enlightenment, Bermejo pulls him a little too far into the amoral vigilante role. Endangering the innocent child, as it plays out, is just a step or two too far. This doesn't bother me to the extent it seems to bother some other reviewers, but perhaps I take my comics and superheroes slightly less seriously.Still, as a whole, this is an engrossing and interesting take and with a new holiday season coming up, this is nice volume to find under one's tree or next to one's menorah.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T7Q4AOL2Z0ZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401232132#wasThisHelpful","R1T7Q4AOL2Z0ZC","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not a full-scale biography of this often-forgotten baseball great, but rather this is a vivid and fascinating thumbnail that illuminates his place in his times and cultural background. While hardly the first Jewish player in the major leagues, Greenberg was the first Jewish STAR in the major leagues, and as such, found himself in a unique and often uncomfortable place as both a very visible target for anti-Semites, and a repository of Jewish pride and ambition.Greenberg, by nature a modest and good-natured man, as well as a non-practicing Jew, faced this dual challenge with a shockingly admirable combination of grace and good humor, only on rare occasions showing any outward stress or anger. In fact, the portrait here is that of a gentle, if fiercely competitive man, reluctantly accepting the mantle of ""credit to his race"" by simply being a good man who worked hard at his craft.Kurlansky, who is of course the author of a great number of wonderfully readable books on a number of interesting topics, does a good job of showing how and why Greenberg was so important to so many people in his particular place and time. Highly recommended for baseball and cultural history readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R104AJPY7LGS8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300192460#wasThisHelpful","R104AJPY7LGS8M","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love reference books. They are the best for nightstand and bathroom reading. A good, solid reference on a subject you are interested in a wise investment in time and money.This new edition of a long-time classic is, as the past editions have been, a sheet delight. Like the old potato chip commercial put it, you can't eat just one entry. You will find yourself staying up later than you intended (or taking a lot longer to get ready for the day, etc.), but pfft. Who cares when a writer like Thomson is keeping you reading? He has not lost any of his edge, strong opinion, or ability to make you laugh out loud. If you agree with his take, you nod your head at his wit and incisive writing. If you disagree with him, all the better. It's still enlightening and more often than not, a hoot.

"Nama here provides a great service to comics and pop culture fans with this thoughtful and concise look at black superheroes in mainstream comics publishing. Focusing almost exclusively on Marvel and DC heroes, he looks at not simply how those characters were portrayed and their evolutions (where such occurred), but also, and more importantly, how they reflected their times and how they were often perceived by readers, in particular black readers. He also follows those characters (where such did so) into television and movie representations.While he may miss a character here and there, this is pleasantly inclusive and, frankly, introduced me to a few characters I was previously unaware of, and his comments and conclusions are generally well laid out. There are a few awkward turns of phrase here and there, but overall this is well-written and the academic jargon is at a minimum. The book is quite accessible to the average interested reader. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7V0K6KRCJJI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0292726740#wasThisHelpful","R7V0K6KRCJJI6","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My girls are both ostensibly beyond the age-range for Peppa and her family, but them so I am. This doesn't matter. Peppa Pig is so charming, so delightful warm and breezy that it is hard for me to imagine much of anybody at any age not being won over after a couple of episodes. The secret, to me, is that gentle and friendly as they are, they are completely devoid of mawkishness and sugary sentiment.The humor is often sly, though never of the this-is-for-the-grown-ups-and-the-kids-won't-get-it variety. If you spend any time around little kids, you know good and well that there is a lot of overlapping sense of humor and Peppa does a nice job of this while never coming within miles of snark, sarcasm or mean spirit. Peppa and her family are, quite simply, wonderful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23GRL4TYU1ICF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FWVXRLG#wasThisHelpful","R23GRL4TYU1ICF","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just finished the final three volumes in this series this weekend and these stars apply not only to this volume, but to the entire series. This is, however, a wonderful finish and may well be the best of the lot.While all six volumes can stand alone, they are all loosely interconnected and part of the same seedy underbelly of the same series. This one stands out, not only for its magnificent James Cain-like story, but also because of the introduction of some visual counterpoints to the usual (greatly atmospheric), claustrophobic permanent twilight artwork. The flashback interludes are both textually and stylistically funny in a darkly ironic way.All in all, count this as a recommendation for the whole series, if you like. This is top-flight graphic storytelling and taken individually or together, a masterpiece of modern noir.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROTHJK1IDCSB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785158294#wasThisHelpful","ROTHJK1IDCSB0","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Have not yet seen the movie, but confess that trailers for it are what made me aware of this. I like it, but cannot say that I love it. It certainly has a fascinating premise, but this is a case of the pace being a little too fast for its own good. The characters have promise, but none are developed very far and the transitions are, in places, so abrupt that a couple of time I thought I must have turned to pages at once and skipped one only to turn back and, no, it just shot ahead.I am curious, and liked this enough, that I want to check out Vol.2 once it hits TP. I think there is great potential here, but as it is, much as I like many elements here, I am slightly less than satisfied and hope that Vol. 2 will fill in some back-story and / or flesh out some characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P5J8NU5DQUE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782761438#wasThisHelpful","R2P5J8NU5DQUE9","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess I'll split the difference here, star-wise. I really wanted to like this and have liked Azzarello on other books, but this just didn't do it for me. Some pretty interesting side characters are treated pretty shabbily here (not so much in the sense of how the Joker treats them, but rather how the author does). The book looks good as a whole and Mr. J is pretty effectively creepy throughout, but the story seems overly bombastic and off-track to me.I get the concept, and have no issue with that, and, in fact, really like the idea of this being told from the viewpoint of a henchman. Just not the execution.

"Pure and simple, this is a really fun comic series and story arc. The humor is genuinely funny, the action big and dumb and fun, and the interplay between Herc and Amadeus Cho is witty and touching.

"Like others have stated here, there is, as a whole, so little on the Walker Brothers available, that even as I write this I am quibbling with myself over adding the fifth star. There is a whole lot to like here - I'm just not quite able to love. Anti-kudos first:Though it settles down over the course of the book, Reynold's writing style over the first few chapters borders on annoying at times, with what occasionally feel like pretentious flights of verbal fancy that fall short of their presumed target. As Nigel Tufnel once said, ""There's a fine line between clever and stupid"". Reynolds come close to that line a time or two too often in the early going.The other annoyance in the early going is the excessive quotation of Kim Fowley, a dubious source at best and once with no real connection to the band that I could discern beyond ""he was around."" His quotes are wise-ass, dismissive, and seemingly beside any point that I could see.Okay - now, then. This is also a very interesting and fairly deep look into the career and work of the Walkers, together and apart, up through the recording and release of Nite Flights, their final work together. While their solo work in this period is covered with equal depth, it ends there and makes only very passing references to Scott's pretty significant work thereafter. That's okay. That's not in scope, but for readers interested in his later solo work, we will want to look elsewhere.Not really a biography (the members' personal lives are treated very superficially), this is a very good dive into the songs, records, performances and recording. It sheds a great deal of light into the circumstances around the records and how, when and why they got made. For those of us who are Yanks, it is eye-opening to see just how massive their success in England really was. Here in the US, they were a British group that had a couple of big hits. In the UK they were major stars with a popularity that rivaled, and for a brief time, surpassed that of the Beatles.In all, this is a valuable book to have on the Walkers and I am certainly glad to have it. I do certainly recommend it. I just don't quite love it.Side note, for those so inclined: This is a beautifully put together book. The soft covers are high quality stock, brushed and handsome. The pages themselves are heavy stock and, though it doesn't say, I suspect they are acid-free as well. The saddle-stitching is first rate, using actual cloth thread. Compared to US mass market trade paperbacks, this is like a cathedral. I wish there were more photos (especially since several are referenced in the text, but do not appear in the book), but those here are quality reproduction with solid printing. Maybe I love this after all...","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KE8W8AY0E45F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906002258#wasThisHelpful","R2KE8W8AY0E45F","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ed Brubaker has become one of my favorite comics authors in the past year or so and while I am steadily going through his back catalog, I am delighted to have picked up this new TP and get in at the beginning of the arc. This is first rate spy / espionage stuff and Brubaker, while perfectly wonderful with the superheros, really excels with crime and mystery. The canvas here is wider than, say, Criminal, but EB seems right at home. The story moves along at a rapid clip, the character of Velvet is engaging and the plot, while labyrinthine, is manageable. And very entertaining.The art, as a whole, is very strong and creates a nice, dead-of-night / sinister shadows mood for the dead-of-night / sinister doings. My only complaint, and a small one, is that some of the secondary characters are hard to distinguish visually. Of course, the fact that are all spies and therefore all trying to blend into the passing scenery sort of asks for that, but still, from page to page it can be disorienting as the story shifts in time and location, but all the spies look like the same guy.Not to nit pick, though.

"Great fun, for those of us old enough to have been around during these years especially. Was introduced to Kiss by a slightly older buddy around the time of Hotter Than Hell, and for a couple of years they were like a secret treasure. My first concert was Uriah Heep and Kiss in August of 1974. Pretty amazing for a 13 year old.Almost gave it five starts, but can't quite because of thinking about how much more fun this would have been if not an ""authorized"" book with Gene and Paul listed as co-authors. As it is, Peter and Ace both pretty much disappear around page 200 and only have brief quotes very here and there after that. And despite the appearance of candor, knowing how Simmons protects the brand, one has to simply imagine what got edited, cut, or left out altogether. Such is life. For Kiss fans from way back (and maybe others looking for a glimpse into the early days), this is still great, good fun: entertaining and a very quick read.

"I confess, I was surprised to the point of near shock by how much I enjoyed this. As an offshoot of the WWH main story line, this is really an Amadeus Cho story more than either the Hulk or Hercules. As such, there is a lot more plot, character development, pathos and humor than in a sadly typical ""Hulk Smash"" story, which most of the other offshoots I've read are. As a result, this is much more in line with the feel of the WWH story in general. As a result, I am now looking forward to checking out the post-WWH Incredible Herc story arcs. Cho is a fun and very interesting character and it's nice to see a ""hero"" who glorifies intelligence and thinking.Seems to be out of print, but currently there are a number of reasonably priced new and used copies available here, and quite possibly your local comic shop, as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YEIDDO0SY265/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078512991X#wasThisHelpful","R2YEIDDO0SY265","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have never used Elixir strings before, but likely will again. I like these quite a lot, actually. Cannot say yet, as others have here, that they are longer lasting than other strings - I simply haven't had them (and therefore haven't been playing them) long enough, but as someone who rarely changes strings unless they break or otherwise wear down, that would be a plus for me.I can say, though, that I like the tone and range on these, particularly the shimmering, clear highs. They give an overall very full sound that is welcome to someone like myself, who tends to play solo and likes a full-bodied sound underneath the vocal. They are also quite easy on the finger tips. Only complaint (for the moment) is that the feel is a touch waxy to me and, honestly, I like to hear finger slide, and these cut back on that some. I realize that for many this will be a good thing.Overall, so far, so very good.

"I loved Harlan Ellison when I was a kid and I genuinely appreciate that he brought a sense of wonder along with a jaundiced eye to my literary development. Some of his stories still rank among my personal favorites. Somewhere in my mid-20's I stopped reading him and moved along to other writers, other topics, other things.A couple of years ago I picked him up again to see what I thought 30 years later. Some good stuff here and there, but frankly, I found much of his work (including some that I loved back when) to be simplistic, kind of petulant, occasionally pretentious, and just not what I wanted to read anymore.Still, I picked up 7 Against Chaos. This is not particularly petulant or pretentious, but it is a mess. And not a particularly interesting one. The characters are lucky if they get two dimensions, the story is disjointed space opera, the artwork stagey and wooden. Lot's of 1950's sounding techno-gobbledygook-gook.Two stars because I just don't like it. Not enough here to make me hate it. Don't get me wrong on this point: I love graphic novels and comics. The format here is not the problem. I would hazard a guess that if the author of this were not ""Harlan Ellison"", DC would not have published it and it would have been another of HE's seemingly endless line of Edgeworks publications.While reading it, I developed a couple of alternate theories to go along with its alternate history:1. Artist Paul Chadwick sent Ellison the finished art and Ellison put in the text and ""dialog"" after the fact, trying to find a story to hang explain the pictures.2. Ellison decided to write a retro ""gee whiz"" space adventure and and wanted to finish before he went to bed that night.3. Ellison decided to write a parody of a ""gee-whiz"" space adventure, but lost interest after signing the contract, so had to furnish SOMETHING.4. Ellison wrote a synopsis of a ""gee-whiz"" space adventure and the artist mistook it for the full script, shrugged and made do.In any case, I found this dull, tiresome and, worst, coming from Ellison, uninteresting. Really, this isn't very good.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROI0KBRFG4X3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401239102#wasThisHelpful","ROI0KBRFG4X3F","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What we have here is an impressionistic snapshot of what rock 'n' roll is, can be and could be.Marcus' look at rock 'n' roll (not ""rock"") is, par for his course, thoughtful, thought-provoking, a teeny bit pretentious here and there, learned, intellectual and witty all over the place. Marcus chooses songs that, for him, express what rock 'n' roll is, and what it means, and uses them as a launching pad to look at how the music and has changed and how it has changed us; how it expresses and reflects the desires, fears, excesses, joys and howls of the women and men who made it, as well as those of us who listen to it and, it a real extent, live it.But this is not a ponderous book, by any means. We ponder, sure - the book is liable to prompt many self-reflections and barroom arguments among those of us who love and feel this music (that it's NOT for everybody is a given) - but it is in many ways a light and breezy read, even when it is discussing some (pardon the word) heavy stuff. While bits and pieces of this will be obscure to some of us (I was unfamiliar with a couple of folks referenced and will be hunting them up 'cause they sound interesting), the songs themselves are songs that most all rock 'n' roll people will have at least a nodding familiarity with. Some of the versions of these, not always so much, but then that gives me something to go hunt up and listen to. (As Marcus points out, thanks to youtube, virtually everything he references is readily available, if not necessarily in the the finest of formats for listening.)The one exception here is ""Guitar Drag"", which I had never heard of. It is the recording / soundtrack for an art piece / experiment that Marcus describes in detail, along with comments from the artist and Marcus' placement of the piece in much broader social, and artistic, context. I cannot say that I am in any great hurry to go hear it, but I AM glad that I know of it and read Marcus' essay on it.I am also glad to have read the rest of these essays. Which is, for me, really what they are: a mosaic of interconnected essays creating a larger image. Not all of it works for me (for example, I think the Beatles' Motown covers were almost all horrible - not a major point overall, but of interest to one of the essays here), but it DOES all make me think about this music I love very, very much, and that is a gift. (As is the Etta James - Beyonce chapter, which in a select three paragraphs within it says everything I think about modern pop vocal styling [and more].)Not for everyone, but then rock 'n' roll never claimed, or wanted, to be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26L0XAN8RO8KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300187378#wasThisHelpful","R26L0XAN8RO8KZ","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Captain Marvel is becoming a must-read for me. In Carol Danvers, Marvel (in both senses) has created a vibrant, interesting character. DeConnick is doing a bang-up job making her complex and relatable, while remaining heroic. The Avengers story here is big, splashy fun, with Thor and Spider Woman playing the major supporting roles. Lots of action and lots of humor.But the biggest treat here is the inclusion of Captain Marvel 17, which features a good enough dollop of action, but is instead a smaller, more intimate story that shows off DeConnick's deft touch with characterization.

"I have been reading about polar explorations for over 20 years now and come to this very well versed in Shackleton and the Endurance expedition. I'm not sure what I expected from this, but I am increasingly enamored of :01 as a publishing house and thought that, at the least, this would be fun. (I have not yet read Bertozzi's previous book on the Lewis and Clark expedition.)I confess to being amazed here. Not so much by the art work, though the minimalist b&w suits the story very well, nor so much by the breadth and scope - this is very to the point; there is very little background or biography of any of the principals, including Sir Ernest. No, what amazes me is Bertozzi's ability to humanize the expedition, to turn these historical figures into people, and to do so with the simplest of touches.Rather than spend a great deal of space and ink on the ""heroic"" nature of the ordeal, he focuses on the personal and the mundane. Rather than paint in larger than life strokes, he presents us with a series of miniatures that illuminate these men and what their lives on the ice were like. Example: rather than provide a ""tour"" of the Endurance and provide ""specs"", Bertozzi uses an escaped sled dog's romp through the under-decks and a cutaway of the ship. We get the same information and sense of scale, but in a novel way that lets us relate to these men AS men. In this case, annoyed men trying to corral a runaway dog. It is touches like this that make this thin graphic work a valuable addition to polar literature.These touches do not in any way diminish the ordeal that Shackleton and his men went through. On the contrary, it rather ennobles them. They quickly become real to us. Not is a particular, biographical way, but in a personal-in-the-universal way. I am really very impressed with the achievement here.Certainly, anyone looking for the depth, details and inner workings of the expedition will find this wanting and will be better served by something like Huntford's terrific biography of Shackleton, or one of the many  available volumes recounting the plight of the Endurance and its crew. But this is a fine and true portrait that deserves attention not just from graphic fans, but anyone interested in the universal, human story as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R226BNO7IYHSLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596434511#wasThisHelpful","R226BNO7IYHSLQ","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like a lot of people, I am really looking forward to a day when we can stop referring to important parts of American history as ""Black"" history and simply recognize that it is all ""American"" history. And while I'm not holding my breath, I hope that day is soon so that a book as wonderful as The Harlem Hellfighters will be read by a wide and all-inclusive audience. The book is wonderful fictionalization of an important event and people that is generally relegated to an afterthought or footnote. In that sense alone, this is an important work.That being said, and out of the way, it is also a terrific work of historical fiction where the words and pictures work together to create a seamless and moving whole.I have never previously read any of Brooks' work, though it has been recommended to my from time to time, but if this is any indication, I will likely be reading more in the future. This story is well-paced, involving - wrenching in many places - and his main characters live and breathe and never fall into  stock ciphers or cardboard cutouts.Which is also a reflection of the art here. The action sequences are suitably chaotic without ever becoming confusing, and the quieter moments are illuminating, as well. The details are telling and apt (a well-placed wink plays an important part in a character's development, for example) and the grim mood never becomes morose or bathetic.I am very glad that I read a review of this (in a different forum) that pointed me to this worthy book. I hope that this review, as well as the other fine and more detailed reviews here, pique others to pick this up and be transported into an important chapter of American history. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PR1LWRU9UT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307464970#wasThisHelpful","R23PR1LWRU9UT2","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not a lot to add to the other reviews here except to say that I really enjoyed the focus on the Gordons in this terrific story arc. The increased gore level, normally not at all my cup of tea, didn't bother me so much since it was couched in a very human story that allowed the Commissioner and Barb to have some significant story time. The continued growth of Dick as BM is fun to read, too.The stylized art helped keep it from feeling exploitive, as well.

"Maybe this would have made a better novella or short story, but this is the first time I've been disappointed with a Shirley Jackson novel.This feels like an early, dry run for my personal, hands-down, Jackson favorite, We Have Always Lived In the Castle: fading aristocratic family slowly goes mad in isolated mansion while the locals gawk and scratch their heads. Unfortunately, this is missing all of WHALC's incredible satire, dry wit and absurdist lunacy which, added to the genuinely creepy sense of foreboding, creates such a powerful, wrenching reading experience.Instead, here, we have a sort-of Importance of Being Ernest in a (very) private lunatic asylum.Basically we have an insulated group of crazy people wittily insulting one another while waiting for the world to end. And part of the problem is that they start off crazy and simply stay that way. The characters are all cardboard cutouts and they spend the length of the novel hurling dialog at each other that starts off wittily enough but after 20 or 30 pages begins to feel like Monty Python's Oscar Wilde sketch. That no one is particularly sympathetic is not really a problem - a lot of good novels have characters with few, if any, redeeming characters. The problem is that these characters have no depth to them.And then they go on and on for a couple of hundred pages.This is, of course, readable, because even mediocre Jackson is well written.Again, this might well have worked as a short story or novella. It might have worked if the characters were fleshed out beyond the placards they carry around (Hi. I'm the Rogue / Hi. I'm the spoiled, self-centered gold-digger, etc.). It might have worked if we were able to see these characters slowly (or even quickly) go mad. But instead they start that way and never develop over 200+ pages in which little happens except for the dulling of the witty dialog.If you are new to the magnificence that is Shirley Jackson's writing, this is not the place to start. This is for Jackson completists, after you've read all the great stuff.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROLJWQPM0LBLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143107062#wasThisHelpful","ROLJWQPM0LBLL","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this new, rebooted All Star Western series. Bringing Jonah Hex to 1870s-era Gotham was a great idea and as the series unfolds, they are keeping it interesting and entertaining. The Hex - Arkham pairing was great fun, and Hex as fish-out-of-water in the ""big city"" presents a lot a fodder for its continued success. I recommend you start with Vol. 1, if you are new to this, but if you have already enjoyed 1 & 2 and want to see about 3, then here you go: You'll want this one, too.Docked 1/2 start for the absurdly silly-assed costumes all of the female characters are put into.

"As a kid and younger man, I always had a major gripe with the Who: namely Roger Daltry, who I found one of the most annoying singers of all time. Heck, he wasn't even the SECOND best singer in the Who.On the other hand, I've loved Wilko Johnson from the moment I laid ears on him.Therefore, I was a little hesitant to pick this up, especially as this is almost exclusively Wilko / Feelgood covers. I already have these songs in great versions. But I listened to a couple of tracks online and, well, here I am.Either I've mellowed on him, Daltry has gotten a lot better, or some combination, but he does a great service to these songs. Part of it is the naturally aging of his voice. It is tougher and yet more expressive here than in the old days, and is very well suited to the greatest-bar-band-around vibe here.Of course, Wilko Johnson has a lifetime of being in greatest-bar-bands-around, so he is right at home. So is the rest of the group here backing up these two old pros.And while it is true that I, and maybe you, already have great versions of these songs, and that as a result there is something essentially nonessential about this record, who cares? You don't have THESE versions and they are pretty great, too, and part of that greatness is the relaxed feel here.These are old guys who have been around pretty much every block there is to go around and they swing here with confidence and comfortable swagger. Johnson may still stutter-stammer his way around the stage and, for all I know, Daltry may still swing the mic around in big circles, but all youthful bluster, bravado and general frantic is gone. Now, those things fueled some damn great music in their day, that day is past for these guys. Nothing to prove, they do what they do, and love doing, with skill and passion. I'm happy to get out of their way, sit back, and have a wonderful time listening to them be who they are now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKJ55EDNTJW87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZX0IM0#wasThisHelpful","RKJ55EDNTJW87","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those of us of a certain age, this movie brings back a lot of memories. But there is more to it.This is the story of Terri Hooley and his Good Vibrations record shop in Belfast, which became the home of Northern Ireland's punk scene in the late 1970's, as well as the first record label for many of its bands. While, being a Yank and having  never set foot in Ireland, North or Republic (as yet, still hoping), I remember the bands and the music.Of course, if it were only for the nostalgia, then the CBGB's movie might have been good. Thankfully, what we have here is a wonderful story with engaging (and often maddening) characters, marvelous performances and direction and editing that capture the anarchic sense of both fun and danger that great rock n roll can inspire. Set down plop in the middle of the Troubles, fun and danger are both constant presences here, along with a look at the way that music can build bridges in the damnedest of places.I don't know enough of the actual, historical particulars to know how faithful this story is to real life, but then again, I don't care. The movie works as a movie and I suspect that the veracity is pretty close. I was also pleased with the way the filmmakers refused to tack on, or weave in, a happy ending, letting the climax be bittersweet the way life usually is. Hooley is presented warts and all, and if the character behaves badly in some (important) parts of his life, in others he shows a quiet nobility.The soundtrack is terrific and primarily features the bands the movie portrays (Rudi, the Outcasts, the magnificent Undertones' magnificent Teenage Kicks - still one of the greatest singles in r n r history).You don't have to have been there, nor do you have to be the right age, to find this a wonderfully moving, witty and in many ways joyous film.

"By now, if you are a reader of mainstream sports books, you probably have an opinion on John Feinstein. Mine is positive. I like his books, those I have read.And here is no different - Feinstein is a pro - he knows how to pace a book. He knows how to weave a number of stories together to create a big, nuanced picture. And he does so here, following a dozen or so ballplayers, managers and even an umpire through a year of AAA baseball, for the uninitiated, one step below the major leagues. But here is where the title really misleads.it is hard to imagine that there is much of an uninitiated audience for a book on AAA baseball and, as a result, most everybody reading this is likely to know most, if not nearly ALL of these names. The reason is that Feinstein isn't really looking at life in the minor leagues, plural, he is focused on AAA. And not only that, his focus is even more narrow - he is looking at players who are, for various reasons, caught in the revolving doors between the majors and minors. Anyone beyond the very casual fan certainly know the names of Scott Podsednick, Nate McClouth, Brett Tomko, Scott Elarton, Sam Fuld, and Brooks Conrad. They likely also know the names of Dan Johnson, Zach Duke, et al, that also play parts here. Sure, there are some names that would require a bit more specialized knowledge, but, really now. These guys would pretty much have to leave the world of baseball entirely to find a place where nobody knows their names. Don't know if the issue lies with Feinstein or Doubleday, but...Of course, the name doesn't really determine the quality and that is first rate. Feinstein has a terrific topic - what it is like to ping-pong between the Show and the not-so-show. The players here find themselves in AAA for various reasons: getting a little too old, having been injured a little too often, being not quite consistent enough, finding themselves one step lower on the totem pole than the newest phenom, the newest high-priced free agent, so on and so forth. For whatever reason, these men find themselves chasing their chance, or their next chance, or their last chance. Feinstein gives them plenty of room to breathe and tell their own stories and they are a sharp, fairly articulate lot. And they are representative of lots of other guys who are out there working their behinds off while being not quite young / healthy / consistent / good enough to make, or stay, in the major leagues.He follows his sources throughout the 2012 season as they come, go, come back again. A number of players make it up, for at least a little while, but nearly always end up sent back down. Only a couple stick and find themselves playing ball in September, and beyond. In the Epilogue, he gives updates on the players entering Spring Training 2013.And that is the reason for four, rather than five stars. Again, whether due to Feinstein or Doubleday, this books is coming out as Spring Training 2014 is coming to a close. Couldn't we have an epilogue that catches us up with them at the END of the 2013 season rather than the beginning? I can Google them, check Baseball Reference, etc., but it would be nice to know where they ended up in the follow ups, not just where they started. This may seem (and BE) a small point for most readers, and it doesn't really change the feel or thrust of the book - it IS a very good, interesting read and you cannot help but pull for these men as they continue to pursue their dreams to the end. But it would be nice to know how much closer they came in the last year.Certainly recommended. But with this one reservation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DF6EOKQDHHTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385535937#wasThisHelpful","R1DF6EOKQDHHTW","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is good news for Farley's financial outlook, but kind of sad for the rest of us.

"Actually, that may sound like damning with faint praise, depending upon your view, but this is the first volume in a very strong Bruce Jones - authored story arc that smartly puts more focus on Banner and less on Hulk SMASH.I'm going to say my bit here, since this is the start, and not go into reviewing each volume individually. The story line throughout the series does meander a bit, and a couple of the volumes (esp. Vol. 5) are more or less self-contained and only tangentially connected to the overall story, but in all cases, this arc is interesting and entertaining as Banner flees from competing shadowy and powerful (and clearly darned-well funded) organizations that may or may not have government sanction. It gets pretty silly if you think too awfully hard about it, but is a great deal of fun while you're immersed. A number of old Hulk foes show up here and there throughout and there are shifting alliances as we go along.But despite the occasional ""wait a minute, what?"" moment, this is a terrific arc and explores Banner's life on the run in greater detail than is normally the case.It looks like all of these are out of print now, which is a shame, but for now they all seem to be available from various marketplace vendors, in some cases pretty cheaply. If you are a Hulk / Banner fan, this might just be right up your alley. And the truth is out there, probably, somewhere...","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19UH53Z628BSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785109439#wasThisHelpful","R19UH53Z628BSZ","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I think I would change the subtitle, there is not much else I would want to be different about this gripping and fascinating look at the enigma that is Pete Rose. Not so much a biography, but rather more of an extended biographical essay, Kennedy's book takes a long look at the many things Pete Rose is and the many things that shaped him, in his life and in ours.Live most any baseball fan of my age (early 50s), Pete Rose has always been a major figure around the game. Growing up in Indianapolis, it was impossible not to be faced with him everyday during the season, and many during the off season. The Indianapolis Indians were the Reds' Triple A affiliate for most of the 1960s and 1970s, an being only a couple hours drive from Cincy, Indianapolis was big time Big Red country. Consequently, I hated the Reds, though I loved being taken to games at Crosely  Field, and later Riverfront. And during those years, no matter how great anybody else on the team was - and they had some great players - the Reds WERE Pete Rose. And so I hated Pete Rose, though I also kinda loved him. Even early on, I could tell that Rose was the kind of guy you hated unless he was on your team, then you adored him.And here, in this book, that plays itself out in large. There is much in Pete Rose to adore. There is much in Pete Rose to abhor. And that is the enigma. The only dilemma I can see, really is being torn over whether or not he belongs back in baseball and eligible for the Hall of Fame. And I confess, I am torn there. But in a sense, that is only a small part of both Rose and this book. This is a fascinating portrait of the man: gregarious and secretive; painfully honest and a proven bald-faced liar; a loyal, true-blue best buddy and a man who ignores his siblings and some of his children.This is a well-written, well-researched and very enjoyable read. I have not previously read any of Kennedy's other books, but I likely will now.I will go so far as to the clich that you don't have to be a baseball fan to find this book gripping and the man fascinating and infuriating. Of course, I AM a baseball fan and so Pete Rose and the one dilemma and the larger enigma do mean something to me that they probably don't to most people.

"I enjoyed this a great deal. It is a lovely and evocative novel of love, commitment, obsession, divided loyalty, dreams, the lure of the river and mermaids. It is moving and wistful and really quite beautiful.As with the best graphic novels, it is impossible to separate the art and the, um, words. Here the two blend seamlessly to create a moody and somber work of mystery and revelation. It is a fantasy, to be sure, but very much an work of adult emotion. Many of the reviews here provide a thumbnail of the plot and setting and so I see no need to rehash. Quite simply: this is a terrific novel and a work of art worth exploring. A journey worth taking one's time on, like a steamboat on the river.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DC49NHAX85W8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596439262#wasThisHelpful","R1DC49NHAX85W8","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the interest of full disclosures, I attended my first Pacers' game in 1969 and I followed last night's horrible Pacers loss online. So yeah, I'm a Pacers fan.Further, my mother worked for Bob and Nancy Leonard for a few years in the late 1970s and early '80s. I met Bob on a couple of occasions.So along with those, one last caveat: This book would have to be awful for me not to like it. And if that were the case, I simply wouldn't post about it. But here I am.I am partisan, but Boom Baby is a lot of fun. It is curiously formatted, with co-author Lew Freedman introducing each chapter with a thumbnail and then Bob reminiscing about the same time period in what seem to be more - or - less is own words. One does get the sense that his-own words have been cleaned up a bit for grammatical purposes and edited to make it a bit more family-friendly (hard to imagine that there weren't some tray expletives littered here and there in the original transcripts), but the voice is clearly Bob Leonard and if you have listened to more than a couple of Pacers' broadcasts over the years you can pretty much hear him saying it.And what you hear him saying is an informal story of his life and, for the past 50 years, the story of the Indiana Pacers.Of course, Slick did some living before he came to Indianapolis, and you'll hear about all of that, too. His childhood, his glory years playing ball at IU and then his all-too brief professional career (derailed by injuries). And all that is great.The meat of the book, though, is his life and career(s) with the Pacers. This is not a detailed history, of course, that we are still waiting on, but this will satisfy most Pacer fans with stories of the great ABA teams and the struggles of the early NBA teams. And Bob would know about both, better than anybody else.But as much as anything, this is a couple hundred pages in the company of an interesting, good-natured and pretty humble man who just happens to also be a basketball Hall of Famer - finally, at long last. And well deserved.I won't go so far as to suggest that this is the amiable memoir of a great national treasure, but he at the least a great REGIONAL treasure. If you are interested enough to be reading reviews of this book, then you will certainly enjoy the book itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYLOQ1TXDCDG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600788599#wasThisHelpful","RYLOQ1TXDCDG0","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Frankly, this may be more Superman - The Movie than most of us really need, considering the price and all the fun extra stuff that comes on these four discs, this is likely the one you'll want to go for.Picked this up recently and wanted to show my daughters (6 and 8), so I watched it again solo to make sure I wasn't forgetting something that was inappropriate for said ages. There isn't. And they both loved it when I showed it to them.And so did I. It had been a long time and I had forgotten just how good this movie is. Some of the effects are a little dated (though not nearly as much as you'd think going in) and the odd wardrobe decision is now brow-raising, but the story, the acting and the sheer fun and enthusiasm are first rate. In fact, I recommend this very much to those who get a little bogged down by the current need for heroes to be anguished and tortured souls. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but, damn, its fun to see a superhero revel in being one.The story, cast and direction are first rate. This is a classic and this set is a good way to revel in it yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IXUPUANV9U0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IJ79UW#wasThisHelpful","R3IXUPUANV9U0U","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, like most of the superhero storybooks aimed at young kids and primary readers, the prose here is pretty leaden and, um, inelegant. Kinda dry.However, it is still useful, and I give it the four stars, because it is a decent primer of Marvel hero origin stories. One of the hindrances to those entering, or wanting to enter, comic fandom is the bewildering world of up to 60 plus years of backstory so many characters carry around with them. While some kids can and will jump right in and start swimming, others reasonably want to know, ""Well, why does he...?"", or ""How come they...?"", or How did she...?"" For most of the major Marvel characters, this book gives you/them a quick story to explain why Bruce Banner gets big and mean and why Thor cares about us mere mortals when he could be relaxing on Asgard being fed grapes (or their equivalent).The art is nothing special, call it adequate. But if you have, or are, a young 'un looking to jump into the world of tights, capes and conflicted, if noble, ideals, this isn't a bad place to get the lay of the land.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ET65VWBU47H7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142317223X#wasThisHelpful","R1ET65VWBU47H7","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Today the people of North Korea are among the most desperately poor, hungry, and economically deprived on Earth.""""The story continues. Economic collapse remain, famine haunts the land, and missiles still get lobbed into the Sea of Japan.""Despite the occasional red-flagged story and ""can-you-believe-these-Kims"" internet meme, many, if not most of us, here in the US are pretty ignorant of the reality of North Korea. This is in part because almost nobody really has a good view of what goes on there (including those who are IN there). It is also because, sad, crazy and bewildering as it looks when we DO look, as a whole, we don't look often. This new volume gives us a chance to look a little more closely and thoughtfully, should we decide to.Caveats first:Minor: I read this in proofs, but even for a galley, there are an awful lot of typos and related issues. I will assume these will get fixed for the trade edition.Less minor: There is a great deal of repetition here that bogged down my reading.This is exacerbated by the overall construction of the book, with the author addressing topics individually through time, then circling back in time to address the next topic. While this does not hinder the individual chapters and subchapters within his topics, it does make it difficult to keep the timelines straight when reflecting from topic (say, economic developments) to topic (say, military developments). This has the effect of making the book seem evening more repetitious than it might otherwise be.Those aside, this is a strong, big-picture look at North Korea from Kim I's rise through the present day - or at least a close to it as we are likely to get considering the subject. While other recent books have looked at personal-level portraits of the DPRK and how individuals, mostly refugees and defectors, have presented their stories, this volume looks at the nation's place in the world, how it got here and where it may go. None of it is pretty.It is, in fact, both breathtaking and heartbreaking to see, even if the view is necessarily occluded, how a people can be so relentlessly abused by those who publically bellow about how they are creating a paradise. It's hard to gauge whether or not anyone at all actually believes it.But at some point, North Korea must be reckoned with. That it has not yet become a disaster outside its borders is hard to fathom, but what can be done to keep it from becoming one (at seemingly any moment) is even harder to imagine. That said, despite a few flaws, as above, French gives us a good place to jump in and see where things seem to stand. And from there we can begin to think about what the outside world may be able to do going forward. To do nothing is increasingly not an option.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJF7Y2N2W37XS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780329482#wasThisHelpful","RJF7Y2N2W37XS","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here in Chicago this book has taken quite a beating over the years since its publication. How dare anyone question the divinity that was / is Walter Payton? I can only imagine the hostility that will greet the first in-depth biography of Mike Ditka...And Payton really was something of a deity on the field - no denying. As football heroes go, he was about as football-heroish as you can get around here (or much of anyplace else, I suppose). A lot of fans reverently mumble a ""hallowed be thy name"" and that's that. But that also does a disservice, in many ways, to the real man who lived inside that hero. And Payton was a real man.To present the man in his complexity, with his not-always admirable behavior, is a service to life in general. One doesn't want to make too much of a person who's claim to fame is the ability to play a sport very, very well, but if you DO want to look at a man or woman who excelled at such things, then really look at them. And this book does.The Payton who emerges here is no less remarkable as an athlete, and his shortcomings and foibles do not render him any less admirable in his strengths and positives. This is an absorbing read about an interesting, flawed man. For those interested in his life and career, it provides three dimensions, not just the two you saw on the field. And part of that third dimension was pretty admirable, too; just not all of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CPNA5TFMM0SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592407374#wasThisHelpful","R2CPNA5TFMM0SE","AKJ87ZCIKUASO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ87ZCIKUASO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The sound on these is very good and they cancel out noise well. My husband can hear his music above the sound of the lawnmower. However, they are uncomfortable for him. They dig into the ear canal. Also, in case it matters to you, they can't be worn while lying down because the back presses against the pillow (or whatever you're laying on) and pop the earbuds out of your ear.

"My two daughters (13, 10) have been playing with this every day for a week. They're having a lot of fun with it. The kit is very basic but it's a good starter kit. There's an instruction booklet, quite a bit of glycerin soap, measuring spoons (cheap plastic), molds (cheap plastic), and some cute gift boxes for gifting the soaps.I was pleased with the amount of soap offered and the recipes and instructions. I also like the quality of the soap my kids have made for me. Many of the molds, however, are too small. I think we'll be visiting a hobby shop soon for better molds, or finding something around the house that works better. Any ingredients you need will be found at a hobby shop, so it's easy to replenish supplies.The advantage of buying this set is that it's an inexpensive way to see if your child enjoys soap-making. Then you can move on to something more elaborate. My daughter and I have signed up for a local soap making class.This would also make a great gift for a child who hasn't yet tried soap making.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36NJ4R920KW4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGM5O3I#wasThisHelpful","R36NJ4R920KW4V","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The sleeping bag is quite comfy and large enough to fit a 6' tall person with a few inches to spare. It is very warm, despite being relatively light.

"So far we love this machine. It's a large heavy nearly commercial quality espresso maker. It took several trials to get things right, but the manual is very helpful and gives detailed instructions and tips. For example, explaining exactly the amount of pressure to use to tamp down the coffee grounds so that the water flows through them evenly. It explains the necessity for this and many more specific behaviors. There are a lot of factors that go into a good cup of espresso or cappuccino and it takes some time to learn how to get it right.The machine is loud. It sort of sounds like a Nazgul screaming, or Dementors sucking out someone's soul, but that's fine. I now associate that sound with the imminent arrival of a delicious cappuccino rather than my imminent death.It's a little difficult to wash some of the parts because the steam milk splatters. Just be sure to wipe it up right away before it dries up.My family of five has been drinking lattes and cappuccinos, and making them for friends, daily since we got this. If we have any trouble with the machine, I'll update this post. If it's been a while, feel free to leave a comment if you're wondering whether it's still working. I'll reply. I know that the reliability has been an issue with this machine, according to other reviewers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13IYH3GFZ5CFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBW6UKU#wasThisHelpful","R13IYH3GFZ5CFJ","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This FlexBrew system has lots of nice features that are missing from my previous K-cup maker (which was much more expensive). First of all, it can do both K-cups and ground coffee, which I LOVE. It's a lot cheaper to use ground coffee than the K-cups, and I already have the coffee beans, which means I don't have to buy something special for this machine.Another feature is that it makes a larger cup of coffee (more oz) than my expensive Keurig brewer. THat one didn't even fill up a normal sized coffee mug when it was on the highest setting. I hated that.I love that this one has a removable platform so that I can put my tall travel mug there. Awesome.The reservoir is nice and large.Here are a couple more differences to note:The Keurig is ready to make a cup at any time, unless the water is low. It keeps a constantly hot reservoir so that a cup can be made immediately as long as the machine is kept on. This machine has no such option (or at least it doesn't make it clear if it does). It takes a few minutes for it to heat up, but you can walk away as long as your cup can fit all of the liquid.- On that note, this machine's options are significantly less clear than the Keurig's. It's harder to operate and clearly not as well thought out as the Keurig's interaction. I had trouble getting the programmed oz settings to work as expected (multiple cups nearly overflowed) and I think it's due to fact that each setting can be programmed. I haven't been able to find a way to reset the programming on it, either.That being said, the Keurig 2.0 has no way to use ground coffee so I've replaced it with this machine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S55JVYUGRP3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3MCL6G#wasThisHelpful","R3S55JVYUGRP3U","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this so far. I'm using it to scare off raccoons from our back porch. We feed a stray cat on the porch and every night the raccoons arrive and eat all the food and sometimes even carry the bowls away. They make a huge mess on the porch. So, I put this motion-detecting light out there, right next to the food. haha. Now, when the raccoons arrive, the light turns on and off they run. hahahaha!So, yeah, it freaked the cat out at first, too, but after only a day she adjusted and will come eat the food even though the light is on. Good kitty. Raccoons still stay away. Good raccoons.The LED light takes 4 D cell batteries and doesn't require wires. I just set it right next to the food, but you can mount it to a wall or wherever. It swivels and adjusts so you can aim the light wherever you want. It's hard enough to adjust that it stays where you want it. It's not going to swivel away from where you aim it.Also, the light doesn't come on during the day because it's photosensitive.It's fairly bright, but it isn't going to light up 20 people at your midnight barbecue by itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KMJTF4DDHLO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTE4X5C#wasThisHelpful","R2KMJTF4DDHLO7","A4SD8F79JBYG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4SD8F79JBYG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far I love this steam mop. It was very easy to assemble (my 13 year old daughter did it). Once you put the water in and turn it on, it heats up extremely fast and is easy to use. It does a large room without needing to be refilled. There's a brush on the back for scrubbing, if needed. It comes with two washable pads so that you can change the pad out after it gets dirty. My tile floor was clean after using the mop.Attachments allow you to scrub grout or non-floor items.Only negative so far: If you turn the mop off and back on, it is ready to go immediately, but if you unplug the mop and plug it in again somewhere else, it requires a few moments to be ready again.Added bonus: my cat loves the long box that the mop comes in. She thinks it's a great hiding place.I have had several of these types of mops that broke after a while.

"I just love the idea of being able to stand up these cooking utensils because I hate laying utensils on the counter and I don't want to use a spoon rest because that's something else that has to be washed and take up counter space. I love these utensils for that reason. I also like that they're solid, sturdy, heavy, and great quality. My only complaint is that the stand makes them a little awkward for the drawer I keep them in. They take up twice as much space as a utensil normally would. I guess you can't have everything, though. It's ironic that the very thing I love about these is also the thing I hate.

"My family has played SET for years -- it's a great game that's easy to learn, fun to play, and versatile. My favorite aspect of the game is that we have a large range of ages in the family and everyone can easily learn and understand the game and find it challenging. Usually a game that's challenging enough for an adult will be too hard for the youngest child (and vice versa). But SET works for everyone.We've played the card game for years. This dice game is a nice twist. I love that the diced are solid and indestructible. Also, it's harder to lose the pieces than with a card game. There are also a couple of new games based off the original that work better with dice than they would with cards (because of the shape). You could make up new games, too. I also appreciate that the box is as small as it can be. So many games are in boxes that don't need to be so big.
